Otterton Water Mill is set beside the River Otter in Devon. A watermill was recorded in this locality in Domesday Book in 1086. The mill possessed three pairs of stones. The manor and its mill were given by King Henry V to the nuns of Syon Abbey. At the Dissolution the manor was sold to Richard Duke, in whose family's possession the mill remained for 200 years. Sold again in 1785 to Denys Rolle, the estate and the mill subsequently passed through marriage to the Clinton family, who still own the mill as part of the Clinton Devon Estates. Milling stopped in 1959 and the buildings were subsequently used for grain storage. The watermill was restored in 1977 by Desna Greenhow, and still works today. Beside the mill is a bakery, a shop, a restaurant and a gallery of art and crafts.

The Swiss Mennonites are the oldest and were possibly the most influential body of Anabaptists at some time. The earliest recorded Anabaptist movement during Reformation times originated in the village of Zollikon near Z√ºrich in 1525. Conrad Grebel (ca. 1496‚Äì1526) and Felix Manz (ca. 1496‚Äì1527), followers of Huldrych Zwingli, divided from Zwingli on the issue of infant baptism versus believers baptism. They organized in the home of Manz on January 21, 1525. Though Grebel and Manz were dead within two years‚ÄîGrebel of the plague and Manz drowned by the Council of Z√ºrich‚Äîthe believers' baptism movement quickly spread through German-speaking Switzerland. On the day of Manz' execution another leader, George Blaurock, was beaten and expelled from the city. From there, he travelled to Bern and eventually left Switzerland, never to return. Bern became the center for Anabaptism in Switzerland. The movement spread, both by evangelistic zeal and persecution, from Switzerland into Germany, Moravia, Poland, Russia, the Netherlands, and eventually to North and South America. Around 1671, because of persecution by the government and the state church, a large group of Anabaptists (Mennonites) left Switzerland for the Palatinate in Germany. For many Mennonites, persecution helped institutionalize separation, non-conformity and farming as a way of life. The Amish schism of the Mennonites originated with Jacob Amman in Switzerland. Many Amish Mennonites in America can be traced to the areas of Thun and Schwarzenburg in Canton Bern. Records of the conferences of the Swiss Mennonites have been consistently recorded since 1889, but various records indicate that an annual conference was an \\"old custom\\" in the 18th century. In 1898 a constitution and the name Conference of the Mennonites in Switzerland was adopted. The Swiss Mennonite Conference is a member of the Federation of Free Churches in Switzerland and the Mennonite World Conference. In 2003 the conference had 2500 members in 14 congregations.2003 Mennonite & Brethren in Christ World Membership . The congregations range in size from 40 to 500. Each church is autonomous and there is much diversity within the conference. A congregation formed in 1991 is the most recent addition to the body. Though the Swiss conference is currently a relatively small body, the Swiss Mennonites have contributed greatly to the spread of Anabaptism across the world.

It was one of the first computers to be (nearly) entirely solid-state, using 700 transistors, and 3000 magnetic amplifiers (FERRACTOR) for primary logic, and 20 vacuum tubes largely for power control. It came in two versions, the Solid State 80 (IBM-style 80 column cards) and the Solid State 90 (Remington-Rand 90 column cards). In addition to the \\"80/90\\" designation, there were two variants of the Solid State the SS I 80/90 and the SS II 80/90. The SS II series included two enhancements the addition of 1,280 words of core memory and support for magnetic tape drives. The SS I had only the standard 5,000-word drum memory described in this article and no tape drives. Both variants included a card reader, a card punch, and the line printer described in this article. The only \\"console\\" was a 10-key adding machine-type keypad, from which the operator would enter the commands to boot the computer. That keypad was also used by programmers in the debugging process. There was no Operating System as we have come to know them in recent years; every program was completely self-contained, including the boot loader that initiated execution. All programs were loaded from punched cards; even on the SS II, with its tape drives, there was no ability to launch programs from those drives. The SS II, including two tape drives, weighed about . Architecture The UNIVAC Solid State was a 2-address, bi-quinary coded decimal computer using signed 10-digit words. Main memory storage was provided by a 5000-word magnetic drum spinning at 17,667 RPM in a helium atmosphere. For efficiency, programmers had to take into account drum latency, the time required for a specific data item, once written, to rotate to where it could be read. Technology The Solid State was one of the first computers to use some solid-state components. However, much of the computer's logic was made out of magnetic amplifiers, not transistors. The decision to use magnetic amplifiers was made because the point-contact germanium transistors then available had highly variable characteristics and were not sufficiently reliable. The magnetic amplifiers were based on tiny (about 1/8\\" ID) toroidal stainless steel spools wound with two or so layers of 1/32\\" wide 4-79 moly-permalloy magnetic material to form magnetic cores. These cores had two windings of #60 copper wire surrounding the 4-79 molypermalloy. The magnetic amplifiers required clock pulses of heavy current that could not be produced by the transistors of the day. The system used a clock derived from a timing band recorded on the main storage drum. This signal was read and amplified, processed and sent to the driver tubes, a pair of 6146 power pentode output tubes. The output from these tubes then fed the main clock power amplifier consisting of six 4CX250B metal/ceramic power tetrode tubes running in push-pull/parallel, yielding an output of a kilowatt. The powerful high-voltage signal was stepped down to a 36-volt, high-current clock by oil-filled transformers that were distributed about the machine. The SS80/90 computer could be heard quite clearly in the AM broadcast band at 707 kHz and 1414 kHz. The 4CX250B tetrodes used a grounded plate (anode) due to forced aircooling requirements. This tube is still in demand by amateur radio operators. The clock tube was enclosed in a shielding box that constrained both radio emissions and viewing by eyes of other than Univac's field engineers. The power supply output was -1.6 kV for cathode supply and -800 V screen grid supply at 1.8 A capacity. The supply weighed nearly 100 pounds and was mounted at the very top of the power supply stack. Thus the SS 80/90, for the heart of its operation, depended on the very technology it claimed to replace, a marketing tactic. Applications The computer was a follow on to a computer built for the USAF and delivered to Lawrence G. Hanscom Field, near Cambridge, MA in 1957. It was manufactured in two versions: the Solid State 80 (IBM-Hollerith 80 column cards) and the Solid State 90 (Remington-Rand 90 column cards). This machine was designated the Solid State 80-90 and sold mostly in Europe. The SS80/90 was aimed at the general purpose business market. UNIVAC SS80/90s were installed at DC Transit, SBA, CWA, in Washington DC during the early sixties. Peripherals The line printer ran at 600 lines per minute, using a continuously rotating print drum technology, with letters, figures and punctuation marks distributed around the drum at each column. 132 solenoid-operated flat-faced print hammers comprised a print line, with ten characters to the inch. When a desired character arrived at the printing position, as indicated by timing marks on the end of the drum, a thyratron would fire and energize a print column solenoid, propelling its hammer to the back face of the printing paper. The paper would be bounced against a wide inked ribbon and against the drum, printing the desired character. The hammer would then rebound with a spring to await the next thyratron firing and the process would repeat on the next line down the sheet. Drum printers, when not adjusted properly, or due to component wear would mis-register the character vertically. The card punch had a maximum rate of 150 cards per minute. Timing was quite critical throughout the operation of the card punch, the card reader and the printer, all being based on electromechanical principles. The basic card punch mechanism was manufactured by Bull, a French company which owned patents on 80 column punch card machines. The machine came in two versions, the P147 and the P67, the main difference being electromagnetic clutch or a solenoid operated mechanical \\"dog\\" clutch to initiate a punch cycle. Since many gears, electrical contact cams were affixed to the main shaft with taper pins, the P 67 with its severe stopping dog clutch would cause timing loss more frequently than the P 147. Most emergency maintenance time was spent replacing worn and damaged taper pins and retiming the machine. The card punch had a preread station, a punch station and a checkread station. The machine could be quite difficult to maintain and required much skill to troubleshoot and maintain. The machine cycle was oddly divided into 420 \\"points\\" or \\"Bull degrees\\". While the Bull punch was used with the UNIVAC Solid State 80 for 80 column cards the UNIVAC Solid State 90 used the Univac manufactured \\"Tower Punch\\" for 90 column cards. The Tower Punch operating at 150 cards per minute used mechanical pin sensing in the pre punch read and the post punch read stations giving the ability to read a card, punch additional information into the card, and check read the results in the post punch station.

Scott Russell & Co. at Millwall Iron Works on the River Thames, London. She was by far the largest ship ever built at the time of her 1858 launch, and had the capacity to carry 4,000 passengers from England to Australia without refuelling. Her length of was only surpassed in 1899 by the 17,274-gross-ton RMS Oceanic, her gross tonnage of 18,915 was only surpassed in 1901 by the 21,035-gross-ton RMS Celtic, and her 4,000-passenger capacity was surpassed in 1913 by the 4,935-passenger SS Imperator. The ship's five funnels were rare and were later reduced to four. It also had the largest set of paddle wheels. Brunel knew her affectionately as the \\"Great Babe\\". He died in 1859 shortly after her maiden voyage, during which she was damaged by an explosion. After repairs, she plied for several years as a passenger liner between Britain and North America before being converted to a cable-laying ship and laying the first lasting transatlantic telegraph cable in 1866. Finishing her life as a floating music hall and advertising hoarding (for the department store Lewis's) in Liverpool, she was broken up on Merseyside in 1889. History=Concept The famous Robert Howlett photo of Isambard Kingdom Brunel against the launching chains of Great Eastern at Millwall in 1857. After his success in pioneering steam travel to North America with Great Western and Great Britain, Brunel turned his attention to longer voyages as far as Australia and realised the potential of a ship that could travel round the world without the need of refuelling. On 25 March 1852, Brunel made a sketch of a steamship in his diary and wrote beneath it: \\"Say 600 ft x 65 ft x 30 ft\\" (180 m x 20 m x 9.1 m). These measurements were six times larger by volume than any ship afloat; such a large vessel would benefit from economies of scale and would be both fast and economical, requiring fewer crew than the equivalent tonnage made up of smaller ships. Brunel realised that the ship would need more than one propulsion system; since twin screws were still very much experimental, he settled on a combination of a single screw and paddle wheels, with auxiliary sail power. Although Brunel had pioneered the screw propeller on a large scale with the Great Britain, he did not believe that it was possible to build a single propeller and shaft (or, for that matter, a paddleshaft) that could transmit the required horsepower to drive his giant ship at the required speed. Brunel showed his idea to John Scott Russell, an experienced naval architect and ship builder whom he had first met at the Great Exhibition. Scott Russell examined Brunel's plan and made his own calculations as to the ship's feasibility. He calculated that it would have a displacement of 20,000 tons and would require to achieve , but believed it was possible. At Scott Russell's suggestion, they approached the directors of the Eastern Steam Navigation Company. Eastern Steam Navigation Company The Eastern Company was formed in January 1851 with the plan of exploiting the increase in trade and emigration to India, China and Australia. To make this plan viable they needed a subsidy in the form of a mail contract from the British General Post Office, which they tendered for and Brunel started the construction of two vessels, Victoria and Adelaide. However, in March 1852 the Government awarded the contracts to the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, even though the Eastern Company's tender was lower. This left them in the position of having a company without a purpose. Brunel's large ship promised to be able to compete with the fast clippers that currently dominated the route, as she would be able to carry sufficient coal for a non-stop passage and the company invited him to present his ideas to the board. He was unable to attend due to illness and Scott Russell took his place. The Company then set up a committee to investigate the proposal, and they reported in favour and the scheme was adopted at a board meeting held in July 1852. Brunel was appointed Engineer to the project and he began to gather tenders to build the hull, paddle engines and screw engines. Brunel had a considerable stake in the company and when requested to appoint a resident engineer refused in no uncertain terms: He was just as firm in the terms for the final contract where he insisted that nothing was to be undertaken without his express consent, and that procedures and requirements for the construction were specifically laid down. 1854‚Äì1859: Construction to maiden voyageConstruction= Sectional plan of Great Eastern Construction of Great Eastern, August 18, 1855 Although Brunel had estimated the cost of building the ship at ¬£500,000, Scott Russell offered a very low tender of ¬£377,200: ¬£275,200 for the hull, ¬£60,000 for the screw engines and boilers, and ¬£42,000 for the paddle engines and boilers. Scott Russell even offered to reduce the tender to ¬£258,000 if an order for a sister ship was placed at the same time. Brunel accepted Scott Russell's tender in May 1853, without questioning it; Scott Russell was a highly skilled shipbuilder and Brunel would accept an estimate from such an esteemed colleague without question.Gillings, p. 128 In early 1854 work could at last begin. The first problem to arise was where the ship was to be built. Scott Russell's contract stipulated that it was to be built in a dock, but Russell quoted a price of ¬£8,000‚Äì¬£10,000 to build the necessary dock and so this part of the scheme was abandoned, partly due to the cost and also to the difficulty of finding a suitable site for the dock. The idea of a normal stern first launch was also rejected because of the great length of the vessel, also because to provide the right launch angle the bow of the ship would have to be raised in the air. Eventually it was decided to build the ship sideways to the river and use a mechanical slip designed by Brunel for the launch. Later the mechanical design was dropped on the grounds of cost, although the sideways plan remained. Having decided on a sideways launch, a suitable site had to be found, as Scott Russell's Millwall, London, yard was too small. The adjacent yard belonging to David Napier was empty, available and suitable, so it was leased and a railway line constructed between the two yards for moving materials. The site of the launch is still visible on the Isle of Dogs. Part of the slipway has been preserved on the waterfront, while at low tide, more of the slipway can be seen on the Thames foreshore. The remains of the slipways, and other structures associated with the launch of the SS Great Eastern, have recently been surveyed by the Thames Discovery Programme, a community project recording the archaeology of the Thames intertidal zone in London. Great Easterns keel was laid down on 1 May 1854. The hull was an all-iron construction, a double hull of wrought iron in plates with ribs every . Internally, the hull was divided by two long, high, longitudinal bulkheads and further transverse bulkheads dividing the ship into nineteen compartments. Great Eastern was the first ship to incorporate the double-skinned hull, a feature which would not be seen again in a ship for several decades, but which is now compulsory for reasons of safety. She had sail, paddle and screw propulsion. The paddle-wheels were in diameter and the four-bladed screw-propeller was across. The power came from four steam engines for the paddles and an additional engine for the propeller. Total power was estimated at 6 MW (8,000 hp). The specific requirements of the Eastern Company also vindicated Brunel's initial concept of using both paddlewheels and a screw. The Great Britain had a chain drive 'overdrive' gear so that the slow- turning marine steam engines of the day could drive a screw propeller of a suitably small diameter while making the required thrust. This had proven troublesome and in his new ship Brunel resolved to use direct drive, requiring the much larger propeller. To be effective this had to be fully submerged at all times, fixing the ship's minimum practical draught while using screw propulsion at around . Brunel designed the Great Eastern to have a maximum draught of . The Company required that the ship be able to dock at Calcutta, where navigation was restricted by the shallow Hooghly River which required a draught of no more than . Brunel calculated that the ship would be able to carry enough coal to steam from Calcutta to a British port while not exceeding that draught, while if the ship took on coal for the final leg of her homeward voyage at Trincomalee instead she would be able to transit the Hooghly with a full load of passengers and cargo while drawing . This would leave around half of the top-most blade of the screw clear of the water, greatly reducing the thrust it developed and the efficiency of the engines. Thus when operating at lighter loads and shallow draughts, the Great Eastern would require paddlewheels. After consultation with Joshua Field, Brunel set the power of the two sets of engines so that the Great Eastern's paddlewheels provided about a third of the total mechanical propulsion, with the screw propeller providing the majority. She also had six masts (said to be named after the days of a week ‚Äì Monday being the fore mast and Saturday the spanker mast), providing space for of sails (7 gaff and max. 9 (usually 4) square sails), rigged similar to a topsail schooner with a main gaff sail (fore-and-aft sail) on each mast, one \\"jib\\" on the fore mast and three square sails on masts no. 2 and no. 3 (Tuesday & Wednesday); for a time mast no. 4 was also fitted with three yards. In later years, some of the yards were removed. Her maximum speed was 24 km/h (13 knots). Scott Russell bankruptcy At the beginning of February 1856, Brunel advised the Eastern Company that they should take possession of the ship to avoid it being seized by Scott Russell's creditors. This caused Scott Russell's bankers to refuse to honour his cheques and foreclose on his assets and on 4 February Scott Russell suspended all payments to his creditors and dismissed all his workmen a week later. Russell's creditors met on 12 February and it was revealed that Russell had liabilities of ¬£122,940 and assets of ¬£100,353. It was decided that his existing contracts would be allowed to be completed and the business would be liquidated. He issued a statement to the Board of the Eastern Company in which he repudiated his contract and effectively handed the uncompleted ship back to them. When the situation was reviewed it was found that three-quarters of the work on the hull had not been completed and that there was a deficit of 1,200 tons between the amount of iron supplied and that used on the ship. Brunel, meanwhile, wrote to John Yates and instructed him to negotiate with Scott Russell for the lease of his yard and equipment. Yates replied that Scott Russell had mortgaged the yard to his banker and that any negotiation would have to be with the bank, who after weeks of wrangling agreed to lease the yard and equipment until 12 August 1857. The Eastern Company began the task of completing the ship. Work recommenced in May and took longer than expected to complete. Brunel reported in June 1857 that once the screw, screw shaft and sternpost had been installed the ship would be ready for launching. However, the launch ways and cradles would not be ready in time since the contract for their construction had only been placed in January 1857. Under pressure from all sides, the lease of the shipyard costing ¬£1,000 a month, and against his better judgement, Brunel agreed to launch the ship on 3 November 1857 to catch the high tide. Launch Great Eastern before launch in 1858 Hand-coloured lithograph of the SS Great Eastern, the great ship of IK Brunel as imagined by the artist at her launch in 1858 Brunel had hoped to conduct the launch with a minimum of publicity but many thousands of spectators had heard of it and occupied vantage points all round the yard. He was also dismayed to discover that the Eastern Company's directors had sold 3,000 tickets for spectators to enter the shipyard. As he was preparing for the launch, some of the directors joined him on the rostrum with a list of names for the ship. On being asked which he preferred, Brunel replied \\"Call her Tom Thumb if you like\\". At 12:30 pm Henrietta (daughter of a major fundraiser for the ship, Henry Thomas Hope) christened the ship Leviathan much to everyone's surprise since she was commonly known as Great Eastern; her name subsequently changed back to Great Eastern in July 1858. The launch was, however, unsuccessful as the steam winches and manual capstans used to haul the ship towards the water were not up to the job. Brunel made another attempt on the 19th and again on the 28th, this time using hydraulic rams to move the ship, but these too proved inadequate. The ship was successfully launched sideways at 1:42pm on 31 January 1858, aided by an unusually high tide and strong winds and using more powerful hydraulic rams supplied by the then-new Tangye company of Birmingham, the association with such a famous project giving a useful fillip to the fledgling company. She was long, wide, with a draught of unloaded and fully laden, and displaced 32,000 tons fully loaded. In comparison, SS Persia, launched in 1856, was long with a beam. The site of launch is still partly visible these days next to Burrell's Wharf on the Isle of Dogs. Suez Canal concerns In 1857, during the planning of the Suez Canal, it was thought that Great Eastern would not be able to traverse it, since she had a draught of and it was expected that the canal would be excavated to a depth of . In any event, when the canal was opened to shipping in 1869, Great Eastern was no longer in passenger service. Fitting out The launch of the ship cost ¬£170,000, a third of Brunel's estimate for the entire vessel, and it had yet to be fitted out. It was difficult to get any more money from the Eastern Company's investors as the company was close to bankruptcy. To prevent this from happening, a new company was formed, the \\"Great Ship Company\\", with capital of ¬£340,000. They bought the ship for ¬£160,000, which left enough funds for fitting her out. The Eastern Company's shareholders were given the market value of their ¬£20 shares (¬£2 10s) towards payment for shares in the new company and the Eastern Steam Navigation Company entered liquidation. Tenders were invited for fitting the ship out, and two were received ‚Äì one from Wigram and Lucas for ¬£142,000, and the other from John Scott Russell for ¬£125,000. Brunel had taken a long holiday on medical advice and was absent when the contract was awarded to Scott Russell. The work was begun in January 1859, and was completed by August. Maiden voyage 30 August 1859 was given as the date of the first voyage, but this was later put back to 6 September. The destination was Weymouth, from which a trial trip into the Atlantic would be made. Following this the ship would sail to Holyhead, Wales. The company had made an agreement with the Canada's Grand Trunk Railway to use Portland, Maine as its US destination, and the railway company had built a special jetty to accommodate the ship. William Harrison was appointed Captain in 1856; he drowned on 21 January 1860 while sailing from Hythe to Southampton in the ship's boat. The explosion on board the Great Eastern, off Hastings, on 9 September 1859 On 9 September the ship had passed down the Thames, and out into the English Channel, and had just passed Hastings when there was a huge explosion, the forward deck blowing apart with enough force to throw the No. 1 funnel into the air, followed by a rush of escaping steam. Scott Russell and two engineers went below and ordered the steam to be blown off and the engine speed reduced. Five stokers died from being scalded by hot steam, while four or five others were badly injured and one had leapt overboard and had been lost. The accident was discovered to have been caused by a feedwater heater's steam exhaust having been closed, and the explosion's power had been concentrated by the ship's strong bulkheads. 1860‚Äì1863: Transatlantic voyages Although designed to carry emigrants on the far Eastern run, the only passenger voyages Great Eastern made were in the Atlantic. Angus Buchanan, an historian of technology comments: \\"She was designed for the Far Eastern trade, but there was never sufficient traffic to put her into this. Instead, she was used in the transatlantic business, where she could not compete in speed and performance with similar vessels already in service.\\" =First voyage to America= Berthed at New York, 1860 Her first voyage to North America began on 17 June 1860, with 35 paying passengers, eight company \\"dead heads\\" (non-paying passengers), and 418 crew. Among the passengers were the two journalists and engineers Zerah Colburn and Alexander Lyman Holley as well as three directors of the Great Ship Company. Preparations were initially made for the ship to sail on 16 June 1860 and the passengers boarded her on the 14th. After visitors had been sent ashore the Captain (Capt. John Vine Hall) announced that he would not be sailing until the 17th, as the crew were drunk. Director Daniel Gooch, who was travelling aboard her, was not pleased. He was further displeased by the route taken by the ship which was the more southerly of the regular steamer routes as he had wanted the ship to complete the journey in nine days. In the event, the voyage took 10 days 19 hours. =1861 government charter= Upon Great Eastern's return to England, the ship was chartered by the British Government to transport troops to Qu√©bec. 2,144 officers and men, 473 women and children, and 200 horses were embarked at Liverpool along with 40 paying passengers. The ship sailed on 25 June 1861 and went at full speed throughout most of the trip arriving at her destination 8 days and 6 hours after leaving Liverpool. Great Eastern stayed for a month and returned to Britain at the beginning of July with 357 paying passengers.Emmerson, p. 99 Although the ship had made around ¬£14,000 on its first Atlantic voyage, the Great Ship Company's finances were in a poor state, with their shares dropping in price. They were also threatened with a lawsuit by the Grand Trunk Railway for not making Portland, Maine the ship's port of call as agreed.Dugan, p. 52 In addition, Scott Russell had been awarded the sum of ¬£18,000 for repairs following the 1859 explosion. The Company managed to appeal against this but Scott Russell applied to the courts and the Chief Justice found in his favour. The company appealed again, and due to rumours that the ship was about to leave the country, Russell's solicitors took possession of her. The Great Ship Company lost its appeal and had to pay the sum awarded; to cover this and the expenses of a second US voyage, they raised ¬£35,000 using debentures.Tyler, p. 323 =Second voyage to America= Only 100 passengers booked for the second voyage, which was originally scheduled to depart Milford Haven on 1 May 1861. However, the boat taking the passengers to the ship ran aground and they and their luggage had to be rescued by small boats. The voyage took 9 days 13 hours. Great Easterns arrival in New York was virtually unnoticed due to the American Civil War, and when it was opened to the public at 25 cents a head there was little interest. 194 passengers sailed on the return journey on 25 May and 5,000 tons of wheat was also carried. =Third voyage to America= Great Eastern sailed from Liverpool on Tuesday 10 September 1861, commanded by Captain James Walker. On her second day out the wind increased to gale force, causing the ship to roll heavily. The port paddle wheel was completely lost, and the starboard paddle wheel smashed to pieces when one of the lifeboats broke loose. At the same time it was discovered that the cast iron rudder post, which was in diameter, had sheared off above its collar and the rudder was swinging free and hitting the screw, which was slowly breaking it up. Captain Walker ordered his officers to say nothing to the passengers concerning the situation, then had a trysail hoisted which was immediately ripped apart by the wind. He then had a four-ton spar thrown overboard secured with a hawser to try to bring some control to the ship, but it only worked for a short while before being torn away. By the end of the second day some of the passengers had an idea as to the predicament they were in and formed a committee chaired by Liverpool shipping merchant George Oakwood. The captain agreed to meet Oakwood and allowed him to inspect the ship. What he found was far worse than had been expected: none of the cargo had been stowed properly and it was all rolling loose in the holds. Hamilton E. Towle, an American civil engineer, who was returning to the States after completing his contract working as a supervising engineer on the Danube River dry-docks in Austria, visited the rudder room and after inspecting the damage came up with a plan to regain control of the rudder. Towle's scheme was taken to the captain, who failed to act on it. In the evening of the third day, Magnet, a brig from Nova Scotia, appeared on the scene. Captain Walker asked her captain if he would stand by. He agreed, but it turned out there was little he could do, and after several hours the brig left, later succeeding in a claim for demurrage from the Great Ship Company for the delay. Towle now presented his plan to the passengers' committee, and in turn they pressured the captain into letting him try it. Towle had a chain composed of links wound around the rudder post below the break, then secured the ends of the chain to the port and starboard frames of the ship using block and tackle. Two lighter chains were led down from the wheelhouse and attached to the heavy chain and also to the ship's frames. This allowed some limited movement of the rudder, and the ship became steerable again. On the morning of Sunday 15 September the storm finally abated. Towle and the passengers committee insisted that the Captain try the repaired rudder and eventually the engines were started and at 5 pm that day after 75 hours of drifting out of control the ship answered the helm and was turned on to a course towards Ireland, away. When the ship arrived at Queenstown, the harbourmaster refused to let her enter because she was not under full control and injured passengers were taken off by boats. The ship had to stand off for three days until she was towed in by HMS Advice. Arrangements for temporary repairs were begun and the passengers were offered free transport to the US aboard other ships. Once the repairs were completed the ship sailed to Milford Haven where permanent repairs were to be carried out. Smaller, paddlewheels were fitted, and improvements were made to the steering. Upon arriving in the US, Towle filed a claim for $100,000 under the laws of salvage, claiming that his efforts had saved the ship. The case was taken to court, and he was awarded the sum of $15,000, quite a considerable sum for that period. Scientific American published an account of the incident and a description of Towle's device.\\"The way the Great Eastern was saved,\\" Scientific American, vol. 5, no. 17, pages 263‚Äì264 (26 October 1861). Available on-line at: Internet Archive. It is uncertain if Towle ever received any of the money awarded to him by the court. =1862 voyages= Great Eastern sailed from Milford Haven on 7 May 1862 with 138 passengers, arriving in New York on 17 May. The ship was opened to visitors and around 3,000 a day took the opportunity. The return journey to Liverpool was profitable, with 389 passengers travelling along with 3,000 tons of freight. The west-to-east trip took 9 days 12 hours, a reduction of 12 hours on her previous record. The second voyage of 1862 saw the ship arriving in New York on 11 July with 376 passengers including the President of Liberia, J. J. Roberts. The return journey later that month carried 500 passengers and 8,000 tons of cargo, the ship arriving at Liverpool on 7 August. =Great Eastern Rock incident= Great Eastern left Liverpool on 17 August with 1,530 passengers on board and a substantial amount of freight which increased her draught to . Not wishing to enter New York Bay over Sandy Hook bar due to the ship's deep draught, the captain decided to steam up Long Island Sound and moor at Flushing Bay. The pilot came on board at 1:30 am and the ship moved slowly ahead. At about 2:00 am east of Montauk, Long Island a rumble was heard and the ship heeled slightly. The pilot said she had probably rubbed against the \\"North East Ripps\\" (later renamed \\"Great Eastern Rock\\"). The captain sent an officer down to check for damage and he reported no leaks. The ship had a list to port, but made her way into New York the next day under her own steam. It was discovered that the rock had opened a gash in the ship's outer hull over wide and long. The enormous size of Great Eastern precluded the use of any drydock repair facility in the US, and the brothers Henry and Edward S. Renwick devised a daring plan to build a watertight, caisson to cover the gash, held in place by chains around the ship's hull. The brothers claimed that it would take two weeks to complete the repairs and said that they would only take payment if successful. The demands of the American Civil War caused delays in getting the iron plates required, and instead of two weeks the repairs took three months at a cost to the company of ¬£70,000. The ship finally sailed from New York for Liverpool on 6 January 1863. =1863 voyages= The deck of Great Eastern in 1865 In 1863 Great Eastern made three voyages to New York, with 2,700 passengers being carried out and 970 back to Britain along with a large tonnage of cargo. One of her paddle wheels was damaged on the last outward trip and she completed it using her screw, while on the return journey she ran down, damaged, and sank Jane, a 775 ton sailing ship, with the loss of two of her 22 crew. It was found that Great Eastern was not maintaining sufficient look-out for the speed she was steaming at; thus she was held to blame for the collision. The company lost nearly ¬£20,000 on the voyages due to a price war between the Cunard and Inman shipping lines, and ended up with debts of more than ¬£142,000, which forced them to lay up Great Eastern. Sale Great Eastern harboured in Milford Haven, 1870s A plan was mooted to offer the ship in a lottery, which came to nothing, and the ship was finally offered for sale on 14 January 1864 at the Liverpool Exchange, the bidding opening at ¬£50,000. No bids were offered and the ship was withdrawn from sale, the auctioneer declaring that it would be offered for sale with no reserve in three weeks' time. Meanwhile, Daniel Gooch approached Thomas Brassey and John Pender to see if they would be willing to assist in the purchase of Great Eastern. The opening bid at the auction was ¬£20,000 and John Yates who was acting for Gooch secured the ship for a bid of ¬£25,000, despite the ship being worth ¬£100,000 in materials alone. The three men set up a new company, the Great Eastern Steamship Company, and Great Eastern was chartered to the newly formed Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company for ¬£50,000 of shares, and would be responsible for carrying out the necessary conversion work for the ship's new role, laying the Atlantic Cable. Cable laying Cable-laying machinery installed on Great Eastern The conversion work for Great Easterns new role consisted in the removal of funnel no. 4 and some boilers as well as great parts of the passenger rooms and saloons to give way for open top tanks for taking up the coiled cable. Under Sir James Anderson she laid of the 1865 transatlantic telegraph cable. Under Captains Anderson and then Robert Halpin, from 1866 to 1878 the ship laid over of submarine telegraph cable including from Brest, France to Saint Pierre and Miquelon in 1869, and from Aden to Bombay in 1869 and 1870. Wilson, Arthur (1994). The Living Rock: The Story of Metals Since Earliest Times and Their Impact on Civilization. p. 203. Woodhead Publishing. . Break up Great Eastern as a floating billboard in Dublin, 1880s Great Eastern beached for breaking up At the end of her cable-laying career she was refitted once again as a liner but once again efforts to make her a commercial success failed. She was used as a showboat, a floating palace/concert hall and gymnasium. She acted as an advertising hoarding‚Äîsailing up and down the Mersey for Lewis's Department Store, who at this point were her owners, before being sold. The idea was to attract people to the store by using her as a floating visitor attraction. She was sold at auction in 1888, fetching ¬£16,000 for her value as scrap. An early example of breaking-up a structure by use of a wrecking ball, she was scrapped at New Ferry on the River Mersey by Henry Bath & Son Ltd in 1889-1890‚Äîit took 18 months to take her apart. At the time Everton Football Club were looking for a flagpole for their Anfield ground, and consequently purchased her top mast. It still stands there today at the ground‚Äînow owned by Liverpool Football Club, at the Kop end. In 2011, the Channel 4 programme Time Team found geophysical survey evidence to suggest that residual iron parts from the ship's keel and lower structure still reside in the foreshore. Model of Great Eastern in the Museum of London Docklands During 1859, when Great Eastern was off Portland conducting trials, an explosion aboard blew off one of the funnels. The funnel was salvaged and subsequently purchased by the water company supplying Weymouth and Melcombe Regis in Dorset, UK, and used as a filtering device. It was later transferred to the Bristol Maritime Museum close to Brunel's SS Great Britain then moved to the SS Great Britain museum.

The term 'maceral' in reference to coal is analogous to the use of the term 'mineral' in reference to igneous or metamorphic rocks. Examples of macerals are inertinite, vitrinite, and liptinite.  Inertinite  Inertinite is considered to be the equivalent of charcoal and degraded plant material. It is highly oxidised in nature and may be said to be burnt. A large portion of South Africa's coal reserves consist of inertinite.  Vitrinite  Vitrinite is shiny, glass-like material that is considered to be composed of cellular plant material such as roots, bark, plant stems and tree trunks. Vitrinite macerals when observed under the microscope show a boxlike, cellular structure, often with oblong voids and cavities which are likely the remains of plant stems. This has a high calorific value (24 - 28 MJ/kg) and a large proportion of volatile matter (24 - 30%). It often occurs interbanded or interlaminated with inertinite and can be recognised as bright bands.  Liptinite  Liptinite macerals are considered to be produced from decayed leaf matter, spores, pollen and algal matter. Resins and plant waxes can also be part of liptinite macerals. Liptinite macerals tend to retain their original plant form, i.e., they resemble plant fossils. These are hydrogen rich and have the highest calorific values of all coal macerals. Macerals of liptinite are sporinite, cutinite, resinite, alginite (telalginite and lamalginite), liptodetrinite, fluorinite, and bituminite. Nature of macerals Macerals are considered to be dehydrogenated plant fragments. Evidence for this includes remnant pollen spores, fossilised leaves, remnant cellular structure and similar. In rare cases, maceral and fossilised pollen can be found in terrestrial sedimentary rocks. Maceral maturity can be estimated by vitrinite reflectance. This gives information on the carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen composition of the coal, and determines the type of coal: lignite, brown coal, bituminous coal, anthracite or graphite. Macerals found in kerogen source rocks are often observed under the microscope to determine the kerogen maturity of the sedimentary formations. This is a vital component of oil and gas exploration. Macerals are observed under the petrographic microscope under reflected light. Coal fragments must be extremely highly polished down to less than half a micrometre before they can be observed under the microscope.

Seyler in 1932, however, used the term with its present meaning, designating the following group of macerals: sporinite, cutinite, alginite (telalginite and lamalginite), resinite. Macerals (from the same Latin source as 'macerate') are to coal as minerals are to rock. The term was coined by M. C. Stopes in 1935, who wrote :\\"The concept behind the word ‚Äòmacerals‚Äô is that the complex of biological units represented by a forest tree which crashed into a watery swamp and there partly decomposed and was macerated in the process of coal formation, did not in that process become uniform throughout but still retains delimited regions optically differing under the microscope, which may or may not have different chemical formulae and properties. These organic units, composing the coal mass I propose to call macerals, and they are the descriptive equivalent of the inorganic units composing most rock masses and universally called minerals.\\" The macerals grouped under the term exinite are not necessarily entirely composed from exines, but appear to have similar technical properties, though little information is so far available on the technological behavior of pure exinite.

The hotel is situated in Old Quebec, within the historic district's Upper Town. The Ch√¢teau Frontenac was designed by Bruce Price, and was built by the Canadian Pacific Railway company. The hotel is presently managed by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts. Opened in 1893, the Ch√¢teauesque-styled building has 18 floors; its height is augmented by the elevation it sits at.Ch√¢teau Frontenac Altitude and Location It is one of the first completed grand railway hotels, and was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1981. The hotel was expanded on three occasions, with the last major expansion taking place in 1993. Location Ch√¢teau Frontenac towers above Old Quebec's Lower Town, situated atop the promontory of Quebec. The Ch√¢teau Frontenac is situated on 1, rue des Carri√®res, at the eastern edge of Old Quebec's Upper Town, built on the promontory of Quebec, a raised mass of land that projects into the Saint Lawrence River. The hotel property is bounded by rue Saint Louis to the north, and rue Mont Carmel to the south. Terrasse Dufferin is a terrace that wraps around the hotel from the northeast to the southeast, overlooking the Saint Lawrence River. Two public roads run through the hotel, rue du Tr√©sor, and rue des Carri√®res. The hotel building was designated as a National Historic Site of Canada, known as the Ch√¢teau Frontenac National Historic Site of Canada. The area was designated as a National Historic Site in January 1981. Located near the edge of the promontory of Quebec, the Ch√¢teau Frontenac is situated near several major historic attractions within the historic district of Old Quebec's Upper Town. To the northeast of the hotel lies the Ursulines Monastery of Quebec, a 17th-century monastery founded by a missionary group of Ursuline nuns, and another National Historic Site of Canada. To the south of the hotel lies the Plains of Abraham, a historic area within The Battlefields Park, and the site of the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. Another major attraction south of the hotel is the Citadelle of Quebec, situated at the atop Cap Diamant, an elevated point of the promontory. The Citadelle serves as an active military installation for the Canadian Armed Forces, as well as a secondary official residence for the Canadian monarch and the Governor General of Canada. East of the hotel lies the Terrasse Dufferin, and Old Quebec's Lower Town directly below it. The Ch√¢teau Frontenac was not the first hotel built on the site. The first hotel was built during the 1780s, and was known as the Ch√¢teau Haldimand, named after the Governor of Quebec who ordered the hotel's construction. That hotel was later demolished to make way for the present hotel. Design=Architecture Designed in a Ch√¢teauesque style, the building features steep pitched roofs, circular and polygonal towers, and ornate gables and dormers. The Ch√¢teau Frontenac is one of Canada's grand railway hotels built by the Canadian Pacific Railway. The Ch√¢teauesque architectural style used throughout the hotel would later serve as a template for other Canadian grand railway hotels erected in the late-19th to early-20th century. The central fortress-like tower design is derived from medieval chateaus found throughout France's Loire Valley. Ch√¢teauesque elements include the hotel's asymmetrical profile, with steeply pitched roofs, massive circular and polygonal towers and turrets, ornate gables and dormers, and tall chimneys. The exterior base of the hotel is largely made of grey stone ashlar, with steel framing running up the building, Glenboig brick cladding. Materials that make up the interior of the building includes mahogany panelling, marble staircases, carved stone, wrought iron, and glass roundels. However, as opposed the other Ch√¢teauesque-styled buildings found in France, the Ch√¢teau Frontenac did not utilize elements of Italianate architecture, instead placing a greater emphasis on Gothic elements. The hotel also draws certain elements from Victorian style of architecture, with rich polychromatic surfaces throughout its exterior. Built in 1892‚Äì93, the Ch√¢teau Frontenac was originally designed by architect Bruce Price. Price's plan called for a horseshoe-shaped hotel, made up of four wings of unequal length, connected at obtuse angles. Public rooms made up the majority of the first two floors of Price's designs. The original proposal called for a square structure, however the completion of the Terrasse Dufferin led to the development for a more picturesque building. Since its completion, the hotel has undergone several major expansions and renovations led by several different architects and architectural firms. William Sutherland Maxwell led two major expansions to the hotel, one in 1908‚Äì09, and another in 1920‚Äì24 (co-led with his brother, Edward Maxwell). Renovations in the 1990s was led by the Arcop, an architectural firm based in Montreal. The hotel was again expanded in 1993, with the addition of a new wing. Several porte-coch√®res provide access to the hotel's central courtyard. Access to the hotel's main entrance is marked by several porte-coch√®re with large dormers and a cupola. The porte-coch√®re leads guests into the hotel's centre courtyard, as well as the entrance to the hotel's main lobby. The building stands , containing 18 floors primarily made up of guest rooms and other hotel amenities. After the addition of the tallest tower in 1924, the hotel became the tallest building in Quebec City. It remained the city's tallest building until 1930, when √âdifice Price was completed just northeast of the hotel. Although several buildings in Quebec City are taller, the hotel continues to hold a prominent position in the city's skyline, as it is perched atop a tall cape overlooking the Saint Lawrence River. Facilities The Ch√¢teau Frontenac includes 611 guest rooms and suites spread throughout the hotel building. Eight executive suites were renovated into specialty \\"themed rooms\\". Most of the suites are themed to the heads of state and government that have visited the hotel, such as the Trudeau-Trudeau Suite, named after two Canadian Prime Ministers, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, and Justin Trudeau. The Churchill Suite and Roosevelt Suite are two suites named after attendees of the First and Second Quebec Conferences, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and American President Franklin D. Roosevelt, respectively. Other suites themed in honour of world leaders include the Charles de Gaulle, named after the former President of France, and the Elizabeth II, named for the Queen of Canada. Aside from world leaders, the hotel also offers suites themed to Alfred Hitchcock, a director who filmed much of I Confess at the hotel, and William Cornelius Van Horne, the second President of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and Celine Dion. The Celine Dion Heritage Suite utilizes an Art Deco style throughout the suite, decorated with images from Dion's family photographer. A number of rooms at the Ch√¢teau Frontenac are also occupied by restaurants and other food-based services. As of 2018, three restaurants operate within the hotel: 1608 Wine and Cheese Bar, Bistro Le Sam, and Champlain. As a part of Fairmont Hotels and Resorts' larger \\"Bee Sustainable\\" program, the Ch√¢teau Frontenac hosts four queen honey bees in hives on the hotel's rooftop garden. The honey is harvested three times a year and is used by the hotel's restaurants. The hotel has nearly 70,000 honey bees producing of honey per year. The hotel's rooftop apiary also operates a pollinator hotel. History Portrait of Louis de Buade de Frontenac at the hotel lobby. The hotel was named after the former Governor General of New France. Background In the 1870s, a restoration project began in Quebec under the British governor general of Canada aimed at restoring the capital to its former 17th century look. One of the contributors to this project was Lord Dufferin, who supervised the construction of the old city wall and many public buildings that followed the theme of old, medieval, European Quebec. Dufferin also made a plan to reconstruct the Chateau Saint- Louis which was located on the cape where the Chateau Frontenac currently stands and served as the home of the French governors from 1620 to 1834. Dufferin's plan did not take off until the City Council and the Board of Trade adopted the idea and planned to instead construct a grand hotel on the site to attract upper-class tourism to the area, but after failing to finance its construction, businessmen from Toronto and Montreal with connections to the Canadian Pacific Railway took control of the project. 1890s‚Äìpresent The Ch√¢teau Frontenac was completed in 1893, and was designed by American architect Bruce Price and overseen by William Van Horne, the Canadian Pacific Railway's general manager and a key developer of the Canadian railway hotel system. The hotel was a part of a series of Chateauesque-styled hotels built for the Canadian Pacific Railway company during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The last of the Canadian Pacific Railway's Chateauesque hotels was completed in 1908, leaving the rival company Grand Trunk Railway to continue the trend. The hotel was expanded in 1924 to designs by William Sutherland Maxwell. The 1924 expansion saw the addition of the hotel's central tower. The hotel was named after Louis de Buade, Count of Frontenac, who was the Governor General of New France from 1672 to 1682, and again from 1689 to 1698. Reception for the Second Quebec Conference, at the Ch√¢teau Frontenac. The allies of World War II met there twice during the war. The World War II Allies' met during the First and Second Quebec Conference (in 1943 and 1944 respectively). During these conferences, officials including American President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, discussed strategy for World War II. In 1953, this hotel was used as the filming location for the final scene in Alfred Hitchcock's film I Confess, featuring Montgomery Clift and Anne Baxter. In 1993, the hotel saw another expansion, with the addition of the new wing that included a pool, fitness centre, and outdoor terrace. On June 14, 1993, Canada Post issued 'Le Ch√¢teau Frontenac, Qu√©bec' designed by Kosta Tsetsekas, based on illustrations by Heather Price. The $C0.43 stamp features an image of the hotel building, and is perforated 13.5 and printed by Ashton-Potter Limited. In 2001, the hotel was sold to Legacy REIT, which is partially owned by Fairmont, for $185 million. The hotel was renamed the Fairmont Le Ch√¢teau Frontenac in November 2001, shortly after Canadian Pacific Hotels reformed itself as Fairmont Hotels and Resorts, taking the name of an American company it acquired in 2001. From 2011‚Äì12, when the hotel's copper roof was being replaced, an image of the roof was printed on safety netting and hung from scaffolding in order to hide the refurbishment work. In 2011, the hotel was sold to Ivanho√© Cambridge.Ch√¢teau's renovation project  New Ch√¢teau Frontenac . Nouveauchateau.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-12. Shortly after acquiring the hotel, Ivanho√© Cambridge announced an investment of $9 million for the restoration of the building's masonry work, and to replacement of the building's copper roofs. The company further announced another $66 million investment for general improvements and renovations throughout the hotel. When the roof was being replaced, an image of the roof was printed on polypropylene safety netting and hung from scaffolding to hide the refurbishing project from view. The extensive renovation saw conference rooms expanded, restaurants remodeled, modernization of the lobby, and the gutting and rebuilding of three-fifths of the hotel's rooms. The hotel was featured in the 2016 Korean drama Guardian: The Lonely and Great God.

Biography Jordan Rudess was born in 1956 into a Jewish family. He was recognized by his 2nd grade teacher for his piano playing and was immediately given professional instruction. At nine, he entered the Juilliard School of Music Pre-College Division for classical piano training, but by his late teens he had grown increasingly interested in synthesizers and progressive rock music. Against the counsel of his parents and tutors, he turned away from classical piano and tried his hand as a solo progressive rock keyboardist. When Bleu Ocean was assembling a team of fellow drummers to perform on the song \\"Bring the Boys Back Home\\", featured on Pink Floyd's The Wall, he invited Rudess for the sessions, since Rudess had played drums as a child. However, Rudess's performance was rejected by producer Bob Ezrin. At that time, Rudess had already chosen the keyboards as his main instrument. Rudess was part of a studio project assembled by bubblegum pop impresarios Jerry Kasenetz and Jeffry Katz, the folks behind The Ohio Express and The 1910 Fruitgum Company. In 1980, they tried their hand at album-oriented rock with Speedway Boulevard, which also featured touring members of Ram Jam. The group never performed live, and disbanded shortly after the release of the album. After performing in various projects during the 1980s, he gained international attention in 1994 when he was voted \\"Best New Talent\\" in the Keyboard Magazine readers' poll after the release of his Listen solo album. Two of the bands who took notice of Rudess were The Dixie Dregs and Dream Theater, both of whom invited him to join. Rudess chose the Dregs, primarily as being a part-time member of the band would have less of an impact on his young family, a choice he was not given with Dream Theater During his time with the Dregs, Rudess formed a \\"power duo\\" with drummer Rod Morgenstein. The genesis of this pairing occurred when a power outage caused all of the Dregs' instruments to fail except Rudess', so he and Morgenstein improvised with each other until power was restored and the concert could continue. The chemistry between the two was so strong during this jam that they decided to perform together on a regular basis (under the name Rudess/Morgenstein Project or later RMP) and have since released a studio and a live record. Rudess encountered Dream Theater once again when he and Morgenstein secured the support slot on one of Dream Theater's North American tours. In 1997, when Mike Portnoy was asked to form a supergroup by Magna Carta Records, Rudess was chosen to fill the keyboardist spot in the band, which also consisted of Tony Levin and Portnoy's Dream Theater colleague John Petrucci. During the recording of Liquid Tension Experiment's two albums it became evident to Portnoy and Petrucci that Rudess was what Dream Theater needed. They asked Rudess to join the band, and when he accepted they released their then-keyboardist Derek Sherinian to make way for him. Rudess has been the full-time keyboardist in Dream Theater since the recording of 1999's Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory. He has recorded nine other studio albums with the group: 2002's Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, 2003's Train of Thought, 2005's Octavarium, 2007's Systematic Chaos, 2009's Black Clouds & Silver Linings, 2011's A Dramatic Turn of Events, 2013's Dream Theater, 2016's The Astonishing, and 2019's Distance over Time. In addition, he has appeared on the live albums Live Scenes From New York, Live at Budokan, Score, Chaos in Motion, Live at Luna Park and Breaking the Fourth Wall. In addition to working with Dream Theater he occasionally records and performs in other contexts, such as a 2001 one-off duo performance with Petrucci (released as the CD An Evening With John Petrucci and Jordan Rudess), as well as backing up Blackfield on their first short US tour in 2005 and playing a solo opening slot for them on their second in 2007. He also contributed to Steven Wilson's 2011 album, Grace for Drowning. and Insurgentes. In 2010, Rudess composed \\"Explorations for Keyboard and Orchestra,\\" his first classical composition. It was premiered in Venezuela on November 19, 2010 by the Chacao Youth Symphony Orchestra and guest conductor Eren Ba≈übuƒü. Rudess played all of the keyboard and synthesizer parts. On July 28, 2011, in a poll conducted by MusicRadar, Rudess was voted the best keyboardist of all time. Rudess says his influences as a keyboardist are Keith Emerson, Tony Banks, Rick Wakeman and Patrick Moraz. His favorite musical artists and groups include Gentle Giant, Yes, Genesis, Pink Floyd, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, King Crimson, Jimi Hendrix, Autechre, and Aphex Twin. Rudess appeared on the Ayreon album, The Theory of Everything released on October 28, 2013.  Use of technology  While many keyboard players in progressive rock tend towards bringing numerous keyboards on stage, creating large racks of keyboards, Rudess would sample sounds from other keyboards he owned and map them to a single keyboard. Each \\"setup\\" assigns different sounds to different layers and key ranges of the keyboard controller; these setups are then arranged in the order they will be required for a gig, and cycled through with a foot-switch. From the 1990s onward, he used a Kurzweil K2600XS during live sets, until switching to Korg's Oasys workstation in 2005, which he first used on Dream Theater's 2005‚Äì2006 20th Anniversary tour, along with a Muse Receptor hardware VST and a Haken Continuum X/Y/Z-plane MIDI instrument triggering a Roland V-Synth XT and a synthesizers.com modular unit designed by Richard Lainhart and Roger Arrick. Influenced by Lainhart, Rudess was the first well known keyboardist to bring a Haken Continuum on to a live stage. Rudess kept the Kurzweil for studio recordings and some of his signature sounds, such as \\"the pig\\", which is often played in unison with the guitar or bass guitar. In 2011 Jordan switched from the Oasys to the new flagship Korg Kronos. In addition, he added a Roland Ax-Edge keytar and a Hammond XK-5 to his live setup in 2019 and were used on Dream Theater's 2019 record Distance over Time. His current live rig consists of the Kronos together with a Continuum, a Hammond XK-5, a Roland AX-Edge, a lap steel guitar, a Harpejji, and an iPad. Since 2001, Rudess has used custom made swiveling keyboard stands on stage for both Dream Theater and his solo career, which are built by Patrick Slaats from the Netherlands. On Dream Theater's 2007‚Äì2008 \\"Chaos in Motion Tour, Rudess expanded his live setup with the addition of a Korg RADIAS, a Manikin Memotron, and a Zen Riffer keytar. Rudess stopped using his Synthesizers.com modular after the European leg of the tour due to its size and weight. Rudess still owns the synthesizer and keeps it in his home studio. During the Progressive Nation 2008 tour, he introduced on the stage a Kaoss Pad 3 for the closing medley. For the 2009‚Äì2010 tour, in support of Black Clouds & Silver Linings, Jordan introduced the Apple iPhone on stage, running an application called Bebot Robot Synth. He plays it during A Rite of Passage ‚Äì both studio album and live versions of the song ‚Äì and frequently uses it for improvised solos, like in Hollow Years' intro and during a new instrumental section on Solitary Shell. On September 24, 2010, Rudess released the song \\"Krump\\", which was an electronica single, released on iTunes. It featured the use of the new Roland Gaia, Roland's more recent keyboard. Software Development In 2010, Rudess started a software company called Wizdom Music. He paired with artists such as Kevin Chartier, Felipe Pe√±a and Eyal Amir (from Project RnL), creating new types of musical instrumental user interfaces and experiences, new and innovative ways of creating sound synthesis, and of recording and performing music, with tablet computers. The company also produced a unique game for learning pitch and chord recognition and an app for real time video effects on a live camera. Wizdom Music created the following software: * SampleWiz ‚Äì a touch screen enabled sampler and self sampler for the iPhone and iPad * MorphWiz ‚Äì a dynamic touch screen music creation controller for iOS, Android, and Windows 8 enabled touch pads and laptops * Geo Synthesizer ‚Äì a new digital music controller interface, for the iPhone and iPad. * Tachyon ‚Äì app for mixing, morphing and transitioning between two types of sound, for the iPhone and iPad. * Leap motion music ‚Äì a yet to be released touchless music controller by four finger location in 3d, creating music verses according to the fingers' locations, with the Leap Motion controller. * HarmonyWiz - an advanced harmonic generator which can create multi-part harmony, all just from inputting a single musical line. You can paint your music in or play it from a piano style keyboard. * Jordantron - An app that contains all the sounds of Rudess' live rig into your iPad. This is the first time Rudess has released a complete set of his exclusive sounds to the public. * SketchWiz - turns your camera into your personal sketch artist. You can view your world as pencil, pen, chalk, or charcoal sketches, and you can save your masterpieces to your photo library. * EarWizard - Trains your ear while improving your memory skills.

It then runs concurrently with US 50 through Holly east to the Kansas border. Kansas US-50 and US-400 eastbound US-400 and US-50 enter Kansas west of Coolidge. They run concurrently through Garden City, where it intersects US-83 and separate at Dodge City, which is where it intersects US-56 and US-283. It continues southeast from Dodge City and first intersects US-54 at Mullinville. US-400 and US-54 begin a long concurrency at Mullinville which passes through Greensburg, Pratt and Kingman before entering Wichita. While in Wichita, US-400 and US-54 intersect Interstate 235 and the concurrency of US-81 and Interstate 135. K-96 provides a short freeway connection to Interstate 35, which is also the Kansas Turnpike. At Augusta, US-400 and US-54 enter into another concurrency with US-77, and US-400 breaks from this concurrency at Haverhill. 54 a few miles west of Pratt, Kansas. US-400 continues east through several small towns before turning southeast to go through the Fredonia area and intersecting US-75 at Neodesha. After a brief concurrency with US-75, it turns east, first intersecting U.S. Route 169 near Morehead and then US-59 near Parsons before finally intersecting US-69 south of Pittsburg. It then turns south with US-69 and at Crestline, follows US-69A south to Riverton. US-400 then turns east with US-166 at Baxter Springs and the two highways run concurrently eastward into Missouri. The entire section of US-400 in Cimarron is maintained by the city. Missouri US 400, along with US 166, terminates at I-44 about one mile (1.6 km) east of the Kansas- Missouri state line, three miles (5 km) west of Joplin. History U.S. 400's eastern terminus approaching I-44 in Newton County, Missouri US 400 was first established on December 1, 1994, and at that time ran from the east end of the US-50 and US-83 overlap, eastward to the east county line of Cherokee County, Kansas. U.S. Route 154 A section of U.S. 400 that ran from Dodge City to Mullinville, Kansas was U.S. Route 154 from 1926 to 1982. It later became K-154 before becoming part of U.S. 400. Construction on the first section of the East Kellogg improvement project started in August 2015. The project included a redesigned intersection with Webb Road and widened US-54 and US-400 from four lanes to six lanes from Webb Road to Greenwich Road. Construction on a second project began in 2016, to continue widening the highway to a six-lane freeway between Greenwich Road and K-96. Also new bridges will be built over I-35/KTA, new ramps will be constructed from southbound I-35/KTA to westbound US-54/US-400 and from eastbound US-54/US-400 to both northbound and southbound I-35/KTA. In addition, two-lane one way frontage roads on each side of the freeway will be built. Construction for both projects should be completed by late 2021. A two-mile section of the new highway, from Eastern Street to the K-96 junction, opened on November 21, 2019. On April 16, 2020, vandals damaged an estimated $50,000 worth of construction equipment, which included a bulldozer, excavator and an off-road vehicle.

Portnoy is primarily known as the former drummer, backing vocalist, and a co-founder of the progressive metal band Dream Theater. In September 2010, Portnoy announced his departure from Dream Theater after 25 years, with Mike Mangini taking his place as drummer of the band. Since his departure, Portnoy has formed a variety of new bands and projects, including Adrenaline Mob, Flying Colors, The Winery Dogs, Sons of Apollo, Metal Allegiance, and BPMD.  Early life  Portnoy was born April 20, 1967 and raised on Long Island in Long Beach, New York. His father, Howard Portnoy (1940‚Äì2009), worked as a DJ at a local radio station. Mike and his father later moved to Carmel- by-the-Sea, California to work at KRML radio station after watching the 1971 film Play Misty for Me. His mother died on November 16, 1984, when the private plane she was riding in, with her boyfriend, crashed off the Atlantic City coastline. Portnoy's father's job helped him gain an appreciation for music at an early age particularly, as Portnoy has pointed out, because he had access to his father's collection of LPs. He developed a preference for bands including Rush, Queen, Led Zeppelin, The Who, Iron Maiden, and the Beatles, among many others. Portnoy claims to be self-taught as a drummer, though he did take music theory classes in high school. During that period he began playing in local bands, two of which (Rising Power and Inner Sanctum) recorded and released independent albums. Dream Theater: 1985‚Äì2010 Portnoy in 2007 He left Inner Sanctum (his last high school band) after being awarded a scholarship to attend the Berklee College of Music in Boston. In university, he met John Petrucci and John Myung. They formed a band, initially taking the name \\"Majesty\\" before changing their name to Dream Theater. They left Berklee soon after. Known for his technical skill as a drummer in Dream Theater, Portnoy has won 30 awards from the Modern Drummer magazine. He co-produced six Dream Theater albums with guitarist John Petrucci, starting from Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory through Black Clouds and Silver Linings and was one of the main songwriters during his tenure. He is the second youngest person (after Neil Peart) to be inducted into the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame, at 37 years of age. In the spring of 2010, Portnoy filled in for Avenged Sevenfold's former drummer, Jimmy \\"The Rev\\" Sullivan, who died during the production of the band's fifth album Nightmare. On May 5, 2010, Portnoy released a statement on his status with Avenged Sevenfold on their official website, concluding his working relationship with the band. On September 8, 2010, Mike Portnoy announced he would be leaving Dream Theater. The band hired Mike Mangini to take his place after inviting and holding auditions with seven \\"world-class\\" drummers. When Avenged Sevenfold later decided to also sever ties with Portnoy, he announced that he had asked to return to Dream Theater, but was turned down by their lawyer since the band had already brought Mangini on board, and Mangini had left his tenured teaching position at Berklee College of Music to join the band. Former and current projects: 1997‚Äìpresent Portnoy is known for his many side projects and tribute bands. He is a founding member of Liquid Tension Experiment, an instrumental progressive rock band featuring fellow Dream Theater members John Petrucci and Jordan Rudess along with bassist Tony Levin. He is also a founding member of Transatlantic, a progressive rock \\"super-group\\" featuring former Spock's Beard keyboardist/vocalist Neal Morse, Flower Kings guitarist Roine Stolt and Marillion bassist Pete Trewavas. Portnoy has also recorded and/or toured/performed live with Neal Morse, OSI, Hail!, Stone Sour, Fates Warning, Overkill and G3. Over the years, Portnoy has also created tribute bands to The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Rush, and The Who, which has allowed him to perform the music of his four favorite drummers. Since his departure, Portnoy has formed several new bands, starting with Adrenaline Mob, a traditional heavy metal/hard rock band with singer Russell Allen (of Symphony X) and guitarist Mike Orlando. On June 4, 2013, however, Portnoy announced his departure from Adrenaline Mob, citing scheduling conflicts. He is also a founding member of Flying Colors, a progressive rock band also featuring Steve Morse, Neal Morse, Dave LaRue, and Casey McPherson; The Winery Dogs, a power trio also featuring bassist Billy Sheehan (Mr. Big) and guitarist Richie Kotzen (formerly of Mr. Big and Poison); Sons of Apollo, a progressive metal supergroup also featuring Sheehan, Derek Sherinian, Jeff Scott Soto and Ron \\"Bumblefoot\\" Thal; Metal Allegiance, a thrash metal/groove metal band also featuring Mark Menghi, David Ellefson (Megadeth) and Alex Skolnick (Testament); and BPMD, a supergroup/cover band also featuring Menghi, Phil Demmel (Vio-lence) and Bobby \\"Blitz\\" Ellsworth (Overkill). Artistry and influences Portnoy played John Myung's bass when Dream Theater performed as the fictitious band Nightmare Cinema. Before live performances of \\"Trial of Tears\\", he would sometimes switch instruments with John Petrucci and play a fragment of \\"Eruption\\" by Van Halen. In Nightmare Cinema he got the \\"alternate stage name\\" Max Del Fuvio. He was seen playing Pink Floyd's Sheep on a sunburst 4-string Music Man Sterling belonging to Myung on The Making of Systematic Chaos. He plays bass guitar and xylophone during a jam by Liquid Trio Experiment 2. He has also contributed lead and harmony vocals to numerous projects. In the April 2001 edition of Modern Drummer and Mike Portnoy's website, he names Neil Peart, Carl Palmer, Bill Bruford, Terry Bozzio, Billy Cobham, Alan White, Stewart Copeland, Phil Collins, Chester Thompson, Simon Phillips, Nick D'Virgilio, Andy Sturmer, Dave Lombardo, Jon Fishman, Vinnie Colaiuta, Peter Criss, Ringo Starr, Tommy Lee, John Bonham, Lars Ulrich and Keith Moon as influences. Portnoy endorses Tama drums, Remo drumheads, Sabian cymbals and Promark drumsticks. Personal life Portnoy and his wife Marlene (n√©e Apuzzo) live in Upper Saucon Township in the Lehigh Valley region of Pennsylvania with their children, Melody Ruthandrea and Max John. Marlene used to be a guitarist in the all-female band Meanstreak, and two of the other members, guitarist Rena Sands and bassist Lisa Martens, are married to Dream Theater guitarist John Petrucci and bassist John Myung, respectively. Max Portnoy, like his father Mike, is a drummer. His band Next to None opened for Adrenaline Mob in Atlanta on April 6, 2013. As of December 26, 2017, Portnoy currently plays drums in his new band Tallah. Portnoy is a recovering alcoholic and has openly talked about it. The five- song set Twelve-step Suite deals with his experience of alcoholism. He quit drinking in April 2000 after the final show on Dream Theater's Scenes from a Memory tour.

He occasionally worked as a producer and director. According to Lluis F√†bregas Cuixart, the pseudonym Fortunio Bonanova referred to his desire to seek fortune, and his love of the Bonanova neighborhood in his native Palma de Mallorca.  Biography  As a young man, living under his birthname, he was a professional telegraph operator. He studied music with the Italian Giovachini. In 1921, he debuted as a singer in Tannh√§user, at the Teatre Principal in Palma. That year, along with a group of Majorcan intellectuals and Jorge Luis Borges (who was briefly living in Majorca with his parents and sister), he signed the Ultraist Manifesto, using the name Fortunio Bonanova. Also in 1921, he appeared in a silent film of Don Juan Tenorio by the brothers Ba√±os, which was shown the following year in New York City and Hollywood. He later directed his own Don Juan in 1924. In 1927, he acted in Love of Sonya, directed by Albert Parker and starring Gloria Swanson. In 1932 he had small parts in Hollywood productions featuring Joan Bennett and Mary Astor. In the same period, he appeared in New York in several operas as well as the zarzuelas La Canci√≥n del Olvido (\\"The song of forgetting\\"), La Duquesa del Tabar√≠n (\\"The Duchess of Tabar√≠n\\"), Los Gavilanes, and La Monter√≠a. In 1934, he returned to Spain, where he had a major role in the film El Desaparecido (\\"The disappeared one\\") written and directed by Antonio Graciani. In 1935 he acted and sang in the film Poderoso Caballero (\\"A Big Guy\\"), directed by M√†ximo Nossik. In 1936, with the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he returned to the United States, where he played the role of Captain Bill in a film called Capit√°n Tormenta, directed by Jules Bernhardt. A sequence of increasingly larger acting and singing roles mostly in English-language films followed, especially after 1940. Among his roles were Signor Matiste, Susan Alexander Kane's opera coach in Citizen Kane (1941); General Sebastiano in Five Graves to Cairo (1943); Don Miguel in The Black Swan (1942); Fernando in For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943); Sam Garlopis in Double Indemnity (1944); and a singing Christopher Columbus in Where Do We Go From Here?. He continued for the next several decades in a miscellany of character roles. Bonanova was also an uncredited technical consultant for the film Blood and Sand (1941), and produced and appeared in the Spanish-language film La Inmaculada (a name of the Virgin Mary, \\"Immaculate\\")(1939). Bonanova played the father of twins Esther Williams, and Ricardo Montalb√°n in the 1947 film Fiesta. In 1949, Bonanova collaborated with Ambrose Barker on a musical entitled \\"Glamor/Glamour is the Gimmick.\\" It got bad reviews‚Äîwhat may have been popular and witty when Barker developed it in the early 1930s didn‚Äôt make it in 1949.Billboard, 22 October 1949, pg. 24 In the 1950s, he appeared in an episode of I Love Lucy as a fake psychic who uses his stage apparatus to make it appear as though Lucy is able to speak Spanish to her mother-in-law. In 1952, he played an Italian opera singer, Anthony Branchetti, in the 4th episode of My Little Margie where Margie helps her father by convincing Mr. Branchetti to appear at a party in his honor to impress a reluctant client of Honeywell & Todd. In 1953 he played Lou Costello's Uncle Bozzo in the Abbott & Costello episode of \\"Uncle Bozzo's Visit.\\" Bonanova died in 1969 in Woodland Hills, California of a cerebral hemorrhage and is buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.

Two sections of this highway are tolled: the Cimarron Turnpike (from I-35 to the western outskirts of Tulsa), and the Cherokee Turnpike (from near Chouteau to about west of the Arkansas border). Arkansas The Arkansas section starts at the Oklahoma line, runs through the scenic Ozark Mountains in the northern part of Arkansas, and leaves the state at the Missouri Bootheel. Cities along the route include Siloam Springs, Springdale, Alpena, Harrison, Cotter, Mountain Home, Salem, Walnut Ridge, and Paragould. In Harrison, U.S. Route 412 is concurrent with both US 62 and US 65. =Northwest Arkansas= The route enters Arkansas in the northwest portion of the state. In Benton County, the route serves Siloam Springs as a major route through the southern part of the city. US 412 has a concurrency with Highway 59 that ends in east Siloam Springs. US 412 becomes four-lane and runs east to enter Washington County. The route enters Tontitown, passes the historic Tontitown School Building, and intersects Highway 112 before entering Springdale.

AHTD: Planning and Research Division. Database. Retrieved June 4, 2011. Now named Sunset Avenue, the route passes through developed parts of Springdale, including many restaurants, hotels, and businesses before turning south, forming a concurrency with US 71B. The concurrency ends and US 412 heads east past the Springdale Municipal Airport and Highway 265 out of town. Again becoming four-lane divided, the route winds east to Hindsville. The route nears Hindsville, including an intersection with a former alignment now designated US 412B. The community was bypassed in 2009 with a four-lane alignment of US 412. US 412 continues east, winding through forested land. Near Huntsville, the highway intersects another business route and Highway 23 before entering Carroll County. =Concurrencies with US 62 and US 63= The highway has a brief overlap with Highway 21 in the southwest corner of the county, and has junctions with many rural routes in Carroll County. The highway passes the James C. Chaney House and Stamps Store in Osage, the Dog Branch School, and the Yell Masonic Lodge Hall in Carrollton. In Alpena, US 412 begins a concurrency with US 62. This overlap is approximately through many north central Arkansas communities, including Harrison, Cotter, Mountain Home, Ash Flat, and Hardy. In Imboden, US 412 breaks from US 62 north, now concurrent with US 63 until 2 miles east of Portia. 1934 Parker pony truss bridge formerly carried US 412 over the Cache River, but was rated structurally deficient in 1991 and was bypassed in 1995.

US 412 runs near the Old Walnut Ridge Post Office, Missouri-Pacific Depot, and the Walnut Ridge Commercial Historic District, each on the National Register of Historic Places. Further east, the route intersects US 67 (Future I-57) at a full interchange before crossing the Cache River and entering Greene County. Historically, the route passed over the water on the Cache River Bridge, but the 1934 Parker pony truss bridge was bypassed in 1995. The highway runs due east, intersecting Highway 228, Highway 141, and Highway 168 (which gives access to Crowley's Ridge State Park) before Paragould. US 412 runs as Kings Hwy in Paragould, passing the Linwood Mausoleum, US 49B, Highway 69, and Highway 135 in the city limits. The route continues east across the St. Francis River, entering Missouri. Missouri U.S. 412 crosses Missouri on its Bootheel, and runs concurrent with Interstate 155 east of Hayti to the Tennessee state line. Tennessee Still concurrent with I-155, US 412 enters Tennessee from Missouri on the Caruthersville Bridge before meeting US 51 in Dyersburg. The interstate designation ends as 412 turns southeast toward Jackson on a stretch of highway that was upgraded from 2 to 4 lanes in the 1990s. After leaving Jackson on its eastern side, US 412 passes through the towns of Lexington, Parsons, and Hohenwald before reaching Columbia. The section from Hohenwald eastward to I-65 near Columbia is overlapped with unsigned State Route 99. East of I-65 at the eastern terminus of US 412, the route remains SR 99. History Arkansas Highway 68 is the former designation of U.S. Highway 412 from the Arkansas- Oklahoma State Line to U.S. Highway 62 at Alpena. The original eastern terminus of Highway 68 was east of Huntsville at Highway 21, but was extended in the 1940s to Alpena. An old alignment of Highway 68 can be found east of Huntsville. This section includes an open-spandrel arch bridge over War Eagle Creek. Just east of Mountain Home, in Henderson, the highway crosses Lake Norfork, which at one time had to be crossed by ferry. Coinciding with the final trip of a Norfork Lake ferry at 8 a.m. Friday, October 14, 1983, the U.S. Highway 62 bridge across Lake Norfork was opened. Charles Gibson piloted the ferry on that trip, carrying three cars across the lake within the shadow of the bridge, which brought a 40-year era to an end.

The second earldom dates to 1442. The holder of the Earldom of Shrewsbury also holds the title of Earl of Waterford (1446) in the Peerage of Ireland and Earl Talbot (1784) in the Peerage of Great Britain. Shrewsbury and Waterford are the oldest earldoms in their peerages held by someone with no higher title (the oldest earldoms in each peerage being held by the Duke of Norfolk and Duke of Leinster respectively), and as such the Earl of Shrewsbury is sometimes described as the premier earl of England and Ireland. History=First creation, 1074 The first creation occurred in 1074 for Roger de Montgomerie, one of William the Conqueror's principal counselors. He was one of the Marcher Lords, with the Earl of Hereford and the Earl of Chester, a bulwark against the Welsh; he was granted great powers, and his territory, which extended from Shropshire (of which Shrewsbury is the county town) into Mid-Wales (the county of Montgomeryshire being named after him), was outside the ordinary administration; he was also granted lands across England. Roger was succeeded in 1094 by his younger son Hugh, his elder son Robert of Bell√™me succeeding to his lands in Normandy. On Hugh's death in 1098 the earldom passed to his brother Robert. The title was forfeit in 1102 after the 3rd Earl, Robert, rebelled against Henry I and joined Robert Curthose's invasion of England in 1101. These earls were sometimes styled Earl of Shropshire (Conte(s/m) Salop). Second creation, 1442 The title was created for a second time in 1442 when John Talbot, 7th Baron Talbot, an English general in the Hundred Years' War, was made Earl of Shrewsbury in the Peerage of England. He was also made hereditary Lord High Steward of Ireland and, in 1446, Earl of Waterford in the Peerage of Ireland (thus, the two titles have always descended together). John Talbot, the first Earl, was succeeded by his son John, the second Earl, who had already succeeded as seventh Baron Furnivall on his mother's death in 1433. Lord Shrewsbury served as both Lord Chancellor of Ireland and Lord High Treasurer of England. He was killed at the Battle of Northampton in 1460 during the Wars of the Roses. His grandson, the fourth Earl, was Lord Steward of the Household between 1509 and 1538. His son, the fifth Earl, was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration as Lord Talbot in 1533, five years before he succeeded his father. On his death the titles passed to his son, the sixth Earl. Lord Shrewsbury was entrusted with the custody of Mary, Queen of Scots, and also served as Earl Marshal from 1572 to 1590. He married as his second wife the famous Bess of Hardwick. Shrewsbury was succeeded by his son from his first marriage to Lady Gertrude Manners, the seventh Earl. He represented Derbyshire in the House of Commons and served as Lord Lieutenant of Derbyshire. He had no sons and on his death in 1616 the baronies of Talbot, Strange of Blackmere and Furnivall fell into abeyance between his three daughters. He was succeeded in the earldoms by his younger brother, the eighth Earl. He was Member of Parliament for Northumberland. He did not have a male heir either and was succeeded by his distant relative, the ninth Earl. He was the great-great-grandson of Sir Gilbert Talbot (died 1518), third son of the second Earl of Shrewsbury. The family bought Barlow Woodseats Hall in 1593 as part of the estate. He was succeeded by his nephew, George, the tenth Earl and Lord of Grafton. He was the son of John Talbot of Grafton. On his death the titles passed to his son, the eleventh Earl. He was killed in a duel with George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham. His son, the twelfth Earl, was a prominent statesman. He was one of the Immortal Seven who in 1688 invited William of Orange to invade England and depose his father-in-law James II and later served under William and Mary as Secretary of State for the Southern Department and Secretary of State for the Northern Department. In 1694 he was created Marquess of Alton and Duke of Shrewsbury in the Peerage of England. The Duke was childless and on his death in 1718 the marquessate and dukedom became extinct. He was succeeded in his other titles by his first cousin, the thirteenth Earl. He was the son of the Hon. Gilbert Talbot, second son of the tenth Earl. Lord Shrewsbury was in the Holy Orders of the Church of Rome. On his death the titles passed to his nephew George, the fourteenth Earl (who was the son of the Hon. George Talbot). He was childless and was succeeded by his nephew Charles, the fifteenth Earl (who was the son of Charles Talbot). He began in 1812 the creation of the extensive gardens at Alveton Lodge, Staffordshire (later renamed Alton Towers) which estate had been in the family since the 15th century. When he died the titles were inherited by his nephew John, the sixteenth Earl who was the son of the Hon. John Joseph Talbot. When in 1831 the principal home of the family at Heythrop, Oxfordshire was destroyed by fire he moved the family seat to Alton Towers. The sixteenth Earl was also a noted patron of A W N Pugin. He was succeeded by Bertram, his second cousin once removed, the seventeenth Earl who was the great-grandson of the Hon. George Talbot, younger son of the aforementioned Gilbert Talbot (died 1711), second son of the tenth Earl. Bertram died unmarried at an early age in 1856. By his will he left his estates to Lord Edmund Howard (by Royal Licence from 1876-1922: Talbot), son of the Duke of Norfolk, a will contested by three distant relatives and after a long and expensive legal case the House of Lords ruled in 1860 in favour of Henry John Chetwynd-Talbot, 3rd Earl Talbot, who thus became the eighteenth Earl of Shrewsbury and Waterford. He was a descendant of the aforementioned the Hon. Sir Gilbert Talbot (died 1518), third son of the second Earl of Shrewsbury (see the Earl Talbot for earlier history of this branch). He also held the titles of Baron Talbot, of Hensol in the County of Glamorgan, and Viscount of Ingestre, of Ingestre Hall in the County of Stafford. Lord Shrewsbury was an admiral in the Royal Navy and also served in the second Conservative administration of the Earl of Derby as Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms (chief whip in the House of Lords) from 1858 to 1859. Alton Towers, former seat of the Earls of Shrewsbury, is now part of a theme park. His eldest son, the nineteenth Earl, also served as Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms, an office he held from 1874 to 1877 under Benjamin Disraeli. He was succeeded by his son, the twentieth Earl. He caused a scandal in Victorian England by eloping with a married woman, Ellen Miller-Mundy. They were later married. On his death the titles passed to his grandson, the twenty-first Earl. He was the son of Charles John Alton Chetwynd-Talbot, Viscount Ingestre. the peerages are held by the twenty-first Earl's eldest son, the twenty-second Earl, who succeeded in 1980. He is one of the ninety elected hereditary peers that remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999, and sits on the Conservative benches. He is also hereditary Lord High Steward of Ireland and as the holder of this office is allowed to bear a white staff at the Coronation of the British Monarch. Lord Shrewsbury is the senior earl on the Roll in the Peerage of England (the more senior earldom of Arundel being held by the Duke of Norfolk). The earldom of Waterford is sometimes called the \\"Premier Earldom of Ireland on the Roll\\", as the oldest Irish earldom, that of Kildare, has been a subsidiary title of the Duke of Leinster for centuries and the Earl held the oldest Irish earldom held by anyone ranked as an Earl. If the Viscount Mountgarret proves his presumed claim to the 1328 earldom of Ormonde, the Earls of Shrewsbury would lose this distinction, but they derive higher precedence from their English earldom in any event. Despite holding three differently named earldoms Lord Shrewsbury is always styled simply \\"The Earl of Shrewsbury\\". The seat of the Earls of Shrewsbury was once Alton Towers until it was sold in 1924 by the infant 21st Earl's Trustees. The family seat is still in Staffordshire, near Ashbourne and Uttoxeter. The family crypt is the Shrewsbury Chapel in Sheffield Cathedral. In 2013, it was discovered that the majority of the Shrewsbury coffins had gone missing from the burial chamber. The current Earl has been appointed High Steward of Sheffield Cathedral. The other family crypt ‚Äì that of the Chetwynd-Talbot Earls of Shrewsbury ‚Äì is at the Church of St Mary The Virgin, Ingestre, Stafford. Three other members of the Talbot family may also be mentioned. The Hon. John Talbot, son of the first Earl of Shrewsbury by his second wife Margaret Beauchamp, was created Viscount Lisle in 1451. Admiral the Hon. Walter Carpenter (who assumed the surname of Carpenter in lieu of his patronymic Chetwynd-Talbot), second son of the eighteenth Earl, was a naval commander and Member of Parliament. Major-General the Hon. Sir Reginald Talbot, third son of the eighteenth Earl, was a soldier, politician and colonial governor.

Its route number is a \\"violation\\" of the usual AASHTO numbering scheme, as it comes nowhere near its implied \\"parent\\", US 25. The route's northern terminus is in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, at an interchange with Interstate 530/U.S. Route 63/U.S. Route 65/U.S. Route 79/US 65B/AR 190. Until 2005, its southern terminus was in Bastrop, Louisiana, at an intersection with U.S. Route 165. In 2005, it was extended to Natchez, Mississippi, at an intersection with U.S. Route 61.Sanderson, Dale End of U.S. Highway 425. Accessed 6 April 2011 (with maps of US 425 and related routes). US 425 is an amalgamation of former state highways. Most of US 425 in Louisiana, for example, is merely a concurrency with LA 15. Route description=Mississippi The southern terminus of US 425 is at a signalized intersection with US 61 and US 84 in Natchez. The route travels northwest through the city concurrent with US 84 to the Natchez‚ÄìVidalia Bridge, along which the two routes cross the Mississippi River into Louisiana. Louisiana After entering Louisiana, the concurrency with US 84 continues for approximately 14 miles to Ferriday. US 425 then splits and heads northeast, running concurrently with LA 15 through mostly farmland and small towns. Just north of Clayton is the southern terminus of US 65. Passing through Winnsboro the highways split at Archibald. LA 15 continues northwest to Monroe, LA while US 425 heads north to Rayville where it crosses I-20. At Mer Rouge, it intersects US 165 and the two highways run concurrent to Bastrop, LA. A few miles north of Bastrop, US 425 crosses into Arkansas south of Crossett. Arkansas Along US 425 north of Star City The route enters Arkansas near Rawls and runs north through rural Ashley County. Highway 425 forms a concurrency with US 82 east of Crosett, with the two routes running north through farmland and trees to Hamburg, the county seat of Ashley County. In Hamburg, the routes are joined by Highway 8, which runs east and west across the southern part of the state. North of the junction, the three routes pass the First United Methodist Church and historic properties within the Hamburg Commercial Historic District before US 82 turns east at St. Louis Street and US 425/AR 8 run north out of Hamburg. Passing more agricultural land, Highway 8 turns west in Fountain Hill just before the Drew County line. Further north US 425 intersects Highway 133 in Lacey and Highway 172 before entering Monticello. The highway serves the University of Arkansas at Monticello in the southern part of town, also passing the Monticello Elementary School. US 425 intersects University Drive and continues north as a four‚Äìlane road. There is an interchange with Jordan Drive (AR 83S), after which US 425 enters residential Monticello. The route now curves to the west side of town, with Main Street (AR 83) serving downtown Monticello. Highway 83 was the previous alignment of AR 13, which US 425 replaced upon designation in 1989. There are plans to bypass Monticello even more efficiently as part of Interstate 69's extension into Arkansas. US 425, now four‚Äìlane with center turn lane format, intersects US 278/Highway 35 at a busy intersection. Highway 35 forms a short concurrency north with US 425, which proceeds north and out of Monticello. After AR 35 turns west, Highway 425 has many rural junctions with county routes. Upon entering Lincoln County, the route passes the historic Mt. Zion Presbyterian Church in Relfs Bluff and the Parker House before entering Star City. Downtown, the highway forms a concurrency with Highway 11, which ends near the Lincoln County Courthouse and the Star City Commercial Historic District. The highway continues north through rural areas before intersecting US 65 in Jefferson County. US 65/US 425 run concurrent west to a high‚Äìvolume interchange with I-530/US 63/US 79/US 65B/AR 190, where US 425 terminates. History In Arkansas, US 425 replaced the southern half of Arkansas Highway 13, which was an original state highway in the area. The route is essentially the same as it was at inception in the 1926 state highway plan, connecting the major cities in its area of southeast Arkansas. Highway 13 now runs in north central Arkansas. Most of US Route 425 was repaved in 2010 within Ashley County. Louisiana Highway 137 Louisiana Highway 137 (LA 137) was a state highway in Louisiana that serves Richland Parish and Morehouse Parish. It spanned in a south to north direction. LA 137 is now signed as U.S. 425 for its entire length. From the south, LA 137 began as a state highway at an intersection with LA 15 north of Mangham in the small town of Archibald. It went north and intersected LA 584 before intersecting LA 135. Passing under I-20, LA 137 met LA 3048 in the town of Rayville. After intersecting US 80, LA 137 entered Morehouse Parish, continuing north as a two-lane road until it swapped the U.S. 425 designation with LA 133. LA 137 is a divided, four-lane highway south of Rayville, a pair of two one-way roads inside of Rayville, and an undivided, two-lane road north of Rayville. Before the 1955 renumbering, LA 137 was State Route 47 from Archibald to Rayville.

Located at the southern edge of the Auckland Region, it is in South Auckland, between the southern shore of the Manukau Harbour and the mouth of the Waikato River. The hills of Pukekohe and nearby Bombay Hills form the natural southern limit of the Auckland region. Pukekohe is located within the political boundaries of the Auckland Council, following the abolition of the Franklin District Council on 1 November 2010. With a population of Pukekohe is the 24th largest urban area in New Zealand, and the third largest in the Auckland Region behind Auckland itself and Hibiscus Coast. Pukekohe is a rural service town for the area formerly known as the Franklin District. It has a population of mainly of European descent, with significant MƒÅori and ethnic Indian and East Asian communities. There are also a notable number of people of South African and Dutch descent. The population growth from 2007 to 2008 was 2.2 percent. The fertile volcanic soil and warm moist climate supports a large horticultural and dairy farming industry; the Pukekohe long keeper onion is well known internationally.  History and culture =MƒÅori history The MƒÅori word puke-kohe means \\"hill of the kohekohe\\", New Zealand's native mahogany. During the period of the Musket Wars of 1807-1843, Northern iwi (tribes) attacked parts of the Auckland area, including Pukekohe. From the 1820s, as a result of these attacks, the resident MƒÅori population who survived mainly migrated south. The two main iwi of the area are Ngati Tamaoho and Ngati Te Ata. Waikato-Tainui has a strong presence. European settlement When European settlers arrived, the remnant MƒÅori population initially provided them with food supplies. As the number of settlers grew, the Pukekohe area, which was largely bush covered, was opened up after 1843 and individual farmers purchased small blocks of land which they cleared by hand. By 1863, the land was still bush covered but with an increasing number of small isolated farms. When Kƒ´ngitanga MƒÅori refused to swear an oath of allegiance to the Crown, many MƒÅori moved out of the area, but some remained. A MƒÅori from this area guided the first gunboats through the Waikato Heads and through the shoals of the Waikato River delta to help put down the rebel Kƒ´ngitanga uprising. New Zealand Wars A major battle of the 1863 Land Wars was fought at Pukekohe East between 11 armed settlers, who were converting the Pukekohe East church into a redoubt and approximately 200‚Äì300 MƒÅori rebels, mainly from the Waikato area. Although surprised and severely outnumbered, the settlers held off the Kƒ´ngitanga invaders until troops arrived. No settlers were killed or injured while 30 MƒÅori were killed with an unknown number wounded. 6 bodies were found near the church and 24 were later found buried in the bush. The church still exists today and the bullet holes are still visible. Although there were many other attacks on settlers in Auckland the MƒÅori preferred isolated targets. As most women and children had been evacuated to Auckland city most of those murdered were men and teenage boys. Rebels were able to hide in the pockets of bush and live off the settlers goods and livestock. Nearly the entire Pukekohe area was abandoned to the rebels apart from Military outposts. Isolated attacks occurred as late as November 1863 after the Battle of Rangiriri.The Journal of William Morgan.p78,80,83,85,89.N Morris Editor. Auckland City Council.1963.

American author William Jelani Cobb wrote of the album's significance, \\"On the heels of Paid in Full, Eric B. & Rakim delivered a full clip of album titled Follow the Leader in 1988. Featuring a broader spectrum of sounds than the James Brown samples that had defined the initial release, Follow the Leader saw Rakim at his most lyrically fierce, issuing deft and death threats on such tracks as 'Microphone Fiend,' 'Lyrics of Fury,' and the nearly felonious 'No Competition.'

Musically, the production ranges from smoother soulful tracks such as \\"In the Ghetto\\" to the hard-edged assault of the title track.

The town lies above sea-level in the foothills of the eastern Alps, by rail from the city of Udine and close to the Slovenian border. It is situated on the river Natisone, which forms a picturesque ravine here. Formerly an important regional power, it is today a quiet, small town that attracts tourists thanks to its medieval center. History Ponte del Diavolo, the Devil's Bridge Archaeological findings reveal that the area was already inhabited in Paleolithic and Neolithic times. During the Iron Age the region was settled by Veneti and Celts. Due to the location's strategic position on the northeastern frontier of Roman Italy, in 50 BC, the Romans founded there a castrum, which afterwards was transformed by Julius Caesar into a forum and its name changed into Forum Iulii (\\"Julius' marketplace\\"; Fr√©jus had the same Roman name).Joseph Bingham, Origines Ecclesiastic√¶ vol. 1 (H.G. Bohn, 1845 ) p422.Antoine Godeau, Algemeine Kirchengeschichte (Rieger, 1771 ) p 45.Robert Knaplock, The Works, Volume 1 (Robert Knaplock, 1726) p387. Not long afterward, the forum became a municipium and its citizens were inscribed in the Roman tribe Scaptia. After the destruction of Aquileia and Iulium Carnicum (Zuglio) in 452 AD, Forum Iulii became the chief town of the district of Friuli and gave its name to it. In 568 the city was the first major centre occupied by Alboin's Lombard invasion of Italy, then part of the Byzantine Empire. The city was chosen as first capital of the newly formed Lombard Kingdom, then granted by Alboin to his nephew Gisulf as the capital of a Lombard Duchy of Friuli. After the Lombards were defeated by the Franks, (774), following the last Lombard resistance under Hrodgaud of Friuli (776) Forum Julii changed its name to Civitas Austriae, Charlemagne's Italian \\"City of the East\\". Under the Carolingian settlement with the Papacy, the patriarchs of Aquileia resided here from 773 to 1031, when they returned to Aquileia, and finally in 1238 removed to Udine. This last change of residence was the origin of the antagonism between Cividale and Udine, which was only terminated by their surrender to Venice in 1419 and 1420 respectively. When the Patriarchal State of Friuli was founded in 1077, Cividale was chosen as the capital. According to James Burke, a 1331 siege of Cividale was one of the first deployments of what we would now call cannons, in the early form known as a bombard. Between July and September 1409, a church council was held at Cividale by Pope Gregory XII (Roman Obedience). It was poorly attended and achieved nothing.Carl Joseph Hefele (1916). Histoire des Conciles (ed. H. Leclercq). Tome VII, premi√®re partie. Paris: Letouzey 1916, pp. 61-64. (in French) In 1420 Cividale was annexed to the Republic of Venice. After the Napoleonic Wars Cividale became part of the Lombard-Venetian Kingdom. It was ceded to Kingdom of Italy in 1866. Main sights Piazza Paolo Diacono The historical center of the town is dominated by Piazza del Duomo, which is where the National Archaeological Museum of Cividale del Friuli is located. Close by is the Palazzo dei Provveditori Veneti, constructed in 1565 and designed by Andrea Palladio. The town is split in two by the Natisone River, which is spanned by the Devil's Bridge (15th century, rebuilt in 1918). The Celtic Hypogeum is a subterranean series of halls carved in the rock in ancient times, whose destination remains unclear: uses as either Celtic funerary monument or a Roman (Lombard) jail has been proposed. The Cathedral (Duomo) was built in the 15th century over a pre- existing construction built in the 8th century. It is a Venetian Gothic building, finished in the 16th century by architect Pietro Lombardo, featuring interventions from the 18th century also. The interior houses an altar dedicated to the Madonna, in the right aisle, and the altarpiece of patriarch Pellegrino II (1195‚àí1204), a silver retable which had been inscribed in Latin by the means of individual letter punches,Brekle, Herbert E.: Die typographische Herstellungstechnik der Inschriften auf dem silbernen Altaraufsatz im Dom von Cividale, Regensburg 2011 250 years before the invention of modern movable type printing by Johannes Gutenberg.; The Christian Museum annexed to the Duomo houses outstanding examples of Lombard sculpture. It contains some interesting relics of the art of the 8th century. The cathedral contains an octagonal marble canopy with sculptures in relief, with a font below it belonging to the 8th century, but altered later. The high altar has a fine silver altar front of 1185. The museum contains various Roman and Lombard antiquities, and works of art in gold, silver and ivory formerly belonging to the cathedral chapter. The fine 15th-century Ponte del Diavolo leads to the church of S. Martino, which contains an altar of the 8th century with reliefs executed by order of the Lombard king Ratchis. The small church of Oratorio di Santa Maria in Valle (also known as Lombard Temple), next to the Natisone river, is a notable example of High Middle Ages art sometimes attributed to the 8th century, but probably later. Included in the old Lombard quarter, it was probably used as Palatine Chapel by the Lombard dukes and king's functionaries. The fine decorations, statues and stuccoes (11th or 12th century) housed in the interior, show a strong Byzantine influence. In the collegiata, the altarpiece of Pellegrinus II (1195‚àí1204) is a silver retable which had been inscribed in Latin by the means of individual letter punches, 250 years before the invention of modern movable type printing by Johannes Gutenberg.; On 25 June 2011 a part of the historical centre of Cividale (the one belonging to the Lombards era) entered the UNESCO heritage list. Other attractions The town has a number of small osterias which serve distinctive local wines. Of particular note are Tocai friulano, Verduzzo and Refosco dal peduncolo rosso. Transport The town is easily accessible by rail and bus from Udine and by bus from Gorizia.

The division was raised in March 1916 and was assigned to the I ANZAC Corps. On establishment, it consisted of four brigades comprising three Australian light horse and one New Zealand mounted rifles, supported by British horse artillery. In 1917, one of the Australian brigades was replaced by a British yeomanry brigade. After April 1917, the standard order of battle was reduced to two Australian brigades and one New Zealand brigade, although the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade and other British mounted brigades were temporarily attached several times during operations. The division had two wartime commanders; the first was the Australian Major-General Harry Chauvel, who had commanded the 1st Light Horse Brigade at Gallipoli. When Chauvel was promoted to command the Desert Columnof which the division was parthe was replaced by the New Zealander Major-General Edward Chaytor from the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, who remained in command for the rest of the war. Post-war, Brigadier- General Granville Ryrie commanded the division from December 1918 until it was disbanded in June 1919. In December 1915, the brigades that would form the ANZAC Mounted Division were evacuated from the Gallipoli Campaign and became part of the British Empire's Egyptian Expeditionary Force. In March 1916, after raising the division served, as the mounted formation, in the I ANZAC Corps. Then subsequently served under the command of Eastern Force for most of 1916. The division served in the Desert Column from the end of 1916 until mid-1917, when the column was expanded and renamed the Desert Mounted Corps. The division fought and won almost all the major battles across the Sinai Peninsula during 1916, and the following year it fought from Gaza to Jerusalem in southern Palestine. In 1918, it took part in the Jordan Valley operations, the raid on Amman, the raid on Es Salt and the final advance to Amman and Ziza, part of the Battle of Megiddo. During which the division formed the main part of Chaytor's Forcewhich captured 10,300 men from the Turkish Fourth Army. Etymology The division is variously referred to in sources as the Australian and New Zealand Mounted Division,Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 156 (abbreviated to the A. & N. Z. Mounted Division),Bou 2010a, p.150 the ANZAC Mounted Division, or the Anzac Mounted Division.Gullett, contents pageBou 2010b, p. 10 Formation history Prior to formation, units that would form the division's brigades served as part of the Force in Egypt from December 1914, and then in the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, from May to December 1915, during the Gallipoli Campaign. At Gallipoli, the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Light Horse Brigades and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade served dismounted in the New Zealand and Australian Division. Them returned to Egypt where the ANZAC Mounted Division was formed in March 1916;Gullett, p.57 and assigned to the I ANZAC Corps as its mounted formation. The first mounted or cavalry division to serve with the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF).Badsey, p.250 The brigades consisted of three regiments, each with an establishment of twenty-five officers and 497 other ranks serving in three squadrons, of six troops.Gullett, p.54 Not all the division's troops came from Australia and New Zealand; the artillery units, with 18-pounders,Powles, p.12 and the Divisional Ammunition Column were provided by the British Royal Horse Artillery from the Territorial Force. The brigade's four batteries were each allocated to a fighting brigade. The 1st Light Horse Brigade had the Leicestershire Battery; the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, the Ayrshire Battery; the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, the Inverness-shire Battery, and the Somerset Battery was attached to the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade.Gullett, p.68 To replace the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, which had been assigned to the Imperial Mounted Division in January 1917, the British 22nd Mounted Brigade joined the division from February to July 1917.Perry, pp.51‚Äì52 Serving alongside them were several smaller support units, which included an engineer field squadron, a signal squadron, and a divisional train.Preston, p.331 The first General Officer Commanding (GOC) Major-General Harry Chauvel, appointed 16 March, was promoted from brigade commander, although he had temporarily commanded the 1st Australian Division for a short period at Gallipoli. His Chief-of Staff was Lieutenant-Colonel John Gilbert Browne of 14th (King's) Hussars, a professional from the British Army who had fought in the Second Boer War and with the British Cavalry Division, on the Western Front in the early stages of the war. The rest of the division's staff were selected on merit for their service at Gallipoli. The same process was applied to select the brigade staff, and regimental and squadron officersmost of whom had seen prior service at Gallipoli or in the Second Boer War.Gullett, p.59 Service history=Sinai On 15 March, the ANZAC Mounted Division relieved the 1st Australian Division, on the front line. Members of the division carried out their first offensive action, crossing the Suez Canal, in the Jifjafa raid between 11 and 14 April 1916, resulting in the campaign's first Australian death.Gullett, p.71Gullett, p.72 Later the same month, the 2nd and the New Zealand Brigades were moved into the Sinai Desert in response to the defeat at Katia of the 5th Mounted Brigade.Gullett, p.89Powles, p.14 By the end of the month, the division had been established around Romani in the Sinai.Gullett, p.91 Here the brigade machine-gun squadrons were formed; each had eight officers and 222 other ranks, with twelve Maxim guns carried on pack horses. These replaced the two guns that had previously been part of each regiment's establishment. In their place, the regiments were issued with three Lewis guns; these were replaced the following year by twelve Hotchkiss machine- guns.Gullett, p.120 On 19 July, reconnaissance aircraft located between 8‚Äì9,000 Turkish soldiers approaching the division's prepared positions. By 3 August, this number had increased to around 18,000 infantry with artillery support.Gullett, p.141 The Battle of Romani was the division's first major victory.Gullett, p.159 The advance to contact without infantry support,Powles 1922 p. 34Bruce 2002 p. 46 which began the next day, was defeated at Bir el Abd by a stronger Turkish force.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 p. 196 In September, the division was involved in a \\"reconnaissance in force\\" to Mazar, east of Romani. They were discovered en route by German aircraft and the although the operation failed, it persuaded Turkish commanders to evacuate the position two days later.Gullett, pp.197‚Äì199 On 11 November, the division was ordered to move east towards Masaid and El Arish on the coast. The division entered the latter on 21 December to find the Turkish garrison had withdrawn.Gullett, pp.206, 209 The next day, Lieutenant-General Philip Chetwode, commanding the Desert Column, arrived and ordered the divisionsupported by the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade (ICCB) to attack Magdhaba.Gullett, p.214 Travelling overnight, most of the division was in position by dawn 23 December. Using the additional strength of the camel brigade, and at times fighting hand to hand, Chauvel's attack on Magdhaba was the division's second victory. Turkish casualties were ninety-seven dead, three hundred wounded and 1,282 prisoners, while the division's were twenty-three dead and 124 wounded.Gullett, pp.216‚Äì227 On 8 January 1917, the division, still with the ICCB under command, continued the advance towards the pre-war Egypt-Palestine border at Rafa.Gullett, p.230 They moved from El Arish to Rafa overnight and by 07:00 they were ready for the assault to begin. The Battle of Rafa, although harder fought, became the division's third victory. Total casualties were seventy-one dead and 415 wounded for the division and the 5th Mounted Brigade who were also involved. Against this, Turkish casualties were two hundred dead, 168 wounded and 1,434 prisoners.Gullett, pp.231‚Äì243 Gaza Lighthorseman, horse, and their equipment In February 1917, just before the division moved forward to take part in the first battle for Gaza, the British 22nd Mounted Brigadea yeomanry brigade from the Territorial Forcejoined the division.Perry, p.51 The first reconnaissance of the Turkish position at Gaza was carried out by the 3rd Light Horse Brigade on 25 March. The rest of the Desert Column moved forward that night. British intelligence had estimated that Gaza garrison comprised around four thousand troops, with their nearest reinforcements away. In fact they had around 15,000 troops based within of Gaza.Gullett, pp.263‚Äì265 The division's objective was to circle the town to the east and provide a screen against a counter-attack from the north.Powles, p.87 At 02:30 on 26 March, the division moved out; by 06:00, ground fogwhich had covered the infantry and mounted advancelifted and they were discovered by a Turkish patrol. The division's nearest troops charged the Turks and came upon an airfield where two German aircraft took off, turned and attacked the mounted troops. The division responded; one squadron per regiment dismounted and returned fire. By sunrise, the division was behind the Turkish lines and engaged in several skirmishes. During the light horse advance to the coast north of Gaza, the Turkish GOC responsible for the Gaza defences was taken prisoner.Gullett, pp.266‚Äì269 The 53rd (Welsh) Division had been responsible for the attack on the town; by 13:00, they had not made much progress and were held down by strong defences. The ANZAC Mounted Division was ordered at 15:15 to prepare for a dismounted assault. Chauvel completed his concentration within an hour. Then, fighting hand to hand and using their bayonets, the division reached the outskirts of the town. The New Zealand and the 2nd Light Horse Brigades entered the town from the north and west. At 18:00, Lieutenant General Charles Macpherson Dobell, GOC Eastern Force, and Chetwode agreed to call off the attack towards nightfall, due to their belief that there was a lack of progress, and the approaching threat from Turkish reinforcements.Gullett, pp.271‚Äì282Powles, p.94 According to Gullett, the error in that decision can perhaps be demonstrated by the lack of any Turkish intervention to the division's regrouping and withdrawal back to their own lines.Gullett, p.284 At 21:30, the Turkish reinforcements were still several miles away; one group confronted by the 3rd Light Horse Brigade immediately stopped advancing. In Chetwode's post-action report, he says that the time taken for the division to regroup was caused by them retrieving their wounded from inside Gaza.Gullett, p.286 British wireless operators intercepted a Turkish Army message from Gaza, timed at 19:45, reporting that their position had been lost.Gullett, p.289 The failure at Gaza resulted in the Turkish Army building a long defence line between Gaza and Beersheba, defended by 20‚Äì25,000 troops.Gullett, p. 298 Dobell's plan for the second battle required his infantry to assault Gaza itself while the mounted forces would operate on their right flank, to force the Turkish troops towards Beersheba, hinder the movement of reinforcements from there to Gaza, and prepare to pursue any retreating Turkish forces.Gullett, p.301 Preliminary manoeuvring began on 16 April and the main attack would start the next day. At 02:00, the division was in position at Shellal.Gullett, p. 303 Reconnaissance patrols convinced Chauvel they would be unable to break through the Ottoman line without infantry support. The main infantry battle began at 07:15 on 19 April following a two-hour bombardment, with the division deployed to attack Sausage Ridge on the extreme right of the three British infantry division's assault at Gaza.Gullett, pp. 304‚Äì316 The division suffered severe casualties while it was comparatively inactive during the infantry attacks. However, during the previous night of 18/19 April, Chauvelunder orders not to make a dismounted attackmoved towards the Hareira Redoubt to protect the army's right.Gullett, pp. 328‚Äì329 In the morning of 19 April, the 1st and 3rd Light Horse Brigades advanced without opposition. However, by mid-afternoon they were confronted by around one thousand Turkish cavalrymen, whom they fought off with rifle, machine-gun and artillery fire. By 20 April, the attack had halted in a decisive victory for the Turkish forces. The attack cost the British 5,900 casualties, but only 105 of those were from the divisionGullett, pp. 330‚Äì334 the fewest of any involved.Powles, p.105 The second GOC Major-General Edward Chaytor This second failure resulted in the recall of Murray and the appointment of General Edmund Allenby to command the EEF. When Chauvel had been promoted to command the Desert Column, he was replaced as GOC by Chaytor who had commanded the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade.Gullett, p. 335 Other changes resulted in the division losing the 3rd Light Horse Brigade to the new Imperial Mounted Division, and the Yeomanry Mounted Division was also raised.Powles, p. 109 This enabled the three divisions to rotate monthly from the front line to resting, to carry out training during a period of inaction.Gullett, p.344 During May, the 1st Light Horse Brigade and divisional engineers were involved in a raid on the Turkish railway line running south of Beersheba towards the frontier with Egypt, while the other two brigades moved forward in support.Gullett, pp. 351‚Äì352 Beersheba On 24 October, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade moved forward to Asluj to screen the advance of the ANZAC and the Australian Mounted Divisions.Gullett, pp.373‚Äì378 On 31 October, Beersheba was captured after the town was attacked by two infantry and two mounted divisions. The 1st Light Horse and the New Zealand Brigades made a combined attack on Tel el Saba, after the 2nd Light Horse Brigade had cut the road north from Beersheba to Hebron. At 15:00 the same day, the New Zealanders attacked and captured with 132 prisoners and four machine-guns with a bayonet charge, while the retreating Turkish soldiers were pursued by the 1st Light Horse Brigade. Chaytor's troops were now in possession of Tel el Saba.Gullett, pp.389‚Äì391Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 55 At 15:30, orders were issued for the final assault on Beersheba; the 1st Light Horse Brigade was tasked with capturing a line from a prominent mound outside to the Beersheba mosque.Gullett, p.392 Beersheba was finally taken following a mounted infantry charge by the 4th Light Horse Brigade.Preston, p.30 Capturing the remainder of Gaza line On 1 November, the division was ordered to push the 1st Light Horse and the New Zealand Brigades further north of Beersheba towards Tel el Khuweilfe with the 2nd Light Horse Brigade moved towards Dhaheriye on their right. The troops moving north skirmished with Ottoman cavalry then occupied a position between the Makhrune well and Towal Abu Jerwal, capturing four machine-guns and 180 prisoners.Gullett, pp. 408‚Äì9, 412 Overnight, the 1st Light Horse Brigade was ordered towards Tel el Khuweilfe, moving between the 2nd Light Horse Brigade on their right and the 7th Mounted Brigade to the left. When they reached the British line they relieved the yeomanry and at 11:00 they fought off a counter-attack by two Turkish infantry companies. They remained in the line until 16:00 when the 53rd (Welsh) Division and the 5th Mounted Brigade relieved them. During these first two days of fighting, water was in short supply and each brigade was relieved in turn to march back to water. This continued until 5 November when the 2nd Light Horse Brigade and the New Zealand Brigade's were ordered back to Beersheba.Gullett, pp.415‚Äì418 By 7 November, the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades were located to the west of Sheria, while the New Zealand Brigade remained temporarily attached to the 53rd (Welsh) Division, which was still fighting at Khuweilfe. Later that day, during the breakthrough of the old Gaza to Beersheba line, the ANZAC Mounted Division advanced to Ameida where the 1st Light Horse Brigade captured an ammunition supply train, a field hospital, a large quantity of stores and 391 prisoners. At 12:30, news of the fall of Gaza reached Chaytor and he was ordered towards Jemmameh, to cut off the retreating Turkish forces, capturing the village of Dilakh in the process. Here the 2nd Light Horse Brigade was ordered to attack; the 5th Light Horse Regiment galloped the through exploding shells to capture part of the village, which they held through the night. The guns shelling them were located nearby; at dawn the following day they secured the rest of the village and captured the guns. Chaytor's plans to advance depended on the Australian Mounted Division moving up to join them, but by 16:30 on 7 November, they were still engaged in fighting at Hareira and Sheria and their horses had not been watered for some time.Gullett, pp.437‚Äì438 Early on 8 November, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade occupied a line from the Nejile mound to the Wadi Hesi and an hour later the 7th Mounted Brigadestill attached to the divisionarrived as reinforcements. As the division advanced, they saw retreating Ottoman soldiers and at 15:00 the 1st Light Horse Brigade captured Jemmameh and its water supply. Positioned beyond the village, the 5th and 7th Light Horse Regiments were attacked by between five and seven thousand men, supported by artillery. The attack lasted the remainder of the day but petered out overnight.Gullett, pp.439‚Äì441 By the evening of 8 November, all the Turkish positions on the Gaza-Beersheba line had been captured and the Turkish Army was withdrawing northwards.Powles, p.145 Judean plain alt=large columns of horses in an arid, hilly landscape After watering their horses overnight on 8/9 November, the division was the only mounted force ready to move by morning. At 06:00, Chaytor ordered the advance onto the Judean plain; the 1st Light Horse Brigade on the left rode towards Simsim and the 2nd Light Horse Brigade on the right towards Bureir, with the 7th Mounted Brigade as reserve. Several large groups of Turkish soldiers were captured without resistance; however during the day, opposition increased as the two withdrawing Turkish armies became more organised. In the face of machine-gun and artillery fire the village of Bureir, along with two howitzers and stores, were captured. Continuing their advance, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade bypassed Huleikat and headed towards Kaukabah, capturing 110 wagons and 390 prisoners. Having outdistanced their lines of communication, the brigade waited in the village under shellfire for three hours for their supply trains to reach them. Then, sighting a convoy at Kustine, the brigade galloped through machine-gun and artillery fire to capture another one hundred wagons and three hundred prisoners. Turkish artillery opened fire on them but the brigade was ordered to hold its ground. Just after dark. part of the 7th Light Horse Regiment was attacked by Turkish infantry; but a Turkish speaking light horse officer convinced them they were surrounded and 230 men surrendered. Brigadier-General Granville Ryrie, GOC 2nd Light Horse Brigade, was conscious of his troops exposed position and ordered a withdrawal to Es Suafir el Gharbiye, during which they skirmished with Turkish infantry and captured another four howitzers at Ebdis.Gullett, pp.449‚Äì453 On 10 November, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade was relieved by the 75th Division and moved to Hamame on the coast for three days rest.Gullett, p.457 On the other flank, at 09:00, the 1st Light Horse Brigade entered Bureir unopposed and continued on, arriving at Mejdel at 14:00 and capturing 164 prisoners. Beit Duras was held in strength so brigade headed for the coast, stopping for the night south of Esdud. On 10 November, they moved on Esdudthe ancient Ashdodopposed by Turkish cavalry to the north and east of the town. By 10:00, they had secured the Jisr Esdud stone bridge over the Wadi Sukereir in front of the village. However, they were confronted by a strong Turkish defence line stretching from Beit Duras to El Butani el Gharbiye and to the mouth of the Wadi Sukereir. Not having the numbers to break the line, the brigade dug in to wait for the infantry to catch up.Gullett, pp.456‚Äì457 On 11 November, the brigade left Esdud to secure the area along the Wadi Sukereir between the bridge and the sea. They subsequently located an ample supply of fresh water and a beach suitable for landing supplies from the sea. The 2nd Light Horse Regiment advanced towards the bridge, while the 1st Light Horse Regiment moved to the left and at Burka they established a line of defence along the Wadi el Khubb facing north-east. Under fire, the 2nd Light Horse Regiment crossed the bridge and gradually forced the Turkish rearguard back. By nightfall, they had occupied the Tel el Murre mound and established a substantial bridgehead over the Sukereir at the Esdud bridge towards Burkha.Gullett, pp.466‚Äì467 New Zealand Brigade headquarters outside Jaffa On 12 November, the 156th (Scottish Rifles) Brigade attacked Burkhawith the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Regiments in support to their leftusing their machine-guns to enfilade the Turkish rearguard trenches. The next day, the 1st and the New Zealand Brigades followed behind the Yeomanry Mounted Division, supporting their advance on Yebna to reach the mouth of the Wadi Rubin.Gullett, pp.467‚Äì471 On 14 November, the division resumed their advance. The New Zealanders on the left headed towards Jaffa, reaching the Wadi Hanein before meeting any opposition. The 1st Light Horse Brigade, on the right, headed towards Ramleh; they reached Deiran unopposed but saw Turkish troops heading towards the New Zealand Brigade. At 12:00, the New Zealanders were engaged with German machine-gun and rifle fire from a strongly defended line at Ayun Kara. During the following Battle of Ayun Kara, the Wellington Mounted Rifles put in a bayonet charge, capturing two machine-guns and killing twenty defenders. The Auckland Mounted Rifles to their left could not break through the German rearguard, which was being rapidly reinforced. While they were being shelled at 14:30, the regiment was attacked by 1,500 troops. The Auckland Mounted Rifles commanding officer requested urgent reinforcements and a squadron from the Wellington Mounted Rifles was sent to assist. By 16:00, the Turkish rearguard had advanced close enough for a bayonet and grenade charge, which the Auckland Mounted Rifles managed to hold, forcing the attackers to withdraw leaving 162 dead and a large number of wounded behind. New Zealand casualties were twenty-one dead and eighty-eight wounded.Gullett, pp.474‚Äì475 On 15 November, the division's reconnaissance patrols reported the way ahead was clear. They resumed their advance led by the 1st Light Horse Brigade, which reached Ramleh at 11:00 unopposed.Gullett, pp.476‚Äì477 The 1st Light Horse Regiment moved ahead to reach Lydda further north, where reports of Turkish soldiers nearby were received. Lieutenant-Colonel Cecil Granville in command ordered two troops to investigate, and forty troopers rode out to locate them and charged a hostile column while under artillery and machine-gun fire. They captured four machine-guns, 297 Turkish and two German soldiers, and sustained one dead and six wounded.Gullett, pp.480‚Äì481 On their left, the New Zealand Brigade reached Rishon LeZion and continued towards Jaffa but was ordered to halt a few miles short of the port by EEF GHQ. The following morning, the Wellington Mounted Rifles was ordered to send reconnaissance patrols towards Jaffa. Meeting no resistance, the patrols rode into the city, which had been evacuated; Chaytor told Allenby that the city had been taken. Other reconnaissance patrols were sent to the River Auju, which was found to be wide and up to deep. Three crossing points were found; a shallow ford near the river mouth, a second crossing near a dam over a bridge at Khurbet Hadra, and a third crossing was located at a watermill beside Jerisheh. On the opposite bank Turkish infantry could be clearly seen digging defences.Gullett, pp.481‚Äì482 River Auja Bridge over the River Auja, north-east of Jaffa While the main effort of the EEF headed north-west towards Jerusalem, by 20 November the division had established a line of observation posts along the River Auja a few miles north of Jaffa, stretching from Nalin at its eastern end, through Budrus and El Yehudiyeh, then along higher ground south of the Sheik Abu ex Zeitun mound and to the coast. When the 54th (East Anglian) Division and the ICCB arrived, the 1st Brigade was sent to the rear to rest at Yebna. The next day, the New Zealanders were relieved by the 161st (Essex) Brigade, but remained near the front ready for an assault on the river crossings. During this time, mounted patrols advanced to the three crossings and the nearby villages but met with strong resistance. On 24 November, following a bombardment of the Turkish defensive line, the Canterbury Mounted Rifles forced a crossing at the river mouth ford, defeated a small party of Turkish soldiers and occupied Sheikh Muannis.Powles, p.161Gullett, p.497 They were followed across by the Wellington Mounted Rifles, which moved through the Canterbury Mounted Rifles to capture the Khurbet Hadrah bridge. Once the bridge was secured, they were relieved by an infantry battalion, which took over the defences while a squadron of the Canterbury Mounted Rifles guarded the ford and the Auckland Mounted Rifles advanced in front of the infantry holding the bridge. At dawn on 25 November, a Turkish force of around one thousand men attacked the Auckland Mounted Rifles, which was forced to withdraw back to the infantry positions. At the same time, the Canterbury Mounted Rifles counter-attacked the Turkish right but the determined Turkish attackers forced the New Zealand Brigade and infantry back across the Auja.Powles, p.162Gullett, p.498 On 27 November, further Turkish advances forced the 4th (ANZAC) Battalion ICCB and the 2nd Brigade back from their position on the right. Over the next few days, trench raids were carried out by both sides, lasting until 7 December when the division handed over their sector of the front to the 52nd (Lowland) Division. The 1st and 2nd Brigades were withdrawn to the rear but the New Zealand Brigade remained at the front in reserve.Powles, p.166Gullett, pp.499‚Äì503 Jericho 3rd Light Horse Regiment outside Bethlehem In February 1918, the divisionless the 2nd Light Horse Brigadewas attached to the XX Corps for the advance into the Jordan Valley. During the advance across the Judean Hills and down into the valley to the Dead Sea, the division was tasked with holding the right flank south from Bethlehem and outflank any Turkish defenders confronting the advance.Gullett, p.526 The British advance started on 14 February; five days later the division was established at El Muntar, west of the Dead Sea. Early on 20 February, the New Zealand Brigade conducted dismounted assaults on the hills Jebel el Kahmum and Tubk el Kaneiterah east of Bethlehem. Both hills were heavily defended and covered by artillery and machine-guns.Powles, p.176 They found the going heavy and the Turkish defenders did not pull back until the hills were outflanked by the 60th (London) Division advancing to the north. Just after 14:00, the two divisions were closing in on the Jordan Valley when a troop from the 1st Light Horse Regiment reached the valley floor. They were soon followed by the remainder of the 1st Light Horse Brigade, with orders to advance north to the Wadi Jofet Zeben. Plans were formed for a joint attack on Nebi Musa, but the Turkish defenders withdrew that night. Instead the 1st Light Horse Brigade headed for Jericho, and at 08:00 the 3rd Light Horse Regiments entered the town virtually unopposed. The brigade pushed on towards the River Jordan and the bridge at Ghoraniye, and by nightfall the two brigades' and the division's artillery were positioned around the bridge. They were relieved the next day by the infantry and arrived back at Bethlehem in the early hours of 23 February.Gullett, pp.538‚Äì541Powles, p.185 The division left the Auckland Mounted Rifles, with a subsection of machine guns and an artillery batteryunder command of the 60th Divisionin the Jordan Valley holding a strong position where the road from Jerusalem falls into the valley.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 309Moore 1921, p. 103Powles 1922 p. 184 Amman Raid / Bridging the River Jordan The division's next operation was a raid on Amman, east-north-east of Jericho, by the division, with the ICCB attached, supported by the 60th Division.Powles, p.190 Heavy rain delayed the operation for several days but by 20 March, the weather improved and the level of the flooded River Jordan dropped. The Turks and the swift river thwarted British bridging units from crossing on the direct route to Amman at Ghoraniye. But further downstream at Hajla, on the night of 21‚Äì22 March, D Field Troop, Australian engineers, commanded by Captain E.J. Howells, with help from the 3rd Light Horse, rafted over infantry from the 23rd Battalion of Londoners, and then forced the first bridge across the Jordan, At 04:00 the morning of the 23rd, the Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment crossed the bridge, turned north and attacked the rear of the Turkish troops that were preventing the crossing at Ghoraniye. By midday, the Aucklanders had secured the east bank and captured four machine- guns and sixty-eight prisoners, allowing the British to bridge the river there.Gullett, pp.552‚Äì554 New Zealand Mounted Rifles crossing the River Jordan The rest of the division crossed the river during the night. The 1st Light Horse Brigade, providing flank protection for 60th Division, went north to locate the track to Es Salt,Gullett, p.556 which is north-east of Jericho but at an altitude higher.Powles, p.193 Leading the remainder of the force, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade advanced to Amman in the east.Gullett, pp.556‚Äì558 At 11:00, several hundred Turkish cavalry were sighted east of the 2nd Light Horse Brigade. The GOC Ryrie and the 6th Light Horse Regiment attempted to cut them off but they escaped in the rugged terrain. At 15:00, the brigade regrouped and set out for the Hekr spring on the plain. Finding the tracks unsuitable for wheeled transport, the division's artillery and supply train had to remain behind. This caused a delay while essential stores were transferred to camels. The advance resumed at 21:30; at times the troopers had to dismount and lead their horses along the tracks, through heavy rain which began to fall at 02:00 on 25 March.Gullett, pp.559‚Äì560 The first troops reached Ain el Hekr at 04:00 and waited for the rest of the division to arrive, and at 19:30 the 2nd Light Horse Brigade moved out again across the plateau. Even on the flat progress was slow, the camels slipping in the rain and the wet conditions, slowed the horsemen.Gullett, pp.560‚Äì563 Soon after observing a Turkish convoy in the distance, the 5th Light Horse Regiment was ordered to attack. The convoy of nineteen lorries, three cars, one armoured car and several other vehicles was captured along with twelve prisoners. Another patrol from the 6th Light Horse Regiment captured sixty-one prisoners at Suweile. Just before dawn, the 7th Light Horse Regiment leading met up with the New Zealand Brigade, which had travelled independently via the Shunet Nimrin road. The New Zealanders route had been easier than that used by the main force. Chaytor, aware that his men had not rested for three days and nights, postponed the assault for twenty-four hours.Powles, p.199 During this rest period, on the night of 26 March Chaytor ordered the railway lines north and south of Amman to be cut to prevent any escape or reinforcement by rail. The New Zealanders destroyed a section of rail long to the south, while the 2nd Light Horse Brigade was confronted by Turkish cavalry and could not reach the northern rail line. Early on 27 March the division advanced to Amman, supported by a four-gun lightweight mountain artillery battery from the ICCB.Gullett, p.563 At Amman, the Turkish Army had four thousand infantry in well-constructed defences dug in along the heights, looking down on the division. Supported by fifteen artillery pieces and machine-guns, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade to the right were to cross the Wadi Amman and assault the hills between Amman and the railway station. The 1st and 2nd Battalions, ICCB would assault Amman from the front while the 2nd Light Horse Brigade to their left would circle around north and approach Amman from the rear. The New Zealand Brigade met with heavy machine-gun fire and were not in position to attack until 15:00. The 2nd Light Horse Brigade dismounted just under from Amman and approached on foot. Advancing through shell and machine- gun fire, the brigade reached within of the village before they were forced to withdraw. It was the same with the camel battalions; in the face of heavy machine-gun fire they were also stopped. On the right, the New Zealanders attack also failed, and during the afternoon they observed a train arriving from the south, which a prisoner confirmed contained three hundred reinforcements. During that night, the New Zealand Brigade stopped a Turkish bayonet charges.Gullett, pp.564‚Äì566Powles, pp.200‚Äì201 The Imperial Camel Corps Brigade artillery battery that supported the division at Amman While this was going on, at 15:00 the Wellington Mounted Rifles and the 4th (ANZAC) Battalion ICCB were destroying of railway line and several culverts to the south- east.Powles, p.202 That night, the 5th Light Horse Regiment was sent north of Amman to destroy a railway bridge. Amman was now cut off from reinforcements by rail but the previous day's fighting convinced Chaytor that his force was not strong enough to take Amman alone.Gullett, p.567 To their north the 1st Light Horse Brigade and 60th Division had captured Es Salt and were defending it against counter-attacks. The GOC 60th Division, Major-General John Shea, ordered the 181st (2/6th London) Brigade and two batteries of mountain guns to Amman. After they arrived early on 28 March, Chaytor decided to attack again. The assault began at 13:00 and was again defeated by heavy gunfire.Powles, p.203Gullett, pp.568‚Äì570 On 29 March, having repaired the railway track, a train of Turkish reinforcement arrived at Amman from the north. Chaytor decided to order a night attack and at 02:00 on 30 March, the division attacked and had some success, but eight hours later, by 10:00 it was clear the attack would not succeed. But it was not until four hours later, soon after 14:00, it was decided to call off the battle and return to the Jordan valley.Gullett, pp.573‚Äì577 The division's casualties, including the ICCB, were heavy128 dead, 551 wounded and fifty-five missing, which was 248 more than those of the much larger 60th Division.Gullett, p.584 The division captured 615 prisoners, ten machine-guns, two field kitchens, twenty-six lorries, five cars, several horse-drawn wagons and the New Zealanders captured an aeroplane. During the battle, the division fired over 587,000 rounds of small arms ammunition (SAA).Powles, p.216 Ghoraniye bridge-head On 2 April, Chaytor was given command of the Jordan Valley defences, consisting of the division, the ICCB, two batteries of 4.5-inch howitzers and two heavier 60-pounders. The 1st Light Horse Brigade, with the 5th Light Horse Regiment attached, was established on the east bank of the Jordan River. The ICCB, with the 6th and 7th Light Horse Regiments attached, was holding a line at Abu Tellul and stretching along the Wadi Mellahah. Daily the defenders saw Turkish patrols but were not attacked, and the division spent their days digging trenches, stringing barbed wire and siting machine-guns.Gullett, p.586 The New Zealand Brigade was further west in the valley between Jericho and the Jordan river.Powles, p.217 5th Light Horse Regiment defending the Ghoraniye bridge- head Then on 11 April the defences on the Wadi Nimrin and in the hills at Musallabeh were attacked by a large Turkish force.Powles, p.218 A patrol from the 2nd Light Horse Regiment discovered a Turkish unit of around 100 men, on the left bank of the Wadi Nimrin at 04:30. By dawn there were one thousand infantrymen approaching, in waves about long, on both sides of the wadi.Gullett, p.588 They got to within of the barbed wire defences before the division's guns opened fire. By now the Turkish force was estimated at two thousand men. At 13:00 Brigadier-General Charles Frederick Cox GOC 1st Light Horse Brigade ordered the 1st and 3rd Light Horse Regiments to ride out and encircle them. But their strength, in men and machine-guns, was such that the mounted troopers could not approach them. Sporadic firing continued all night but by 04:00 12 April the Turkish force had withdrawn.Gullett, p.590 Turkish casualties were fifty-one dead, 550 wounded and ninety unwounded prisoners. The brigade had seven dead and seventeen wounded.Gullett, p.591 At Musallabeh to the north at 04:30 the crossing was subjected to a heavy artillery barrage, with infantry following close behind. At 05:00 the barrage lifted and the Turkish infantry attack the outnumbered ICCB, and attached light horse regiments. For the next three hours at close quarters a fire fight ensued. At 08:00 the attack petered out, but the defenders were still subjected to sniper and artillery fire. Another attack in the afternoon also failed, and they withdrew leaving 170 dead. The ICCB and light horse casualties were eighteen dead and twenty-seven wounded.Gullett, pp.591‚Äì592 Es Salt raid German prisoners taken during the raid escorted by the ANZAC Mounted Division and the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade. On 18 April, the division crossed the Jordan valley to attack the Turkish troops at Shunet Nimrin in the nearby foot-hills. Their orders were \\"to inflict losses on the enemy and to convey the impression that we are about to advance again to Amman\\".Gullett, p.596 The brigades, supported by artillery and armoured cars, were confronted by strong Turkish defences and that night withdrew back across the river. The incursion was ordered by Allenby; the result was the Turkish sending reinforcements to the area and strengthening their defences. Two days later, Chaytor received orders for another attack across the Jordan on Shunet Nimrin and Es Salt.Gullett, p.599 This time, commanded by Chauvel, the division would be again joined by the 60th Division, and by the Australian Mounted Division, the ICCB, the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade and the 20th Indian Brigade.Preston, pp.154‚Äì155 The division, less the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, was to support the 60th Division in a minor role.Gullett, pp.601‚Äì602 The force crossed the Jordan overnight on 29/30 April.Preston, p.157 The division supported the 60th Division's, assaults on Shunet Nimrin, but they could not break the Turkish position. Shea the GOC 60th Division used the ANZAC brigades on his flanks, but they were prevented from getting forward by the strong defences in the rugged terrain. All except a squadron from the 6th Light Horse Regiment attached to the 179th (2/4th London) Brigade.Gullett, pp.608‚Äì609 Elsewhere, the force was involved in heavy fighting against strong Turkish defences; during a counter-attack it lost more than two batteries of artillery, which was captured by the advancing Turkish soldiers.Gullett, pp.621‚Äì622 On 1 May, 60th Division was supposed to attack Shunet Nimrin again but failures elsewhere caused the assault to be cancelled. Instead, the Australian Mounted Division which had advanced to occupy Es Salt, sent the 5th Mounted Brigade to attack Shunet Nimrin from the rear. To assist them, the 1st Light Horse Brigade was sent to cut off any retreat from there northwards. The Australian attack faltered, partly in response to Turkish successes in the west, and by 20:00 they were still stationary. Another frontal assault by 60th (London) Division at 02:00 on 2 May also failed; by now the British position was turning more to defence than attack. In the three days since crossing the Jordan valley, the force had been involved in almost continuous fighting. On 3 May, yet another frontal attack by 60th Division failed and the ANZAC Division covering the flanks were confronted by growing numbers of Turkish troops. At 16:00 on 3 May, with an acceptance of the need to save his command, Chauvel ordered a withdrawal back from Es Salt to the Jordan valley.Gullett, pp.624‚Äì630 The last unit to cross back across the Jordan was the New Zealand Brigade, leaving the Auckland and Wellington Mounted Rifles as the east bank guard force, along with the Ghoraniyeh bridgehead.Powles, p.222 The operation failed in its objectives, only resulting in the capture of one thousand prisoners. Casualties for the two mounted divisions were comparability light at fifty dead and 310 wounded, while the 60th Division suffered 1,116 casualties.Gullett, p.634 Summer in the Jordan Valley New Zealand Brigade patrol in the Jordan Valley. In normal times, no one lived in the Jordan Valley during the warmer months of the year; the residents of Jericho left the village for the cooler hills. The residents said it was impossible for Europeans to live there after April. To prevent the Turkish Army from re- occupying the valley, Allenby had to keep a defence force in place.Gullett, p.638 To that end, the division patrolled the southern sector, which included Ghoraniye and the Dead Sea. The division was reinforced by the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade and the 181st (2/6th London) Brigade.Gullett, p.639 The infantry held the Ghoraniye bridgehead on the eastern side of the Jordan river.Gullett, p.640 Because of the severe climate, there was little daylight activity during the summer. Patrols would normally be sent out at night, often returning in the morning after encountering Turkish cavalry trying to reach the Jordan to water their horses. The divisions were sent, in turn, to rest at Bethlehem and were given leave in Jerusalem.Gullett, pp.646‚Äì647 During this time, the division conducted training camps for non-commissioned officers, Hotchkiss machine-gunners and signallers, and all ranks took part in general military training.Gullett, p.622 However, the troops left in the valley were being beginning to suffer from \\"malaria and other diseases\\".Gullett, p.655 In June, the 1st Light Horse Brigade returned from Bethlehem and replaced the 4th Light Horse Brigade in the Musallabeh sector. The brigade deployed with two regiments forward and one in reserve at the Wadi el Auja front line.Gullett, p.662 By early July, they had 3rd Light Horse Regiment on the left, 2nd Light Horse Regiment on the right and the 1st Light Horse Regiment in reserve. Because of illness and a lack of replacements, the 3rd Light Horse Regiment had only 210 men available and the other regiments were in a similar condition. Since they arrived, the brigade had been subjected to Turkish shelling. Activity then increased to such an extent that a Turkish attack was expected at any time.Gullett, p.663 In preparation, extra water and ammunitionenough for two dayswas cached in the defence posts. On 13 April, Turkish artillery fire on the brigades' positions increased and that night, movement could be head at the barbed wire defence line. At 01:00 on 14 April, the forward troops reported that the enemy appeared to be massing, and later a \\"strong body of troops\\" about to their front. Lieutenant-Colonel George John Bell, commanding 3rd Light Horse Regiment asked for a protective artillery barrage in front of his position. The Turkish responded with shelling of their own, which lifted at 02:30. In the quiet, the regiment heard some commands shouted in German. Then the Turkish artillery laid down another one-hour barrage. When that lifted, around one thousand troops attacked the brigade's forward defences in what became known as the battle of Abu Tellul. In the 2nd Light Horse Regiment's sector, some forward posts were withdrawn to safer areas. Regimental headquarters was overrun and other positions surrounded. Other troops were overrun but regained their posts by counter-attacking. Further west, a position held by the regimental adjutant, a signals officer, grooms, batmen and signallers, was all that remained between the attacking Germans and the division's artillery batteries. Troops were then withdrawn to a trench line below a crest so the attacking Germans coming over the skyline were easily targeted and the brigade held off the attack for the next hour.Gullett, pp.665‚Äì667 3rd Light Horse Regiment Chaytor, informed of the attack, sent a squadron from the 4th Light Horse Brigadewhich was still close byto reinforce the position. Cox, commanding 1st Light Horse Brigade, ordered the 1st Light Horse Regimenthis only reserveto counter-attack the Germans. At 03:30, one squadron and four machine-guns were sent to reinforce the position at Abu Tellul. At dawn on 14 April, it became clear that the main German assault was centred on Abu Tellul, so two more squadrons were sent to assist them. The reinforcements assembled below the crest, fixed bayonets and counter-attacked the Germans, whom taken by surprise, broke and withdrew to their own trenches. The position at Abu Tellul was now secure but on the other flank in the west, the German attack was progressing. At 08:00, the last reserve squadron counter-attacked there, forcing the Germans back and capturing one hundred prisoners. By 09:00, the brigade was back in control of its previous positions and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade moved to sweep clear to their front. The battle cost the Germans 105 dead, and 358 prisoners; another sixty-seven Turkish prisoners were captured. One group of one hundred captured German Stormtroopers were armed with forty-two automatic riflesthe German equivalent of the Hotchkissalmost one between every two men. The brigade casualties were twenty-three dead and forty-six wounded. Ammunition expended by the brigade was 19,000 rifle rounds, 20,000 Hotchkiss and 30,000 machine gun rounds.Gullett, pp.667‚Äì669Powles, pp.231‚Äì232 Chaytor's Force In September 1918, British intelligence reported that the Turkish Fourth Army, comprising six thousand infantrymen and two thousand cavalry with 74 artillery pieces, was still east of the Jordan.Gullett, p.681 Further south at Ma'an was the Fourth Army's four to six thousand-man II Corps.Preston, p.241 However Allenby planned that the next offensive would take place on the coastal Sharon plain and in the Judean Hills near Nablus.Gullett, p.683 To accomplish that, the EEF had to realign to the left flankPowles, p.234 and convince the opposition that the main attack would take place in the Jordan Valley.Gullett, p.685 To allow this to happen, the division remained in the valley as the main component of Chaytor's Forcethe division reinforced by the 20th Indian Brigade, Jewish Legion (38th and 39th Battalions, Royal Fusiliers), and 1st and 2nd Battalions, British West Indies Regiment and support troops. Chaytor's Force was responsible for holding the eastern flank in the Jordan Valley. While the EEF moved west, the force built new and larger camps and 15,000 dummy horses. At the same time, the infantry battalions marched around the valley, giving the illusion of a much larger force,Gullett, p.686 and constructed false bridges across the Jordan. Part of Chaytor's orders were to conduct patrols east of the Jordan; if there was evidence of a Turkish withdrawal, they were to head north and capture the crossing at Damieh and east to seize Amman and block the Fourth Army's retreat north to Damascus.Gullett, p.690 While the Australian Mounted Division, which was advancing along the coast as part of the main drive towards Damascus, had received swords and cavalry training in August 1918, the ANZAC Mounted Division did not, and continued in the mounted rifles role until the end of the war.Bou 2010b, pp. 107‚Äì108 Galloping New Zealand troops in the Jordan Valley The force was divided to cover the Jordan Valley. The 2nd Light Horse and 20th Indian Brigades held a line between the Dead Sea along the Jordan to the Auja bridgehead. The New Zealand Brigade and the other four infantry battalions held the line from Auja to Mellahah and Ahu Tellul, while the 1st Light Horse Brigade was in reserve at Jericho.Powles, p.235Gullett, pp.713‚Äì714 Over the nights of 17‚Äì19 September, the divisions' patrols crossed east of the river and were involved in several fire fights with the defenders.Gullett, p.714 During daylight on 19 September, the two West Indian battalions carried out bayonet charges and captured Turkish positions west of the river. An attempt by the Royal Fusiliers failed to gain any ground. Throughout the next day, the Turkish defenders fought hard against any attack. On 21 September, the Auckland Mounted Rifles advanced to the north on the western side of the river towards the Damieh bridge and Mafid Jozele, forcing the Turkish troops to withdraw to their reserve line.Gullett, pp.715‚Äì716 On 22 September at 03:30, on the left the New Zealand Brigade and mounted West Indies infantry battalions reached the Nablus‚ÄìDamieh road and reached the Mazar mound an hour later. They next captured El Makhruk along with a large supply dump, seventy vehicles and 724 prisonersone of which was the GOC of the Turkish 53rd Division. Before daylight, they captured the Damieh bridge with a dismounted attack during which one of the West Indies companies charged with them.Powles, p.247Gullett, pp.716‚Äì717 The Fourth Army units, leaving small rear guards behind, now started to withdraw from the east bank towards Amman, pursued by the 1st Light Horse Brigade, a West Indian battalion and the Royal Fusiliers battalions. They became involved in several small fights as they tried to turn the Turkish to their front, back towards the river.Gullett, p.717 That night, Chaytor issued orders for a general advance the next day. In the south, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade's objectives were Kabr Mujahid and the Rame mound. The 20th Brigade, the Royal Fusiliers battalions and a light horse squadron would take Shunet Ninirin. The 1st Light Horse Brigade would capture a crossing on the Jordan at Mafid Jozele, forcing the Seventh Army back into the hills. The New Zealand Brigade were to gallop to Es Salt followed by the West Indies battalions on foot. The division's artillery, supply train and all wheeled vehicles would travel along the road from Shunet Nimrin to Es Salt.Gullett, p.718 Chaytor's Force advanced on 23 September; by 04:30, 2nd Light Horse Brigade had taken their first objective and continued towards Tel er Rame. Before night they had climbed out of the foot hills and onto the plateau. The 1st Light Horse Brigade forced their crossing and were en route to Es Salt. The 20th Brigade captured Shunet Nimrin and also headed towards Es Salt. The only opposition was in the north, where the New Zealand Brigade were temporarily stopped by a machine-gun post, but by 19:00 they had captured Es Salt along with 312 prisoners, two machine-guns and three artillery pieces.Gullett, pp.718‚Äì719 The 1st Light Horse and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigades' now advanced on Suweile. The 2nd Light Horse Brigade had problems negotiating hill trackssome of which had been damaged by artillery firebut reached Ain es Sir at midday. By now, except for one battalion of fusiliers, Chaytor's Force was on the plateau around Es Salt, advancing on Amman.Gullett, p.719 To close the trap on the Fourth Army, the Auckland Mounted Rifles sent a squadron overnight on 25 September to destroy the railway line north of Amman.Powles, p.249 The rest of the division set out at 06:00 to attack Amman for a second time with the 2nd Light Horse and the New Zealand Brigades leading and the 1st Light Horse Brigade in reserve.Powles, p.250 Chaytor, being well aware of the terrain, ordered the division to move slowly and to wait for infantry support before attacking if they encountered a strong position. The New Zealand Brigade encountered around two hundred men and artillery on a ridge position north-west of Amman. The 2nd Light Horse Brigade moving along the Ain es Sir-Amman road were slowed down by several machine-gun posts, which they over-ran and captured 130 prisoners, three artillery pieces, and four machine-guns.Gullett, pp.720‚Äì721 At 11:00, a British aircraft dropped a note for Chaytor reporting that the defenders were leaving their trenches. Chaytor ordered a mounted charge by the Canterbury Mounted Rifles, but they were stopped by the terrain and machine-gun fire. For the next two hours, the brigades gradually fought their way closer to Amman.Gullett, p.721 The break through came when the 7th Light Horse Regiment reached within of the Turkish trenches; they fixed bayonets and charged, capturing 113 prisoners and seven machine-guns. The New Zealand Brigade from the north-west had advanced close enough, so that when they crossed the Wadi Amman they charged and captured the old citadel and the Amman rail station. Within Amman, the division captured 2,360 prisoners, six artillery pieces and several machine-guns.Gullett, p.723 Some of the prisoners taken by the 2nd Light Horse Brigade during September 1918 About to the south, the Turkish II Corpsaround five to six thousand strong of the Fourth Army, were defending Ma'an from the Arab forces. To hinder their retreat north, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade was sent to cut the railway line to the south of Amman and the 1st Light Horse Brigade was sent to capture Wadi el Hammam and its water supplies. The rest of the force prepared a defence line between Shunet Nimrin, Es Salt, and Suweile. On 26 September, the 3rd Light Horse Regiment captured one hundred pro-Turkish Arabs, then reached Ez Zerka where they discovered ninety- five sick or wounded Turkish soldiers and an artillery piece. The next day, the 1st Light Horse Brigade outflanked Wadi el Hammam and captured 453 prisoners and three machine-guns, and also closed the eastern road north from Ma'an. The next day, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade moved south along the railway line and reached Leban, where a prisoner disclosed that the 6,000-man Ma'am garrison was about to the south. Early on 28 September, the garrison's men were located to the south of Kastal by British aircraft, digging trenches. The 5th Light Horse Regiment was sent to reconnoitre the position, which was surrounded by the Beni Sakhr tribe who were harassing the defenders, galloping around the trenches and firing their guns in the air. Lieutenant-Colonel Donald Charles Cameron commanding 5th Light Horse Regiment approached the Turkish commander about their surrender; He was in agreement but disinclined to relinquish their weapons with the Arab force present.Powles, pp.254‚Äì255Gullett, pp.724‚Äì725 When Chaytor was informed of their predicament, he ordered the remainder of the 2nd Light Horse Brigade south to assist. When Cameron reported to Ryriewho was commanding the 2nd Light Horse Brigadethat the situation was becoming critical, he ordered the brigade to gallop, leaving their slower pack horses behind. The brigade arrived just before nightfall,Gullett, pp.725‚Äì726 by which time the Turkish had opened fire on the Arabs. Ryrie conferred with the Arab chiefs, who wanted to make a joint assault on the position. Instead, fearing the Arabs' intention if the Turkish surrendered, Ryrie camped inside the Turkish position for the night.Gullett, p.726 The next morning at 08:00, the New Zealand Brigade arrived and a Turkish force, thirteen artillery pieces, thirty machine-guns, a train with three steam engines and five thousand men went into captivity. In the nine days since operations started, Chaytor's Force had taken 10,300 prisoners and captured fifty-seven artillery pieces, 132 machine-guns, eleven railway engines and 106 lorries. His casualties were twenty-seven dead, 105 wounded and seven men missing.Gullett, p.727 Disbandment 2nd Light Horse Regiment march through Brisbane, Queensland, in 1919 While the division withdrew, the Desert Mounted Corps in the west advanced into Syria, where it captured Damascus on 1 October, while Prince Feisal's Sherifial force captured Aleppo on 25 October.Gullett, p.776 At the end of October, the Armistice of Mudros was agreed between the British and Ottoman Empires.Gullett, p.779 During this time, the division was withdrawn back to Jerusalem and then Richon.Gullett, p.780 At the end of hostilities, sickness caught up with the men and there were 900 \\"stretcher cases\\" laid up and several men died of disease.Gullett, p.781 The 7th Light Horse and the Canterbury Mounted Rifles were selected to be part of the forcecommanded by the 28th Divisionthat occupied the Dardanelles and Constantinople, landing on the Dardanelles peninsula on 5 December.Gullett, p.786Powles, p.263 In December 1918, Ryrie GOC 2nd Light Horse Brigade, as a brigadier-general, assumed command of the division. In early 1919, while the division was based around Rafa preparing to return home, a revolt broke out in Egypt. The 1st and 2nd Light Horse Regiments had already sailed for Australia in March,Gullett, p.792 and rest of the division had returned most of their equipment to the stores and were waiting for transport ships to return them home. They were rearmed and deployed to patrolling and counter rioting duties. Within a month the revolt was over and the embarkation of the division resumed. The 3rd Light Horse Regiment left in May, the New Zealand Brigade had left by July and by the end of the summer, the rest of the division had followed.Gullett, p.793Powles, p.284 The ANZAC Mounted Division officially ceased to exist on 30 June 1919. Immediately after the war ended, the division's horses were taken to the Imperial Remount Depot at Moascar in Egypt. The riding horses were eventually reissued, when required, to units of the British Empire. The heavier pack and draught horses were now redundant, so these were shipped to France and sold.

History The street was named after Henry Compton who raised funds for a local parish church, eventually dedicated as St Anne's Church in 1686. The area in general and this street in particular became the home of Huguenots, French Protestant refugees who were given asylum in England by Charles II in 1681. By the end of the 18th century, fewer than ten of the houses were without shop fronts. In the middle of the 19th century, while there were some workshops too, as well as restaurants and public houses, the ground floors of most of the houses were still used as shops. The number of people of overseas descent continued to grow and the street became a meeting place for exiles, particularly those from France: after the suppression of the Paris Commune, the poets Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine often frequented drinking haunts here. Old Compton Street had its resident curiosity in the form of Wombwell's Menagerie. George Wombwell kept a boot and shoe shop on the street between 1804 and 1810 and, by all accounts, was quite an entrepreneur. Of short stature and an alcoholic, he nonetheless built up three hugely successful menageries from a starting point of two snakes bought at a bargain price. The menageries travelled around England and made him a wealthy man before his death in 1850. Between 1956 and 1970 the 2 I's Coffee Bar was located here. Many well-known 1960s pop musicians played in its cramped surroundings. Current Today, the street is the main focal point for London's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. In Soho, central London, it features several gay bars, restaurants and caf√©s, as well as a popular theatre. Whilst a pedestrianisation project proved unpopular with local traders and was reversed, the street is closed to vehicular traffic for the Soho Pride festival one weekend each year, in late summer. The Prince Edward Theatre is located on the east end of the street. Until 2004 the long-running production of Mamma Mia!, a musical based upon the songs of ABBA, was showing at the theatre. When Mamma Mia! moved to larger premises in another part of the West End, a production of Mary Poppins moved in, but closed in 2008. It subsequently became home to Aladdin. London producer and director Adam Spreadbury-Maher lives at the northern end of Old Compton Street. The Admiral Duncan public house. In 1999, the Admiral Duncan pub was the site of a nail bomb attack which killed three people and injured over a dozen. A neo-nazi, David Copeland, was subsequently found guilty of the bombing (intended specifically to injure members of the gay community). Previously decorated in neutral colours, the Admiral Duncan was re-opened with a flamboyant pink and purple exterior with a large rainbow flag flying outside as a symbol of gay pride. The flag has remained there ever since, in defiance of Westminster City Council's planning permission laws. Along the street are numerous other gay bars including Comptons of SOHO and G-A-Y. Also on the street are a variety of caf√©s, tea rooms (including the original branch of the Patisserie Valerie chain) and restaurants (including Bincho, a yakitori restaurant and Balans, which unusually for much of England is open 24 hours a day), and sex shops. In the middle of Charing Cross Road, at its junction with Old Compton Street, beneath the grill in the traffic island in the middle of the road, can be seen the old road signs for the now-vanished Little Compton Street, which once joined Old Compton Street with New Compton Street.

The highway's eastern terminus is in Greenville, Texas at an intersection with Interstate 30, of which the easternmost 3‚Äì4 miles are concurrent with US 69 in a loop around the west and south sides of Greenville. Its western terminus is at San Antonio, New Mexico, south of Socorro at an intersection with Interstate 25. It intersected with its parent, U.S. Route 80, at Cisco up to 1971, when it was rerouted along the former SH 24 from that highway's western terminus near Old Glory to Greenville. Former U.S. Route 380 from Cisco to near Old Glory became an extension of SH 6. The highway no longer connects to any x80 route. US 380 passes through some of the far northern suburbs of the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex, including (from west to east) Denton, Frisco, McKinney and Princeton. The portion in Texas from the New Mexico Border to Jayton was SH 84 before 1939. Its spur, SH 84A, went from Jayton to Aspermont, until 1930, when it became SH 161. Route description=New Mexico US-380 US Route 380 begins at an intersection with Interstate 25 just west of San Antonio, New Mexico, and travels through town, meeting the old route of US 85, now New Mexico State Road 1. It then travels generally east, and marks the northern edge of the White Sands Missile Range. The road then turns southeast, crossing the Carrizozo Malpais before reaching Carrizozo, meeting U.S. Route 54. The route continues southeast, climbing the Sacramento Mountains, and going through the town of Capitan and briefly travelling through the Lincoln National Forest, before reaching U.S. Route 70 at Hondo and becoming concurrent with US 70.US 380 at the intersection of US 70 and US 285 in Roswell. These routes continue eastward, next reaching Roswell, New Mexico. US 380 splits with US 70 in Roswell, then crossing U.S. Route 285 in Roswell before continuing east across oil-producing areas of the Llano Estacado of east New Mexico and the Texas South Plains. Texas US 380 enters Texas at a crossing with Farm to Market Road 769, travelling generally due east before meeting up with US Route 82 in Plains. They continue east passing the former locations of Tokio and Gomez before reaching Brownfield. In Brownfield, it meets US Routes 62 and 385, and all 4 routes coincide for 3 blocks through the center of town before US 380 splits to the east. US 380 west of Tahoka, Texas The route continues due east through Texas South Plains farmland, passing through Tahoka, before falling off the Llano Estacado and reaching Post. The highway then meanders east through rural Garza and Kent Counties before reaching the ghost town of Clairemont. The route then travels east, where it meets Texas State Highway 70, which both then turn northeast until reaching Jayton, where US 380 takes a sharp turn back to the southeast. The road then travels through several thousand acres of private ranchland in Kent and Stonewall Counties before reaching Swenson. US 380 in Rule, Texas The route continues to the southeast, reaching an intersection with US 83, where both continue southeast into the town of Aspermont. The route continues to the east and northeast through the communities of Old Glory, Rule, Haskell, Throckmorton, and Newcastle, before crossing Lake Graham and reaching the city of Graham. US 380 continues to the east and northeast through Bryson before reaching an intersection with US Route 281 and Texas State Highway 114 in Jacksboro. US 281 departs southward out of town, while US 380 and TX 114 depart east south of Jacksboro, crossing Lake Bridgeport before reaching the city of Bridgeport. US 380 then travels due east toward the city of Decatur. US 380 exits to the east and reaches an intersection with Interstate 35 on the west end of Denton where it is known as University Drive. US 380 continues through the city of Denton, intersecting US Route 77 and US 377 near Texas Woman's University, before continuing east with US 377. The routes cross the very northern edge of Lake Lewisville before US 377 departs off to the north. US 380 continues east, meeting the northern terminus of the Dallas North Tollway in Frisco, before reaching McKinney, where it is also known as University Drive. The route then continues east, passing through Princeton before crossing the northern fringe of Lake Lavon, and reaching Farmersville, where it is signed as the Audie Murphy Parkway. The route again continues east, passing just south of Floyd, before reaching an intersection with US Route 69 on the far western edge of Greenville. Both of those routes then follow a loop around the south end of Greenville, before reaching the routes eastern terminus at an intersection with Interstate 30 and US Route 67. Special routes The route has two special routes, all business routes in Texas. U.S. Route 380 Business - F This is the former route of US 380 through the city of Decatur. The route was bypassed in 1987, with the old route being renamed Texas State Highway Loop 569. The route was re-designated as the business route in 1991. U.S. Route 380 Business - J This is the former route of US 380 through the town of Floyd. The route was bypassed in 1968, when the route was still known as Texas State Highway 24, with the old routing being designated as Texas State Highway Loop 462. The route was re- designated as the business route in 1991. History When US 380 was commissioned in 1931, it took over the entire former route of U.S. Route 566, an original 1926 route. The entire route of US 566 was within the state of New Mexico, from an intersection with (modern day New Mexico State Road 48) and (modern-day US 70) east of Ruidoso to US 85 (originally planned as US 466) in Socorro, New Mexico. US 566 never intersected with its nominal parent, U.S. Route 66 although it temporarily connected to that parent indirectly via U.S. Route 366 (1927‚Äì1932). The section of highway from the New Mexico border to Jayton was previously SH 84. A spur route, SH 84A, went from Jayton to Aspermont, being changed to Texas State Highway 161 in 1930.

In 1923, Odlum, a friend, and their wives pooled a total of $39,600 and formed the United States Company to speculate in purchases of utilities and general securities. Within two years, the company's net assets had increased 17 fold to nearly $700,000.Current Biography 1941, pp 629-31 In 1928, Odlum incorporated Atlas Utilities Company to take over the common stock of his other company. During the summer of 1929, Odlum was one of the few industrial moguls to believe that the boom on Wall Street could not continue much longer, and he sold one half of Atlas's holdings, as well as $9 million in new securities to investors. He had $14 million in cash and short term notes when the stock market crashed.Current Biography 1941, p630 During the next few years, Atlas Utilities bought up stock in less fortunate investment companies at Depression-reduced prices. After Franklin D. Roosevelt was inaugurated President of the United States, Odlum shifted gears, selling off utilities before stronger regulation set in, and switching to large-scale financing. By 1933, Odlum was one of the 10 wealthiest men in the United States.

The edge of chaos is a transition space between order and disorder that is hypothesized to exist within a wide variety of systems. This transition zone is a region of bounded instability that engenders a constant dynamic interplay between order and disorder. Even though the idea of the edge of chaos is an abstract one, it has many applications in such fields as ecology, business management, psychology, political science, and other domains of the social science. Physicists have shown that adaptation to the edge of chaos occurs in almost all systems with feedback.  History  The phrase edge of chaos was coined by mathematician Doyne Farmer to describe the transition phenomenon discovered by computer scientist Christopher Langton. The phrase originally refers to an area in the range of a variable, Œª (lambda), which was varied while examining the behavior of a cellular automaton (CA). As Œª varied, the behavior of the CA went through a phase transition of behaviors. Langton found a small area conducive to produce CAs capable of universal computation. At around the same time physicist James P. Crutchfield and others used the phrase onset of chaos to describe more or less the same concept. In the sciences in general, the phrase has come to refer to a metaphor that some physical, biological, economic and social systems operate in a region between order and either complete randomness or chaos, where the complexity is maximal. The generality and significance of the idea, however, has since been called into question by Melanie Mitchell and others. The phrase has also been borrowed by the business community and is sometimes used inappropriately and in contexts that are far from the original scope of the meaning of the term. Stuart Kauffman has studied mathematical models of evolving systems in which the rate of evolution is maximized near the edge of chaos. Adaptation Adaptation plays a vital role for all living organisms and systems. All of them are constantly changing their inner properties to better fit in the current environment. The most important instruments for the adaptation are the self-adjusting parameters inherent for many natural systems. The prominent feature of systems with self- adjusting parameters is an ability to avoid chaos. The name for this phenomenon is \\"Adaptation to the edge of chaos\\". Adaptation to the edge of chaos refers to the idea that many complex adaptive systems seem to intuitively evolve toward a regime near the boundary between chaos and order. Physics has shown that edge of chaos is the optimal settings for control of a system. It is also an optional setting that can influence the ability of a physical system to perform primitive functions for computation. Because of the importance of adaptation in many natural systems, adaptation to the edge of the chaos takes a prominent position in many scientific researches. Physicists demonstrated that adaptation to state at the boundary of chaos and order occurs in population of cellular automata rules which optimize the performance evolving with a genetic algorithm. Another example of this phenomenon is the self-organized criticality in avalanche and earthquake models. The simplest model for chaotic dynamics is the logistic map. Self-adjusting logistic map dynamics exhibit adaptation to the edge of chaos. Theoretical analysis allowed prediction of the location of the narrow parameter regime near the boundary to which the system evolves.

It has additional campuses in Portland, Maine and Tangier, Morocco. During the 2016‚Äì2017 academic year, 13,743 students were enrolled in UNE's campus-based and online programs. UNE's institutional history dates to 1831, when Westbrook Seminary opened on what is now the UNE Portland Campus. The UNE Biddeford Campus was founded in 1939 when College S√©raphique opened as a high school and junior college for boys of Quebecois descent. In 1952, that institution became a four-year liberal arts college named St. Francis College. In 1978, St. Francis College merged with the New England Foundation for Osteopathic Medicine to become the University of New England. In 1996, the University of New England merged with Westbrook College. UNE is the largest private university in the state of Maine and the largest educator of healthcare professionals for Maine. It is organized into six colleges that combine to offer more than 70 undergraduate, graduate, online, and professional degrees. Known predominantly for its programs in the sciences and health sciences, UNE also offers degrees in the marine sciences, data science, environmental science, mathematics, business, education, the humanities, and many other subjects. Its College of Osteopathic Medicine is the only medical school in Maine and its College of Dental Medicine is the only dental college in northern New England. It is classified among \\"R2: Doctoral Universities ‚Äì High research activity\\".  History  In 1939, a boys-only high school and junior college called the College S√©raphique was founded in Biddeford by Father Decary and the Franciscan friar of St. Andre's parish. In 1952, the school changed its name to St. Francis College and began granting bachelor's degrees with state approval in 1953. The high school program was phased out by 1961, and the college was first accredited in 1966. The school became co- educational for the first time in 1967, and the Franciscans withdrew from the administration of the college in 1974. To survive dropping enrollment, St. Francis College entered into an agreement with the New England Foundation for Osteopathic Medicine to establish the New England College of Osteopathic Medicine on the same campus, and in 1978 the two became the \\"University of New England\\", although the merger would not be fully complete until a 1987 vote by the College of Osteopathic Medicine corporation.http://dune.une.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&context;=shapingafuture In 1996, Westbrook College merged with the University of New England. The merger took place under the terms of the original 1831 Westbrook charter, and the combined institutions became Westbrook College before changing the name back to the University of New England. The campus of the former Westbrook College is now known as the UNE Portland Campus. In December 2010, the university received the largest gift in its history‚Äî$10 million from the Harold Alfond Foundation to build the Harold Alfond Forum on the Biddeford Campus, and to support interprofessional healthcare workforce education. The Alfond Forum, which opened fall 2012, includes a athletics complex featuring an ice hockey rink with 900 seats; a basketball court with 1,200 seats; classroom space; a fitness center; and multi-purpose indoor practice courts that can also be used for performances and other events, with a combined seating capacity of 3,000. This provides the largest gathering space on both the Biddeford and Portland campuses. The complex is located between UNE's new synthetic blue turf field and Sokokis Hall. In March 2014, UNE launched its $60M \\"Moving Forward Campaign,\\" the largest in UNE history. James D. Herbert, Ph.D., serves as UNE's sixth president. His tenure began on July 1, 2017, immediately following the 11-year tenure of Danielle N. Ripich.  Campuses  UNE offers three campuses that provide students with a range of learning environments. The university's two campuses in coastal Maine, USA, house undergraduate, graduate, and professional programs, while its Tangier Campus provides a semester-abroad opportunity in Morocco. Biddeford Campus The Biddeford Campus covers , with of ocean frontage where the Saco River flows into the Atlantic Ocean. The 26 buildings on the campus include the Harold Alfond Center for Health Sciences, the Pickus Center for Biomedical Research, and the Marine Science Center. The Harold Alfond Center for Health Sciences houses Maine's only medical school: The University of New England College of Osteopathic Medicine. UNE's Biddeford Campus is also home to the George and Barbara Bush Center, which houses material chronicling the Bush legacy in Maine, including memorabilia on loan from the George H.W. Bush Presidential Library at Texas A & M University. The Center includes a replica of the Oval Office during Bush's term in the White House and a statue of the former president. Each year, UNE hosts an annual lecture at its Biddeford Campus that is often attended by the former president and his family. In September 2017, former U.S. Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell visited UNE's Biddeford Campus to deliver the Bush Lecture. The UNE Biddeford Campus also includes the Harold Alfond Forum, which offers 105,000 square-feet (9,800 m2) of athletic and learning space, including: an NHL-size ice hockey rink with 900 seats, a basketball court with 1,200 seats, classrooms, a fitness center, and multi- purpose indoor practice courts that are also used for performances and lectures. A $10 million gift from the Harold Alfond Foundation facilitated the building's construction and the development of associated programming. UNE also owns Ram Island, off the coast of the Biddeford Campus, which serves as a field station for student and faculty researchers.

The medieval title (1065 creation) was associated with the ruling house of Scotland (David of Scotland). The seventh and most recent creation dates to 1529. In this lineage, the current holder of the title is William Hastings-Bass, 17th Earl of Huntingdon (b. 1948). In English folklore, the title has been associated with the outlaw Robin Hood. In particular, the 1980s ITV TV series Robin of Sherwood and the actor Michael Craig. Early history Huntingdonshire was part of the Kingdom of East Anglia, inhabited by a group known as the Gyrwas from about the 6th century. It fell to the Danes in the 9th century, but was re-conquered under Edward the Elder in 915. An earldom of Huntingdon was established shortly after, and it was one of the seven earldoms of Saxon England during the reign of king Edward the Confessor. It was created for Beorn Estrithson, cousin to Harold Godwinson (later King Harold). The earldom at that time carried extensive powers and covered a wide area of the East Midlands, covering the counties of Northamptonshire and Bedfordshire as well as Huntingdonshire. First creation (1065) In 1065 the earldom passed to Waltheof, son of Siward, Earl of Northumbria. Waltheof kept his title following the Conquest in 1066, and even after his rebellion in 1067, and married Judith, King William's niece. However, after a second rebellion in 1076 he was executed and the earldom reduced in size and power. The earldom was inherited by Waltheof's daughter Maud, countess of Huntingdon, and passed to her husbands in turn, first Simon de Senlis and then David King of Scotland. Following her death, and during the reigns of Matilda and Stephen and the anarchy that ensued, the earldom was the subject of dispute between Maud's sons Simon II and Henry the prince, and was held by both at various times. In the reign of Henry II, following the death of Simon II, it was settled on the Scottish house, and the sons of Prince Henry: first Malcolm, then William, then David. With the death of David's childless son John in 1237, the title was not passed on and became extinct. *Waltheof (d. 1076) *Judith of Lens, Countess of Huntingdon (c.1055‚Äìafter 1086) *Maud, Countess of Huntingdon (c.1074‚Äì1130/31) ** m.

Seventh creation (1529) Arms of the Hastings family, Earls of Huntingdon as recorded in the Gelre Armorial: Argent, a maunch sable Henry Hastings, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon The title was re-created for George Hastings, 3rd Baron Hastings, 5th Baron Hungerford, 6th Baron Botreaux and 4th Baron de Moleyns. He fought in the French Wars of Henry VIII. In 1529 the King created him Earl of Huntingdon in the Peerage of England. His eldest son, the second Earl, was a lieutenant-general and served as Commander- in-Chief of the Army. Lord Huntingdon married Catherine, daughter and co- heiress of Henry Pole, 1st Baron Montagu, son of Sir Richard Pole and Margaret Pole, 8th Countess of Salisbury, daughter and sole heiress of George, Duke of Clarence, brother of King Edward IV. On his death the titles passed to his son, the third Earl. He was a possible heir presumptive to the crown through his mother, though Elizabeth I never acknowledged his claim officially. Lord Huntingdon was one of the custodians of Mary, Queen of Scots, and also served as President of the Council of the North. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the fourth Earl. He represented Derbyshire and Leicestershire in the House of Commons and served as Lord-Lieutenant of Rutland and Leicestershire. When he died the titles passed to his grandson, the fifth Earl. He was the son of Francis Hastings, Lord Hastings (d. 1595). Lord Huntingdon was also Lord- Lieutenant of Leicestershire and Rutland. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the sixth Earl. He sat as Member of Parliament for Leicestershire. His son, the seventh Earl, served as Lord-Lieutenant of Leicestershire and Derbyshire. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the eighth Earl. He carried the Sceptre at the Coronation of Queen Anne but died at an early age. He was succeeded by his half-brother, the ninth Earl. He carried the Sword of State at the Coronation of King George II. His son, the tenth Earl, was a courtier and notably served as Master of the Horse. He had no legitimate male issue and on his death in 1789 the earldom became dormant. He was succeeded in the baronies of Hastings, Hungerford, de Moleyns and Botreaux by his sister Lady Elizabeth, wife of John Rawdon, 1st Earl of Moira. The earldom was assumed by the tenth Earl's distant relative (his fifth cousin once removed) Reverend Theophilus Henry Hastings. He was the great-great-great-grandson of Sir Edward Hastings (d. 1603), younger son of the second Earl. He is by some sources considered as the de jure eleventh Earl while some sources do not include him in the numbering of the Earls. On his death the claim passed to his nephew Hans Francis Hastings, son of George Hastings. He was allowed to take his seat in the House of Lords as the Earl of Huntingdon in 1819. Depending on the sources he is numbered as the eleventh or twelfth Earl. Lord Huntingdon served as Governor of Jamaica from 1822 to 1824. His great-great-grandson (the titles having descended from father to son), the sixteenth (or fifteenth Earl), was an artist, academic and Labour politician. He died without male issue in 1990 and was succeeded by his first cousin once removed, the seventeenth (or sixteenth) and () present holder of the title. He is the uncle of television presenter Clare Balding and eldest son of Captain Peter Robin Hood Hastings Bass (1920‚Äì1964) (who assumed the additional surname of Bass, which was that of his uncle by marriage, Sir William Bass, 2nd Baronet, by deed poll in 1954), son of Aubrey Craven Theophilus Robin Hood Hastings (1878‚Äì1929), younger son of the fourteenth Earl. Several other members of the Hastings family may be mentioned. The Hon. Edward Hastings, third son of the first Earl, was created Baron Hastings of Loughborough in 1558. Richard Hastings, grandson of Sir Edward Hastings, younger son of the second Earl, was created a baronet in 1667 (see Hastings baronets). The Hon. Henry Hastings, second son of the fifth Earl, was created Baron Loughborough in 1643. Lucy Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon, wife of the sixth Earl, was a poet. Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon, wife of the ninth Earl, was a Methodist leader and the founder of the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion. Charles Hastings, illegitimate son of the tenth Earl, was a distinguished soldier and was created a baronet in 1806 (see Abney- Hastings baronets). The Hon. George Fowler Hastings, second son of the twelfth (or eleventh) Earl, was a vice-admiral in the Royal Navy. Alexander Plantagenet Hastings (1843‚Äì1928), son of Captain the Hon. Edward Plantagenet Robin Hood Hastings (1818‚Äì1857), third son of the twelfth (or eleventh) Earl, was an admiral in the Royal Navy. His son Edward George Godolphin Hastings (1887‚Äì1973) was a captain in the Royal Navy. The Earl possesses no subsidiary titles, but his eldest son uses the invented courtesy title of Viscount Hastings to avoid confusion, there already being a Baron Hastings. The family seat of the present line is at Hodcott House, near West Ilsley, in Berkshire. *George Hastings, 1st Earl of Huntingdon (1488‚Äì1544) *Francis Hastings, 2nd Earl of Huntingdon (1514‚Äì1560) *Henry Hastings, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon (1536‚Äì1595) *George Hastings, 4th Earl of Huntingdon (1540‚Äì1604) *Henry Hastings, 5th Earl of Huntingdon (1586‚Äì1643) *Ferdinando Hastings, 6th Earl of Huntingdon (1609‚Äì1656) *Theophilus Hastings, 7th Earl of Huntingdon (1650‚Äì1701) *George Hastings, 8th Earl of Huntingdon (1677‚Äì1705) *Theophilus Hastings, 9th Earl of Huntingdon (1696‚Äì1746) *Francis Hastings, 10th Earl of Huntingdon (1729‚Äì1789) (dormant) *Theophilus Henry Hastings, de jure 11th Earl of Huntingdon (1728‚Äì1804) *Hans Francis Hastings, 12th Earl of Huntingdon (1779‚Äì1828) (confirmed in title 1819) *Francis Theophilus Henry Hastings, 13th Earl of Huntingdon (1808‚Äì1875) *Francis Power Plantagenet Hastings, 14th Earl of Huntingdon (1841‚Äì1885) *Warner Francis John Plantagenet Hastings, 15th Earl of Huntingdon (1868‚Äì1939) *Francis John Clarence Westenra Plantagenet Hastings, 16th Earl of Huntingdon (1901‚Äì1990) *William Edward Robin Hood Hastings-Bass, 17th Earl of Huntingdon (b. 1948) The heir presumptive is the present holder's brother the Hon.

Geodes are hollow, vaguely spherical rocks, in which masses of mineral matter (which may include crystals) are secluded. The crystals are formed by the filling of vesicles in volcanic and sub-volcanic rocks by minerals deposited from hydrothermal fluids; or by the dissolution of syn-genetic concretions and partial filling by the same, or other, minerals precipitated from water, groundwater or hydrothermal fluids. Geodized brachiopod fossil lined with calcite with a single crystal of sphalerite, from the Devonian of Wisconsin.  Formation  Geodes can form in any cavity, but the term is usually reserved for more or less rounded formations in igneous and sedimentary rocks. They can form in gas bubbles in igneous rocks, such as vesicles in basaltic lava; or, as in the American Midwest, in rounded cavities in sedimentary formations. After rock around the cavity hardens, dissolved silicates and/or carbonates are deposited on the inside surface. Over time, this slow feed of mineral constituents from groundwater or hydrothermal solutions allows crystals to form inside the hollow chamber. Bedrock containing geodes eventually weathers and decomposes, leaving them present at the surface if they are composed of resistant material such as quartz. When cut in half, visible bands corresponding to varied stages of precipitation may at times show patterns that reveal points of fluid entry into the cavity and/or varied colors corresponding to changes in chemistry.  Coloration  thumb Geode banding and coloration is the result of variable impurities. Iron oxides will impart rust hues to siliceous solutions, such as the commonly observed iron-stained quartz. Most geodes contain clear quartz crystals, while others have purple amethyst crystals. Still others can have agate, chalcedony, or jasper banding or crystals such as calcite, dolomite, celestite, etc. There is no easy way of telling what the inside of a geode holds until it is cut open or broken apart. However, geodes from a particular area are usually similar in appearance. Geodes and geode slices are sometimes dyed with artificial colors. Samples of geodes with unusual colors or highly unlikely formations have usually been synthetically altered.  Prevalence  Fluorite and calcite on quartz stalactites, in geode Geodes are common in some formations in the United States (mainly in Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, western Illinois, Kentucky, and Utah). They also are common in Brazil, Namibia, and Mexico. Geodes are also abundant in the Mendip Hills in Somerset, England, where they are known locally as \\"potato stones\\".  Vugs and crystal caves In 2000 a team of geologists found a cave filled with giant gypsum crystals in an abandoned silver mine near Almer√≠a, Spain. The cavity, which measures 1.8 √ó 1.7 meters and is 8 meters in length, would be the largest crystal cave ever found. The entrance of the cave has been blocked by five tons of rocks, and is under police protection (to prevent looters from entering). According to geological models, the cave was formed during the Messinian salinity crisis 6 million years ago, when the Mediterranean sea evaporated and left thick layers of salt sediment). The cave is currently not accessible to tourists. The world's largest known crystal cave or vug is Crystal Cave, a celestine geode 35 feet (10.7 m) in diameter at its widest point, located near the village of Put-in-Bay, Ohio, on South Bass Island in Lake Erie.

The town is some 3 km inland from the Port de S√≥ller, in a large, bowl-shaped valley that also includes the village of Fornalutx and the hamlets of Biniaraix and Binibassi. The combined population is around 14,000. A famous tram, the Tranv√≠a de S√≥ller operates in the town, linking S√≥ller to the Port de S√≥ller. Overview S√≥ller is linked by the historic railway, the Ferrocarril de S√≥ller, and by a highway with a tunnel, to the Majorcan capital of Palma. The Ferrocaril was built on the profits from the orange and lemon trade and completed in 1911. The Andratx-Pollen√ßa highway also runs through the valley. The present-day economy is based mainly on tourism and the expenditure of foreign residents, complementary to the agricultural economy based around citrus and olive groves. Soller is unique compared to towns on the rest of the island due to its geographical isolation, being surrounded by the Tramuntana mountain range. This isolation from all other major towns on the island, made it easier to trade with French merchants arriving by sea. Main sights Sant Bartomeu Church Port of S√≥ller The focus of the town is the Pla√ßa Constituci√≥ which is surrounded by caf√©s and has plane trees and a fountain in its centre. The tram passes through the Pla√ßa on its way to and from the main station which has been restored to incorporate a museum of Picasso and Joan Mir√≥. The church of Sant Bartomeu (Saint Bartholomew) facing the east side of the Pla√ßa is flanked by the ajuntament (town hall) and the Banco de S√≥ller, a remarkable 1912 Modernista building with defining ironwork, by the Catalan architect Joan Rubi√≥ i Bellver, a follower of Antoni Gaud√≠. The bank's organisation was founded in 1889 with the money of emigrants who returned prosperous to S√≥ller. On the other hand, the church can clearly be seen standing out from the canopy of the town from other parts of the Vall de S√≥ller (the surrounding valley). The original building dates from some time before 1236. The current main interior structure is now largely baroque (1688‚Äì1733). The campanar (belltower) blends in well with its neo-gothic design. The remarkable fa√ßade is a 1904 construction, also by Joan Rubi√≥. The old street plan is of Islamic origin and lined with historic houses of the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries. The town has a covered market and is bisected by a fast flowing river with a number of bridges. S√≥ller is also notable for the houses built in the early twentieth century by emigrants who returned wealthy to the town, particularly those on the Gran Via which reflect the fin de si√®cle Art Nouveau styles of France. The renowned Jard√≠ Botanic (botanical garden) is on the outskirts of the town and is laid out with the plants of the Balearics and the Mediterranean islands. The Modernista mansion in the garden houses El Museu Balear de Ci√®ncies NaturalsMuseu Balear de Ci√®ncies Naturals (The Museum of Balearic Natural Sciences). Events Since 1980, S√≥ller has hosted a week-long international folklore festival every May.

It has received attention due to speculation that it is actually several centuries older and would thus represent evidence of pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact. Carbon dating shows this belief to be incorrect.  Description  The Newport Tower is located in Touro Park at the top of Mill Street, surrounded by a historical residential neighborhood on the hill above the waterfront tourist district. Eighteenth-century paintings show that the hill itself once furnished a view of the harbor and would have been visible to passing mariners in Narragansett Bay,Painting attributed to Gilbert Stuart (c1770s): Redwood Library and Athenaeum, via chronognostic.org but recent tree growth now obscures the view. The Newport Tower is not exactly circular.

The tower has a height of and an exterior width of . At one time, the interior of the tower was coated with smooth white plaster, the remnants of which may be seen on the interior faces of several pillars. It is supported by eight cylindrical columns that form stone arches, two of which are slightly broader than the other six. Above the arches and inside the tower is evidence of a floor that once supported an interior chamber. The walls are approximately thick, and the diameter of the inner chamber is approximately . The chamber has four windows on what used to be the main floor, and three very small ones at the upper level. Almost directly opposite the west window is a fireplace backed with grey stone and flanked by nooks.\\"Unrolled\\" interior elevation of the Tower about 1% missing at right end, chronognostic.org- accessed 2007-12-11 A representation of the tower is featured prominently on the seal and unit patch of the former US Navy vessel USS Newport. Nothing in early Norse architecture is similar to the Newport Tower in size or appearance. However, this 17th-century windmill near Chesterton, England shares many characteristics with the Newport Tower. The tower is described in a document of 1741 as \\"the old stone mill.\\" It was used as a haymow in 1760, while it was described in 1767 as being used as a powder store \\"some time past\\". De Barres' plan of Newport published in 1776 marks it as \\"Stone Wind Mill.\\" During the American Revolution, the tower was used by the Americans as a lookout and by the British to store munitions.  Construction  The tower is located at the upper end of the plot behind the now-demolished mansion built by Benedict Arnold, the first colonial governor of Rhode Island, who moved from Pawtuxet to Newport in 1651.Not to be confused with his great-grandson General Benedict Arnold of the American Revolutionary War In 1677, Arnold mentions \\"my stone built Wind Mill\\" in his will; the site for his burying ground is between this mill and his mansion and still exists today. The phrase has therefore generally been accepted as referring to the Newport Tower, and is evidence that the tower was once used as a windmill. An illustration from the British \\"Penny Magazine\\" published in 1836 (shown at right) reveals that the tower is of a similar type to Chesterton Windmill, a 17th-century mill near Chesterton, Warwickshire, England. There is a mistaken notion that Arnold was born in Leamington, Warwickshire, only a short distance from Chesterton; the family lived near Limington in Somerset, about away.Fred A. Arnold An account of the English homes of three early \\"proprietors\\" of Providence Providence RI, E.A. Johnson & Co. (1921) via the Internet Archive However, Chesterton windmill stands on a ridge within half a mile of one of the main southwest‚Äìnortheast roads of early modern Britain, which also runs past Limington, and it is entirely plausible that Arnold would have seen it, or perhaps another colonist in a position to influence the design of his \\"stone built windmill\\". √òsterlars Church, Bornholm Various authors have suggested that comparable mediaeval buildings can be found in Europe, particularly the Orphir Round Church on Orkney built in Scotland around 1115, and the round churches on the Danish island of Bornholm, such as √òsterlars Church dating from around 1160.Davis, Graeme. \\"Vikings In America\\", Edinburgh, Birlinn (2011) pp169  Scientific investigations = 1848 mortar comparison  In 1848, the Rev. Dr. Jackson of Newport collected samples of mortar from the mill and some of the oldest known structures in the town, including the very early Bull house (c. 1640), the Easton house (1642‚Äì1643), other houses, and the tombs of Governor Arnold and his wife. Under detailed examination, all proved to be of very similar composition, \\"composed of shell lime, sand, and gravel\\".  1948 excavation  The city of Newport gave permission for a scientific investigation of the site by the Society for American Archaeology in 1948. The investigation was directed by Hugh Henken of Harvard University, with the field work headed by William S. Godfrey. As part of the investigation, a one-meter-wide trench was dug from the tower's exterior through the interior. The results were published in Godfrey's 1951 Ph.D. dissertation and concluded that all the artifacts discovered were from the 17th century. Godfrey's dissertation identifies Benedict Arnold as the builder of the tower, stating that Arnold \\"purchased some of his Newport property, specifically the section on which he later built his house and the stone mill, the year before he moved.... At some period before 1677 Arnold built the Old Stone Mill.\\"Godfrey, Digging a Tower and Laying a Ghost, p.5 There is no evidence for Godfrey's assertion that Arnold \\"built his house\\" in Newport. From Godfrey's thesis: \\"It is strongly suggested by the records that he purchased some of his Newport property, specifically the section on which he later built his house and the Stone Mill, the year before he moved. (Thompkins, 1919, quoting Roger Williams, 1650) The original owner had been Jeremy Clarke, but there is no indication that Clarke ever built on the property.\\" Thompkins wrote: ‚ÄúIt will be noticed as an evidence of Benedict Arnold's prominence that his name is mentioned first in the order, rather than his father, and as an indication of his increasing wealth at the assessment of taxes in Providence in 1650, Benedict Arnold's amount was put at ¬£5, the largest sum assessed against any one individual. In June of this same year Roger Williams, in writing to Gov. Winthrop of Connecticut says, \\"Benedict Arnold having now bought house and land at Newport, proposing thither to remove.\\" Godfrey initially dismissed the Chesterton Mill theory,Godfrey, Digging a Tower and Laying a Ghost, p.17, 18 claiming that \\"on the other hand, there is very little probability that Benedict built his Tower as a mill... the tower mill form, as contrasted to the smock, post and composite forms, was not common in England until the beginning of the 18th century.\\"Godfrey, Digging a Tower and Laying a Ghost, p.177 Godfrey posited the hypothesis that \\"the tower was built as a comfortable retreat and lookout for a very rich and very autocratic old man.\\"William S. Godfrey, Jr., \\"The Archeology of the Old Stone Mill in Newport, Rhode Island,\\" American Antiquity (Feb. 1951), p. 129. However, he later retreated from this position, noting in 1954 that \\"Rex Wailes, noted English expert on windmills... has supported the contention that both structures were built as mills.\\"William Godfrey, \\"Answer to 'Plaster under the Tower,'\\" American Antiquity, vol. 19, no. 3 (Jan. 1954), p. 278. It has since been shown that tower mills were known in England from the late 13th century and that they became increasingly common from the late 16th century onwards.Watts, M. Archaeology of Mills and Milling, Tempus 2002Langdon,J. Watts, M. Tower Windmills in Medieval England: A Case of Arrested Development? Technology and Culture ‚Äì Volume 46, Number 4, The Johns Hopkins University Press, October 2005, pp. 697‚Äì719 Subsequent research has determined that Chesterton was, in fact, built as a windmill in 1632‚Äì33, as the original building accounts have been traced since Wailes' death in 1986, including payments for sailcloths.Warwickshire County Council There are also several surviving 17th-century unarched stone tower mills in North America,Priamo, C Mills of Canada, McGraw-Hill Ryerson 1976 which are similar in appearance to European examples of the same period (e.g., Moulin de Grondines, Quebec (1674) and Moulin de Vincelotte, Quebec (1690)).  1993 carbon-14 dating  In 1993, radiocarbon dating tests of the tower's mortar were undertaken by a team of researchers from Denmark and Finland. The results suggest a probable date of production of the mortar between 1635 and 1698. The tested mortar may date from the tower's initial construction or from repointing, which may have been performed long after initial construction. The researchers drilled \\"deep so as to get past any recent mortar that might have been applied during tuck pointing.\\" In a 2003 report on this and related work, Hale, et al. put the date of the mortar, and thus the tower, at about 1680.  Alternative hypotheses  The Newport Tower, circa 1894 Norse In 1837, Danish archaeologist Carl Christian Rafn proposed a Viking origin for the tower in his book Antiquitates American√¶, partly based on his research of the inscriptions on the Dighton Rock near the mouth of the Taunton River. This hypothesis is predicated on the uncertainty of the southward extent of the early Norse explorations of North America, particularly in regard to the actual location of Vinland. Rafn's popularization of the theory led to a flurry of interest and \\"proofs\\" of Norse settlement in the area.N.E.A.R.A. essay by S. Carlson Henry Wadsworth Longfellow incorporated the Norse-origin view of the tower into his poem \\"The Skeleton in Armor\\".Ehrlich, Eugene and Gorton Carruth. The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States. New York: Oxford University Press, 1982: 71. Philip Ainsworth Means, an archaeologist whose specialty was Andean civilizations, attempted to compile all known evidence surrounding the tower in his 1942 book Newport Tower. As a supporter of the Norse hypothesis, Means dismissed the idea that Arnold built the tower \\"from the ground up.\\" He claimed that the Tower was a church built between the 11th and 14th centuries, citing many architectural features obsolete by the 17th century. Since then, much of Means' evidence has been shown to be mistaken. His assertion is incorrect that a windmill would not have fireplaces because of the fire risk.Derek Ogden, \\"Fireplaces Are Common in Tower Windmills,\\" 'Newport Daily News', 23‚Äì24 March 1996. Several have fireplaces aligned with windows, and it is not unusual to find a double flue exiting the wall, generally with the exits aligned parallel to the prevailing wind to improve the updraft on a relatively short flue. A conventional chimney could not be used, as it would foul the turning cap and sails of the windmill. Examples include the later-built (ca. 1750s) Upholland Windmill, Lancashire, where the fireplace is at second floor level (first floor in British English), as well as Much Wenlock windmill, Shropshire, which has double flues of uncertain purpose rising from the middle floor level, which was constructed in the 18th century.Much Wenlock Windmill Trust Both of the above cited examples post-date the earliest surviving mention of the Stone Mill in a 28 February 1677 deed. Newport Tower, 2008 Observatory hypothesis Four of the eight supporting pillars of the tower face the main points of the compass. In the 1990s, William Penhallow, a Professor of Physics and astronomer at the University of Rhode Island, studied the windows in the tower and said that he found a number of astronomical alignments. At the summer solstice the setting sun should shine through the \\"west\\" window (actually just south of true west) onto a niche in the inner wall, next to the \\"south\\" window. (This no longer happens due to urban development and park trees.) Similarly, the angle from the \\"east\\" window through the \\"west\\" window is about 18 degrees south of west, which is the southern extreme of moonsets during what is known as the \\"lunar minor standstill\\". The smaller windows also form alignments, on significant stars. These alignments could be accidental, but if they were deliberate it would explain why the pattern of windows seems, according to Penhallow, \\"so odd\\". Chinese Author Gavin Menzies argues in 1421: The Year China Discovered America that the tower was built by a colony of Chinese sailors and concubines from the junks of Zheng He's voyages either as a lighthouse or as an observatory to determine the longitude of the colony, based on Penhallow's findings.Penhallow, William S. Astronomical Alignments in Newport Tower, in \\"Across before Columbus?\\", Edgecomb, Maine, New England Antiquities Research Association, 1998. Menzies claimed that the tower closely matches designs used in Chinese observatories and lighthouses elsewhere. However, these claims have been debunked.e.g., K. Seaver Walrus Pitch and Other Novelties: Gavin Menzies and the Far North at the 1421 Exposed website Portuguese During the early 20th century, Edmund B. Delabarre associated the Dighton Rock with the lost Portuguese navigators Miguel Corte-Real and his brother Gaspar. This Portuguese hypothesis has been supported more recently by Manuel Luciano DaSilva, who suggests that one of the Corte-Real brothers built the Newport Tower as a watchtower. The idea of Portuguese construction of the tower was also supported by former U.S. Ambassador Herbert Pell, who in 1948 argued that the tower resembles elements of the Convent of Tomar in Portugal. Medieval Templars British writer Andrew Sinclair has put forth the hypothesis that the Newport Tower was built by medieval Scottish Templars led by Scottish earl Henry Sinclair as part of an alleged voyage to New England about a hundred years before Columbus,Andrew Sinclair, The Sword and the Grail: Of the Grail and Templars and a True Discovery of America (New York: Crown Publishers, 1992), pp. 140‚Äì150. but such a voyage has been vigorously disputed.Brian Smith Earl Henry Sinclair's fictitious trip to America New Orkney Antiquarian Journal, vol. 2 (2002) online at www.alastairhamilton.com See also * Oldest buildings in the United States * List of windmills in Rhode Island * Albinus Hasselgren * Stafford Hill Memorial, a replica of the tower in Cheshire, Massachusetts  References  External links  *Redwood Library site on Newport Tower *\\"The Newport Tower and the Plowden Petition\\" article from Skeptical Intelligencer *F.

In both cases it is the final piece placed during construction and locks all the stones into position, allowing the arch or vault to bear weight. In arches and vaults (such as quasi-domes) keystones are often enlarged beyond the structural requirements and decorated. A variant in domes and crowning vaults is a lantern. Keystones, as a hallmark of strength or good architecture, or their suggested form are sometimes placed in the centre of the flat top of doors, recesses and windows for decorative effect, so as to form an upward projection of a lintel. Although a masonry arch or vault cannot be self-supporting until the keystone is placed, the keystone experiences the least stress of any of the voussoirs, due to its position at the apex. Old keystones can decay due to vibration, a condition known as bald arch. In a rib-vaulted ceiling, keystones commonly mark the intersections of any two or more arched ribs. For aesthetics, keystones are often larger than ribs in vaults and many of the voussoirs (arch stones) in arches, or embellished with a boss. Mannerist architects of the 16th century often designed arches with enlarged and slightly dropped keystones, as in the \\"church house\\" entrance portal at Colditz Castle. Numerous examples are found in the work of Sebastiano Serlio, a 16th-century Italian Mannerist architect. The U.S. state of Pennsylvania calls itself the \\"Keystone State\\", because during early American history, it held a crucial central position among the Thirteen Colonies geographically, economically, and politically, like the keystone in an arch. A keystone is a symbol of Pennsylvania, being used in the logos of many Pennsylvania government departments and on Pennsylvania car license plates.

New York: Atlas Books / HarperCollins, 2005. and wrote to his publisher, Schott Music, that the Opus 126 Bagatelles \\"are probably the best I've written\\".von Irmer (1975, 7) A bagatelle, in Beethoven's usage, is a kind of brief character piece. The set comprises six short works, as follows: #Andante con moto, Cantabile e compiacevole, G major, 3/4 time #Allegro, G minor, 2/4 #Andante, Cantabile e grazioso, E flat major, 3/4 #Presto, B minor, cut time #Quasi allegretto, G major, 6/8 #Presto, cut time then Andante amabile e con moto, E flat major, 3/8 In prefatory remarks to his edition of the works, Otto von Irmer notes that Beethoven intended the six bagatelles be played in order as a single work, at least insofar as this can be inferred from a marginal annotation Beethoven made in the manuscript: \\"Ciclus von Kleinigkeiten\\" (cycle of little pieces). Lewis Lockwood suggests another reason to regard the work as a unity rather than a collection: starting with the second Bagatelle, the keys of the pieces fall in a regular succession of descending major thirds, a pattern Lockwood also notices in Beethoven's \\"Eroica\\" Symphony and the String Quartet, Op. 127.Lockwood (2005, 398) Maurice J. E. Brown, writing in the Grove Dictionary, says of the Bagatelles that they \\"are thoroughly typical of their composer and show affinities with the greater instrumental works written at the same time.\\" Some possible such affinities are as follows: #1 shares the terse, elliptical expression of the first movement of the Piano Sonata Opus 101; #3 shares the style of elaborate, high-register elaboration of a slow melody in triple time, seen in the slow movement of the \\"Hammerklavier\\" Sonata; and the final Bagatelle opens with a chaotic passage reminiscent of the opening of the finale of the Ninth Symphony.

Most trains continue along the Northeast Corridor (NEC) to Pennsylvania Station in New York. Travel time between Harrisburg and New York is approximately 3 hours and 30 minutes, including 1 hour and 45 minutes to travel between Harrisburg and Philadelphia. There are also several express trains which cut both journey times by approximately 15 minutes. A few portions of the route consist of high-speed rail, where it reaches its max speed of , making it one of the four high-speed rail services operated by Amtrak, and one of the five high-speed rail services in the United States. It is Amtrak's fifth-busiest route, and the railroad's third-busiest in the NEC. In fiscal year 2016, the service carried 1.47 million passengers, an increase of 7.9% over FY2015. Total revenue in FY2016 was $41,123,787, an increase of 7.5% over FY2015. The route is primarily funded by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT). History=Takeover from Penn Central The Keystone Service is the successor of numerous services running along the Philadelphia to Harrisburg Main Line dating from 1857, when the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) bought the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad, enabling service between Philadelphia and Harrisburg. By the time the PRR folded into Penn Central in 1968, it operated three types of service on the Main Line: commuter service between and Suburban Station via 30th Street Station, regional service (trains numbered in the 600s) between Harrisburg and Suburban Station via 30th Street Station, and express intercity service like the Broadway Limited and Duquesne, which skipped 30th Street Station entirely and used North Philadelphia station as their only Philadelphia stop. When the Metroliner high-speed program had begun two years earlier, the state had attempted to capitalize on the opportunity to purchase upgraded rolling stock for the 600-series trains. On August 30, 1966, Governor William Scranton of Pennsylvania announced plans to purchase 11 Metroliners for service to replace the Silverliners then used. The cars were ordered through Philadelphia commuter agency SEPTA, as the state was not permitted to contract directly with the PRR. The state, SEPTA, and PRR reached an agreement on November 3rd; the state and SEPTA would each pay $2 million, funded mostly by mass transit grants from the newly formed Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and the PRR would receive a free 15-year lease of the cars. The PRR soon withdrew after complaints from competing Red Arrow Lines and Capitol Trailways, and the HUD grants were later found not to be applicable to intercity service. In June 1968, an agreement was reached where the state Transportation Assistance Authority would pay $2 million and Penn Central would pay $2.5 million for the 11 Metroliners for Harrisburg service. On July 14, a 4-car train was tested on the line, with several demonstration runs for officials on August 21. On February 25, 1970, the cars intended for Harrisburg service completed their performance testing. Penn Central refused to accept the cars, citing numerous technical issues with the cars and their general unsuitability for the service. They had worse acceleration than the Silverliners already in service, tended to overheat when making numerous closely spaced stops, and had difficulty climbing the grade out of Suburban Station. Additionally, the corridor lacked high-level platforms to effectively use the cars, and 15 substations would require expensive modifications. The 11 cars were unused for some time before Penn Central ultimately decided to lease the cars for use on the core New York‚ÄìWashington service. They were moved back to the Budd plant for modifications in April. In July 1970, the state authorized $100,000 to upgrade existing Silverliners for the Harrisburg service instead. When Amtrak was created to take over intercity passenger rail service in 1971, there was substantial debate about whether some trains constituted intercity services (to be either taken over by Amtrak or discontinued, relieving private companies like Penn Central of the financial burden) or commuter services (to be retained by the private companies unless discontinuance was approved by the ICC). Penn Central alleged that several of its regional services ‚Äì the 600-series trains, connecting Lancaster‚ÄìYork buses, Clockers, and New York‚ÄìChatham service ‚Äì were intercity services that could be discontinued since they were not included in Amtrak's initial system. On March 31, 1971, Penn Central filed with ICC to discontinue the 600-series trains at the conclusion of their contract with SEPTA on June 30. The state filed suit against Penn Central on April 7 to stop the discontinuance. On April 23, Penn Central filed in District Court to discontinue the regional services. Five days later, the state and the UTU filed an opposing suit, calling the trains a commuter service. On April 30, Judge John P. Fullam ordered Penn Central to continue operating the trains and referred the case to the ICC. When Amtrak took over intercity service on May 1, 1971, the 600-series trains continued to be operated by Penn Central, though they were listed in Amtrak schedules. The city of Philadelphia and the state both preferred to have Penn Central rather than Amtrak operate the service, as Amtrak was exempt from state control. On June 21, the ICC ruled that the service was not intercity rail, as sought by the state and not by Penn Central. On August 3, Fullam ordered Penn Central to continue operating the regional services. On October 29, 1972, after further negotiations with Penn Central, Amtrak took over operation of the 600-series trains as Silverliner Service, named for the Silverliner cars used to run the trains. Amtrak assumed formal responsibility for the Silverliner Service and Clockers around April 1974. Penn Central (and later Conrail and finally SEPTA Regional Rail) continued to operate Paoli‚ÄìPhiladelphia commuter service. Amtrak took over ticketing for the Silverliner Service and Clockers from Penn Central on July 1, 1975. On October 26, 1975, SEPTA funded an increase from 9 to 11 daily round trips. Amtrak began including a listing of connecting trains to/from New York City in the November 1975 timetable. Declining service In the late 1970s, NJDOT's new Arrow III railcars arrived several years ahead of the completion of electrification projects to allow their use in New Jersey commuter service. Amtrak by this time was desperate for electric propulsion, as the aging GG1 locomotives were reaching the end of their usefulness, replacement E60 locomotives were proving unreliable, and new EMD AEM-7 locomotives were only just beginning to arrive. In April 1978, Amtrak leased 70 of NJDOT's Arrow II cars for use on the Clockers, Keystone Service, and the new Chesapeake. By January 1979, the Arrows were rotated between the Clockers and Silverliner Service. The Arrows had bathrooms and water fountains, making them more suitable for the regional service than the Silverliners. In late 1980, under pressure from NJDOT, Amtrak returned all but 32 of the Arrows, which created a need to find other equipment for the Silverliner Service. Despite being pronounced unsuitable for Harrisburg service a decade before, the Metroliners were the only easily available rolling stock, as they were being slowly retired from the eponymous service. A test run with Metroliners was made on January 20, 1981, and Metroliners were used in revenue service for two weeks in February. Metroliners were used on the New York - Harrisburg Valley Forge for a week in August, and a maintenance facility at Harrisburg opened on October 13, 1981. As the new AEM-7 locomotives continued to arrive, Amtrak assigned them to haul crack Metroliner trains with Amfleet consists and reassigned the less-reliable Metroliners for the secondary Philadelphia‚ÄìHarrisburg service, calling them Capitoliners. On October 25, 1981, the service was rebranded as Keystone Service. All service was then operated by the Metroliners, which lacked the quick acceleration of the Silverliners and Arrows and made them unsuitable for the service. After a single Metroliner set was withdrawn from Clocker service in March 1982, the Keystone Service was the only remaining use of the Metroliners. On April 24, 1983, a pair of weekday trains ‚Äì the 9:54am arrival and 3:55pm departure from Suburban Station ‚Äì were renamed Keystone Executive. Intended to attract riders from the western end of the corridor, the trains made intermediate stops only at Lancaster, Downingtown, and 30th Street, with a 99-minute schedule. The first westbound train of the morning made numerous local stops for commuters to Harrisburg, including some at stations not served by any other Amtrak train. This was first shown in the April 29, 1973 schedule. These one-off stops were gradually dropped: Merion in 1979; 52nd Street and Berwyn in 1980; Radnor and Narberth in 1982; and Bryn Mawr, Overbrook, and Wayne in 1987. Amtrak and SEPTA opened a station in on November 2, 1981 to serve fast-growing suburban areas. The Silverliner Service carried over one million passengers in 1980, but ridership was in steep decline from a variety of factors. On October 30, 1983, Amtrak reduced the service from 11 to 9 weekday round trips, prompting an 8% drop in ridership. A decrease to 6 weekday round trips on January 12, 1986, and 5 round trips on April 27, cut ridership by an additional 45%. The cuts included the termination of the Keystone Executive. Despite the loss of service, fares doubled from 1980 to 1987. The single SEPTA round trip past Paoli to was cut in 1983, but two round trips were restored in March 1985, with additional midday and weekend service in 1988. Service was further extended to in 1990, with lower fares than Amtrak. By 1990, SEPTA carried 595,000 passengers west of Paoli, twice that of Amtrak's ridership on the entire Keystone Service. The Metroliner cars, worn out from nearly two decades of heavy use, began to fail frequently. In April 1985, Amtrak began studying the possibility of removing electrification west of Paoli. On-time performance decreased from around 85% in 1985 to below 60% in early 1988. On January 25, 1988, Amtrak began towing the Metroliner cars with AEM-7 locomotives rather than running them under their own power, although the cars had their pantographs up to power lighting and heating systems. A wreck of the Night Owl four days later two took AEM-7 locomotives out of commission, exacerbating a shortage of electric power available to Amtrak. On February 1, Amtrak converted all Keystone Service trains to diesel power and terminated them on the lower level of 30th Street Station, as diesel-powered trains were not allowed in the tunnels to Suburban Station. The change was listed as \\"temporary\\" on timetables starting on May 15, 1988 and lasting into 1990. After dieselization and the lengthening of schedules, on-time performance jumped up to consistently over 90%. Through service At its inception on May 1, 1971, Amtrak ran two through services on the line: the combined New York‚ÄìChicago Broadway Limited and New York‚ÄìSt. Louis Spirit of St. Louis (soon renamed National Limited), and the Pittsburgh‚ÄìNew York Duquesne (soon renamed Keystone). The former train stopped only at Lancaster and Paoli between Harrisburg and North Philadelphia; it was intended for long-distance travelers between the East Coast and the Midwest rather than local passengers. The Duquesne/Keystone had one additional stop at Coatesville and was intended for medium-distance intercity travel. Amtrak discontinued the Keystone on April 30, 1972, leaving the 600-series trains as the only local service along their route. The Broadway Limited and National Limited were split; they added local stops west of Harrisburg, but passengers from between Harrisburg and Philadelphia had to change trains at Harrisburg, Lancaster, Paoli, or Philadelphia to reach stops west of Harrisburg or north of Philadelphia. On October 28, 1973, Amtrak changed the weekday-only Valley Forge from a Philadelphia‚ÄìNew Haven local train to a Harrisburg‚ÄìNew York City train. It only made the same intermediate stops as the Keystone, including no direct service to 30th Street Station. However, its introduction meant that through passengers no longer had to change at Philadelphia or rely on the Broadway Limited, whose on-time performance had plunged to just 6.8% in 1973. Additional local stops in Pennsylvania were later added. On May 19, 1974, Amtrak added weekend service on the Valley Forge: a Saturday train from Harrisburg to Boston, and a Sunday train from Boston to Harrisburg. The weekend service ended on October 26, 1975. On October 28, 1979, Amtrak and SEPTA began the \\"Ardmore Connection\\": the Valley Forge began stopping at , where a close connection could be made with a SEPTA Paoli‚ÄìPhiladelphia local train. On December 17, 1979, the westbound Valley Forge began stopping at 30th Street rather than bypassing it using the Pittsburgh Subway; however, it retained the Ardmore stop. The Washington sections of the Broadway Limited and National Limited originally split at Harrisburg and reached the Northeast Corridor via the Port Road Branch. The Washington section of the Broadway Limited was rerouted through Philadelphia on October 26, 1975; the National Limited followed suit on October 29, 1978. The National Limited was discontinued entirely on October 1, 1979; the state began funding the Pittsburgh‚ÄìPhiladelphia Pennsylvanian as a replacement on April 27, 1980. At the same time, a pair of Clockers, the westbound Keystone and eastbound Big Apple, were extended to Harrisburg on weekends. They ran within an hour of the Valley Forge's weekday schedule; however, they ran to 30th Street and Suburban stations rather than only serving North Philadelphia. The Keystone was renamed Susquehanna on October 25, 1981. The Big Apple and Susquehanna dropped the Suburban Station stop a year later, but continued to serve 30th Street. On October 30, 1983, the Pennsylvanian was extended to New York City, eliminating the transfer at Philadelphia (although it continued to stop at 30th Street). On January 12, 1986, the eastbound Valley Forge began serving 30th Street (as the westbound had for six years); this allowed it to effectively replace a canceled Keystone Service train (#600, the first morning eastbound) to serve commuters. Amtrak began operating the Atlantic City‚ÄìPhiladelphia Atlantic City Express in 1989, and later extended it along several busy corridors in hopes of increasing ridership. On April 4, 1991, one daily Keystone Service round trip was extended to Atlantic City under the Atlantic City Express brand. Only a weekend round trip continued to be through-routed. The Atlantic City Express was discontinued on April 2, 1995; New Jersey Transit Atlantic City Line trains continue to serve 30th Street Station. Modern improvements In November 1996, as part of a general cutback of Regional Rail service, SEPTA cut service back to Downingtown, leaving Parkesburg and as Amtrak-only stations. Amtrak added the stations to several existing round trips as a result. Amtrak discontinued its stops at and (both served only by a single round trip) on April 5, 1998, reducing the number of suburban stations shared by SEPTA and Keystone Service trains to four. Beginning in 2000, Amtrak and PennDOT spent $166 million to rehabilitate the Philadelphia to Harrisburg Main Line. This included the restoration of fully electrified service, as well as track improvements for a top speed of . When the project was completed and electric service began in October 2006, travel times between Harrisburg and Philadelphia were reduced from 120 minutes to 95 minutes, with further time savings for through trains by eliminating the need for an engine change at Philadelphia. Service was also increased from 11 to 14 daily round trips. By FY 2010, ridership was up 91% since FY 2000 and 58% since FY 2006. Later improvements aimed to develop a sealed corridor without public at-grade crossings, which would allow future speed increases to west of Philadelphia. The last two such at-grade crossings on the line, located just east of Mount Joy, were closed on September 24, 2014. They were replaced with a bridge connecting to a nearby street. Private crossings continue to be used on the line, however. On March 18, 2020 Amtrak temporarily suspended all Keystone Service trains due to declining demand because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Service between Philadelphia and Harrisburg resumed on June 1, 2020, with all-reserved seating.  Operation = Consist  Former Metroliner cab car at Lancaster, Pennsylvania in 2017 A typical Keystone consist usually contains an ACS-64 electric locomotive and five passenger cars, consisting of four Amfleet coaches and a rebuilt Metroliner cab car. As a result of the signal, track, and catenary upgrades that were completed in October 2006, Keystone trains run in a push‚Äìpull mode, one of the few Amtrak services to do so. Before the 2006 upgrades, diesel power (typically a GE Genesis locomotive) was needed between Harrisburg and Philadelphia. The trains consist of unreserved coaches between Harrisburg and Philadelphia and reserved coaches between Philadelphia and New York. There is no business class or snack/food service. However, there is a quiet car on all trains, and free Wi-Fi service is offered. Amenities vary by train.  Service  On weekdays there are thirteen Keystone trains and one Pennsylvanian train in each direction. All trains run between Harrisburg and Philadelphia, with nine Keystone trains plus the Pennsylvanian continuing on to New York. There are eight round-trip trains on both Saturdays and Sundays. All but one, including the Pennsylvanian, make the full trip between Harrisburg and New York. On the majority of the trains, the journey between Harrisburg and New York takes approximately 3 hours and 30 minutes, including 1 hour and 45 minutes to travel between Harrisburg and Philadelphia. There are also several express trains which cut both journey times by approximately 15 minutes each. interactive map) Route The Keystone Service operates over Amtrak-owned trackage: *Amtrak Philadelphia to Harrisburg Main Line, Harrisburg‚ÄìPhiladelphia *Amtrak Northeast Corridor, Philadelphia‚ÄìNew York The route's western terminus, Harrisburg Transportation Center, is the 22nd busiest Amtrak station in the country. Lancaster station, the route's midpoint, is the 21st busiest. Due largely to the significant number of passengers traveling to and from Philadelphia, these stations are among the busiest in the country serving metropolitan areas with fewer than two million people.

His small stature at and 132 lb (68 kg)\\"Lloyd Waner\\" . psu.edu. Retrieved 2010-10-10. made him one of the smallest players of his era. Along with his brother, Paul Waner, he anchored the Pittsburgh Pirates outfield throughout the 1920s and 1930s. After brief stints with four other teams late in his career, Waner retired as a Pirate. Waner finished with a batting average over .300 in ten seasons. He earned a selection to the MLB All-Star Game in 1938. Lloyd and Paul Waner set the record for career hits by brothers in MLB. He was elected into the National Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1967. He worked as a scout for the Pirates and the Baltimore Orioles after retiring as a player. Early life Waner was born on March 16, 1906 in Harrah, Oklahoma, and grew up on a farm with his older brother, Paul. The two worked from dawn to dusk every day, and baseball was their only form of entertainment. Influenced by their father, who was a minor league player in Oklahoma City, Paul and Lloyd's love and natural talent for the game developed over the years. The Waners learned to hit against corncobs and cut down saplings in the woods to use as bats. Lloyd graduated from McLoud High School and attended three semesters at East Central State University in Ada, Oklahoma before going into professional baseball. Waner started his professional baseball career in 1925 with the San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League, but he hit poorly. He was offered a tryout for the Pirates at the urging of his brother, who had been discovered in Ada by Pirates scout Joe Devine. In 1926, he batted .345 in the Class B South Atlantic League. He also won the league's most valuable player award.Parker, p. 52. MLB career=Early career Waner broke into the major leagues with the Pirates in 1927 and quickly built his reputation as a slap hitter with an astute sense of plate discipline. In his rookie campaign, he batted .355 with 223 hits while only striking out 23 times (the highest strikeout total of his career). As the leadoff hitter of the powerful Pittsburgh offense, he led the National League (NL) with 133 runs scored. The runs scored mark set an MLB rookie record. Al L√≥pez said that infielders of the era played deep at their positions, but Waner made them play closer to compensate for his speed as a runner. The Pirates won the 1927 NL pennant; Waner then batted .400 in his only World Series, but the New York Yankees won in four games. He continued to bat well early in his career. He earned a record-setting 678 hits over his first three seasons (1927‚Äì1929). (From 2001 to 2003, Ichiro Suzuki came close to the mark with 662 hits in his first three years.) Waner finished in the top ten in MVP voting 1927 and 1929. Coming off a .353 season in 1929, he missed most of the next year due to appendicitis. He had surgery for the condition in the winter. Waner had difficulty recovering from the surgery and re-entered the hospital in May. The Pittsburgh Press reported the fear that he might have to retire. Middle career He returned in 1931 and led the NL with 214 hits and 681 at-bats while hitting .314. Waner hit .333 the next year and finished 13th in MVP voting, but his average dropped to .276 in 1933. Waner's average increased to .283 and then .309 over the next two years, though he did not lead the league in any offensive categories or place in the MVP voting during those seasons. In January 1936, Waner became ill with pneumonia and his condition was initially said to be critical. He recovered and was back on the field by late April. Waner hit between .313 and .330 between 1936 and 1938, earning an MLB All-Star Game selection in 1938. Later career After splitting time in the early 1940s with the Boston Braves, Cincinnati Reds, Philadelphia Phillies, and Brooklyn Dodgers, Waner returned to Pittsburgh, where he finished his career. In September 1945, he asked team president William Benswanger for his release, saying, \\"The old legs just won't hold up anymore and I'm convinced that I'm through.\\" He compiled a career .316 batting average, batting .300 or higher in ten seasons. Waner was also an accomplished center fielder. He led the league in putouts four times, using his excellent speed to cover the spacious Forbes Field outfield. He recorded a career .983 fielding percentage at that position. He (2,459) and his older brother Paul (3,152) hold the career record for hits by brothers (5,611), outpacing the three Alou brothers and the three DiMaggio brothers, among others. For most of the period from 1927 to 1940, Paul patrolled right field at Forbes Field while Lloyd covered the ground next to him in center. On September 15, 1938, the brothers hit back-to-back home runs against Cliff Melton of the New York Giants. Paul was known as \\"Big Poison\\" and Lloyd as \\"Little Poison\\". They got their nicknames from a Brooklyn Dodgers fan's pronunciation of \\"Big Person\\" and \\"Little Person\\", which was then picked up by a sportswriter in the stands. In 1927, the season the brothers accumulated 460 hits, the fan is said to have remarked, \\"Them Waners! It's always the little poison on thoid (third) and the big poison on foist (first)!\\"\\"Lloyd Waner's Obit\\". thedeadballera.com.

Later life Baseball Hall of Fame After retiring as a player, Waner was a scout for Pittsburgh from 1946 to 1949. He filled the same role with the Baltimore Orioles in 1955. He worked for the city of Oklahoma City between 1950 and 1967. Lloyd and Paul Waner both struggled with alcohol abuse. Lloyd Waner Jr. said that while Paul \\"drank like a fish when he was playing ball\\",Parker, p. 282. Lloyd's drinking intensified after his playing career was over. Lloyd Jr. said that the brothers would have been better known and would have enjoyed their later lives more were it not for alcohol.Parker, p. 291. In 1950, Lloyd and Paul Waner lost their older brother, Ralph Waner, when he was fatally shot by his ex-wife Marie. Ralph had been eating a steak dinner with his girlfriend when Marie came into the restaurant. Ralph and Marie both became angry. As they started to walk outside, Marie pulled out a gun. Ralph was shot twice, then struggled for the weapon. It went off one more time, injuring Marie. Ralph died a short time later.Parker, p. 286. Ralph had held numerous roles in organized baseball in Pennsylvania. Waner was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1967. Sabermetrician Bill James has listed Waner as one of ten examples of Hall of Fame inductees who do not deserve the honor.\\"Bill James Answers All Your Baseball Questions\\", an April 2008 entry from the Freakonomics blog Possible reasons for his selection include his brother being a fellow inductee and the inflated batting averages of his era, which helped many players from the 1920s and 1930s in the eyes of the Veterans Committee. Late in Waner's life, writer Donald Honig asked him about a previous quote in which Waner said that he would have played baseball for free. \\"I think I would have asked for expenses\\", Waner reflected. Lloyd gave up drinking in the last four or five years of his life and Lloyd Jr. said that \\"it was like having a real father around... I'll always treasure that period.\\" In 1982, Waner died of complications related to emphysema. He was survived by his wife Frances and his two children.

Doctor of Medicine (abbreviated M.D., from the Latin Medicinae Doctor) is a medical degree, the meaning of which varies between different jurisdictions. In Canada and most other countries, the M.D. denotes an undergraduate degree awarded upon graduation from medical school. In the United States, and some other countries, the M.D. denotes a professional graduate degree. In the United States, this generally arose because many in 18th-century medical professions trained in Scotland, which used the M.D. degree nomenclature. In England, however, Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery was used and eventually in the 19th century became the standard in Scotland too. Thus, in the United Kingdom, Ireland and other countries, the M.D. is a research doctorate, higher doctorate, honorary doctorate or applied clinical degree restricted to those who already hold a professional degree in medicine; in those countries, the equivalent professional to the North American and some others use of M.D. is still typically titled Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (M.B.B.S.). History The thesis presented by Claude Bernard to obtain his doctorate of medicine (1843) The first medical degrees were awarded by the Schola Medica Salernitana around the year 1000, including to women such as Trota of Salerno. The degrees received legal sanction in 1137 by Roger II of Sicily and in 1231 by Emperor Federico II, in the Constitution of Melfi. In the titles XLIV- LXXXIX of the third book of the Constitutions of 1231, it was established that the activity of a doctor could only be carried out by doctors holding a medical degree, the Licentia Medendi (license to practice medicine), by the Schola Medica Salernitana (the only school in the kingdom authorized to award degrees in medicine). This degree was awarded after a curriculum composed of three years of study of logic, five years of medical studies, an examination of a commission composed of the professors of the University, a one-year apprenticeship with an expert doctor, and a final examination before the Commissioners of the Royal Curia and the Provincial Curias. In 1703, the University of Glasgow's first medical graduate, Samuel Benion, was issued with the academic degree of Doctor of Medicine. University medical education in England culminated with the MB qualification, and in Scotland the M.D., until in the mid-19th century the public bodies who regulated medical practice at the time required practitioners in Scotland as well as England to hold the dual Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery degrees (MB BS/MBChB/MB BChir/BM BCh etc.). North American medical schools switched to the tradition of the ancient universities of Scotland and began granting the M.D. title rather than the MB beginning in the late 18th century. The Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York (which at the time was referred to as King's College of Medicine) was the first American university to grant the M.D. degree instead of the MB. Early medical schools in North America that granted the Doctor of Medicine degrees were Columbia, Penn, Harvard, Maryland, and McGill. These first few North American medical schools that were established were (for the most part) founded by physicians and surgeons who had been trained in England and Scotland. A feminine form, \\"Doctress of Medicine\\" or Medicinae Doctrix, was also used by the New England Female Medical College in Boston in the 1860s.Samuel Gregory, MD. (1868) Doctor or Doctress? Boston: Trustees of New England Female Medical College. In most countries having a Doctor of Medicine degree does not mean that the individual will be allowed to practice medicine. Typically a doctor must go through a residency for at least three years and take some form of licensing examination in their jurisdiction. By country=Professional degrees Afghanistan = In Afghanistan, medical education begins after high school. No pre-medicine courses or bachelor's degree is required. Eligibility is determined through the rank applicants obtain in the public university entrance exam held every year throughout the country. Entry to medical school is competitive, and only students with the highest ranks are accepted into medical programs. The primary medical degree is completed in 7 years. According to the new medical curriculum (from 2016), during the 12th semester, medical students must complete research on a medical topic and provide a thesis as part of their training. Medical graduates are awarded a certificate in general medicine, regarded \\"MD\\" and validated by the \\"Ministry of Higher Education of Afghanistan\\". All physicians are to obtain licensing and a medical council registration number from the \\"Ministry of Public Health\\" before they officially begin to practice. They may subsequently specialize in a specific medical field at medical schools offering the necessary qualifications. After graduation, students may complete residency. The MD specification: Before the civil wars in Afghanistan, medical education used to be taught by foreign professors or Afghan professors who studied medical education abroad. The Kabul medical institute certified the students as \\"Master of Medicine\\". After the civil wars, medical education has extremely changed, and the MD certification has been reduced to \\"Medicine Bachelor\\". =Argentina= In Argentina, the First Degree of Physician or Physician Diplomate () is equivalent to the North American MD Degree with six years of intensive studies followed by usually three or four years of residency as a major specialty in a particular empiric field, consisting of internships, social services and sporadic research. Only by holding a Medical Title can the postgraduate student apply for the Doctor degree through a Doctorate in Medicine program approved by the . =Australia= Historically, Australian medical schools have followed the British tradition by conferring the degrees of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) to its graduates whilst reserving the title of Doctor of Medicine (MD) for their research training degree, analogous to the PhD, or for their higher or honorary doctorates. Although the majority of Australian MBBS degrees have been graduate programs since the 1990s, under the previous Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) they remained categorized as Level 7 Bachelor's degrees together with other undergraduate programs. The latest version of the AQF includes the new category of Level 9 Master's (Extended) degrees which permits the use of the term 'Doctor' in the styling of the degree title of relevant professional programs. As a result, various Australian medical schools have replaced their MBBS degrees with the MD to resolve the previous anomalous nomenclature. With the introduction of the Master's level MD, universities have also renamed their previous medical research doctorates. The University of Melbourne was the first to introduce the MD in 2011 as a basic medical degree, and has renamed its research degree to Doctor of Medical Science (DMedSc). =Austria= In Austria, medical studies (medicine or dentistry) take 6 years full-time. In medicine, the first two years comprise basic fields of medicine such as anatomy, biology, chemistry, physics, physiology, etc., the next three years consist of all medical fields in the narrower sense with frequent bedside training and medical traineeships while the sixth and last year is dedicated solely to working in a clinic. After this, a specific 6-year training (e.g. in internal medicine, paediatrics, ENT, pathology) or 4 year (GP) can be started; without this training, working with patients is forbidden. There is no central placement test for said specialist training, only a board-registered spot as a resident/registrar is needed. As with all other studies in Austria, there is no tuition but compulsory students' insurance (approx. 38 ‚Ç¨ per year). A specific entrance exam (MedAT, Medizin- Aufnahmetest, medicine acceptance test) has to be taken but is open only once a year in summer; a fee of 110 ‚Ç¨ has to be paid. In 2019, 16.443 persons registered for the MedAT and 12.960 took the test.https://www.aufnahmepruefung.at/medizin-studieren-tausende-kaempften- heuer-wieder-fuer-ihren-traum/ 1.680 university places for both medicine and dentistry are offered each year with 95% of all places for EU citizens and 75% for applicants with an Austrian higher education entrance qualification/GCE A-levels. Many Germans who are denied studying in their home country try to study medicine in Austria; hence this quota was introduced and approved by the EU as most of them leave upon graduation.https://www.wienerzeitung.at/nachrichten/politik/europa/892593-Keine- EU-Einwaende-mehr-gegen-Quotenregelung.html The title of \\"Doktor\\" is granted to physicians (Dr. med. univ., Doctor medicinae universae, Dr. der gesamten Heilkunde = Dr. \\"of the entire art of healing\\") and dentists (Dr. med. dent., Doctor medicinae dentinae), who do not possess doctorate degrees, but Master's level 6 year-training, similar to the American MD or DDS. although they have to write a diploma thesis of approx. 50-100 pages. Some of which are published in peer-reviewed journals while others are not. A post-graduate research doctorate (Dr. scient. med., Dr. scientiae medicinae, or PhD) can be obtained after a three years post-graduate study at a medical university. All doctors may be addressed as \\"Doktor ______\\", and the title is usually contracted to \\"Dr. ______\\". In many everyday-day settings in Austria, also outside the clinic, it is common to address medical doctors solely as \\"Herr/Frau Doktor\\" (Mr./Ms./Mrs. doctor) without any specific family name (especially in rural areas and small villages, and by older people), and they are often viewed as the \\"real doctors\\". Among themselves, MDs don't use \\"doctor\\" as an appellation but just \\"Herr Kollege/Frau Kollegin\\" (Mr./Ms/Mrs. = \\"dear\\" colleague). Consistent use of \\"Doktor\\" when addressing another medical doctor is seen as confrontative and mockery. =Belgium= In the French-speaking part of Belgium, the medical degree awarded after six years of study is \\"Docteur en M√©decine\\". Physicians would then have to register with the Ordre des M√©decins to practice medicine in the country. =Bosnia and Herzegovina= In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the title of \\"doktor medicine\\" (abbreviated \\"dr. med.\\") is awarded upon completion of six years of study at a Faculty of Medicine (\\"medicinski fakultet\\") immediately after high school. =Bulgaria= At the end of the six-year medical programs from Bulgarian medical schools, medical students are awarded the academic degree Master/Magister in Medicine and the professional title Physician - Doctor of Medicine (MD / MA ). =Cambodia= After 6 years of general medical education (a foundation year plus 5 years), all students will graduate with a Bachelor of Medical Sciences (BMedSc, ), equivalent to Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS). This degree does not allow graduates to work independently as a physician, but it is possible for those who wish to continue to master's degrees in other fields relating to medical sciences such as public health, epidemiology, biomedical science, and nutrition. Medical graduates, who wish to be fully qualified as physicians or specialists must follow the process as below: *General Practitioner's (GP) course of 8 years (BMedSc plus a 2-year internship). Clinical rotation during the internship is modulated within four main disciplines (general medicine, surgery, gynecology, and pediatrics). The medical certification awarded is Diploma of Doctor of Medicine (MD, ) ‚Äì equivalent to a master's degree [?]. *After graduating with BMedSc; any students who wish to enter a 'Residency Training Program', are required to sit for an Residency Entrance Exam. The duration of the programs takes 4 years after either BMedSc or MD (BMedSc or MD plus 4 years of specialization). Once the graduates have successfully defended their practical thesis, they are awarded the Diploma of Specialized Doctor (MD with specialization, ). All medical graduates must complete a 'Thesis Defense' and pass the National Exit Exam () to become either GPs or medical or surgical specialists. Last but importantly, those GPs or MDs have to register their name in the Cambodian Medical Committee (CMC) to receive the license to see patients, and pay for the registration every year. =Canada= In Canada, the M.D. is the degree required to practice medicine. Similar to the United States, students in Canada from English-speaking provinces must attain a Bachelor's, then pass the MCAT at which point they move into the typical 4-year medical school curriculum. The notable exception is the French-speaking province of Quebec, where their special CEGEP post-secondary institutions don't grant a Bachelor's, but instead College Education Diplomas (DECs). Students typically enroll in a 2-year Science Program such as Health Science, Pure & Applied, or Environmental (latter exclusive to CEGEP Dawson College) which lead into the one-year med-p at Quebec universities, where students catch up on what they need, at which point it resumes like any other province and students pass the 4-year curriculum. This in total means the path to graduation from medical school is one year shorter for Quebec students (7 as opposed to 8). McGill University Faculty of Medicine is the only medical school in Canada that continues to award the M.D., C.M. degrees (abbreviated M.D.C.M.). M.D.C.M. is from the Latin Medicinae Doctorem et Chirurgiae Magistrum meaning \\"Doctor of Medicine and Master of Surgery\\". Upon graduation, students enter into a residency phase of training. Prior to obtaining an independent practicing license from a provincial regulatory body, students must complete the Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examination to obtain the Licentiate of the Medical Council of Canada (LMCC) qualification.https://mcc.ca/about/lmcc/ =Chile= In Chile, medical education begins after graduating high-school, in public or private universities, which select candidates based on a national entrance exams (former University Selection Test, now in transition to a new selection test). Public universities and private universities cost around US$8,000 - US$12,000 a year. In almost every university the career lasts for 7 years, the first two being basic sciences, then three years of preclinical studies, and ending with two years of supervised clinical practice (internship, or ‚Äúinternado‚Äù) both at hospitals and ambulatory centers. Upon graduation, students obtain the professional title \\"M√©dico Cirujano\\", equivalent to Doctor of Medicine (MD). After graduation every new physician must take the EUNACOM (National Exam of Medical Knowledge), which gives the ability to practise medicine in public establishments of primary or hospital care. The title enables the graduate to practise as a General Practitioner, and many of them may follow specialization studies in clinical or non-clinical fields. There is a national program of accreditation, mandatory to every Medicine School. In Chile, physicians receive the courtesy denomination of Doctor followed by their family name, even though in an academic environment the medical title isn't accepted as an equivalent to PhDs; regardless, at community and family level, and in day-to-day activities, they are often viewed as \\"real doctors\\". =China= In China, many prestigious research universities such as Peking Union Medical College, Peking University Health Science Center, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University offer the 8-year Doctor of Medicine program. In the meantime, the majority of primary medical training comes in the form of a 5-year Bachelor of Medicine degree, which includes 2.5 years of basic science and biomedical science training and 2.5 years of clerkship training. Graduates from such programs are eligible to sit for Medical Doctor License Examination in China providing they are working as resident physicians in a hospital. Many of the young doctors do seek further training by entering a 3-year Master of Medicine (clinical track) program or 5-year Doctor of Medicine (clinical track). Some take a job/promotion after the 3-year program and work for a number of years and then take on another 3 years of training to get the ultimate Doctor of Medicine degree. =Croatia= In Croatia, the title of \\"doktor medicine\\" (abbreviated \\"dr. med.\\") is awarded upon completion of six years of study at a Faculty of Medicine (\\"medicinski fakultet\\") immediately after high school. =Cuba= In Cuba, the title of \\"Doctor en Medicina\\" (Doctor in Medicine) is awarded upon completion of six years of study at a University of Medical Sciences after high school. Medicine was one of the four foundational careers of the first Cuban university named Real y Pontificia Universidad de San Jeronimo de La Habana (current University of Havana) founded in 1728. =Dominican Republic= In the Dominican Republic, it is known as \\"Doctor en Medicina\\" (Doctor in Medicine). In 1511 the Spanish Catholic church founded the first university of the Americas in Santo Domingo present capital of modern-day Dominican Republic and name it Universidad Santo Tomas de Aquino (today Universidad Autonoma de Santo Domingo). In 1630 this university graduated the first medical doctors of the Americas and amongst the graduates some Native Americans included. =Ecuador= In Ecuador, medical school begins after graduating high-school. There are two options; applying to public or private universities. Both private and public university select their candidates based on entrance exams. Public universities are free while private universities cost around 6,000 - US$12,000 a year. In most universities, the carrier lasts for 6 years. After graduating, students obtain a degree of ‚Äúm√©dico‚Äù or \\"m√©dico cirujano\\", depending which one is offered by each university. Both degrees are equivalent to doctor of medicine (MD). =France= After graduating from high school with a Baccalaureat, any student can register at a university of medicine (there are about 30 of them throughout the country). Until 2018, at the end of the first year, an internal ranking examination took place at each of these universities in order to implement the numerus clausus. This ranking examination and the numerus clausus has since been abolished. First year consists primarily of theoretical classes such as biophysics and biochemistry, anatomy, ethics or histology. Passing first year is generally considered very challenging, requiring hard and continuous work. Each student can only try twice. For example, the Universit√© Ren√© Descartes welcomes about 2,000 students in the first year and only 300 after numerus clausus. The second and third year are usually quite theoretical although the teachings are often accompanied by placements in the field (e.g., internships as nurses or in the emergency room, depending on the university). During their fourth, fifth and sixth years, medical students get a special status called \\"externe\\" (In some universities, such as Pierre et Marie Curie, the externe status is given beginning in the third year). They work as interns every morning at the hospital plus a few night shifts a month and study in the afternoon. Each internship lasts between three and four months and takes place in a different department. Med students get five weeks off a year. At the end of the sixth year, they need to pass a national ranking exam, which will determine their specialty. The first student gets to choose first, then the second, etcetera. Usually, students work hard during the fifth and sixth years in order to train properly for the national ranking exam. During these years, actual practice at the hospital and in conjunction with some theoretical courses are meant to balance the training. Such externs' average wage stands between 100 and 300 euros a month. After taking those ranking exams, students can start as residents in the specialty they have been able to pick. That is the point from which they also start getting paid. Towards the end of the medical program, French medical students are provided with more responsibilities and are required to defend a thesis; however, unlike a PhD thesis, no original research is actually necessary to write an MD thesis. At the conclusion of the thesis defense, French medical students receive a State Diploma of Doctor of Medicine (MD, ). Every new doctor must then proceed to a Diploma of Specialised Studies (DES, ) to mark their specialty. Some students may also receive a Diploma of Complementary Specialized Studies (DESC, ). =Georgia= In Georgia, medical universities in Georgia offer a 6-year curriculum leading to award Doctor of Medicine (MD) \\"Physician\\" \\"Medical Doctor (MD), a European medical degree which is valid throughout the world. Some of the reputed medical universities include Tbilisi State Medical University, Akaki Tsereteli State University and Petre Shotadze Tbilisi Medical AcademyTbilisi Medical Academy =Germany= The University of Freiburg Faculty of Medicine After at least six years of medical school, the students graduate with a final federal medical exam '. Graduates receive their license to practice medicine and the professional title of physician ('). About 80% of them additionally obtain the academic degree Doctor of Medicine (Dr. med.).U. Beisiegel: Promovieren in der Medizin. Die Position des Wissenschaftsrates. In: Forschung & Lehre 7/09, 2009, S. 491\\\\. The European Research Council ruled in 2010 that a Dr. med. doctorate alone is not considered equivalent to a PhD research degree for the purpose of selection for ERC Starting Grants, requiring additional evidence (e.g., proof of an appointment that requires doctoral equivalency, such as a post-doctoral fellowship) for the overall training to be considered equivalent to a PhD.https://erc.europa.eu/content/erc-policy-phd-and-equivalent-doctoral- degrees-2016 =Guyana= In Guyana, Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree is awarded after the completion of 4 years or 5 years of study. Texila American University, Green Heart University, American International School of Medicine, Alexander American University, Lincoln American University provides medicine programs. =Hungary= In Hungary, after six years of medical school, which includes a sixth-year internship, students are awarded the degree of 'orvosdoktor' (Doctor of Medicine) degrees. =Indonesia= In Indonesia, the title of \\"dokter\\" (dr.) is awarded after 3-3.5 years of study (at least) and 1.5‚Äì2 years of clinical course in university hospitals. After a medical student finished those five years of study, they need to take \\"Uji Kompetensi Mahasiswa Program Profesi Dokter\\" (UKMPPD). If they pass the test, they can take Hippocrates Oath and the title of Dokter (dr.) is entitled before their name. Then they need to take a year-long internship course in primary health care clinics (also known as Puskesmas) or primary hospitals all over the country to practice as general practitioner under supervision of senior doctors. Those who wished to further their study into specialties can take graduate course of medicine of their preference and will be entitled with \\"Specialist of ...\\" after their name (e.g.: Sp.A for Spesialis Anak = Pediatrician). Graduate course of medicine is equal with residency program which is required the candidates to study for four years and hospital internship. Note that \\"dr.\\" is used for medical graduates, while Dr. (or wrongfully DR.), that is Doktor is used for PhD holders. =Iran= In Iran, Medical education begins after high school. No pre-med course or BSc degree is required. The eligibility is determined through the rank applicants obtain in the public university entrance exam being held every year throughout the country. The entry to medical school is competitive and only students with the highest rank are accepted into medical program. The primary medical degree is completed in 7‚Äì7.5 years. On the final years (last 1‚Äì2 years) medical students need to do a research on a medical topic and provide thesis as part of their trainings. Medical graduates are awarded a certificate in general medicine, called \\"Professional Doctorate in Medicine\\" validated by the \\"Ministry of Health and Medical Education of Iran\\". All physicians will obtain license and medical council registration number from the \\"Medical Council of Iran\\" before they officially begin to practice. They may subsequently specialize in a specific medical field at medical schools offering the necessary qualifications. =Israel= There are six university medical schools in Israel, including the Technion in Haifa, Ben Gurion University in Be'er Sheva, Tel Aviv University, the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, the Medical school of the Bar-Ilan University in Safed and Ariel University. They all follow the European 6-year model except Bar-Ilan University and Ariel University, which has a four-year program similar to the US system. However, as of 2009, Tel Aviv University has introduced a four-year program similar to the US system for students with a bachelor's degree in certain biological sciences. The entrance requirements of the various schools of medicine are very strict. Israeli students require a high school Baccalaureate average above 100 and psychometric examination grade over 740, which corresponds to the 99th percentile. Candidates achieving these demanding cognitive requirements are then selected according to their ranking in the Mor and Mirkam MMI personality tests. Approximately 30% of applicants pass the Mor and Mirkam tests and are accepted into medical school. The demand for medical education is strong and growing, and there is a lack of doctors in Israel. The Technion Medical School, Ben Gurion University, and Tel Aviv University Sackler Faculty of Medicine offer 4-year MD programs for American students who have American college degrees and have taken the MCAT interested in completing rigorous medical education in Israel before returning to the US or Canada. In Israel, the degree of Doctor of Medicine (MD) is considered to be equivalent to a master's degree academically and legally. =Italy= In Italy, before the Bologna process, the degree of \\"Dottore in Medicina e Chirurgia\\" (literally Doctor in Medicine and Surgery, from the Latin Medicinae Doctor et Chirurgiae) is awarded after completion of at least six years of study and clinical training in a university and after the submission of a thesis, that consists of original research. However, spurred by the Bologna process, a major reform instituted in 1999 to align University programmes with the more universal system of undergraduate (Bachelor's degree) and postgraduate studies (Master's and Doctoral degrees) and as such the degree of 'Dottore in Medicina e Chirurgia' is no longer offered and was replaced with the 'Laurea Magistrale in Medicina e Chirurgia' (Master of Medicine and Surgery). In this context, the new Laurea Magistrale a ciclo unico in Medicina e Chirurgia is a six-year second cycle degree, equivalent to a master's degree (360 ECTS credits) which can be earned in a six-year programme and requires a scientific research thesis. Consequently, the new medical degrees in Italy is considered to be equivalent to a Master's degree academically and legally. =Latvia= In Latvia, the duration of basic medical education is six years and the course leads to the degree of Doctor of Medicine. =Malaysia= In Malaysia, there are two types of MDs, one being for a basic medical degree while the other being a doctoral degree, depending on the awarding universities. The basic medical degree MDs (Similar to the MBBS awarded by other local universities) are awarded by both private and public universities, mostly are trained as a undergraduate 5-year course, however, with the establishment of Perdana University, it became the first university in Malaysia to provide a 4-year graduate entry course. Examples of universities in Malaysia offering the M.D degree are University Sains Malaysia, National University of Malaysia, University Putra Malaysia, UCSI University, etc. MDs are being awarded as a doctoral degree in public universities such as University of Malaya. =Philippines= In the Philippines, the MD is a first professional degree in medicine. To be accepted in Philippine medical schools, one must have finished a college degree before one can proceed to have a medical education. It is attained by either completing a 4-year degree or a 5-year degree (with internship included) from an accredited institution private and public Medical School by the Association of Philippine Medical Colleges and the Commission on Higher Education. The MD degree does not permit the practice of medicine but qualifies the degree-holder to apply for registration to the Professional Regulatory Commission. Registration to the Commission through completion of internship and examinations will grant the privilege of practicing medicine in the Philippines. Moreover, the licensed Physician has the option to proceed for medical specialization and the taking of diplomate board examinations conducted by the respective board of medical specialists in a particular field. =Poland= In Poland the title of lekarz (physician, medical doctor) or \\"lek.\\" is granted after completing a 6-year medical program (students apply to it directly after graduating high school). Many medical schools in Poland also offer medicine programs in English, which award the Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree. In contrast, a higher doctoral academic research degree in medicine resembling a PhD is named \\"dr n. med.\\" or doktor nauk medycznych (Doctor of Medical Sciences). Specialization is valued similarly to a specialization in the English system. It is not a pre-requisite for a \\"dr. n. med.\\" which is an academic, not a professional title in Poland. =Romania= Romanian medical programs last for 6 years (including clinical practice), which is the long-cycle first professional degree and concludes with a final licensing examination (licen»õa), based on the dissertation of the student's original research. The degree awarded is 'Doctor-Medic' and graduates are entitled to use the title \\"Dr.\\" =Russia= Medical universities in Russia offer a six-year curriculum leading to award a professional graduate degree, called of \\"specialist\\" (Diploma of Specialist; in medicine, Diploma of Physician (Doctor of Medicine)).https://www.ecfmg.org/certification/reference-guide.html Whereas, the title of Doctor of Medical Sciences (, \\"doktor medicinskix nauk\\" abbreviated –¥. –º. –Ω.) is a higher research doctoral degree, which may be earned after the Candidate of Medical Sciences (the latter is informally regarded in Russia as equivalent to the Ph.D.). =Serbia= In Serbia, MD degree is awarded upon completion of six years of study at a Faculty of Medicine immediately after high school. =Singapore= The American Duke University has a medical school based in Singapore (Duke-NUS Medical School), and follows the North-American model of styling its first professional degree \\"Doctor of Medicine\\" (\\"MD\\"), consid. By contrast, the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine at the National University of Singapore confers MB BS as the first professional degree. =Slovakia= Slovakia's medical education is offered at three medical schools in the country. Two of them are faculties of the Comenius University, which are the Faculty of Medicine in Bratislava, and the Jessenius School of Medicine in Martin, while the third one is the Pavol Josef ≈†afarik University in Ko≈°ice. Both the Jessenius School of Medicine and the Faculty of Medicine in Ko≈°ice has several international students. The Jessenius School of Medicine has almost a thousand international students, most from Norway. Admission to the medical schools is based on entrance examination that can be undergone once a year. The program is a 6-year program in general medicine with a strictly preclinical and clinical division. The preclinical years are the two first, and are purely theoretical. They consist of subjects such as cell biology, genetics, biophysics, medical chemistry, anatomy, biochemistry, histology, embryology and so on. From the third year onwards, the study is integrated with practical learning at the faculty's associated teaching hospital, including major multi-year subjects such internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, etc. In the sixth and final year, the student must pass four final state examinations and defend a self-composed thesis in order to graduate with a professional doctorate granting them the title of MUDr. for practicing in Slovakia or the Czech Republic or MD when practicing outside of Slovakia. =Slovenia= In Slovenia, the title of \\"doktor medicine\\" (abbreviated \\"dr. med.\\") is awarded upon completion of six years of study at one of the two Slovenian Faculties of Medicine (\\"medicinska fakulteta\\") in Ljubljana or Maribor. Studying at these faculties is only possible if the student has finished a gymnasium/grammar school (\\"gimnazija\\") with a general diploma called \\"splo≈°na matura\\". =South Korea= In South Korea, there is a Medical Doctor (MD) license. The medical educations in South Korea (Republic of Korea) are 6 or 4 years in duration, 6-year courses starting right after high schools, and 4-year course starting after 4-year's university education (to start the 4-year course, the student needs a bachelor's degree). The first 2 years in the 6-year system is composed of basic sciences and liberal art courses. =Taiwan= In Taiwan, the MD is a first awarded professional degree that goes up and beyond the limits of upper education. =Thailand= The Thai medical education follows the 6-year European system, consisting of 1 year in basic-science, 2 years in pre- clinical training, and 3 years for clinical training. Upon graduation, all medical students must pass national medical licensing examinations and a university-based comprehensive test. After medical school, newly graduated doctors are under contract to spend a year of internship and 2 years of tenure in rural areas before they are eligible for any other residency positions or specialized training. The students will receive Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree. However, the degree is equivalent to master's degree in Thailand. Specialty training after the MD degree requires at least 4‚Äì6 years residency program in the training university hospitals and must pass the board examination. Board-certified specialized degree is equivalent to doctorate degree. =Tunisia= In Tunisia, education is free for all Tunisian citizens and for foreigners who have scholarships. The oldest Medical school is a faculty of the University of Tunis. There are four medicine faculties situated in the major cities of Tunis, Sfax, Sousse and Monastir. Admission is bound to the success and score in the baccalaureate examination. Admission score threshold is very high, based on competition among all applicants throughout the nation. Medical school curriculum consists of six years. The first two years are medical theory (PCEM), containing all basic sciences related to medicine, and the last four years (DCEM) consists of clinical issues related to all medical specialties. During these last four years, the student gets the status of \\"Externe\\". The student has to attend at the university hospital every day, rotating around all wards. Every period is followed by a clinical exam regarding the student's knowledge in that particular specialty. After those five years, there are two years on internship, in which the student is a physician but under the supervision of the chief doctor; the student rotates over the major and most essential specialties during period of four months each. After that, student has the choice of either passing the residency national exam or extending his internship for another year, after which he gains the status of family physician. The residency program consists of four to five years in the specialty he qualifies, depending on his score in the national residency examination under the rule of highest score chooses first. Whether the student chooses to be a family doctor or a specialist, he has to write a doctoral thesis, which he will be defending in front of a jury, after which he gains his degree of Docteur d'√©tat en Medecine (MD). =Turkey= In Turkey, the title of \\"Tƒ±p Doktoru\\" (literally \\"Doctor of Medicine\\") is awarded upon completion of six years continuous study started with five years university education include three years basic sciences, two years clinical courses followed by one year of internship in university hospitals. The internal structure and methodology of training vary among universities; however vertical integration between basic and clinical sciences and horizontal integration between disciplines have become more prevalent approaches as well as student oriented practices. Regardless of the university, the whole program is equivalent to a combined degree of bachelors and masters, thus every students graduates with a master's degree. The graduates, becoming Doctors of Medicine, are eligible to practice general medicine through state assigned slots, start residency training through a state exam called \\"TUS\\"(short for \\"Tƒ±pta Uzmanlƒ±k Sƒ±navƒ±\\"), or apply for a PhD program in a relevant field. =Ukraine= In Ukraine, by 2018, graduates of the school with completed secondary education that have coped with the relevant exams (in the disciplines designated by these universities) in the nationwide system for assessing graduates' knowledge - EIT (, External independent testing) based on the rating - may be admitted to the Medical Universities.–í–∏—â—ñ –Ω–∞–≤—á–∞–ª—å–Ω—ñ –º–µ–¥–∏—á–Ω—ñ –∑–∞–∫–ª–∞–¥–∏ –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏ Ukrainian medical universities offer a 6-year curriculum, which should end with the passing of the State Complex Examination. The graduate receives the Diploma of the State Standard with the title \\"Specialist Diploma\\", which specifies a specialty and qualification (for example, \\"Physician\\"), or \\"Magister's Diploma\\" also of a state standard. After that, the graduate according to the rating division (at the university) is required to undergo a practical internship course (working as a doctor under the supervision of an experienced doctor) with a duration of 2 to 3 years, in the corresponding specialty. Successful completion of internship implies that an intern passes an examination on a specialty, including testing –ü—Ä–æ –ø–æ–¥–∞–ª—å—à–µ —É–¥–æ—Å–∫–æ–Ω–∞–ª–µ–Ω–Ω—è –∞—Ç–µ—Å—Ç–∞—Ü—ñ—ó –ª—ñ–∫–∞—Ä—ñ–≤? –ù–∞–∫–∞–∑ –ú–û–ó –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏ –≤—ñ–¥ 19.12.1997 —Ä. ‚Ññ 359 and receives a certificate of a specialist physician of the Ministry of Health, which is a formal permission for practical activity.7.1.4. –ü—Ä–∞–≤–æ –Ω–∞ –∑–∞–Ω—è—Ç—Ç—è –º–µ–¥–∏—á–Ω–æ—é —ñ —Ñ–∞—Ä–º–∞—Ü–µ–≤—Ç–∏—á–Ω–æ—é –¥—ñ—è–ª—å–Ω—ñ—Å—Ç—é –≤—ñ–¥–ø–æ–≤—ñ–¥–Ω–æ –¥–æ —Å–ø–µ—Ü—ñ–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—ñ —Ç–∞ –∫–≤–∞–ª—ñ—Ñ—ñ–∫–∞—Ü—ñ—ó–ù–æ—Ä–º–∞—Ç–∏–≤–Ω—ñ –¥–æ–∫—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∏ –∑–≥—ñ–¥–Ω–æ —è–∫–∏—Ö –∑–¥—ñ–π—Å–Ω—é—î—Ç—å—Å—è –ø—ñ–¥–≤–∏—â–µ–Ω–Ω—è –∫–≤–∞–ª—ñ—Ñ—ñ–∫–∞—Ü—ñ—ó –ª—ñ–∫–∞—Ä—ñ–≤, –ø—Ä–æ–≤—ñ–∑–æ—Ä—ñ–≤ —Ç–∞ –ø—Ä–æ—Ñ–µ—Å—ñ–æ–Ω–∞–ª—ñ–≤ –∑ –≤–∏—â–æ—é –Ω–µ–º–µ–¥–∏—á–Ω–æ—é –æ—Å–≤—ñ—Ç–æ—é, —è–∫—ñ –ø—Ä–∞—Ü—é—é—Ç—å –≤ —Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º—ñ –æ—Ö–æ—Ä–æ–Ω–∏ –∑–¥–æ—Ä–æ–≤'—è Thus, the American MD and the Ukrainian Physician have identical titles. On the other hand, the colloquial (not official terminology) Doctor of Medicine means that a Physician with a higher education successfully defended his thesis, after a 2-year postgraduate course and corresponding term of research (Candidate of Medical Sciences before 2015, or Ph.D. after 2015 - till 2020), which is closer to the English system of degrees. =United States= In the United States, the M.D. awarded by medical schools is a \\"Professional Doctorate\\" (as opposed to the Doctor of Philosophy degree which requires a focus on research) and is accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME), an independent body sponsored by the Association of American Medical Colleges, and the American Medical Association (AMA). In addition to the M.D., the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) is an equivalent professional doctoral degree for physicians and surgeons offered by medical schools in the United States. According to Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, \\"the training, practice, credentialing, licensure, and reimbursement of osteopathic physicians is virtually indistinguishable from those of M.D. physicians, with 4 years of osteopathic medical school followed by specialty and subspecialty training and certification.\\" Admission to medical school in the United States is highly competitive, and in the United States there were 21,869 matriculants to medical school out of 53,371 applicants (‚âà41%) in 2019. Before entering medical school, students are required to complete a four-year undergraduate degree and take the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT); however, some combined undergraduate-medical programs exist. Before graduating from a medical school and being awarded the Doctor of Medicine degree, students are required to take the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 and both the clinical knowledge and clinical skills parts of Step 2. The MD degree is typically earned in four years. Following the awarding of the MD, physicians who wish to practice in the United States are required to complete at least one internship year (PGY-1) and pass the USMLE Step 3. In order to receive board eligible or board accredited status in a specialty of medicine such as general surgery or internal medicine, physicians undergo additional specialized training in the form of a residency. Those who wish to further specialize in areas such as cardiology or infectious diseases then complete a fellowship. Depending upon the physician's chosen field, residencies and fellowships involve an additional three to eight years of training after obtaining the MD. This can be lengthened with additional research years, which can last one, two, or more years. Even though the M.D. is a professional degree and not a research doctorate (i.e., a Ph.D.), many holders of the M.D. degree conduct clinical and basic scientific research and publish in peer- reviewed journals during training and after graduation; an academic physician whose work emphasizes basic research is called a physician-scientist. Combined medical and research training is offered through programs granting an MD-PhD. The National Institutes of Health (NIH), through its Medical Scientist Training Program, funds M.D.-Ph.D. training programs at many universities. Some M.D.s choose a research career and receive funding from the NIH as well as other sources such as the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. The United States Department of Education and the National Science Foundation do not include the M.D. or other professional doctorates among the degrees that are equivalent to research doctorates. =Venezuela= After graduating from high school in Venezuela students can apply for federal appointment to a six- year medical program within a University. Only Public Universities offer this degree in Venezuela. Any student can apply for federal appointment by Ministry of Higher Education. So that, the student is allowed to register at university and follow a medical program. This a six-year program divided within three cycles. First cycle: Theory and lectures (1-2), second cycle: pre-clinical training (3-4) and third cycle: clinical training (5-6). First year consists mainly of theoretical classes, however there are practice since first day in laboratories and institutes, such as biochemistry, anatomy which included lectures and teaching sessions with cadavers in dissection tables, Molecular Biology, histology, embryology and many others general subjects. The second year is usually mainly quite theoretical although most teaching sessions takes place in laboratories. After completing these years the student know how the human body is and how it works. Also, any extrinsic agent that can modify its functions. There is also Medical Exercise demonstration which included guided visit to primarily care centers during a complete semester or year-round depending on universities. During third year medical students start studying pharmacology, pathology and physical examination. Passing successfully first, second and third year is commonly considered a filter, almost half of previously admitted students leave voluntarily. The fourth year medical students enter on the field starting to visit hospitals and healthcare services. This is called Pre-Clinical Cycle were they acquire deep knowledge about clinical examination visiting specialized units such as Internal Medicine, Trauma and orthopedics, surgery and gynecology and obstetrics. They start to be member of a medical team. Every morning at the hospital, plus one night shifts per week, and lectures in the afternoon. Each internship lasts between six and four months and takes place in a different department. The fifth and sixth year are very similar but this time they applied their previously earned clinical knowledge and skills starting to follow patients independently. At the end of the sixth year, they need to pass a highly supervised medical practice examination in an unserved outpatient center or specialized hospital in order to earn the degree. During these years, there is training at the hospital almost exclusively. Very little theoretical courses are meant to balance the training. Once completed they earn a university degree and a title granted by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela as \\"Medical Surgeon\\" this is considered equivalent to a M.D degree. There is also a five years program the \\"M√©dico Integral Comunitario\\" title and degree granted by newly created universities and headed by Cuban nationals from the Cuba - Venezuela cooperation agreements. This program has been subject of controversy in the country over the legitimacy of the Cuban doctors' licensure for teaching and practice medicine.\\"Sobre Plan Barrio Adentro: Rangel Avalos reitera desacato a decisi√≥n de Corte\\" El Universal\\"Sala Constitucional se neg√≥ a pronunciarse sobre ejercicio de m√©dicos cubanos: Gobierno deber√° llevar caso Barrio Adentro a otra instancia\\" El Universal\\"Desacato al amparo acarrear√° sanciones jur√≠dicas\\" El Universal After graduation, recently graduate doctors acquire the right to use Dr. before their names but still must follow a one- year exercise in the countryside or a two years training in a specialized hospital. So that, They can be enabled to practice medicine with a full licence in Venezuela and the right to work as a medical doctor, generally as a general practitioner (Art√≠culo 8). That is the point from which they also start getting paid. They can follow specialized studies which usually last between 3 or 5 years depending on specialization and furthermore a phD for relevant research activities which usually take at least three years more. Postgraduate clinical degreesBhutan= In Bhutan, a medical doctor who completes 4 to 5 years of medical school is awarded with MBBS or Dr.title by their respective universities ( usually from universities in Sri Lanka, India, Thailand and Bangladesh). Upon recognition by Bhutan Health and Medical council, they work as medical doctor in country. M.D title is usually given to those who completes 3 to 4 years of residency for specialised course like surgery, medicine pediatrics, etc. =India= The MBBS (Bachelor of Medicine/Bachelor of Surgery) degree represents the first (undergraduate) level of training required to be licensed as a physician (other degrees in alternative medicine are present like BAMS, BHMS, BSMS etc.) and the MS or MD degree is a postgraduate degree, representative of speciality training. The equivalent training in the US or Canada would be the completion of a medical (post-graduate) degree. Eligibility for the MS or MD course is restricted to medical graduates holding the MBBS degree. The MBBS course is for five and a half years, and training imparted is as follows: # Pre-clinical (Anatomy, Physiology, and Biochemistry) # Para-clinical (Pathology, Microbiology, Pharmacology, Forensic Medicine and Community Medicine) # Clinical (Ophthalmology, Otorhinolaryngology, General Medicine, General Surgery, Pediatrics and Obstetrics/Gynecology; with speciality rotations such as Orthopaedics, Radiology, Pulmonary Medicine, Psychiatry, Dermatology, Anesthesiology and Dentistry) After five and a half years of study and the successful completion of an examination, which includes both theoretical and practical elements, in a pre-clinical or clinical subject of a non-surgical nature [e.g. Anatomy (since the subject deals with study of anatomy through dissecting cadavers, thus given an MD degree), Physiology, Pharmacology, Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, Pathology, Microbiology] the candidate receives MD degree, whereas in a clinical subject of a surgical nature (e.g. General Surgery, Orthopaedics, Obstetrics/Gynaecology, Ophthalmology), the candidate receives the equivalent degree Master of Surgery (MS). A second alternate qualification termed DNB [Diplomate of National Board], is considered equivalent to the MD and MS degrees. This can be obtained by passing the exam conducted by the National Board of Examinations after completing 3 years of post-MBBS residency training in teaching hospitals recognised by the board. The College of Physicians & Surgeons of Bombay, India (Established 1912) also awards higher postgraduate degrees in clinical and pre-clinical specialities, called FCPS; it involves three years of study and the successful completion of an examination, which includes both theoretical and practical elements, and a research thesis and a viva. The FCPS is representative of speciality clinical training, and equivalent to MD/MS/DNB/Ph.D Medical in Medical Doctorate in other parts of the world. Until 2007, the Government of India and the Medical Council of India recognised the FCPS qualification - since then, this is being done by State Medical Councils. After obtaining the first postgraduate degree, that is MD/MS/FCPS/DNB/Ph.D Medical, one can go for further specialisation in medical or surgical fields. This involves a highly competitive entrance examination. This course has three years of additional training and requires the submission of a dissertation (thesis). This is considered a clinical doctorate as the focus is on preparing a super-specialist with adequate clinical as well as research training. After the dissertation is approved and the exit examination (theory and practical) is cleared, the degree awarded is DM (Doctor of Medicine), Ph.D Medical . Based on the specific field of training, the degree awarded is DM in Cardiac Anaesthesia, Cardiology, Neurology, Nephrology, Gastroenterology, Neuroradiology, Critical Care, Pulmonology, Hematology, Medical Oncology, Clinical Pharmacology, Pediatric Critical Care, Pediatric Neurology, Neonataology, Pediatric Gastroenterology, Neuroanaesthesia, etc. For surgical superspecialities the degree awarded is MCh (Magister Chirurgiae), like MCh in Cardio-thoracic and Vascular Surgery, Endocrine Surgery, Neurosurgery, Surgical Gastroenterology, Urology, Plastic Surgery, Pediatric Surgery etc. DM and MCh are the clinical equivalent of a Doctorate degree. A third alternate qualification is DNB (superspecialties), offered by National Board of Examinations, like DNB in Cardiology, Neurology, Cardiac Surgery, Neurosurgery. Following DM or MCh, one can further go for postdoctoral fellowship programs of one-year duration in specific subspecialties like Cardiac Electrophysiology, Invasive cardiology, Pediatric cardiology, Epilepsy, stroke, electroencephalography, movement disorders, neuromuscular disorders, cerebrovascular surgery, skull base surgery, neurocritical care, pediatric cardiac surgery etc. offered by prestigious government institutes and abroad. The National Board of Examinations also awards the DNB degree for 6 year integrated surgical courses in specialties of Neurosurgery, Cardio-thoracic and Vascular Surgery, Pediatric Surgery and Plastic surgery. The residency period lasts 6 years post MBBS and thus alleviates the need to undergo a 3-year residency in General Surgery. =Pakistan= In Pakistan MBBS is the undergraduate degree. The MD is a higher doctorate, awarded by medical universities based on successful completion of a residency program of four to six years' duration in a university hospital. Many universities are offering MD. Parallel to MD, MS is a higher doctorate awarded on successful completion of four to six years' duration of a residency program in surgical field. =Sri Lanka= In Sri Lanka, the MD degree is a higher postgraduate degree that is awarded by the Postgraduate Institute of Medicine after completion of a postgraduate course, examinations and speciality training. The MD degree in Sri Lanka is representative of specialty training in clinical, para clinical, and preventive medicine (e.g., general medicine, cardiology, nephrology, oncology, para clinical such as microbiology, haematology and preventive such as community medicine). Entry for the MD course is open only for medical graduates holding the MBBS degree (with a duration of five and a half years), and training is obtained in medical disciplines that are non-surgical in nature (e.g., internal medicine, radiology, pathology, etc.) After three or four years of study and the successful completion of an examination with written as well as cases and via examinations, the MD degree in the respective field of study is awarded. In community medicine and medical administration, part I examination consists of a theoretical exam while the degree is conferred after completion of a thesis as a PhD. This thesis has to be completed within a period of five years. After successfully defending the academic thesis, the MD degree is conferred to the candidate. The MD degree holder is certified as a board certified specialist by the respective board of study of the Postgraduate Institute of Medicine after he or she undergoes 2‚Äì4 years of local and foreign training depending on the specialty/subspecialty selected. Research degreesUnited Kingdom, Ireland and some Commonwealth countries= The entry-level first professional degree in these countries for the practice of medicine is that of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS, MB, MB BCh BAO, BMBS, MBBChir, or MBChB). This degree typically requires between four and six years of study and clinical training, and is equivalent to the North American MD degree. Due to the UK code for higher education, first degrees in medicine comprise an integrated programme of study and professional practice spanning several levels. These degrees may retain, for historical reasons, \\"Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery\\" and are abbreviated to MBChB, MBBS or BMBS. In the UK, Ireland and many Commonwealth countries, the MD is a postgraduate research degree in medicine. At most universities, this takes the form of a first doctorate, analogous to the Ph.D., awarded upon submission of a thesis and a successful viva. The thesis may consist of new research undertaken on a full- or part- time basis, with much less supervision (in the UK) than for a Ph.D., or a portfolio of previously published work. In order to be eligible to apply for an MD degree from a UK or Commonwealth University one must hold either a \\"Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery\\" (MBBS, MBChB, BMBS for example) degree, or an equivalent U.S.-MD degree and must usually have at least five years of postgraduate experience. Therefore, graduates from the MBBS/MBChB/BMBS degrees do not hold doctorates; however, physicians holding these degrees are referred to as \\"doctor\\" as they are fully licensed as medical practitioners. In some commonwealth nations, these interns are designated as \\"house officers\\". Traditionally, the MD in the UK and Commonwealth was a higher doctorate (similar to a DSc) awarded upon submission of a portfolio of published work representing a substantial contribution to medical research.CF Hawkins, \\"Write the MD Thesis\\" in \\"How To Do It\\" London: British Medical Association 2nd ed. 1985 Many universities have now changed its status, but this has happened only recently: for example, the University of Cambridge in 2012 introduced a new higher degree of MedScD (more akin to the ScD degree) awarded on the basis of a career's contribution to the science or art of medicine, while redesignating the MD as an initial research doctorate awarded on the basis of a thesis.; Oxford, which had changed the regulations for the MD degree to bring it more in line with initial doctorates in 2002, removed its status as a higher doctorate after a review in 2016. Some Commonwealth institutions retain the MD as a higher degree, such as the relatively new James Cook University). In the case where the MD is awarded (either as a first or higher doctorate) for previously published research, the candidate is usually required to be either a graduate or a full-time member of staff, of several years' standing of the university in question. Equivalent degrees in other countries *In Bangladesh, the basic medical degree is the MBBS. After completing the intermediate level of education (12 years) the candidate must undergo 5 years of medical training in any medical college to achieve the MBBS degree. After obtaining the degree, the candidate needs to undergo one year of internship to obtain BMDC (Bangladesh medical and dental council) accreditation in order to practice in the country. *In mainland China, some medical schools award MBBS to foreign students while all medical schools award Bachelor of Medicine to nationals. Some MD degrees are higher academic research degrees. *In Colombia, the medicine faculties of the universities awards the title of \\"Medico Cirujano\\" after taking 12 semesters of studies on \\"all clinic and surgery discipline a two semester on internship. After receiving the degree there is a mandatory year \\"obliged social work\\" were the doctors practice as GP in the countryside. Residency programs last between 3‚Äì4 years depends on the specialty. *The Czech and Slovak title MUDr. (Medicinae Universae doctor or doktor medic√≠ny) is a professional doctorate granted upon completion of six years pregraduate Master's study at medical schools. The postgraduate academic research degree in medicine is a PhD degree. *The Danish and Norwegian Candidatus medicinae or Candidata medicinae degrees (cand. med.) is awarded after completing a six-year medical programme, to which students apply directly upon finishing secondary school. The programme usually includes a small thesis. However, the cand. med. degree must not be confused with the previous Danish and Norwegian Dr. Med. degree, which is a separate degree from the Ph.D. and represents a higher degree of medical research experience. It typically consists of at least 5‚Äì6 original publications. *In Finland, the duration of basic medical education is six years and the course leads to the degree of Licentiate of Medicine. *In Greece, after a six-year study, a medical student acquires his medical degree and the right to use \\"ŒîœÅ.\\", (Dr.) before his name. This is considered equivalent to the MD title. *In Kosovo, there are medical high schools. Students from elementary school can choose to attend the medical high school, which lasts 3 years. When they finish the 3 years of medical high school, they practice for 4 months. After that, they can be a nurse or they can go to medical facilities in Pristina, with the education there taking around 6 years, including practice, to become a doctor. *In Mexico and Peru, schools of medicine award the \\"T√≠tulo de M√©dico Cirujano\\" degree after completing either six or seven years of study. This curriculum includes a rotating internship year and a year of social service providing care to an underserved community. *In Nepal, a MBBS degree is awarded. This is an undergraduate level degree, which is awarded after completion of four and half years of medical school followed by one year of clinical internship. Most medical schools also offer postgraduate M.D and M.S. degrees, which requires three years of further training. Post-doctorate D.M. and M.Ch. terminal degrees are awarded by a few elite institutions after three more years of super-speciality training. *In the Netherlands, medical students receive six years of university education prior to their graduation. Prospective students can apply for medical education directly after finishing the highest level of secondary school, vwo; previous undergraduate education is not a precondition for admittance. Medical students receive three years of preclinical training, followed by three years of clinical training (co-assistentschappen, or co-schappen) in hospitals. At one medical faculty (Utrecht University), clinical training already begins in the third year of medical school. After 6 years, students graduate as Basisartsen (\\"base physician\\"). As a result of the Bologna process, medical students in the Netherlands receive a bachelor's degree (BSc) concluding successfully three years of medical university curriculum, and a master's degree (MSc) upon successful graduation. After graduation, physicians can apply for, and complete a R&D; based doctorate, earning them a PhD in Medicine. Contrary to popular (international) daily use, the title \\"MD\\" does not exist, is not granted, nor recognised for Dutch physicians. Furthermore, no specific notation signifying board registration exists for physicians in the Netherlands. *In Belgium, Belgian medical education is much more based on theoretical knowledge than the Dutch system. In the first three years, which are very theoretical and lead to a university bachelor's degree, general scientific courses are taken such as chemistry, biophysics, physiology, biostatistics, anatomy, virology, etc. To enter the bachelor course in Flanders, prospective students have to pass an exam, as a result of the numerus clausus. After the bachelor courses, students are allowed to enter the 'master in medicine' courses, which consist of three years of theoretical and clinical study. In general, the first two master years are very theoretical and teach the students human pathology, diseases and pharmacology. The third year is a year full of internships in a wide range of specialities in different clinics. The seventh, final year serves as a kind of 'pre- specialization' year in which the students are specifically trained in the specialty they wish to pursue after medical school. This contrasts with the Dutch approach, in which graduates are literally 'basic doctors' (basisartsen) who have yet to decide on a specialty. *In Portugal, to practice medicine, a master's degree in medicine (awarded after a 6-year Integrated master's program in medicine) is mandatory. Before the 2007 Bologna Process, the same course was only a Licentiate Degree. After the 6-year program, students must go through the National Seriation Exam (Prova Nacional de Seria√ß√£o), and then a year of General Medical Internship (Ano Comum). When the internship ends, the students are placed in their choice of Medical Specialty, according to their ranking in the aforementioned Exam and the vacancies available for each medical specialty. Only when each student finishes the Medical Internship, will they be allowed to practice medicine without supervision. Entry to the Integrated Masters Program in Medicine is done directly after High School, based on the student's grade - each year there are about 1800 new Medical Students in Portugal, in 8 different Medical Schools. *In Sudan the awarded degree in most of the medical schools is, Bachelor of Medicine and Basic Surgery (MBBS). In schools that are based on the English system of medical teaching, the degree is granted after six years of studying. As for the schools that are adopting the American system, they grant their students the degree of MBBS in only five years. *In Sweden, medical education begins with a five-and-a-half-year undergraduate university program leading to the degree \\"Master of Science in Medicine\\" (). Following this, the National Board of Health and Welfare requires a minimum of 18 months of clinical internship () before granting a medical license () to be fully qualified as the Swedish equivalent to Medical Doctor (MD). This internship consists of surgery (3‚Äì6 months), internal medicine (3‚Äì6 months), psychiatry (three months) and family medicine (six months). Upon receiving a license to practice, a physician is able to apply for a post to start specialist training. There are currently 52 recognised medical specialties in Sweden. The specialist training () has a duration of minimum five years, which upon completion grants formal qualification as a specialist. Other postgraduate clinical degrees There is also a similar advanced professional degree to the postgraduate MD: the Master of Surgery (usually ChM or MS, but MCh in Scotland, Ireland, Wales and at Oxford and MChir at Cambridge). The equivalence of these degrees, but their differing names, prevents the need for surgeons (addressed as Mr. in the UK) having to revert to the title Dr., which they once held as new MBBS graduates. In Ireland, where the basic medical qualification includes a degree in obstetrics, there is a similar higher degree of Master of the Art of Obstetrics (MAO). A Master of Midwifery was formerly examined by the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries of London (hence MMSA) but fell into abeyance in the 1960s; in this case, the term Master referred not to a university degree but rather a professional rank that is common among craft guilds. In East Africa, the medical schools in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda award the degree of Master of Medicine (MMed) degree in both surgical and medical specialty disciplines following a three to six-year period of instruction, in Ethiopia students first finish high school then took university entrance exam then based on their result (it is highly competitive) then start medical school until recently but now students take another 1 year in university studying common course then take another exam to join medicine after that the students begin studying preclinical for 3 years studying anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, histology, embryology, pathology, pharmacology, microbiology and other minor courses of public health then at 4th year studemts join the clinical rotation ranging from physical examination and history taking to different specialities like internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics and gynobs for two years and other minor specialities like psychiatry, ophthalmology, dematology, ENT after finishing these courses students take qualification exam and become intern doctors for one year then graduate as general practitioner and serve two or more years on primary hospitals then by taking national resedency exam and join their apeciality based on their result. . In West Africa, the West African College of Physicians and the West African College of Surgeons award the Fellowship of the West African College of Physicians (FWACP) and the Fellowship of the West African College of Surgeons (FWACS) in medical and surgical disciplines respectively after a minimum of four-year residency training period. The Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine or DO degree allows the same practice rights in the United States and Canada to the MD degree and Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine are fully licensed physicians. Holders of the MD degree must pass MD level board exams while DO holders can pass either the DO (COMLEX) exam or MD exam (USMLE). Similarly, MDs must attend MD rated residency and fellowship programs while DOs can attend either MD programs or Osteopathic (DO) programs. As a result of this, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) are currently transitioning to a single accreditation system for medical residencies in the U.S. The American MD degree is also recognized by most countries in the world, while DO physicians are only licensed to practice the full scope of medicine and surgery in 65 countries.

Biography=Early life Johanson was born Susan Powell in Toronto, Ontario, to Wilfrid Powell, a decorated British war hero, and an affluent Ontario-born Irish Protestant mother, Ethel Bell. Her great-uncle was Lord Baden-Powell. Her mother died when Johanson was ten. Johanson attended nursing school in St. Boniface Hospital Winnipeg, graduating as a registered nurse. Soon after, she married a Swedish-Canadian electrician named Ejnor Johanson. They had three children: Carol, Eric and Jane. The family moved to North York, where Johanson kept house and raised her children. In 1972, Johanson opened a birth control clinic in Don Mills CI high school, the first of its kind in Canada. She worked there as clinic coordinator until 1986. She continued her education at the Toronto Institute of Human Relations (a postgraduate course in counseling and communication), the University of Toronto (family planning), and the University of Michigan (human sexuality), graduating as a counselor and sex educator. Career Johanson's career rose rapidly since her first classroom teaching in the North York schools. Later some other districts of the country noticed her performances and began to invite her in schools and universities all over the country. Johanson's humour and frankness make her a popular speaker at Canadian universities. She frequently packs auditoriums to capacity, making even standing room hard to come by. Radio and TV programs Johanson achieved popularity as a sex educator and therapist on rock radio station Q107. Originally she had a one-hour phone-in radio show dedicated to advice on sex. Later, the show was increased to two hours. The show was called Sunday Night Sex Show and existed for nineteen years between 1984 and 2005. In 1985 this radio program was turned into a TV talk show with the same name on the community television, Rogers Cable. In 1996 it became a national show on the Women's Television Network (WTN) with a high rating. The first seven seasons were delivered to American audiences by Oxygen Media in 2002. The recorded program was very popular, but American viewers missed the opportunity to call in and ask their own questions. The U.S. version of Sunday Night Sex Show, called Talk Sex with Sue Johanson, produced especially for American audiences, debuted in November 2002 on the Oxygen Media. Talk Sex with Sue Johanson was an educational talk show airing every Sunday night. The program was divided into several segments all covering the following topics: sexual life, love and relationships. Call-in segment includes viewers' live calls with questions immediately being answered by Sue. The discussions included the most common worries about arousal or erection, pregnancy, contraception, infections, and diseases. Johanson easily covered such topics as BDSM, sex positions, sexuality trends, sex and age, and much more. The show also included a sex quiz, a sex poll where viewers could vote via the internet and see the results at the end of the episode, and included important sexual news and information before and after commercial breaks. The \\"Hot Stuff Bag\\" segment of the show was dedicated to reviewing a new sex toy which has been tested out by one or more members of the crew. The toy is shown and its usage is explained, as well its pros and cons. It is then rated on a scale of 1‚Äì4. The show also usually includes a book review. The educational format of the show combined with Johanson's profound knowledge of the subject and healthy sense of humour made the program popular with all age groups. Approximately 4.2 million Americans watch the show every Sunday. The show appears in Israel, Brazil, and twenty European countries in five languages. Johanson made two cameo appearances in the teen drama Degrassi Junior High as \\"Dr. Sally\\", essentially a fictionalised version of herself. She reprised the role a decade later for two episodes of Degrassi: The Next Generation. It was announced on May 7, 2008, that Sunday night's episode on May 11, 2008, would be her last, opting to retire. Johanson ended the show very emotionally and was joined by her staff on stage as she said goodbye. Books Johanson is the author of three books: Talk Sex (), Sex Is Perfectly Natural but Not Naturally Perfect (), and Sex, Sex, and More Sex (). All of them cover the sex topics from different points and include the detailed answers of the most delicate questions asked commonly about sexual life, Johanson's advice and health information. Johanson is also the author of a weekly column published in the Health section of the Toronto Star newspaper. Awards and honours Johanson's work educating and informing the public about birth control and sexual health earned her Canada's fourth highest honor (after the Victoria Cross, Cross of Valour, and the Order of Merit), appointment to the Order of Canada in 2001, for lifetime achievement. In 2010, Johanson was presented the Bonham Centre Award from the Mark S. Bonham Centre for Sexual Diversity Studies for her contributions to the advancement and education of issues around sexual identification.

Completed in 1818, it is often considered to be Beethoven's most technically challenging piano composition and one of the most demanding solo works in the classical piano repertoire. The first documented public performance was in 1836 by Franz Liszt in the Salle Erard in Paris.  Composition  Sketches for the slow movement of Piano Sonata no. 29, probably 1818, musical autograph Dedicated to his patron, the Archduke Rudolf, the sonata was written primarily from the summer of 1817 to the late autumn of 1818, towards the end of a fallow period in Beethoven's compositional career. It represents the spectacular emergence of many of the themes that were to recur in Beethoven's late period: the reinvention of traditional forms, such as sonata form; a brusque humour; and a return to pre-classical compositional traditions, including an exploration of modal harmony and reinventions of the fugue within classical forms. The Hammerklavier also set a precedent for the length of solo compositions (performances typically take about 40 to 50 minutes, depending on interpretative choices). While orchestral works such as symphonies and concerti had often contained movements of 15 or even 20 minutes for many years, few single movements in solo literature had a span such as the Hammerklavier's third movement. The sonata's name comes from Beethoven's later practice of using German rather than Italian words for musical terminology. (Hammerklavier literally means \\"hammer-keyboard\\", and is still today the German name for the fortepiano, the predecessor of the modern piano.) It comes from the title page of the work, \\"Gro√üe Sonate f√ºr das Hammerklavier\\", which means \\"Grand sonata for the fortepiano\\". The more sedate Sonata No. 28 in A major, Op. 101 has the same description, but the epithet has come to apply to the Sonata No. 29 only. \\"Hammerklavier\\" was part of the title to specify that the work was not to be played on the harpsichord, an instrument that was still very much in evidence in the early 1800s. The work also makes extensive use of the una corda pedal, with Beethoven giving for his time unusually detailed instructions when to use it.  Structure  The piece contains four movements, a structure often used by Beethoven, and imitated by contemporaries such as Schubert, in contrast to the more usual three or two movements of Mozart's and Haydn's sonatas. The four movements are: In addition to the thematic connections within the movements and the use of traditional Classical formal structures, Charles Rosen has described how much of the piece is organised around the motif of a descending third (major or minor). This descending third is quite ubiquitous throughout the work but most clearly recognizable in the following sections: the opening fanfare of the Allegro; in the scherzo's imitation of the aforementioned fanfare, as well as in its trio theme; in bar two of the adagio; and in the fugue in both its introductory bass octave-patterns and in the main subject, as the seven-note runs which end up on notes descended by thirds.  I. Allegro  The opening bars of the Hammerklavier sonata The first movement opens with a series of fortissimo B-major chords, which form much of the basis of the first subject. After the first subject is spun out for a while, the opening set of fortissimo chords are stated again, this time followed by a similar rhythm on the unexpected chord of D major. This ushers in the more lyrical second subject in the submediant (that is, a minor third below the tonic), G major. A third and final musical subject appears after this, which exemplifies the fundamental opposition of B and B in this movement through its chromatic alterations of the third scale degree. The exposition ends with a largely stepwise figure in the treble clef in a high register, while the left hand moves in an octave- outlining accompaniment in eighth notes. The development section opens with a statement of this final figure, except with alterations from the major subdominant to the minor, which fluidly modulates to E major. Directly after, the exposition's first subject is composed in fugato and features an incredible display of musical development. The fugato ends with a section featuring non-fugal imitation between registers, eventually resounding in repeated D-major chords. The final section of the development begins with a chromatic alteration of D to D. The music progresses to the alien key of B major, in which the third and first subjects of the exposition are played. The retransition is brought about by a sequence of rising intervals that get progressively higher, until the first theme is stated again in the home key of B, signalling the beginning of the recapitulation. In keeping with Beethoven's exploration of the potentials of sonata form, the recapitulation avoids a full harmonic return to B major until long after the return to the first theme. The coda repetitively cites motives from the opening statement over a shimmering pedal point and disappears into pianississimo until two fortissimo B major chords conclude the movement.  II. Scherzo: Assai vivace  The brief second movement includes a great variety of harmonic and thematic material. The scherzo's theme ‚Äì which Rosen calls a humorous formThe Classical Style, Expanded Edition, p. 423 of the first movement's first subject ‚Äì is at once playful, lively, and pleasant. The scherzo, in B major, maintains the standard ternary form by repeating the sections an octave higher in the treble clef. The trio, marked \\"semplice\\", is in the parallel minor, B minor, but the effect is more shadowy than dramatic. It borrows the opening theme from the composer's Eroica symphony and places it in a minor key. Following this dark interlude, Beethoven inserts a more intense presto section in meter, still in the minor, which eventually segues back to the scherzo. After a varied reprise of the scherzo's first section, a coda with a meter change to cut time follows. This coda plays with the semitonal relationship between B and B, and briefly returns to the first theme before dying away.  III. Adagio sostenuto  The ternary-form slow movement, centred on F minor, has been called, among other things, a \\"mausoleum of collective sorrow\\",Wilhelm von Lenz, quoted in The NPR Guide to Building a Classical CD Collection. Ted Libbey. . p. 379. and is notable for its ethereality and great length as a slow movement (e.g. Wilhelm Kempff played for approximately 16 minutes and Christoph Eschenbach 25 minutes) that finally ends with a Picardy third. Paul Bekker called the movement \\"the apotheosis of pain, of that deep sorrow for which there is no remedy, and which finds expression not in passionate outpourings, but in the immeasurable stillness of utter woe\\".Bekker, Paul (1925). Beethoven (translated and adapted by Mildred Mary Bozman). J.M. Dent & Sons, Ltd. p. 134. Wilhelm Kempff described it as \\"the most magnificent monologue Beethoven ever wrote\\".Schumann, Karl. Beethoven's Viceroy at the Keyboard In Celebration of Wilhelm Kempff's Centenary: His 1951‚Äì1956 Recordings of Beethoven's 32 Piano Sonatas. Structurally, it follows traditional Classical-era sonata form, but the recapitulation of the main theme is varied to include extensive figurations in the right hand that anticipate some of the techniques of Romantic piano music. NPR's Ted Libbey writes, \\"An entire line of development in Romantic music‚Äîpassing through Schubert, Chopin, Schumann, Brahms, and even Liszt‚Äîsprings from this music.\\"Libbey, Ted. The NPR Guide to Building a Classical CD Collection. .  IV. Introduzione: Largo... Allegro ‚Äì Fuga: Allegro risoluto  The movement begins with a slow introduction that serves to transition from the third movement. To do so, it modulates from D major/B minor to G major/E minor to B major/G minor to A major, which modulates to B major for the fugue. Dominated by falling thirds in the bass line, the music three times pauses on a pedal and engages in speculative contrapuntal experimentation, in a manner foreshadowing the quotations from the first three movements of the Ninth Symphony in the opening of the fourth movement of that work. After a final modulation to B major, the main substance of the movement appears: a titanic three-voice fugue in meter. The subject of the fugue can be divided itself into three parts: a tenth leap followed by a trill to the tonic; a 7-note scale figure repeated descending by a third; and a tail semiquaver passage marked by many chromatic passing tones, whose development becomes the main source for the movement's unique dissonance. Marked con alcune licenze (\\"with some licenses\\"), the fugue, one of Beethoven's greatest contrapuntal achievements, as well as making incredible demands on the performer, moves through a number of contrasting sections and includes a number of \\"learned\\" contrapuntal devices, often, and significantly, wielded with a dramatic fury and dissonance inimical to their conservative and academic associations. Some examples: augmentation of the fugue theme and countersubject in a sforzando marcato at bars 96‚Äì117, the massive stretto of the tenth leap and trill which follows, a contemplative episode beginning at bar 152 featuring the subject in retrograde, leading to an exploration of the theme in inversion at bar 209.Willi Apel, \\"Retrograde,\\" Harvard Dictionary of Music (Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 1969), p. 728.  Influence  The work was perceived as almost unplayable but was nevertheless seen as the summit of piano literature since its very first publication . However, even as progressive a musician as Richard Wagner, who appreciated the work and fully admired the late string quartets, held reservations for what he perceived as a lack of succinctness in its composition.  Orchestration  The composer Felix Weingartner produced an orchestration of the sonata. In 1878, Friedrich Nietzsche had suggested such an orchestration: > In the lives of great artists, there are unfortunate contingencies which, > for example, force the painter to sketch his most significant picture as > only a fleeting thought, or which forced Beethoven to leave us only the > unsatisfying piano reduction of a symphony in certain great piano sonatas > (the great B flat major). In such cases, the artist coming after should try > to correct the great men's lives after the fact; for example, a master of > all orchestral effects would do so by restoring to life the symphony that > had suffered an apparent pianistic death.Human, All Too Human, ¬ß 173 However, Charles Rosen considered attempts to orchestrate the work \\"nonsensical\\".Rosen, The Classical Style, p. 446  References  Further reading  Extensive discussion and analysis is given in Charles Rosen's book The Classical Style (2nd ed., 1997, New York: Norton): ).

It was designed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as an extension of the Secure Shell protocol (SSH) version 2.0 to provide secure file transfer capabilities. The IETF Internet Draft states that, even though this protocol is described in the context of the SSH-2 protocol, it could be used in a number of different applications, such as secure file transfer over Transport Layer Security (TLS) and transfer of management information in VPN applications. This protocol assumes that it is run over a secure channel, such as SSH, that the server has already authenticated the client, and that the identity of the client user is available to the protocol. Capabilities Compared to the SCP protocol, which only allows file transfers, the SFTP protocol allows for a range of operations on remote files which make it more like a remote file system protocol. An SFTP client's extra capabilities include resuming interrupted transfers, directory listings, and remote file removal. SFTP attempts to be more platform-independent than SCP; with SCP, for instance, the expansion of wildcards specified by the client is up to the server, whereas SFTP's design avoids this problem. While SCP is most frequently implemented on Unix platforms, SFTP servers are commonly available on most platforms. The file transfer is fast in SCP when compared to the SFTP protocol due to the back and forth nature of SFTP protocol. In SFTP, the file transfer can be easily terminated without terminating a session like other mechanisms do. SFTP is not FTP run over SSH, but rather a new protocol designed from the ground up by the IETF SECSH working group. It is sometimes confused with Simple File Transfer Protocol. The protocol itself does not provide authentication and security; it expects the underlying protocol to secure this. SFTP is most often used as subsystem of SSH protocol version 2 implementations, having been designed by the same working group. It is possible, however, to run it over SSH-1 (and some implementations support this) or other data streams. Running an SFTP server over SSH-1 is not platform-independent as SSH-1 does not support the concept of subsystems. An SFTP client willing to connect to an SSH-1 server needs to know the path to the SFTP server binary on the server side. Uploaded files may be associated with their basic attributes, such as time stamps. This is an advantage over the common FTP protocol. History and development The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) working group \\"Secsh\\" that was responsible for the development of the Secure Shell version 2 protocol (RFC 4251) also attempted to draft an extension of that standard for secure file transfer functionality. Internet Drafts were created that successively revised the protocol into new versions. The software industry began to implement various versions of the protocol before the drafts were standardized. As development work progressed, the scope of the Secsh File Transfer project expanded to include file access and file management. Eventually, development stalled as some committee members began to view SFTP as a file system protocol, not just a file access or file transfer protocol, which places it beyond the purview of the working group. After a seven-year hiatus, in 2013 an attempt was made to restart work on SFTP using the version 3 draft as the baseline. Versions 0‚Äì2 Prior to the IETF's involvement, SFTP was a proprietary protocol of SSH Communications Security, designed by Tatu Yl√∂nen with assistance from Sami Lehtinen in 1997.ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf-mail- archive/secsh/2012-09.mail Differences between versions 0‚Äì2 and version 3 are enumerated upon in section 10 of draft-ietf-secsh-filexfer-02. Version 3 At the outset of the IETF Secure Shell File Transfer project, the Secsh group stated that its objective of SSH File Transfer Protocol was to provide a secure file transfer functionality over any reliable data stream, and to be the standard file transfer protocol for use with the SSH-2 protocol. Drafts 00‚Äì02 of the IETF Internet Draft define successive revisions of version 3 of the SFTP protocol. * SSH File Transfer Protocol, Draft 00, January 2001 * SSH File Transfer Protocol, Draft 01, March 2001 * SSH File Transfer Protocol, Draft 02, October 2001 Version 4 Drafts 03‚Äì04 of the IETF Internet Draft define version 4 of the protocol. * SSH File Transfer Protocol, Draft 03, October 2002 * SSH File Transfer Protocol, Draft 04, December 2002 Version 5 Draft 05 of the IETF Internet Draft defines version 5 of the protocol. * SSH File Transfer Protocol, Draft 05, January 2004 Version 6 Drafts 06‚Äì13 of the IETF Internet Draft define successive revisions of version 6 of the protocol. * SSH File Transfer Protocol, Draft 06, October 2004 * SSH File Transfer Protocol, Draft 07, March 2005 * SSH File Transfer Protocol, Draft 08, April 2005 * SSH File Transfer Protocol, Draft 09, June 2005 * SSH File Transfer Protocol, Draft 10, June 2005 * SSH File Transfer Protocol, Draft 11, January 2006 * SSH File Transfer Protocol, Draft 12, January 2006 * SSH File Transfer Protocol, Draft 13, July 2006 Software=SFTP client The term SFTP can also refer to Secure file transfer program, a command-line program that implements the client part of this protocol. As an example, the sftp program supplied with OpenSSH implements this. Some implementations of the \`scp\` program support both the SFTP and SCP protocols to perform file transfers, depending on what the server supports. SFTP server Some FTP server implementations implement the SFTP protocol; however, outside of dedicated file servers, SFTP protocol support is usually provided by an SSH server implementation, as it shares the default port of 22 with other SSH services. SFTP implementations may include an SSH protocol implementation to leverage integration of SSH connection details with preexisting FTP server access controls, where an alternative SSH server is tolerable or where alternative ports may be used. An SSH-2 server which supports subsystems may be leveraged to keep a uniform SSH implementation while enhancing access controls with third party software, at the cost of fine-grained integration with connection details, and SSH-1 compatibility. SFTP proxy It is difficult to control SFTP transfers on security devices at the network perimeter. There are standard tools for logging FTP transactions, like TIS fwtk or SUSE FTP proxy, but SFTP is encrypted, rendering traditional proxies ineffective for controlling SFTP traffic. There are some tools that implement man-in-the-middle for SSH which also feature SFTP control. Examples of such a tool are Shell Control Box from Balabit and CryptoAuditor from SSH Communications Security (the original developer of the Secure Shell protocol) which provides functions such as SFTP transaction logging and logging of the actual data transmitted on the wire.

The company was established by Amar Bose in 1964 and is based in Framingham, Massachusetts. Bose is best known for its home audio systems and speakers, noise-cancelling headphones, professional audio products and automobile sound systems. Bose has a reputation for being particularly protective of its patents, trademarks, and brands. The majority owner of Bose Corporation is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, donated to MIT by the founder Amar Bose himself, which receives cash dividends through the non- voting shares donated by the founder in 2011. According to the company annual report in the 2019 financial year, Bose Corporation received revenue of US$4.0 billion and employed more than 9,000 people.\\"Bose 2019 sustainability report\\", 2019. Retrieved December 26, 2019 History Bose store in Century City The company was founded in Massachusetts in 1964 by Amar Bose with angel investor funding, including Amar's thesis advisor and professor, Y. W. Lee. Amar's interest in speaker systems had begun in 1956 when he purchased a stereo system and was disappointed with its performance. The purpose of the company was to develop speaker systems which used multiple speakers aimed at the surrounding walls to reflect the sound and replicate the sound of a concert hall. In 1966, the Bose 2201 became the first product sold by the company. It was an unusual design consisting of 22 speakers, with many of them facing away from the listener. The 2201 was designed to be located in the corner of a room, using reflections off the walls to increase the apparent size of the room. The 2201 was a failure in the market and was discontinued after three or four years. After this experience, Amar came to the conclusion that the audio system measurement techniques of the time (such as measuring distortion and frequency response) were not effective ways to evaluate the goal of natural sound reproduction. Amar argued that the best measure of audio quality is the listener's perception. Also in 1968, the company introduced the Bose 901 stereo speaker system, which used eight mid-range drivers pointing towards the wall behind the speaker, and a ninth driver towards the listener. The purpose of this design was to achieve a dominance of reflected over direct sound in home listening spaces. The design used in the 901 is unconventional compared with most systems, where mid-range and high-frequency speakers directly face the listener. The 901 was an immediate commercial success, and Bose Corporation grew rapidly during the 1970s. The Bose 901 model name was a mainstay of the Bose line-up for many years, being produced from 1968 until 2016. In 1991, a team of Bose researchers debunked a 1989 experiment that claimed to have created energy through cold fusion. The first Bose retail store was opened in 1993 in Kittery, Maine. Bose announced it would close all of its retail stores in North America, Europe, Japan, and Australia in 2020, but would keep open another 130 stores in India, Southeast Asia, South Korea, China, and the United Arab Emirates. In 2011, then-chairman and primary stockholder Amar Bose donated the majority of the firm's non-voting shares to his former employer and alma mater, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. An annual cash dividend is paid out to \\"advance the research and education mission of MIT\\". However, the conditions of receiving the shares stated that MIT was not allowed to sell them, nor was MIT permitted to participate in the company's management and governance.Gift to MIT from Amar Bose raises Tax Questions, by Stephen Stom, New York Times 30 April 2011 Following Amar Bose's death in 2013, Bob Maresca became the Chief Executive Officer. In June 2016, Bose and Flex manufacturing extended their strategic partnership. Bose operations in Malaysia and Mexico will transfer to Flex. At the end of 2017, Maresca stepped down as CEO and Bose President Phil Hess took the position. Maresca remained Chairman of the Board however. In January 2020, Bose announced that they would be closing all their more than 100 retail stores in North America, Japan, Europe, and Australia. They will retain their online presence on their own website, as well as on Target, Best Buy, and Amazon In late January 2020, President and COO Jim Scammon replaced Phil Hess at the helm. In August 2020, Bose named their first female CEO, Lila Snyder, who was formerly an executive at Pitney Bowes. Snyder, who will take her position September 2020, is an MIT alumna, having earned her master‚Äôs and Ph.D. degrees in mechanical engineering there.  Production facilities  Bose's products are manufactured in the United States, Mexico, China and Malaysia. The company's factories in the United States are located in Framingham, Massachusetts (also the site of the company headquarters), Westborough, Massachusetts and Stow, Massachusetts. The Bose factories in Mexico are located in Tijuana and San Luis R√≠o Colorado. The Malaysian Bose factory is located in Batu Kawan and is also the company's distribution hub for the Asia- Pacific and Middle East. In 2015, two facilities in Columbia, South Carolina and Carrickmacross, Ireland, were closed (with the loss of 300 and 140 jobs respectively), as part of a \\"global streamlining of Bose's supply chain. Bose used the Columbia facility, which opened in 1993, for distribution and repair, sub-manufacturing and regional manufacturing, and final assembly for some headsets. The Carrickmacross factory, which began operations in 1978, did final assembly for some home theatre systems, Wave radios, and other regional manufacturing. The operation of the San Luis and Batu Kawan factories were taken over by contract manufacturer Flex in 2016 and continued to produce Bose products.  Products  Bose products at a Staples store  Automotive  Following an unsuccessful attempt to sell aftermarket car speakers, Bose's first OEM audio installation in a MY1983 Cadillac Seville. Bose has since supplied audio systems for many car manufacturers. In 2007, the Bose media system won the International Telematics Award for the \\"Best Storage Solution for In-Car Environment\\". A prototype active suspension system, using electromagnetic motors instead of hydraulic/pneumatic power, was unveiled by the company in 2004\\"Popular Science\\" magazine, December 2004 and was due for release in 2009, but it did not materialize due to weight and cost. The system used electromagnetic linear motors to raise or lower the wheels of an automobile in response to uneven bumps or potholes on the road. The wheels are raised when approaching a bump (or lowered into a pothole) to keep the vehicle level, using similar principles to noise cancelling audio devices. A prototype car had the ability to jump over an obstacle. (car jumping appears at 3:20) The company said that the system is too expensive and heavy, even after development over more than 20 years costing $100 million of development. In November 2017, it was reported that Bose had sold the technology to ClearMotion. In May 2018, it was announced that five major car manufacturers had expressed interest in the technology and that it may be available in 2019 for low-volume vehicles and by 2020 for the mass market. A truck seat system called Bose Ride was introduced in 2010. This active seat system aims to reduce fatigue, back pain and physical stress experienced by truck drivers by reducing vibration from the road. Bose claimed up to a 90% reduction in driver's seat vibration. Automobile brands that currently have Bose audio systems available in its vehicles are Chevrolet, Buick, Cadillac, GMC, Fiat, Porsche, Hyundai, Kia, Mazda, Nissan, and Infiniti.https://automotive.bose.com/vehicles Home audio and video SoundLink Mini Bose's product range has included: In 2012, Bose was the highest selling company in the United States for retail home theater systems, and the third highest selling for portable audio products.

Some people claim that Bose equipment produces, \\"sound larger than life and exaggerated\\" Bose has not been certified by THX for its home entertainment products even though its more expensive home theater products compete at prices where THX certification is common. Some other views include: * Bose's flagship 901 speaker system was given a negative review by Consumer Reports in 1970 (See Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc.). Stereophile magazine, in 1979, also gave a negative review, stating that the system was unexceptional and unlikely to appeal to perfectionists with a developed taste in precise imaging, detail, and timbre; and that these shortcomings were an excessive price to pay for the improvement in impact and ambiance generated by the large proportion of reflected sound [to on-axis sound]. However, the author also stated that the system produced a more realistic resemblance of natural ambiance than any other speaker system. A more recent positive review by TONE Audio found that the 901 was better than expected and a good value for the price range. *A 2005 market study published by Forrester Research reported that Bose's brand name was among several computer and consumer electronics brands most trusted by US consumers including Dell and Hewlett-Packard. *A 2007 review in Audioholics online magazine reiterated that Bose was very expensive for its performance. Of the Bose Lifestyle V20 Home Theater System the reviewer wrote, \\"The Bose system is very expensive at nearly $2,000 and the sound quality isn't really any better than many other surround systems costing a third of the price... the smaller [bass] cones cannot reproduce lower tactile [sic] frequencies.\\" The review included an interview with a Best Buy sales manager who suggested from his experience that, despite his directing customers to a better-sounding and less expensive alternative, some customers insisted on Bose. *A July 2012 review by NBC News of the $5,000 46\\" Bose TV noted that the video screen, produced by Samsung, resembled most closely a $750 flat panel television, and that the technology used was not up to par with other screens in the same category. The review then questioned the value of the additional $4,250 cost for the Bose TV, suggesting there were compelling audio alternatives for less than 1/5th the price difference. The same system received a positive review by PC Magazine that cited the user interface and sound quality in an unobtrusive design. *In July 2013, iLounge wrote about the Bose Soundlink Mini, a small remote speaker competing against inexpensive, low-end audio devices, that \\"Audio quality is SoundLink Mini's real trump card over Jambox and most‚Äînot all‚Äîof its competitors... SoundLink Mini delivers much deeper bass and cleaner mid-bass at all volumes, suffering from noticeable distortion solely at the top of its volume scale.\\" Legal action Bose has been described by audio industry professionals as a litigious company. In 1981, Bose unsuccessfully sued the magazine Consumer Reports for libel. Consumer Reports reported in a review that the sound from the system that they reviewed \\"tended to wander about the room.\\" Initially, the Federal District Court found that Consumer Reports \\"had published the false statement with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of its truth or falsity\\" when it changed what the original reviewer wrote about the speakers in his pre-publication draft, that the sound tended to wander \\"along the wall.\\" The Court of Appeals then reversed the trial court's ruling on liability, and the United States Supreme Court affirmed in a 6‚Äì3 vote in the case Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., finding that the statement was made without actual malice, and therefore there was no libel.Commentary on libel cases in general giving a specific example of Bose Corp. v. Consumer's Union of United States. In an interview decades later Amar Bose said \\"We had 37 people at the time. I gathered them in one room and said, 'If we don't do anything, it will probably kill us. But if we do something, we have no credibility since we're just a small company and we can't do anything against this.' I said I think we oughtta do something. I wanted a vote. It was unanimous in favor of taking action. Little did we know it would take 14 years to go through the legal process.\\" Bose sued Thiel Audio in the early 1990s to stop the audiophile loudspeaker maker from using \\".2\\" (point two) at the end of its product model \\"CS2.2\\". To comply with Bose's trademark of \\".2\\" associated with the Bose Model 2.2 product, Thiel changed their model name to \\"CS2 2\\", substituting a space for the decimal point. Bose did not trademark \\".3\\" so in 1997 when Thiel introduced the next model in the series, they named it the \\"Thiel 2.3\\", advertising \\"the return of the decimal point.\\" In 1996, Bose sued two subsidiaries of Harman International Industries‚ÄîJBL and Infinity Systems‚Äîfor violating a Bose patent on elliptical tuning ports on some loudspeaker products. In 2000, the court determined that Harman was to cease using elliptical ports in its products, and Harman was to pay Bose $5.7 million in court costs. Harman stopped using the disputed port design but appealed the financial decision. At the end of 2002, the earlier judgment was upheld but by this time Bose's court expenses had risen to $8 million, all to be paid by Harman. Bose was successful in blocking QSC Audio Products from trademarking the term \\"PowerWave\\" in connection with a certain QSC amplifier technology. In 2002, a court decided that the \\"Wave\\" trademark was worthy of greater protection because it was well-known on its own, even beyond its association with Bose.

CEDIA was criticized for spending nearly $1 million of its member's money on the lawsuit, and Bose was criticized for \\"unsportsmanlike action against its own trade association\\", according to Julie Jacobson of CE Pro magazine. In July 2014, Bose sued Beats Electronics for patent infringement, alleging that its \\"Studio\\" headphones line incorporated Bose noise cancellation technology. Bose and Apple had collaborated on the SoundDock for iPod music players in 2004, then in May 2014 Beats was bought by Apple, bringing Bose and Apple into direct competition in the headphones market. Bose headphones were once the foremost brand offered in Apple stores, but Beats headphones outnumbered Bose headphones in Apple stores at the time of the lawsuit, and Beats had captured 62% of the premium headphones market while Bose held 22%. In October 2014, Bose dropped the lawsuit, as Bose and Beats settled out of court without revealing the terms. Apple removed all Bose products from its Apple stores a few days after the lawsuit was settled, but two months later Bose products were returned to shelves. In April 2017 Bose was sued alleging a privacy violation with regard to the mobile phone apps delivered by Bose to control bluetooth Bose headphones.

It was founded by the Emperor Trajan around CE 100. The full name of the city was Colonia Marciana Ulpia Traiana Thamugadi. Trajan named the city in commemoration of his mother Marcia, eldest sister Ulpia Marciana, and father Marcus Ulpius Traianus. Located in modern-day Algeria, about 35 km east of the city of Batna, the ruins are noteworthy for representing one of the best extant examples of the grid plan as used in Roman town planning. Timgad was inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1982.  Name  In the former name of Timgad, Marciana Traiana Thamugadi, the first part ‚Äì Marciana Traiana ‚Äì is Roman and refers to the name of its founder, Emperor Trajan and his sister Marciana. The second part of the name ‚Äì Thamugadi ‚Äì \\"has nothing Latin about it\\". Thamugadi is the Berber name of the place where the city was built, to read Timgad plural form of Tamgut, meaning \\"peak\\", \\"summit\\". History The city was founded ex nihilo as a military colony by the emperor Trajan around 100 CE. It was intended to serve primarily as a bastion against the Berbers in the nearby Aures Mountains. It was originally populated largely by Roman veterans and had expanded to over 10,000 residents of Roman, African, as well as Berber descent. Although most of them had never seen Rome before, and Timgad was hundreds of miles away from the Italian city, Trajan invested densely in Roman culture and identity. The city enjoyed a peaceful existence for the first several hundred years and became a center of Christian activity starting in the 3rd century, and a Donatist center in the 4th century. In the 5th century, the city was sacked by the Vandals before falling into decline. In 535 CE, the Byzantine general Solomon found the city empty when he came to occupy it during the Vandalic War. In the following century, the city was briefly repopulated as a primarily Christian city before being sacked by Berbers in the 7th century. During the Christian period, Timgad was a diocese which became renowned at the end of the 4th century when Bishop Optat became the spokesman for the Donatist movement. After Optat, Thamugadai had two bishops Gaudentius (Donatist) and Faustinus (Catholic).Maureen A. Tilley, The Bible in Christian North Africa: The Donatist World (Fortress Press,1997)p135. Timgad was destroyed at the end of the 5th century by montagnards of the Aur√®s. The Byzantine Reconquest revived some activities in the city, defended by a fortress built to the south, in 539, reusing blocks removed from Roman monuments. The Arab invasion brought about the final ruin of Thamugadi which ceased to be inhabited after the 8th century CE. Because no new settlements were founded on the site after the 7th century CE, the city was partially preserved under sand up to a depth of approximately one meter. The encroachment of the Sahara on the ruins was the principal reason why the city is so well preserved. Travelling Northern Africa, Scottish explorer James Bruce reached the city ruins on 12 December 1765, likely being the first European to visit the site in centuries and described the city as ‚Äúa small town, but full of elegant buildings.‚Äù In 1790, he published the book Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile, where he described what he had found in Timgad. The book was met with skepticism in Great Britain, until 1875 when Robert Lambert Playfair, Britain‚Äôs consul in Algiers, inspired by Bruce's account, visited the site. In 1877 Playfair described Timgad in more detail in his book Travels in the Footsteps of Bruce in Algeria and Tunis. According to Playfair, ‚ÄúThese hills are covered with countless numbers of the most interesting mega-lithic remains‚Äù. The French colonists took control of the site in 1881, began investigations and maintained it until 1960. During this period, the site was systematically excavated.Montoya, Rub√©n: The Sahara buried this ancient Roman city‚Äîpreserving it for centuries at National Geographic, 30 July 2019. Description Map of the Archeological site Located at the intersection of six roads, the city was walled but not fortified. Originally designed for a population of around 15,000, the city quickly outgrew its original specifications and spilled beyond the orthogonal grid in a more loosely organized fashion. At the time of its founding, the area surrounding the city was a fertile agricultural area, about 1000 meters above sea level. The original Roman grid plan is magnificently visible in the orthogonal design, highlighted by the decumanus maximus (east‚Äìwest-oriented street) and the cardo (north‚Äìsouth-oriented street) lined by a partially restored Corinthian colonnade. The cardo does not proceed completely through the city but instead terminates in a forum at the intersection with the decumanus. At the west end of the decumanus rises a 12 m high triumphal arch, called the Arch of Trajan, which was partially restored in 1900. The arch is principally of sandstone, and is of the Corinthian order with three arches, the central one being 11' wide. The arch is also known as the Timgad Arch. A 3,500-seat theater is in good condition and is used for contemporary productions. The other key buildings include four thermae, a library, and a basilica. The Capitoline Temple is dedicated to Jupiter and is of approximately the same dimensions as the Pantheon in Rome. Nearby the capitol is a square church, with a circular apse dating from the 7th century CE. One of the sanctuaries featured iconography of (Dea) Africa. Southeast of the city is a large Byzantine citadel built in the later days of the city. Library View of Timgad ruins The Library at Timgad was a gift to the Roman people by Julius Quintianus Flavius Rogatianus at a cost of 400,000 sesterces.Pfeiffer, H. (1931). The Roman Library at Timgad. Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome, 9, 157-165. As no additional information about this benefactor has been unearthed, the precise date of the library's construction remains uncertain. Based on the remaining archaeological evidence, it has been suggested by scholars that it dates from the late 3rd or possibly the 4th century. The library occupies a rectangle 81 feet (24.69 meters) long by 77 feet (23.47 meters) wide. It consists of a large semi-circular room flanked by two secondary rectangular rooms, and preceded by a U-shaped colonnaded portico surrounding three sides on an open court. The portico is flanked by two long narrow rooms on each side, and the large vaulted hall would have combined the functions of a reading room, stack room, and perhaps a lecture room. Oblong alcoves held wooden shelves along walls that would likely have been complete with sides, backs and doors, based on additional evidence found at the library at Ephesus. It is possible that free-standing bookcases in the center of the room, as well as a reading desk, might also have been present. While the architecture of the Library at Timgad is not especially remarkable, the discovery of the library is historically important as it shows the presence of a fully developed library system in this Roman city, indicating a high standard of learning and culture. While there is no evidence as to the size of the collection the library harbored, it is estimated that it could have accommodated 3,000 scrolls. World Heritage Site Timgad was inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1982.

Carnival Corporation is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Carnival plc is listed on the London Stock Exchange. Carnival is listed in both the S&P; 500 and FTSE 250 indices.

Please note that U.S. postal address city names do not always adhere to municipal boundaries (see the postal address portion this page for further information) History Carnival Corporation was founded as Carnival Cruise Line in 1972. The company grew steadily throughout the 1970s and 1980s, making an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange in 1987. The capital generated was used to finance acquisitions. Between 1989 and 1999, the company acquired Holland America Line, Windstar Cruises, Westours, Seabourn Cruise Line, Costa Cruises and Cunard Line. The name Carnival Corporation was adopted in 1993, to distinguish the parent company from its flagship cruise line subsidiary. P&O; Princess Cruises plc was formed in 2000, following the demerger of the cruise ship division of the P&O; group. Originating as the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company in England in 1837, P&O; operated the world's first commercial cruise ships. Restructuring of the P&O; group in the 20th century led to its cruise operations being rebranded as P&O; Cruises and P&O; Cruises Australia, with the company acquiring Princess Cruises in 1974. Following the demerger in 2000, the company also acquired AIDA Cruises, as well as establishing the A'Rosa Cruises and Ocean Village brands. In 2003, Carnival Corporation acquired P&O; Princess Cruises plc. It was agreed that P&O; Princess Cruises plc would remain a separate company, listed on the London Stock Exchange and retaining its British shareholder body and management team. The company was renamed Carnival plc, with the operations of the two companies merged into one entity. Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc jointly own all the operating companies in the Carnival group. Prior to Carnival Corporation's acquisition, P&O; Princess Cruises plc had agreed to a merger with Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. The deal unraveled as Carnival Corporation initiated a hostile takeover with improved terms for British shareholders. Carnival sold Windstar Cruises to Ambassadors Group in February 2007 and Swan Hellenic to Lord Sterling in March 2007. In October 2015, CSSC Carnival Cruise Shipping, a joint venture between Carnival, the China Investment Corporation, and the China State Shipbuilding Corporation, was founded, with operations expected to commence in 2019. In March 2018, Carnival Corporation announced its intention to invest in the construction of a new terminal in the port of Sasebo, Japan. It is expected to open in 2020. In June 2018, Carnival Corporation announced that it had acquired the White Pass and Yukon Route from TWC Enterprises Limited for US$290 million. The properties acquired were port, railroad and retail operations in Skagway, Alaska.  Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic  All cruise ship itineraries were cancelled in March 2020 due to the worldwide pandemic and eventually, 55 passengers on ships owned by Carnival Corporation & plc were reported as having died. After months of cancelled cruises, Carnival Corporation & plc announced in September 2020 that it intended to dispose of 18 ships, a full 12% of the global fleet. By that time, four ships had already been scrapped: Carnival Fantasy, Carnival Fascination, Carnival Imagination, Carnival Inspiration and Costa Victoria. The corporation also announced that it was delaying the delivery of several ships already on order. These steps were part of the company's cost-cutting plan, important because the \\"pause in guest operations continues to have a material negative impact on all aspects of the company‚Äôs business, including the company‚Äôs liquidity, financial position and results of operations\\". The adjusted net loss in the third quarter was reported by the Corporation to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as US$1.7 billion. As of September 2020, the no-sail rule by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention prohibited cruising in the U.S. until October 31, 2020 at the earliest. Members of the Cruise Lines International Association, including Carnival Corporation & plc, had announced in early August that its members were extending a voluntary suspension until October 31; that applied to cruises that were to depart from the U.S. or planned to stop at U.S. ports of call. Current operations The Carnival group comprises nine cruise line brands and one cruise experience brand operating a combined fleet of 104 ships. The following operating companies have full executive control of the Carnival brands in their portfolio, with the exception of CSSC Carnival Cruise Shipping in which 40% is controlled: Carnival of the Americas * Carnival Cruise Line ‚Äì headquarters in Miami, Florida, US Carnival United Kingdom * P&O; Cruises ‚Äì headquarters in Southampton, UK * Cunard Line ‚Äì headquarters in Southampton, UK Holland America Group * Holland America Line ‚Äì headquarters in Seattle, Washington, US * Princess Cruises ‚Äì headquarters in Santa Clarita, California, US * Seabourn Cruise Line ‚Äì headquarters in Seattle, Washington, US * P&O; Cruises Australia ‚Äì headquarters in Sydney, Australia Carnival Australia * Carnival Cruise Line Australia ‚Äì headquarters in Sydney, Australia Carnival China *Carnival Cruise Shipping ‚Äì headquarters in Hong Kong, China Costa Group * Costa Cruises ‚Äì headquarters in Genoa, Italy * AIDA Cruises ‚Äì headquarters in Rostock, Germany Brands and ships=AIDA Cruises AIDA Cruises originated from the state-owned German shipping conglomerate Deutsche Seereederei, established in Rostock, Germany, in 1952. The company entered the passenger market in the 1960s, but after the unification of Germany in 1990, the company was privatised and its passenger ships acquired by Deutsche Seetouristik. In 1996, the company launched its first new cruise ship AIDA, but after failing to achieve a profit, the ship was sold to Norwegian Cruise Line, continuing operations under a charter agreement. In 1999, Deutsche Seetouristik was acquired by British shipping company P&O;, with the AIDA name being repurchased from NCL. P&O; subsequently formed AIDA Cruises as a subsidiary brand, with two new ships ordered to form a fleet. AIDA was renamed AIDAcara, with AIDAvita and AIDAaura launched in 2002 and 2003 respectively. =AIDA Cruises ships= *AIDAcara *AIDAvita *AIDAaura *AIDAdiva *AIDAbella *AIDAluna *AIDAblu *AIDAsol *AIDAmar *AIDAmira *AIDAstella *AIDAprima *AIDAperla *AIDAnova *AIDAcosma (future) Carnival Cruise Line Carnival Cruise Line was founded in 1972 as a subsidiary of American International Travel Service (AITS), by Ted Arison and Meshulam Riklis. Due to mounting debts, Riklis sold his stake in the company to Arison for $1 in 1974. However through the acquisition of existing ships, the company continued to grow and, in 1980, Carnival ordered its first new commission, the Tropicale, which was completed in 1981/2. Three further ships were commissioned during the 1980s, the Holiday (1985), Jubilee (1986) and Celebration (1987). In 1987, Carnival completed an initial public offering of 20 percent of its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange, raising approximately $400m in capital. The capital raised was used to finance acquisitions, so in 1993 the business was restructured as a holding company, under the name Carnival Corporation, with Carnival Cruise Line becoming its principal subsidiary. =Carnival Cruise Line ships= *Carnival Breeze *Carnival Conquest *Carnival Celebration (due Autumn 2022) *Carnival Dream *Carnival Ecstasy *Carnival Elation *Carnival Freedom *Carnival Glory *Carnival Horizon *Carnival Legend *Carnival Liberty *Carnival Magic *Mardi Gras (due Spring 2021) *Carnival Miracle *Carnival Panorama *Carnival Paradise *Carnival Pride *Carnival Sensation *Carnival Spirit *Carnival Splendor *Carnival Sunshine *Carnival Sunrise *Carnival Valor *Carnival Victory (Carnival Radiance in mid-2020) *Carnival Vista Costa Cruises Costa Cruises originates from a cargo shipping company founded by Giacomo Costa fu Andrea in Genoa, Italy in 1854. Better known as Costa Line or C Line by the 1920s, its first passenger carrier was Maria C, a former U.S. Navy stores ship that was partly converted for passenger use and served various routes to North and South America from 1947 to 1953. The company's first dedicated passenger ship was the Anna C, a cargo vessel that was requisitioned for war time use by the Royal Navy and refitted as an accommodation ship before returning to merchant use. Costa purchased the ship in 1947 and it operated between Italy and South America from 1948, later converting to full-time cruising and serving with the company until 1971. From the late 1960s until the 1980s, Costa rapidly developed its passenger operations into what we now recognise as modern cruise ships. Subsequently, in 1987, it consolidated its cruise ship operations into a new company, Costa Cruises, which at its peak, was the largest cruise ship operator in the world. The takeover of Costa Cruises by Carnival Corporation began in 1997, as a 50/50 deal between Carnival and the British tour operator Airtours. On 13 January 2012, Costa Concordia, a ship operated by the line, hit an underwater rock and ran aground in Isola del Giglio, Tuscany, resulting in 32 deaths. Investigations proved that the captain and general bad organization was responsible for the disaster, and the company was fined. =Costa Cruises ships= *Costa Deliziosa *Costa Diadema *Costa Fascinosa *Costa Favolosa *Costa Firenze (future) *Costa Fortuna *Costa Luminosa *Costa Magica *Costa Mediterranea *Costa Pacifica *Costa Serena *Costa Smeralda *Costa Toscana (future) *Costa Venezia Carnival CSSC CSSC Carnival Cruise Shipping (Carnival China) is a Chinese-American cruise line that is scheduled to begin operation in 2019. CSSC Carnival was founded in October 2015 as a joint venture, worth about $4 billion over ten years, between American cruise line Carnival Corporation & plc, Chinese sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corporation, and Chinese shipbuilder China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC). CSSC Carnival is headquartered in Hong Kong and is majority owned by the Chinese shareholders, which collectively own 60% of the company, with Carnival holding the remainder. * Costa Atlantica Cunard Line The second oldest brand in the Carnival group after P&O;, Cunard Line originated in 1840 and celebrated its 179th anniversary in 2019. It was founded by Samuel Cunard, who was awarded the first trans-Atlantic mail contract in 1837 and established the British and North American Royal Mail Steam-Packet Company in 1840.Langley, John G. (2006). Steam Lion. Nimbus After initially dominating the trans-Atlantic route, the need for new capital led to the company being re-organised as the Cunard Steamship Company Ltd in 1879.Gibbs, Charles Robert Vernon (1957). Passenger Liners of the Western Ocean: A Record of Atlantic Steam and Motor Passenger Vessels from 1838 to the Present Day. John De Graff. pp. 52‚Äì92 The early 1900s saw increased competition for speed, particularly from Germany, which led the British government to subsidise the building of Mauretania and Lusitania, which both won the Blue Riband. Competition continued to increase however and by the early 1930s, Cunard was experiencing financial difficulties. To secure further government subsidy, it agreed to merge with its chief rival White Star Line, to form Cunard-White Star Line in 1934.Gibbs, Charles Robert Vernon (1957). Passenger Liners of the Western Ocean: A Record of Atlantic Steam and Motor Passenger Vessels from 1838 to the Present Day. John De Graff. pp. 52‚Äì92. Cunard later purchased the remaining White Star shares in 1947, reverting to the name Cunard Line in 1949. Cunard continued to operate independently until 1971, when it was acquired by the conglomerate Trafalgar House, which was in turn taken over by the Norwegian company Kv√¶rner in 1996. In 1998, Carnival Corporation purchased a controlling stake in Cunard, completing the acquisition in 1999 to become sole shareholder. Since that time, Cunard has been one of Carnival's most high- profile brands, with the continued popularity of the famous Queen Elizabeth 2 and the development of the world's largest trans-Atlantic Ocean liner Queen Mary 2, which continues to be the flagship of the fleet. =Cunard Line ships= *Queen Elizabeth *Queen Mary 2 *Queen Victoria Holland America Line Holland America Line originated as Plate, Reuchlin & Company, founded in Rotterdam, Netherlands, in 1871. Initially struggling to survive, the company went public in 1873, renamed Nederlandsch Amerikaansche Stoomvaart Maatschappij (NASM). The company grew quickly in the early years, acquiring several new ships, including SS Rotterdam, which operated the company's first passenger cruise in 1895. The company also quickly became known by its shortened English name, Holland America Line, which was officially adopted in 1869. By the early 1900s, the company had separated its cargo and passenger operations, with its passenger ships being identifiable by names ending with dam, a tradition which continues with Holland America cruise ships today. The development of container shipping in the 1960s, forced the company to make a decision between investing in new cargo ships, or cruise ships. It ultimately sold its cargo operations, becoming exclusively a cruise ship company in 1973. Holland America continued to thrive well into the 1980s, consolidating its business with the acquisitions of Westours, Windstar Cruises and Home Lines. In 1989 however, it was itself the subject of an acquisition, when it was purchased in full by Carnival Corporation. =Holland America Line ships= *MS Eurodam *MS Koningsdam *MS Nieuw Amsterdam *MS Noordam *MS Oosterdam *MS Nieuw Statendam *MS Rotterdam (future) *MS Volendam *MS Westerdam *MS Zaandam *MS Zuiderdam P&O; Cruises P&O; Cruises was originally a subsidiary of the British shipping company P&O; and was founded during a restructuring of P&O;'s operations in 1977. Along with P&O; Cruises Australia, a sister company also founded by P&O;, it has the oldest heritage of any cruise line in the world, dating to P&O;'s first passenger operations in 1837. P&O; Cruises was divested from P&O; in 2000, becoming a subsidiary of P&O; Princess Cruises, before coming under the ownership of Carnival Corporation & plc in 2003, following the merger between P&O; Princess Cruises and Carnival Corporation. At the time P&O; Cruises and Princess Cruises demerged with Princess Cruises moving to the Corporation side and Cunard merging with P&O; cruises to make Carnival UK. P&O; Cruises is based in Southampton, England, and operates a fleet of six ships, dedicated to serving the British market. =P&O; Cruises ships= *Arcadia *Aurora *Azura *Britannia *Iona *Ventura P&O; Cruises Australia *Pacific Adventure (future) *Pacific Aria *Pacific Dawn *Pacific Encounter (future) *Pacific Explorer Princess Cruises *Caribbean Princess *Coral Princess *Crown Princess *Diamond Princess *Discovery Princess (future) *Emerald Princess *Enchanted Princess (future) *Golden Princess *Grand Princess *Island Princess *Majestic Princess *Pacific Princess *Regal Princess *Royal Princess *Ruby Princess *Sapphire Princess *Sky Princess *Star Princess Seabourn Cruise Line *Seabourn Encore *Seabourn Odyssey *Seabourn Ovation *Seabourn Quest *Seabourn Sojourn *Seabourn Venture (future) Former brands *A'Rosa Cruises ‚Äì Established by P&O; Princess in 2001, sold following the Carnival merger in 2003 *Fathom ‚Äì Established by the Carnival Corporation in 2015 ‚Äì Ended cruise operations in 2017.

Repeated violations of environmental laws In 2002 the Carnival Corporation pleaded guilty in United States District Court in Miami to criminal charges related to falsifying records of the oil-contaminated bilge water that six of its ships dumped into the sea from 1996 through 2001. The Carnival Corporation was ordered to pay $18 million in fines and perform community service, received five years' probation and must submit to a court-supervised worldwide environmental-compliance program for each of its cruise ships. For dumping oiled waste into the seas and lying to cover it up, Princess Cruise Lines was fined $40 million in 2016. According to federal authorities, it was the \\"largest-ever criminal penalty\\" for intentional vessel pollution. Officials said that these practices began in 2005 and persisted until August 2013, when a newly hired engineer blew the whistle. As part of its plea agreement, ships of the parent company Carnival Cruise lines were subjected to a court supervised environmental compliance plan for five years. For violation of the probation terms of 2016 Carnival and its Princess line were ordered to pay an additional $20 million penalty in 2019. The new violations included discharging plastic into waters in the Bahamas, falsifying records, and interfering with court supervision.

Early life  Jones was born on January 20, 1798, in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. He traveled to Seneca Falls, New York, and opened a one-room school. He taught there from 1812 to 1813. In 1820, Jones was licensed as a doctor by the Oneida, New York, Medical Society, and began medical practice in 1822. However, his practice did not prosper, and he moved several more times before finally being arrested in Philadelphia by a creditor. He stayed in Philadelphia for a few more years, teaching and practicing medicine, until in 1823, he decided to go to Venezuela. Later, Jones returned to Philadelphia, earned an MD, and reopened his practice. He never had much success as a doctor, and in 1832, he renounced medicine and headed for New Orleans, where he entered the mercantile trade. Once again, though, Jones's dreams were thwarted. Though he safely weathered two plagues, his business efforts never met with any success, and within a year he had no money. He was a member and Past Master of the Masonic Harmony Lodge #52 of Philadelphia. He was a Past Grand of Independent Order of Odd Fellows Washington Lodge no. 2 and Philadelphia Lodge no. 13 in Pennsylvania and a Past Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania.  Life in Texas  Anson Jones House, now in Washington-on-the-Brazos, Texas In 1832, Jones headed west to Texas, settling eventually in Brazoria. Here, at last, he met with success, establishing a medical practice that prospered quickly. In 1835, he began to speak out about the growing tensions between Texas and Mexico, and that year he attended the Consultation, a meeting held at Columbia, by Texas patriots to discuss the fight with Mexico (the meeting's leadership did not want to call the meeting a \\"convention\\", for fear the Mexican government would view it as an independence forum). Jones himself presented a resolution at the Consultation calling for a convention to be held to declare independence, but he himself refused to be nominated to the convention. During the Texas Revolution, Jones served as a judge advocate and surgeon to the Texas Army, though he insisted on holding the rank of private throughout the conflict. After the war, Jones returned to Brazoria and resumed his medical practice. Upon his return to Brazoria, Jones found that James Collinsworth, a fellow Texas patriot and signer of the Texas Declaration of Independence from Brazoria, had set up a law practice in Jones's office. Jones evicted Collinsworth and challenged him to a duel (though the duel never occurred). Just a few months before the revolution, on March 2, 1834, Jones met with four other Masons at Brazoria and petitioned the Grand Master of Louisiana for a dispensation and a charter to form the first Masonic lodge in Texas. In December, when the lodge was set to labor, Jones was elected its first Master. The charter for Holland Lodge No. 36 arrived during the final days of the revolution, and Jones carried it in his saddlebags during the decisive Battle of San Jacinto on April 21, 1836. At the formation of the Grand Lodge of the Republic of Texas in December 1837, he was elected its first Grand Master. He also became the first Grand Master of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows in Texas. On May 17, 1840, he married Mary Smith Jones. Together, they had four children.  Move to politics  Texas Historical Commission marker located in Glenwood Cemetery (Houston, Texas) commemorating the many important contributions made by Anson Jones to the history of Texas Jones and Collinsworth would spar again. Collinsworth was instrumental in starting the Texas Railroad, Navigation, and Banking Company, to which Jones was vehemently opposed. Jones was elected to the Second Texas Congress as an opponent of the company; however, his most significant act in Congress was to call for the withdrawal of the Texas proposal for annexation by the United States. He also helped draw up legislation to regulate medical practice, and called for the establishment of an endowment for a university. Jones expected to return to his practice at Brazoria after his term in Congress, but Texas President Sam Houston instead appointed him Minister to the United States, where Jones was to formally withdraw the annexation proposal. During this time, while many Texans hoped to encourage eventual annexation by the United States, some supported waiting for annexation or even remaining independent. The United States, in the late 1830s, was hesitant to annex Texas for fear of provoking a war with Mexico. Jones and others felt that Texas gaining recognition from European states was important, and began to set up trade relations with them, to make annexation of Texas more attractive to the United States, or failing that, to give Texas the strength to remain independent. Jones was recalled to Texas by new president Mirabeau Lamar in 1839. Back at home, he found himself elected to a partial term in the Senate, where he quickly became a critic of Lamar's administration. He retired from the Senate in 1841, declining the opportunity to serve as Vice President in favor of returning to his medical practice. Late in 1841, though, he was named Texas Secretary of State by President Houston, who had been recently been elected president again by opponents of Lamar. Jones served as Secretary of State until 1844. During his term, the main goal of Texas foreign policy was to get either an offer of annexation from the United States, or a recognition of Texas independence from Mexico, or preferably, both at the same time. Anson Jones served as the fourth and last President of the Republic of Texas.  After presidency  Jones hoped that the new Texas state legislature would send him to the United States Senate. He was not chosen, and as time went on, he became increasingly bitter about this slight. Although Jones prospered as a planter and eventually amassed an enormous estate, he was never able to get past the fact that Sam Houston and Thomas Jefferson Rusk were chosen over him to represent Texas in Washington, DC. After the suicide of Thomas Jefferson Rusk in 1857, Jones became convinced that the legislature would finally send him to the Senate, but he received no votes. In 1849 Jones was thrown from a horse. His left arm was crushed and became withered and discolored. This injury sent him back east for medical treatment. In the east he was exposed to and found keen interest in new technology, especially railroads.  Death  Glenwood Cemetery in Houston For four days, he had lodged at Houston's old Capitol Hotel, the former seat of government of the Republic of Texas. His arm permanently injured in a fall, and having received no votes for a vacant seat in the U.S. Senate, he brooded over his career. After dinner on January 9, 1858, he returned to his room and fatally shot himself.Anson Jones Left Behind He was 59 years old. Jones was buried at Glenwood Cemetery in Houston.  Legacy  Jones County Courthouse in Anson, Texas Jones County, and its county seat, Anson, were both named for Anson Jones. The Anson Jones Elementary Schools in Bryan, Texas and Midland, Texas, are named for him along with Anson Jones Middle School In San Antonio, Texas, as well as Anson Jones Elementary in the Dallas ISD system.Jones Elementary School, Bryan, Texas His plantation home, known as Barrington, is preserved at Washington-on-the-Brazos State Historic Park.

He was the father of poet and essayist Kim Stafford. He was appointed the twentieth Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress in 1970. Early life=Background Stafford was born in Hutchinson, Kansas, the oldest of three children in a highly literate family. During the Depression, his family moved from town to town in an effort to find work for his father. Stafford helped contribute to family income by delivering newspapers, working in sugar beet fields, raising vegetables, and working as an electrician's apprentice. Stafford graduated from high school in the town of Liberal, Kansas in 1933. After initially attending junior college, he received a B.A. from the University of Kansas in 1937. He was drafted into the United States armed forces in 1941, while pursuing his master's degree at the University of Kansas, but declared himself a pacifist. As a registered conscientious objector, he performed alternative service from 1942 to 1946 in the Civilian Public Service camps. The work consisted of forestry and soil conservation work in Arkansas, California, and Illinois for $2.50 per month. While working in California in 1944, he met and married Dorothy Hope Frantz, with whom he later had four children (Bret, who died in 1988; Kim, writer; Kit, artist; Barbara, artist). He received his M.A. from the University of Kansas in 1947. His master's thesis, the prose memoir Down In My Heart, was published in 1948 and described his experience in the forest service camps. He taught English for one academic semester (1947) to 11th graders (juniors) at Chaffey Union High School, Ontario California. That same year he moved to Oregon to teach at Lewis & Clark College. In 1954, he received a Ph.D. from the University of Iowa. Stafford taught for one academic year (1955‚Äì1956) in the English department at Manchester College in Indiana, a college affiliated with the Church of the Brethren where he had received training during his time in Civilian Public Service. The following year (1956‚Äì57), he taught at San Jose State in California, and the next year returned to the faculty of Lewis & Clark. Career One striking feature of his career is its late start. Stafford was 46 years old when his first major collection of poetry was published, Traveling Through the Dark, which won the 1963 National Book Award for Poetry.\\"National Book Awards ‚Äì 1963\\". National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-03-03. (With acceptance speech by Stafford and essay by Eric Smith from the Awards 60-year anniversary blog.) The title poem is one of his best known works. It describes encountering a recently killed doe on a mountain road. Before pushing the doe into a canyon, the narrator discovers that she was pregnant and the fawn inside is still alive. Stafford had a quiet daily ritual of writing and his writing focuses on the ordinary. His gentle quotidian style has been compared to Robert Frost. Paul Merchant writes, \\"His poems are accessible, sometimes deceptively so, with a conversational manner that is close to everyday speech. Among predecessors whom he most admired are William Wordsworth, Thomas Hardy, Walt Whitman, and Emily Dickinson.\\" His poems are typically short, focusing on the earthy, accessible details appropriate to a specific locality. Stafford said this in a 1971 interview: > I keep following this sort of hidden river of my life, you know, whatever > the topic or impulse which comes, I follow it along trustingly. And I don't > have any sense of its coming to a kind of crescendo, or of its petering out > either. It is just going steadily along. Stafford was a close friend and collaborator with poet Robert Bly. Despite his late start, he was a frequent contributor to magazines and anthologies and eventually published fifty-seven volumes of poetry. James Dickey called Stafford one of those poets \\"who pour out rivers of ink, all on good poems.\\" He kept a daily journal for 50 years, and composed nearly 22,000 poems, of which roughly 3,000 were published. In 1970, he was named Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress, a position that is now known as Poet Laureate. In 1975, he was named Poet Laureate of Oregon; his tenure in the position lasted until 1990.See list of Oregon Poets Laureate, at < http://oregonpoetlaureate.org/history/>. In 1980, he retired from Lewis & Clark College but continued to travel extensively and give public readings of his poetry. In 1992, he won the Western States Book Award for lifetime achievement in poetry. Personal life Stafford died at his home in Lake Oswego, Oregon on August 28, 1993. The morning of his death he had written a poem containing the lines, \\"'You don't have to / prove anything,' my mother said. 'Just be ready / for what God sends.'\\" In 2008, the Stafford family gave William Stafford's papers, including the 20,000 pages of his daily writing, to the Special Collections Department at Lewis & Clark College. Kim Stafford, who serves as literary executor for the Estate of William Stafford, has written a memoir, Early Morning: Remembering My Father, William Stafford (Graywolf Press).

The toys are also known as good luck trolls, or gonk trolls in the United Kingdom. The dolls were first created in 1959 and became one of the United States' biggest toy fads in the early 1960s. They became briefly popular again during the 1970s through the 1990s and were copied by several manufacturers under different names. During the 1990s, several video games and a video show were created based on troll dolls. In 2003, the Dam company restored the United States copyrights for this brand, stopping unlicensed production. In 2005, the Dam company modernized the brand under the name Trollz, but it failed in the marketplace.http://www.trollsdolls.com/tag/varieties-of-trolls-dolls/ In 2013, the brand was bought by DreamWorks Animation, with an animated feature film called Trolls being released in 2016.  Toy history  Troll dolls were originally created in 1959 by Danish fisherman and woodcutter Thomas Dam. Dam could not afford a Christmas gift for his young daughter Lila and carved the doll from his imagination. Other children in the Danish town of Gj√∏l saw the doll and wanted one. Dam's company Dam Things began producing the dolls in plastic under the name Good Luck Trolls.BNA's patent, trademark & copyright journal Bureau of National Affairs (Arlington, Va.) - 2002 \\"In the 1950s, Danish woodcarver Thomas Dam created a plastic mould to shape a doll that he began producing as the ‚ÄúGood Luck Trolls.‚Äù Dam's company, Dam Things from Denmark, holds valid Danish copyrights in the trolls\\" It became popular in several European countries during the early 1960s, shortly before they were introduced in the United States. They became one of the United States' biggest toy fads from the autumn of 1963 to 1965. The originals were of the highest quality, also called Dam dolls and featuring sheep wool hair and glass eyes. Their sudden popularity, along with an error in the copyright notice of Thomas Dam's original product, resulted in cheaper imitations. A collection of troll dolls The Dam company never stopped its production of trolls in Denmark, where they were always a popular item. In the late 1980s, the Dam trolls started making another comeback in North America. E.F.S. Marketing Associates, Inc. was one of the few corporations granted permission to import and market the Thomas Dam trolls for resale in the United States. These Dam Trolls were marketed under the trade name of Norfin Trolls, with an \\"Adopt A Norfin Troll\\" logo on the tags. During the period of popularity in the early to mid-1990s, several attempts were made to market the troll dolls to young boys. This included action figure lines such as The Original Battle Trolls from Hasbro, the Stone Protectors franchise, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Trolls. The popular Mighty Max line also had a series named Hairy Heads, also known as Dread Heads. In 2003, the Dam copyright was restored by the Uruguay Round Agreements Act. The Uneeda Doll Company, a company that made millions of US dollars by manufacturing troll dolls in the U.S., challenged the restoration. The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the lower court's preliminary injunction, enjoining Uneeda from manufacturing, distributing, or selling \\"Wish-nik\\" troll dolls.Troll Company v. Uneeda Doll Company, 483 F.3d 150 (2d Cir. April 13, 2007). Retrieved October 25, 2011.

Business Wire, 21 January 2003. Retrieved 31 October 2008. In 2005, the troll brand was licensed to DIC Entertainment, and products such as fashion dolls and fashion accessories were sold under the Trollz name. The new Trollz campaign was not successful. In 2007, the Danish company filed a lawsuit against DIC Entertainment claiming that the company financially misrepresented its ability to create and market a modern troll doll toy campaign and destroyed the image and goodwill of the doll.  Television, film and video games  The Magic Trolls And The Troll Warriors was a 1991 cartoon special made to promote the Troll doll toys, featuring Trolls battling against King Nolaf and his Troll Warriors.The Magic Trolls and the Troll Warriors There was also a 30-minute DIC cartoon special in 1992 called Magical Super Trolls which featured an evil troll named Craven.Super Trolls Syndication A platform video game simply titled Trolls was released in 1993 for Amiga, DOS, and C64. Other games were released for the NES (Trolls on Treasure Island (a modified re-release of Dudes with Attitude) and The Trolls in Crazyland (a localized version of Doki! Doki! Y≈´enchi: Crazy Land Daisakusen)) and SNES (Super Troll Islands). The 1990s troll doll fad also included The Trollies Radio Show, which was a direct-to-video musical with puppet trolls singing hits such as \\"Kokomo\\", \\"Woolly Bully\\", and \\"Do Wah Diddy\\", as well as some original songs. The 2005 DIC Entertainment range included an animated series called Trollz. The series stars five trolls who live in a magical world of ogres, gnomes and dragons, but experience everyday aspects of teenage life. On April 11, 2013, DreamWorks Animation announced that it had acquired the intellectual property for the Trolls franchise from the Dam Family and Dam Things and become the exclusive worldwide licensor of the merchandise rights, except for Scandinavia, where Dam Things remains the licensor. DreamWorks produced a 3D computer-animated musical comedy film based on the Troll dolls, Trolls, released on November 4, 2016. It was directed by Mike Mitchell and co-directed by Walt Dohrn, with Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake providing the voices. A sequel, Trolls World Tour, was announced in early 2017, scheduled for theatrical release on April 10, 2020 in North America. The film was originally planned to be released theatrically in the United States on this day. However, on March 17, Universal Pictures announced that the film would be released simultaneously in drive-in theaters, as regular movie theaters closed due to the restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and through Premium VOD in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, South Korea and Italy. This affected the number of projections and the box office performance of the film. As the pandemic receded, the film was released back in regular theatres.

It is native to the Mediterranean region and is used as bay leaf for seasoning in cooking. Its common names include bay tree (esp. United Kingdom), bay laurel, sweet bay, true laurel, Grecian laurel, or simply laurel. Laurus nobilis figures prominently in classical Greco-Roman culture. Worldwide, many other kinds of plants in diverse families are also called \\"bay\\" or \\"laurel\\", generally due to similarity of foliage or aroma to Laurus nobilis, and the full name is used for the California bay laurel (Umbellularia), also in the family Lauraceae. Description A laurel shrub Laurus nobilis in pot Laurus nobilis bloomed The laurel is an evergreen shrub or small tree, variable in size and sometimes reaching tall. The genus Laurus includes four accepted species, whose diagnostic key characters often overlap.Mabberley, The Plant-Book: A Portable Dictionary of the Vascular Plants, Cambridge University Press, 19 Jun 1997 The bay laurel is dioecious (unisexual), with male and female flowers on separate plants. Each flower is pale yellow-green, about diameter, and they are borne in pairs beside a leaf. The leaves are glabrous, long and broad, with an entire (untoothed) margin. On some leaves the margin undulates. The fruit is a small, shiny black berry-like drupe about long that contains one seed. A recent study found considerable genetic diversity within L. nobilis, and that L. azorica is not genetically or morphologically distinct. Ecology Laurus nobilis is a widespread relic of the laurel forests that originally covered much of the Mediterranean Basin when the climate of the region was more humid. With the drying of the Mediterranean during the Pliocene era, the laurel forests gradually retreated, and were replaced by the more drought-tolerant sclerophyll plant communities familiar today. Most of the last remaining laurel forests around the Mediterranean are believed to have disappeared approximately ten thousand years ago, although some remnants still persist in the mountains of southern Turkey, northern Syria, southern Spain, north- central Portugal, northern Morocco, the Canary Islands and in Madeira. Human uses=Food The plant is the source of several popular herbs and one spice used in a wide variety of recipes, particularly among Mediterranean cuisines. Most commonly, the aromatic leaves are added whole to Italian pasta sauces. They are typically removed from dishes before serving, unless used as a simple garnish. Whole bay leaves have a long shelf life of about one year, under normal temperature and humidity. Whole bay leaves are used almost exclusively as flavor agents during the food preparation stage. Ground bay leaves, however, can be ingested safely and are often used in soups and stocks, as well as being a common addition to a Bloody Mary. Dried laurel berries and pressed leaf oil can both be used as robust spices, and the wood can be burnt for strong smoke flavoring. Ornamental Laurus nobilis is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant in regions with Mediterranean or oceanic climates, and as a house plant or greenhouse plant in colder regions. It is used in topiary to create single erect stems with ball-shaped, box- shaped or twisted crowns; also for low hedges. However it is slow-growing and may take several years to reach the desired height. Together with a gold form, L. nobilis 'Aurea' and a willow-leaved form L. nobilis f. angustifolia, it has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Alternative medicine Laurus nobilis essential oil in clear glass vial In herbal medicine, aqueous extracts of bay laurel have been used as an astringent and salve for open wounds.. It is also used in massage therapy and aromatherapy. A folk remedy for rashes caused by poison ivy, poison oak, and stinging nettle is a poultice soaked in boiled bay leaves. The Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder listed a variety of conditions which laurel oil was supposed to treat: paralysis, spasms, sciatica, bruises, headaches, catarrhs, ear infections, and rheumatism. Other uses Laurel oil is a secondary ingredient, and the distinguishing fragrant characteristic of Aleppo soap. Symbolism Petrarch, laurated poet, father of humanism Ancient Greece In ancient Greece, the plant was called daphne, after the mythic mountain nymph of the same name. In the myth of Apollo and Daphne, the god Apollo fell in love with Daphne, a priestess of Gaia (Mother Earth), and when he tried to seduce her she pled for help to Gaia, who transported her to Crete. In Daphne's place Gaia left a laurel tree, from which Apollo fashioned wreaths to console himself. Other versions of the myth, including that of the Roman poet Ovid, state that Daphne was transformed directly into a laurel tree. Translation by A. S. Kline, 2000. Bay laurel was used to fashion the laurel wreath of ancient Greece, a symbol of highest status. A wreath of bay laurels was given as the prize at the Pythian Games because the games were in honor of Apollo, and the laurel was one of his symbols. According to the poet Lucian, the priestess of Apollo known as the Pythia reputedly chewed laurel leaves from a sacred tree growing inside the temple to induce the enthusiasmos (trance) from which she uttered the oracular prophecies for which she was famous. Some accounts starting in the fourth century BC describe her as shaking a laurel branch while delivering her prophecies. Those who received promising omens from the Pythia were crowned with laurel wreaths as a symbol of Apollo's favor. Rome The symbolism carried over to Roman culture, which held the laurel as a symbol of victory. It was also associated with immortality, with ritual purification, prosperity and health. It is also the source of the words baccalaureate and poet laureate, as well as the expressions \\"assume the laurel\\" and \\"resting on one's laurels\\". Pliny the Elder stated that the Laurel was not permitted for \\"profane\\" uses ‚Äì lighting it on fire at altars \\"for the propitiation of divinities\\" was strictly forbidden, because \\"...it is very evident that the laurel protests against such usage by crackling as it does in the fire, thus, in a manner, giving expression to its abhorrence of such treatment.\\" Laurel was closely associated with the Roman Emperors, beginning with Augustus. Two Laurel trees flanked the entrance to Augustus' house on the Palatine Hill in Rome, which itself was connected to the Temple of Apollo Palatinus which Augustus had built. Thus the laurels had the dual purpose of advertising Augustus' victory in the Civil Wars and his close association with Apollo. Suetonius relates the story of Augustus' wife, and Rome's first Empress, Livia, who planted a sprig of laurel on the grounds of her villa at Prima Porta after an eagle dropped a hen with the sprig clutched in its beak onto her lap. The sprig grew into a full-size tree which fostered an entire grove of laurel trees, which were in turn added to by subsequent Emperors when they celebrated a triumph. The Emperors in the Julio-Claudian dynasty all sourced their Laurel wreaths from the original tree planted by Livia. It was taken as an omen of the impending end of the Julio- Claudian dynasty that in the reign of Nero the entire grove died, shortly before he was assassinated. Rome's second Emperor Tiberius wore wreaths of laurel whenever there was stormy weather because it was widely believed that Laurel trees were immune to lightning strikes, affording protection to those who brandished it. One reason for this belief is because laurel does not burn easily and crackles loudly when on fire. It led ancient Romans to believe the plant was inhabited by a \\"heavenly fire demon\\", and was therefore \\"immune\\" from outer threats like fire or lightning. In modern Italy laurel wreaths are worn as a crown by graduating school students.\\"Corona d‚Äôalloro fai da te\\" by Gabriella Massara, https://giftsitter.com/it/blog/laurea-perche-si-incorona- il-laureato-con-lalloro, retrieved April 2018 East Asia An early Chinese etiological myth for the phases of the moon involved a great forest or tree which quickly grew and lost its leaves and flowers every month. After the Sui and Tang dynasties, this was sometimes connected to a woodsman named Wu Gang, sentenced to cut at a self-repairing tree as a punishment for varying offenses. The tree was originally identified as a (gu√¨) and described in the terms of the osmanthus (Osmanthus fragrans, now known in Chinese as the or \\"gui flower\\"), whose blossoms are still used to flavor wine and confections for the Mid-Autumn Festival. However, in English, it is often associated with the more well-known cassia (Cinnamomum cassia, now known in Chinese as the or \\"meat gui\\") while, in modern Chinese, it has instead become associated with the Mediterranean laurel.

The similar association in Europe of laurels with victory and success led to its translation into Chinese as the or \\"Moon gui\\". Chemical constituents The most abundant component found in laurel essential oil is 1,8-cineole, also called eucalyptol. The leaves contain about 1.3% essential oils (ol. lauri folii), consisting of 45% eucalyptol, 12% other terpenes, 8‚Äì12% terpinyl acetate, 3‚Äì4% sesquiterpenes, 3% methyleugenol, and other Œ±- and Œ≤-pinenes, phellandrene, linalool, geraniol, and terpineol. It contains lauric acid also. Both essential and fatty oils are present in the fruit. The fruit is pressed and water-extracted to obtain these products. The fruit contains up to 30% fatty oils and about 1% essential oils (terpenes, sesquiterpenes, alcohols, and ketones). The chemical compound lauroside B has been isolated from Laurus nobilis.

Bagatelle (from the Ch√¢teau de Bagatelle) is a billiards-derived indoor table game, the object of which is to get a number of balls (set at nine in the 19th century) past wooden pins (which act as obstacles) into holes that are guarded by wooden pegs; penalties are incurred if the pegs are knocked over. It probably developed from the table made with raised sides for trou madame, which was also played with ivory balls and continued to be popular into the later nineteenth century, after which it developed into bar billiards, with influences from the French/Belgian game ' (with supposed Russian origins). A bagatelle variant using fixed metal pins, billard japonais, eventually led to the development of pachinko and pinball. Bagatelle is also laterally related to miniature golf. History Table games involving sticks and balls evolved from efforts to bring outdoor games like ground billiards, croquet, and bowling inside for play during inclement weather. They are attested in general by the 15th century, although the 19th- century idea that bagatelle itself derived from the English \\"shovel-board\\" described in Charles Cotton's 1674 Compleat Gamester has since been disregarded. France In France, during the long 1643‚Äì1715 reign of Louis XIV, billiard tables were narrowed, with wooden pins or skittles at one end of the table, and players would shoot balls with a stick or cue from the other end, in a game inspired as much by bowling as billiards. Pins took too long to reset when knocked down, so they were eventually fixed to the table, and holes in the bed of the table became the targets. Players could ricochet balls off the pins to achieve the harder scorable holes. Quite a number of variations on this theme were developed. In 1777 a party was thrown in honour of Louis XVI and the queen at the Ch√¢teau de Bagatelle, recently erected at great expense by the king's brother, the Count of Artois. Bagatelle from Italian bagattella, signifies 'a trifle', 'a decorative thing'. The highlight of the party was a new table game featuring a slender table and cue sticks, which players used to shoot ivory balls up an inclined playfield. The game was dubbed bagatelle by the count and shortly after swept through France. UK and US A Little Game of Bagatelle, Between Old Abe the Rail Splitter & Little Mac the Gunboat General The name \\"bagatelle\\" was first used to describe such a game in 1819.. Its dimensions soon standardised at 7 feet by 21 inches. Illustrates a London design that was current in 1782. Some French soldiers carried their favorite bagatelle tables with them to America while helping to fight the British in the American Revolutionary War. Bagatelle spread and became so popular in America as well that a political cartoon from 1863 depicts US President Abraham Lincoln playing a small tabletop version of bagatelle against presidential rival George B. McClellan. The world's largest bagatelle board is believed to be one made by 5th Chislehurst Scout Group in 2016. It measures four by sixteen feet.

It was based on an idea that farmers were over-reliant on fertilizers, that livestock, crops and the soil should be treated as a whole system, and that \\"natural\\" farming produced food which was in some way more wholesome than food produced with more intensive methods. Lady Balfour believed that mankind's future and human health were dependent on how the soil was treated, and ran the experiment to generate scientific data that would support these beliefs. Deborah Stinner, an entomologist, has written that by modern standards the Haughley experiment was more of a \\"demonstration\\" than a true experiment because it lacked methodological rigour, and it is thus not possible to draw any firm conclusions from its outputs. Findings reported by the Haughley experiment included: # Levels of available minerals in the soil fluctuate according to the season, maximum levels coinciding with the time of maximum plant demand and these fluctuations were significantly greater in the organic plots. #Vegetative mineral levels remained as high or higher in the organic plots even without receiving the mineral inputs that the conventional plots had. #Organic fed animals required from 12-15% less input of food, were healthier, and lived longer than their conventional counterparts. #Increased yields. In the early 1980s just before it ceased operation, properties of the three sections were measured and showed differences in earthworm density, crop root depth, and soil properties including soil carbon, moisture and, surprisingly, temperature.

I-385 is a spur route of Interstate 85. The highway provides a connection between Greenville and Columbia. Route description I-26. After exit 42, Interstate 385 turns into a Business Spur and becomes East North Street and later ‚Äî for northbound motorists only ‚Äî Beattie Place. The spur promptly ends at US 29 (Church Street) near the Bon Secours Wellness Arena in downtown Greenville. The explosive economic growth of southern Greenville county is largely attributed to I-385 and its connection to the city of Greenville and the major cities of Atlanta and Charlotte (via I-85). This area is known by locals as the \\"Golden Strip\\". I-385 features a rather unusual rest area in the median strip near Laurens, that serves both directions of traffic. It was completed as part of the original design of the U.S. 276 expressway in 1958, modeled after the type of single median-located rest areas shared by both north and southbound traffic (to save money). The design is similar to many of those built on turnpikes that predated the Interstate System. History Greenville The general idea ‚Äî but none of the specifics ‚Äî of I-385 were present on the 1955 Yellow Book map of the Greenville area. Also of note is that Interstate 85 would have used the US 29 corridor from Greenville east towards Spartanburg based on the diagram. The portion of I-385 that replaced US 276 (from SC 417 in Mauldin to SC 56/I-26 in Clinton) was initially the first phase built of an SC DOT plan that predated the Interstate System to upgrade and bypass existing through routes, the goal of forming a single limited-access highway from Greenville to the port of Charleston via the State Capital of Columbia. This plan was scrapped as soon as the future I-26 was added to the act of Congress that set into motion the Interstate System. As a result, I-26 was one of the first Interstates in the south to open in significant mileage (most in SC between 1959 and 1963). Prior to 1985, I-385 was only signed as such from downtown Greenville to I-85. The portion of the freeway from US 276 in Mauldin to the southern terminus at I-26 was signed as US 276\\\\. When the connecting portion was completed, the entire freeway was signed as I-385. For seven months ending July 23, 2010, northbound traffic could not use a 15-mile section of I-385 in Laurens County due to a $60.9 million project to pave the portion extending from South Carolina Highway 101 to the I-385-I-26 interchange near Clinton, SC in concrete. The closing of a major highway generated controversy. Closing the interstate for construction saved approximately $34 million. Between 2002 and 2012, I-385 was widened from 2 to 3 lanes in each direction from just north of exit 24 near Fountain Inn to just south of Woodruff Rd/SC 146 (exit 35), with the portion between exits 31 and 35 resurfaced in concrete. Beginning in February 2016 and expected to continue through 2020, the I-385/I-85 interchange is being reconstructed to decrease congestion and related accidents.http://www.85385gateway.com/corridor.aspx Exit listInterstate 385 Business Interstate 385 Business (I-385 Bus) is an unsigned boulevard grade business spur of I-385 along North Street, between Stone Avenue (US 276) and Church Street (US 29); continuation along North Street, it becomes SC 183\\\\. It also connected to US 123 (Academy Street) and SC 183 MLC (Beattie Place).

A Brief History of Western Civilization: The Unfinished Legacy, volume II: Since 1555. (5th ed. 2007). Few were primarily philosophers; rather, philosophes were public intellectuals who applied reason to the study of many areas of learning, including philosophy, history, science, politics, economics, and social issues. They had a critical eye and looked for weaknesses and failures that needed improvement. They promoted a \\"republic of letters\\" that crossed national boundaries and allowed intellectuals to freely exchange books and ideas. Most philosophes were men, but some were women. They strongly endorsed progress and tolerance, and distrusted organized religion (most were deists) and feudal institutions.Richard Hooker, \\"The Philosophes,\\" (1996) online Many contributed to Diderot's Encyclop√©die. They faded away after the French Revolution reached a violent stage in 1793.  Characterization  Philosophe is the French word for \\"philosopher,\\" and was a word that the French Enlightenment thinkers usually applied to themselves.Isaac Kramnick, The Portable Enlightenment Reader, Harmondsworth, 1995, pp. 21‚Äì22 The philosophes, like many ancient philosophers, were public intellectuals dedicated to solving the real problems of the world. They wrote on subjects ranging from current affairs to art criticism, and they wrote in every conceivable format. The Swiss philosophe Jean-Jacques Rousseau, for example, wrote a political tract, a treatise on education, constitutions for Poland and Corsica, an analysis of the effects of the theater on public morals, a best-selling novel, an opera, and a highly influential autobiography. The philosophes wrote for a broadly educated public of readers who snatched up every Enlightenment book they could find at their local booksellers, even when rulers or churches tried to forbid such works. Between 1740 and 1789, the Enlightenment acquired its name and, despite heated conflicts between the philosophes and state and religious authorities, gained support in the highest reaches of government. Although philosophe is a French word, the Enlightenment was distinctly cosmopolitan; philosophes could be found from Philadelphia to Saint Petersburg. The philosophes considered themselves part of a grand \\"republic of letters\\" that transcended national political boundaries. In 1784, the German philosopher Immanuel Kant summed up the program of the Enlightenment in two Latin words: sapere aude, \\"dare to know\\", meaning, have the courage to think for yourself. The philosophes used reason to attack superstition, bigotry, and religious fanaticism, which they considered the chief obstacles to free thought and social reform. Voltaire took religious fanaticism as his chief target: \\"Once fanaticism has corrupted a mind, the malady is almost incurable\\" and that \\"the only remedy for this epidemic malady is the philosophical spirit\\". Enlightenment writers did not necessarily oppose organized religion, but they strenuously objected to religious intolerance. They believed that a society based around reason instead of religious fanaticism would improve the way people think and culminate in a more critical, scientific outlook on social issues and problems. The philosophes believed that the dissemination of knowledge would encourage reform in every aspect of life, from the grain trade to the penal system. Chief among their desired reforms was intellectual freedom‚Äîthe freedom to use one's own reason and to publish the results. The philosophes wanted freedom of the press and freedom of religion, which they considered \\"natural rights\\" guaranteed by \\"natural law.\\" In their view, progress depended on these freedoms.L. Hunt, \\"The Making of the West\\" Volume C, Bedford St. Martins, 2008, p. 556  Usage in modern English  The word \\"philosophe\\" has been used in English since the Middle Ages. Horace Walpole in 1779 remarked that \\"[t]he philosophes, except Buffon, are solemn, arrogant, dictatorial s.\\"Oxford English Dictionary (2nd ed. online 2009) Scholars differ concerning whether the word should be applied to all Enlightenment thinkers or be restricted to only the French philosophers.L.G. Crocker, \\"Interpreting the Enlightenment: a political approach\\", Journal of History of Ideas 46 (1985), pp. 211-30 Historian Peter Gay, for example, uses it to apply to all Enlightenment philosophers \\"from Edinburgh to Naples, Paris to Berlin, Boston to Philadelphia\\".Peter Gay, The Enlightenment - An Interpretation 1: The Rise of Modern Paganism, (1995) p. 3.

Operation Fifty men parachuted to the Cusna Mountain area (Reggio Emilia) between 4 and 24 March 1945, under command of Major Roy Farran and helped from the SOE mission \\"Envelope\\" under the command of Michael Lees. A number of Allied airdrops provided weapons for the force which included local resistance fighters and 70 escaped Soviet POWs. Captain Roy Farran holding a German sub-machine gun in Italy They were able to attack the German LI Gebirgs (Mountain) Corps headquarters, which was located at two villas in Botteghe d'Albinea in the hills above Reggio Emilia. In that attack on the night of 27 March 1945, the Germans sustained 50‚Äì60 casualties (including an unknown number killed). Three SAS personnel were killed in action at Villa Rossi, and about seven SAS and partisans were wounded (four British, two Italians and a Russian). The attack was carried out to the sound of a Scottish piper, David Kirkpatrick (1924‚Äì2016), wearing a kilt. Kirkpatrick had volunteered to be dropped into the area, to identify the operation as British ‚Äì so that reprisals would not be carried out against the local population. Operation Tombola continued until 23 April and the raids included the cutting of roads and shelling of a number of installations . Just as important as the 300 or so Germans killed and 200 captured, was the number of Axis defenders moved from other duties to secure the area. A number of Allied airmen, who were being hidden by civilians in the area, were also returned to friendly lines. Aftermath The commander of the operation, Roy Farran, published his account in the book Operation Tombola (Special Forces Library, Arms and Armour Press, 1986). The BBC series Secret War narrated by Alisdair Simpson (Acorn Media) in 2011 focuses on the exploits of Roy Farran and Michael Lees in the episode \\"SAS Italian Job\\". The operation is narrated also in the TV mini-series \\"Great SAS missions\\" (2004). A book written in Italian Il bracciale di sterline by Matteo Incerti & Valentina Ruozi (Aliberti April 2011) details for the first time the operations with the use of British, Italian, and German documents. A second book Il paradiso dei folli (Imprimatur-Aliberti 2014) by Matteo Incerti to, focused on the war and post war experience of several participants of this secret mission. \\"Il suonatore matto\\" (Imprimatur 2017) also written by Matteo Incerti focused about the life of David 'mad piper' Kirkpatrick. Incerti found documents and memory who prove that the sound of Kirkpatrick's bagpipe and the sacrifice of the three SAS soldiers killed in action (Riccomini, Bolden, Guscott) in Villa Rossi, made the Germans believe that Tombola was a conventional military attack, rather than a \\"partisan\\" action. As a result the Nazis didn't inflict reprisals on the civilian population of Albinea. During the second part of Operation Tombola, on 21 April 1945 action in Torre Maina (Modena) also the 2 SAS paratrooper Justo Balerdi-Robert Bruce was killed in action. He was a Basque antifascist, republican, and a former member of the French Foreign Legion. Bruce was the only Basque to fight with the British SAS in World War II. The story of Justo Balerdi-Robert Bruce appears in the books \\"Il bracciale di sterline\\" and \\"Il suonatore matto\\".

It declares its mission is to, \\"Lead, unite and assist the organic movement in its full diversity.\\" and vision is the \\"worldwide adoption of ecologically, socially and economically sound systems, based on the Principles of Organic Agriculture\\". Among its wide range of activities, the federation maintains an organic farming standard, and an organic accreditation and certification service.  History  Ra»ôit Pertev, Secretary of the International Fund for Agricultural Development, was a keynote speaker at the 2014 Organic World Congress in Istanbul, Turkey. IFOAM - Organics International began in Versailles, France, on November 5, 1972, during an international congress on organic agriculture organized by the French farmer organization Nature et Progr√®s. The late Roland Chevriot, President of Nature et Progr√®s, took the initiative. There were 5 founding members representing different organizations: Lady Eve Balfour representing the Soil Association of Great Britain, Kjell Arman representing the Swedish Biodynamic Association, Pauline Raphaely representing the Soil Association of South Africa, Jerome Goldstein representing Rodale Press of the United States, and Roland Chevriot representing Nature et Progr√®s of France. The aim of the new organization was reflected in the name: International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements. The founders hoped that the federation would meet what they saw as a major need: a unified, organized voice for organic food, and the diffusion and exchange of information on the principles and practices of organic agriculture across national and linguistic boundaries. In 2015 the name of changed to IFOAM - Organics International. Structure Linda Bullard, former President of IFOAM - Organics International), Dr. Vandana Shiva, winner of the Right Livelihood Award, and Magda Aelvoet, Belgian Minister of State and former Health and Environment Minister, celebrate the landmark decision of the European Patent Office to uphold a decision to revoke in its entirety a patent on a fungicidal product derived from seeds of the Neem, a tree indigenous to the Indian subcontinent. The General Assembly of IFOAM - Organics International serves as the foundation of the organization. It elects the World Board of IFOAM - Organics International for a three-year term.http://www.ifoam.org/sites/default/files/page/files/ifoam_directory_2013_dragged.pdf The World Board is a diverse group of individuals working voluntarily to lead IFOAM - Organics International. The current World Board was elected at the General Assembly of IFOAM in Istanbul which took place in October 2014. The World Board appoints members to official committees, working groups and task forces based upon the recommendation of the membership of IFOAM - Organics International. Member organizations also establish regional groups and sector specific interest groups. International standing IFOAM - Organics International actively participates in international agricultural and environmental negotiations with the United Nations and multilateral institutions to further the interests of the organic agricultural movement worldwide, and has observer status or is otherwise accredited by the following international institutions: :* ECOSOC Status with the United Nations General Assembly :* The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)http://www.fao.org/tc/NGO/status3_en.asp :* United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) :* Codex Alimentarius Commission (FAO and World Health Organization)http://www.codexalimentarius.net/web/organizations.jsp :* United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) :* The Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD) :* International Labour Organization of the United Nations (ILO) :* International Organization for Standardization (ISO)http://www.iso.org/iso/about/organizations_in_liaison.htm?filter=I According to the One World Trust's Global Accountability Report 2008 which assessed a range of organisations in areas such as transparency, stakeholder participation and evaluation capacity, \\"IFOAM is the highest scoring international NGO, and at the top of the 30 organisations this year with a score of 71 percent\\". Members For a full list of member organizations, see the Activities= IFOAM - Organics International and Standards and Certification  The Organic Guarantee System (OGS) of IFOAM - Organics International is designed to a) facilitate the development of organic standards and third-party certification worldwide and to b) provide an international guarantee of these standards and organic certification. In recent years the OGS approach of IFOAM - Organics International underwent some significant changes. With the establishment and spreading of organic standards and certification around the world a number of new challenges appeared. Especially smallholder farmers in developing countries struggle with a) the multitude of standards they are expected to farm conform with and b) with high certification costs and considerable administrative expenditures. IFOAM - Organics International had a breakthrough in the development and adoption of approaches to address these certification problems. The organization now directs special focus on the promotion of two new concepts: =IFOAM Family of Standards= In the framework of a multi-year collaboration IFOAM - Organics International developed together with his UN partners: the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), a set of standard requirements that functions as an international reference to assess the quality and equivalency of organic standards and regulations. It is known as the COROS (Common Objectives and Requirements of Organic Standards) The vision is that the Family of Standards will contain all organic standards and regulations equivalent to the COROS. Instead of assessing each standard against each other the Family of Standards can be used as a tool to simplify equivalence assessment procedures while ensuring a high level of integrity and transparency. The Family of Standard Program started in January 2011. One year later about 50 standards worldwide are approved. =Participatory Guarantee Systems PGS= Participatory Guarantee Systems are locally focused quality assurance systems. They certify producers based on active participation of stakeholders and are built on a foundation of trust, social networks and knowledge exchange‚Äùhttp://www.ifoam.bio/sites/default/files/pgs_definition_in_different_languages.pdf (Definition of IFOAM - Organics International, 2008). Participatory Guarantee Systems represent an alternative to third party certification, especially adapted to local markets and short supply chains. They can also complement third party certification with a private label that brings additional guarantees and transparency. PGS enable the direct participation of producers, consumers and other stakeholders in: :* the choice and definition of the standards :* the development and implementation of certification procedures :* the certification decisions For many organic farmers, particularly in developing countries and emerging organic markets, third party certification is often difficult to access. PGS provides an alternative option that takes some burden from the farmers and is crucially linked to local products and local markets. =Accreditation and IOAS= IFOAM - Organics International also offers organic accreditation to certification bodies. Certifiers can have their processes audited against the IFOAM Accreditation Requirements. IOAS, an IFOAM - Organics International daughter company set up in 1997, offers the IFOAM Accreditation (analyses of standards and verification process) or the Global Organic System Accreditation (analyses of verification process only) and grants special recognition of credibility. The document ISO/IEC 17011: ‚ÄòConformity assessment ‚Äì General requirements for accreditation bodies accrediting conformity assessment bodies‚Äô lays down internationally agreed rules for how accreditation should be performed. Various national bodies verify this accreditation including the US Department of Commerce National Institute of Standards & Technology.  IFOAM - Organics International and GMOs  On October 19, 1998, participants at the 12th Scientific Conference of IFOAM - Organics International issued the Mar del Plata Declaration, where more than 600 delegates from over 60 countries voted unanimously to exclude the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in food production and agriculture. From that point GMOs have been categorically excluded from organic farming. Text of the declaration: :We, the undersigned participants at the 12th Scientific Conference of the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM) at Mar del Plata, Argentina, call on governments and regulatory agencies throughout the world to immediately ban the use of genetic engineering in agriculture and food production since it involves: :* Unacceptable threats to human health :* Negative and irreversible environmental impacts :* Release of organisms of an un-recallable nature :* Removal of the right of choice, both for farmers and consumers :* Violation of farmers' fundamental property rights and endangerment of their economic independence :* Practices, which are incompatible with the principles of sustainable agriculture as defined by IFOAM Signed by: Dr. Vandana Shiva (India), Herv√© La Prairie (Outgoing IFOAM - Organics International president, France), Linda Bullard (Incoming IFOAM - Organics International president, USA/Belgium), Gunnar Rundgren (Incoming IFOAM - Organics International vice- president, Sweden), Gerald Hermann (IFOAM - Organics International Treasurer, Germany), Pipo Lernoud (Conference Coordinator, Argentina), Guillermo Schnitman (MAPO President, Argentina)  IFOAM - Organics International and training  Organic agriculture can contribute to meaningful socio-economic and ecologically sustainable development, especially in poorer countries. On one hand, this is due to the application of organic principles, which means efficient management of local resources (e.g., local seed varieties, manure, etc.) and therefore cost-effectiveness. On the other hand, the market for organic products ‚Äì at local and international level ‚Äì has tremendous growth prospects and offers creative producers and exporters in the South excellent opportunities to improve their income and living conditions. IFOAM - Organics International is therefore active to give special support to the development of the Organic Agriculture Sector in Developing Countries through several means. Organic Agriculture is a very knowledge intensive production system. Therefore, capacity building efforts play a central role in this regard. There are many efforts all around the world regarding the development of training material and the organization of training courses related to Organic Agriculture. Existing knowledge is still scattered and not easy accessible. Especially in Developing Countries this situation remains an important constraint for the growth of the organic sector.

The information revolution has resulted in over-abundant data that are critical in a wide range of areas, from the Internet to healthcare systems. Related to conceptual art, electronic art and new media art, informatism considers this new technological, economical, and cultural paradigm shift, such that artworks may provide social commentaries, synthesize multiple disciplines, and develop new aesthetics. Realization of information art often take, although not necessarily, interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary approaches incorporating visual, audio, data analysis, performance, and others.Edward A. Shanken has argued that little scholarship has explored the relationship between technology and conceptual art. He also claimed that there was an art-historical impetus to artificially distinguish information art from conceptual art. Edward A. Shanken, 'Art in the Information Age: Technology and Conceptual Art,' in Michael Corris (ed.), Conceptual Art: Theory, Myth and Practice Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004. Furthermore, physical and virtual installations involving informatism often provide human-computer interaction that generate artistic contents based on the processing of large amounts of data.See Charlie Gere Art, Time and Technology: Histories of the Disappearing Body (Berg, 2005). This text concerns artistic and theoretical responses to the increasing speed of technological development and operation, especially in terms of draws on the ideas of Jacques Derrida, Bernard Stiegler, Jean-Fran√ßois Lyotard and Andr√© Leroi-Gourhan, and looks at the work of Samuel Morse, Vincent van Gogh and Kasimir Malevich, among others.  Background  Kynaston McShine's \\"Information\\" Information art has a long history as visualization of qualitative and quantitative data forms a foundation in science, technology, and governance. Information design and informational graphics, which has existed before computing and the Internet, are closely connected with this new emergent art movement. An early example of informatism the 1970 exhibition organized called \\"Information\\" at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City (curated by Kynaston McShine). This is the time when conceptual art has emerged as a leading tendency in the United States and internationally.See Lucy R. Lippard, Six Years: the Dematerialization of the Art Object From 1966 to 1972 (1973. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1997). At the same time arose the activities of Experiments in Art and Technology known as E.A.T.E.A.T. followed from the event Nine Evenings: Theatre and Engineering, organised by Robert Rauschenberg and Billy Kl√ºver at the Armoury Building, New York City, 13‚Äì22 October 1966 to promote the collaboration between artists and engineers. They also organised the Pepsi Pavilion at the World's Fair, Osaka, in 1970. For a detailed discussion of the project see Bijvoet, Art as Inquiry, ch. 2.  Contemporary practices  Information art are manifested using a variety of data sources such as photographs, census data, video clips, search engine results, digital painting, network signals, and others. Often, such data are transformed, analyzed, and interpreted in order to convey concepts and develop aesthetics. When dealing with big data, artists may use statistics and machine learning to seek meaningful patterns that drive audio, visual, and other forms of representations. Recently, informatism is used in interactive and generative installations that are often dynamically linked with data and analytical pipelines.

She was a campaigner for animal rights and vegetarianism. A 1965 Sunday Times article by Brophy is credited by psychologist Richard D. Ryder with having triggered the formation of the animal rights movement in England. Brophy married art historian Michael Levey in 1954. She was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1983. Biography Brigid Antonia Brophy was born on 12 June 1929, in Ealing in west London. She was the only child of the novelist John Brophy and Charis Brophy (n√©e Grundy), who was a teacher. Even as a child she began writing plays. Of Irish extraction, but having grown up in England, Brophy felt divided in her identity writing in her essay Am I An Irishwoman?: \\"I feel a foreigner there [Ireland], but I feel like a foreigner in England, too. I was brought up to do so\\". Her easy-going father, whom she felt closest to, was a lapsed Catholic turned atheist while her stern, cold mother was a member of an apocalyptic sect called the Catholic Apostolic Church who expected the End Times predicated in the Book of Revelation to occur in the near-future. In opposition to her mother, Brophy wrote that she and her father were \\"natural, logical and happy atheists\\". A bookish and intelligent girl, as a child she read works by William Shakespeare, John Milton, George Bernard Shaw, Evelyn Waugh and Ronald Firbank. During World War II she was moved 12 times from one school to another as her parents constantly sought to place her at a school far from where German bombs and rockets might land, making it hard for her to build lasting friendships. The longest period of attendance for her during the war was at The Abbey School, Reading, between May 1941 and July 1943. She then attended St Paul's Girls' School in London. In 1947 she went on a scholarship to Oxford University (St Hugh's College), but left in 1948 without a degree. At Oxford, Brophy specialised in learning Latin and Greek, showing exceptional promise as a Classics scholar, but was expelled from Oxford after completing only four semesters for \\"indiscretions\\" on campus. Brophy was vague about the precise nature of these \\"indiscretions\\" that led to her expulsion. It seems that the principal \\"indiscretion\\" that caused her expulsion was that she showed up at the Church of England chapel on the campus drunk and loudly advocated the virtues of lesbianism to anyone who would listen. In an interview in 1975, Brophy declined to discuss what led to her expulsion, saying: \\"I shall never describe it, because I won't risk reliving the distress I suffered\\". After being expelled from Oxford, Brophy lived in London, working part-time as a secretary while working full-time as a writer of short stories that she submitted to various literary journals. In 1953, when she was 25, her book of short stories, The Crown Princess, was published; it was followed in the same year by her much better received novel, Hackenfeller's Ape. Brophy wrote about Theresa, the heroine of The Crown Princess that: \\"She was a mooted castle, a royal castle, with a draw-bridge, and ramparts, and there was nothing inside...She had no self. She had no character\\". The intelligent and artistic Theresa wants to be a painter, but is incapable of asserting herself, instead marrying a cousin she has never met and does not love in an arranged marriage set up by her parents. A shy, introverted woman who feels like an outsider despite being the Crown Princess, Theresa attempts to befriend the common folk of her realm, but her poor social skills and the fact that everything she knows about ordinary people is from Hollywood films instead alienate the common people, leading to sadly conclude: \\"Her idols were dolls\\". At the end of the story, Theresa accepts her fate is to be unhappy and on her 21st birthday stand on the balcony of the royal palace hearing the cheers of the crowd while thinking: \\"GO AWAY!, she shouted. THERE IS NOBODY HERE!\\". The Crown Princess and the other short stories in the same volume were noted for their fatalism and strong sense of doom as it implied that for woman like Theresa happiness is an impossibility. Hackenfeller's Ape with its advocacy of animal rights first brought Brophy to widespread attention. Hackenfeller's Ape concerned a story of an young scientists named Clement Darrelhyde who becomes close to an ape couple in London's Regent Park zoo named Percy and Edwina. Darrelhyde is the prototype of Brophy's favorite hero, the \\"delicate, ineffectual male\\". Darrelhyde is a deeply shy man whose passions are science and the music of Mozart, which he frequently sings regardless of the appropriateness of the situation. At one point, as he observes the apes in the zoo, Darrelhyde begins to sing one of Mozart's arias and imagines him transformed into a woman as Brophy wrote: \\"He was transported into another era, another sex. He became the middle-aged Countess, tragically and with dignity calling upon Love to restore her treasure-the affections of her Count\\". When the government decides to break up the couple by sending Percy up on a rocket on an outer space mission too dangerous for humans, Darrelhyde decides to take matters into his hands by kidnapping the two apes, arguing that it would be cruel to break up the loving relationship between the apes which so closely resembles a relationship between a human couple. With the assistance of a young thief named Gloria, who becomes his lover, Darrelhye tries to kidnap the apes several times, and in the last attempt, he succeeds in freeing Percy who is however shot down by the police. Despite the tragedy, the novel ends on a hopeful note as Edwina gives birth and gently cuddles her baby as Brophy wrote: \\"It woke all the other animals and set them gibbering as it let out its roar of wrath\\". For Hackenfeller's Ape, Brophy was awarded the first prize at the Cheltenham Literacy Festival. Brophy always considered Hackenfeller's Ape her best novel as she wrote it \\"displays at its most intense the violently romantic feeling in a precisely classical form to which most of my fiction aspires\\". In 1954 she married art historian Michael Levey (afterwards director of the British National Gallery, 1973‚Äì87, and knighted in 1981) and the couple had one daughter named Kate (b. 1957). Through her marriage was ostensibly a happy one, Brophy's statements about the \\"immorality of marriage\\" and her complaint about how British society had \\"imposed monogamy on those who have not chosen it\\" contributed to rumours that her marriage was a front to establish a respectable image for herself. After homosexuality was legalised in Britain in 1967, Brophy was one of the first to demand gay marriage, at the time an extremely controversial stance to take, which led to rumours that she was a lesbian who just had married to present a heterosexual image. The rumours that her marriage was just a facade to hide her lesbian tendencies hurt her. Nevertheless, Brophy's daughter states that Brophy and Iris Murdoch were lovers.https://www.brigidbrophy.com/brophy-s-fiction In 1956, she published her only autobiographical novel, King of a Rainy Country, a roman √† clef dealing with a failed relationship she had after being expelled from Oxford. Brophy once said: \\"I do not dislike or despise autobiographical novelists...I cannot, however be one of them\\". However, Brophy admitted that Susan, the heroine of King of a Rainy Country was a \\"cut down version\\" and \\"stunned self-portrait\\" of herself while Neale was a \\"reasonably accurate portrait\\" of a man she was once in love with. The plot of King of a Rainy Country concerned the platonic relationship between two bohemian intellectuals both of whom are described as \\"incurable romantics\\" living in the drab post- war London, namely Susan, an aspiring writer and her roommate, Neage, an young man described as a brilliant intellectual who however works as a dishwasher in a filthy restaurant. Neagle is confused about his sexual identity, saying he is not certain if he is bisexual or homosexual. One day, Neagle brings home another dishwasher to share their flat, a bohemian young Frenchman named Fran√ßois who is openly gay, and a love triangle ensures as Susan and Fran√ßois both compete for the affections of Neage. The climax of King of a Rainy Country is when Neagle takes Susan on a road trip to Italy and then tells her that he is ending the relationship to marry another woman that Susan was not aware even existed was based on an incident that happened in her own life. The birth of her daughter Kate in 1957 and the demands of motherhood led to a period of prolonged depression which she described in 1968: \\"In the dark crisis of my personal life, the constituents of my personality were broken down like the constituents of a caterpillar inside the chrysalis-case\\". Not until 1962 did she felt capable of publishing again. In the following years she brought out a series of novels, including Flesh (1962), The Finishing Touch (1963, described as a \\"lesbian fantasia\\"), The Snow Ball (1964) and Palace Without Chairs (1978, in which a child of royal descent survives political tumult). The Finishing Touch is set in a girls' boarding school on the French Riviera where the headmistresses are all lesbians who put the \\"finishing touch\\" to the education of the young women under their care by introducing them to the pleasures of Sapphic love. One of Brophy's favorite writers was the gay novelist Ronald Firbank and The Finishing Touch was written in a style that paid homage to his thinly veiled homoerotic novels. One of Brophy's principal heroes since childhood was Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, whose music and operas she adored. The Snow Ball, a comedy of manners set in modern London is a tribute to Mozart's operas, and many reviewers noted The Snow Ball was also something of a game as Brophy contrived to put in as references to Mozart's work and life into her novel as possible. In the same year that The Snow Ball was published, Brophy also published Mozart the Dramatist: A New View of Mozart, His Operas and His Age, a Freudian psycho- analytical account of Mozart and his work. Critical reception to Mozart the Dramatist was mixed with some praising her for an original and well researched account of Mozart's life while others being exasperated by her psychoanalytical approach. In the Hudson Review, Joseph Kerman wrote a hostile review that concluded: \\"I do not think that Miss Brophy knows quite what she is up to...Criticism is not psychoanalysis.\\" Brophy was friends with Charles Osborne, the editor of London Magazine, who often solicited articles from her. Brophy's articles together with frequent appearances on television in the 1960s‚Äì1970s created the image of her as the enfant terrible of British literature as she was outspoken in praising writers and artists she liked while being vociferous in denouncing those she disliked. Besides for literature, Brophy frequently wrote about and spoke out on social and political issues. The principle issues that engaged her were feminism; animal rights; gay rights; opposition to the strict censorship laws that existed in Britain until the 1960s; making vivisection illegal; demanding changes in British publishing laws as she believed that the current laws allowed publishers to benefit financially at the expense of writers; and a general opposition to marriage and monogamy as \\"oppressive\\". Through in fact a very shy woman who was uncomfortable in social settings, her enfant terrible image led to widespread perception of her as an abrasive and opinionated scold who was forever pushing to do away with residual Victorian values, much to her distress. In 1967, she set off a firestorm of controversy when she co-wrote with her husband and Osborne Fifty Works of English and American Literature We Could Do Without. The book was widely attacked by critics on both sides of the Atlantic. Typical of the critical response to Fifty Works of English and American Literature We Could Do Without was the review by the novelist Anthony Burgess who wrote: \\"Like children, they have shown off, and the showing off has provoked attention...They're still in the nursery, cut off from the big world\\". However, the challenge by Fifty Works of English and American Literature We Could Do Without to the literary cannon with its claim that certain Victorian writers were not worth cherishing did have the effect of leading to a number of British and American universities changing their English courses to include more modern writers. In 1968, she wrote a play The Burglar, an attack upon bourgeois sexual manners in modern London as hypocritical when a thief discovers that certain London housewives do not mind him breaking in to their houses as long as he is willing to have sex with them. The play met with very hostile reviews when it premiered, described as an \\"instant and virtually unanimous critical cannonade\\". The play closed three weeks after it opened in west London in the spring of 1968. Brophy was furious with the critical reviews, and when she published The Burglar later in 1968, she added a ferociously written defense of her play in a 47-page long preface which she took issue with the play's critics point by point. In 1969, she published an \\"experimental\\" avant-garde novel In Transit: An Heroi-Cyclic Novel. The story of In Transit concerned an young woman named Evelyn Hillary O'Rooley who becomes lost in an airport as enormous as it is depersonalised, when nobody really belongs as everybody is in transit from one place to another. Trapped in the airport, her identity fades together with her sense of gender identity, leading the heroine to engage in series of comically inept experiments and sexual adventures in an attempt to rediscover the joys of being a woman. In a summary of British literature in 1969, the critic William Webb wrote that \\"...Brophy's strenuous variations on fashionable sexual themes\\" provoked boredom. The avant-garde nature of In Transit infuriated both readers and critics in 1969 with Joyce Carol Oates writing in a review: \\"The reader feels a kind of desperation in his desire to come upon something good in all these pages-something intelligent, something original and striking- something\\". However, subsequently In Transit was considered to be a pioneering work of post-modernism and as a feminist surrealist fantasia. The critic Karl Stenger wrote that In Transit was \\"Brophy's most original and enduring creation\\". Stenger wrote that much of the hostile reception that In Transit met in 1969 may have to do to the fact that the novel was a complete departure in style from Brophy's previous books, and a result of the overwhelming negative reviews, she never attempted a similar avant-garde novel, leaving In Transit as sui generis in her oeuvre. In a retroactive review of In Transit in 1991, the critic Sheryl Stevenson wrote: \\"By suggesting that individual identity is tied to language and by presenting both in an unstable condition, In Transit draws attention to a juncture between feminist studies of gender and Mikhail Bakhtin's theory of language\\". Brophy also wrote several non- fiction books and essays, including Black Ship to Hell (1962; an appreciation of Shavian and Freudian ideas), Mozart the Dramatist (1964) and (with her husband and Charles Osborne) Fifty Works of English Literature We Could Do Without (1967). Her detailed study of Ronald Firbank, Prancing Novelist A Defence of Fiction in the Form of a Critical Biography in Praise of Ronald Firbank, appeared in 1973. In her 1978 comic novel Palace Without Chairs concerned two siblings who are the heirs to the throne in a fictional European nation that resembles Ruritania. After their siblings all meet with bizarre deaths, Crown Prince Ulrich and his twin sister Heather renounce their claims to the throne. Ulrich takes a job working as a banker in Sweden while Heather moves to London, which she comes of the closet and declares her lesbianism, finding a degree of happiness that was never possible as a princess. In a review of Palace Without Chairs, the critic Chris Hopkins praised Brophy for drawing \\"...upon aspects of modernism in unexpected ways (given its comic aspects and apparent genre)\\" as she displayed \\"great interest in language itself...and the capacity and incapacity of language to render the self\\". She was a campaigner for several reforms. Brophy had joined the Labour Party, and became increasing involved in social activism which distracted her from writing. She became the Vice President of the National Anti-Vivisection Society, which sought to end cruelty to animals. With Maureen Duffy she fought between 1972 and 1982 for authors' Public Lending Right. One of her father's ideas had been the \\"Brophy penny\\", a plan for an author to be paid a penny every time one of their books had been borrowed from a library. Together with Duffy, she founded the Writers Action Group to campaign for the revival of the \\"Brophy penny\\" as the Public Lending Right, which she believe would benefit authors whose work were not bestsellers. She was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto. She became president of the National Anti-Vivisection Society. In her book Baroque 'n' Roll (1987) she wrote about her struggle with multiple sclerosis (of which she knew the first symptoms in 1981), her bisexuality and the causes that she supported. From 1987 her husband, Michael Levey, looked after her during her illness, resigning his position as director of the National Gallery to do so. She died on 7 August 1995, at Louth in Lincolnshire.

The state is divided into boroughs, counties, cities, townships, called \\"towns\\", and villages. (The only boroughs, the five boroughs of New York City, except for the Bronx have the same boundaries as their predecessor counties.) They are municipal corporations, chartered (created) by the New York State Legislature, under the New York State Constitution the only body that can create governmental units in the state. All of them have their own governments, sometimes with no paid employees, that provide local services. Centers of population that are not incorporated and have no government or local services are designated hamlets. Whether a municipality is defined as a borough, city, town, or village is determined not by population or land area, but rather on the form of government selected by the residents and approved by the New York Legislature. Each type of local government is granted specific home rule powers by the New York State Constitution. There are still occasional changes as a village becomes a city, or a village dissolves (stops existing), each of which requires legislative action. New York also has various corporate entities that provide local services and have their own administrative structures (governments), such as school and fire districts. These are not found in all counties. Except for its 10 Indian Reservations and the City of New York, every piece of land in the State is part of a city or town, which, with the exception of the city of Geneva, is part of one and only one county. Not every piece is in a village or city. A village is part of a town; cities are not part of towns, but have the powers of towns. A village can be a part of more than one town. A village cannot be part of a city. Services which must be available everywhere ‚Äî education, road maintenance, snow removal ‚Äî are ultimately the responsibility of towns or cities, although cooperative agreements are not unusual. In the more rural counties, local services may be provided on a county-wide basis. As of 2019, New York has 62 counties (including New York City's five boroughs), which are subdivided into 932 towns and 62 cities. In total, the state has more than 3,400 active local governments and more than 4,200 taxing jurisdictions. Home rule Counties and incorporated municipal governments (also known as \\"general purpose units of local government\\"; i.e., cities, towns and villages) in New York State have been granted broad home rule powers enabling them to provide services to their residents and to regulate the quality of life within their jurisdictions. They do so while adhering to the United States Constitution and the Constitution of the State of New York. Articles VIII (titled \\"Local Finances\\") and IX (titled \\"Local Government\\", but commonly referred to as the \\"Home Rule\\" article) of the state constitution establish the rights and responsibilities of the municipal governments. The New York State Constitution provides for democratically elected legislative bodies for counties, cities, towns and villages. These legislative bodies are granted the power to enact local laws as needed in order to provide services to their citizens and fulfill their various obligations.  County  Map of the sixty- two counties of New York The county is the primary administrative division of New York. There are sixty-two counties in the state. Five of the counties are boroughs of the City of New York and do not have functioning county governments. While originally created as subdivisions of the state meant to carry out state functions, counties are now considered municipal corporations with the power and fiscal capacity to provide an array of local government services. Such services generally include law enforcement and public safety, social and health services (such as Medicaid), and education (special needs and community colleges). Every county outside of New York City has a county seat, which is the location of county government. Nineteen counties operate under county charters, while 38 operate under the general provisions of the County Law. Although all counties have a certain latitude to govern themselves, \\"charter counties\\" are afforded greater home rule powers. The charter counties are Albany, Broome, Chautauqua, Chemung, Dutchess, Erie, Herkimer, Monroe, Nassau, Oneida, Onondaga, Orange, Putnam, Rensselaer, Rockland, Schenectady, Suffolk, Tompkins, Ulster, and Westchester. Sixteen counties are governed through an assembly with the power of a board of supervisors, composed of the supervisors of its constituent towns and cities. In most of these counties, each supervisor's vote is weighted in accordance with the town's population in order to abide by the U.S. Supreme Court mandate of \\"one person, one vote\\". Other counties have legislative districts of equal population, which may cross municipal borders; these counties may also have an elected County Executive. Most counties in New York do not use the term \\"Board of Supervisors.\\" 34 counties have a County Legislature, six counties have a Board of Legislators, and one county has a Board of Representatives. The five counties, or boroughs, of New York City are governed by a 51-member City Council. In non-charter counties, the legislative body exercises executive power as well. Although the legislature can delegate certain functions and duties to a county administrator, who acts on behalf of the legislature, the legislature must maintain ultimate control over the actions of the administrator. Many, but not all, charter counties have an elected executive who is independent of the legislature; the exact form of government is defined in the County Charter.  City  Albany City Hall, the seat of local government in New York's capital city In New York, each city is a highly autonomous incorporated area that, with the exceptions of New York City and Geneva, is contained within one county. Cities in New York are classified by the U.S. Census Bureau as incorporated places. They provide almost all services to their residents and have the highest degree of home rule and taxing jurisdiction over their residents. The main difference between a city and a village is that cities are organized and governed according to their charters, which can differ widely among cities, while most villages are subject to a uniform statewide Village Law (twelve villages still operate under charters issued by the state legislature prior to a revision of the State Constitution in 1874 that forbade chartering villages). Also, villages are part of a town (or towns; some villages cross town borders), with residents who pay taxes to and receive services from the town. Cities are neither part of nor subordinate to towns except for the city of Sherrill, which for some purposes is treated as if it were a village of the town of Vernon. Some cities are completely surrounded by a town, typically of the same name. There are sixty-two cities in the state. As of 2000, 54.1% of state residents were living in a city; 42.2% were living in New York City; 11.9% were living in one of the other 61 cities. In 1686, the English colonial governor granted the cities of New York and Albany city charters, which were recognized by the first State Constitution in 1777. All other cities have been established by act of the state legislature and have been granted a charter. Cities have been granted the power to revise their charters or adopt new ones. There are no minimum population or area requirements in order to become a city. While there is no defined process for how and when a village becomes a city, the Legislature requires clear evidence, usually in the form of a locally drafted charter, that the community in question seeks to incorporate as a city. The forms of government cities can have are council‚Äìmanager, strong mayor‚Äìcouncil, weak mayor‚Äìcouncil or commission. Forty-six cities, the majority, use the mayor‚Äìcouncil form. *Strong mayor‚Äìcouncil ‚Äî An elective mayor serves as the chief executive and administrative head of the city. A city council serves as a legislature. The mayor has veto power over council decisions, prepares a budget, and appoints and removes agency heads. This form sometimes includes a professional administrator appointed by the mayor. *Weak mayor‚Äìcouncil ‚Äî The mayor is a ceremonial figure. The city council serves as both a legislature and executive committee. There is generally no mayoral veto. *Council‚Äìmanager ‚Äî The mayor, if such a position exists, is ceremonial only. A professional administrator, appointed by the city council, serves as the administrative head. While empowered to appoint and remove agency heads and responsible for preparing a budget, the administrator does not have veto power. The city council serves as the legislature. *Commission ‚Äî Elected commissioners administer individual city departments and together act as a legislature. This form sometimes includes an administrator. There is no mayor, although commissioners sometimes assume mayoral ceremonial duties. The City of New York is a special case. The state legislature reorganized government in the area in the 1890s in an effort to consolidate. Other cities, villages, and towns were annexed to become the \\"City of Greater New York\\", (an unofficial term, the new city retained the name of New York), a process basically completed in 1898. At the time of consolidation, Queens County was split. Its western towns joined the city, leaving three towns that were never part of the consolidation plan as part of Queens County but not part of the new Borough of Queens. (A small portion of the Town of Hempstead was itself annexed, also.) The next year (1899), the three eastern towns of Queens County separated to become Nassau County. The city today consists of the entire area of five counties (named New York, Kings, Queens, Bronx, and Richmond). While these counties have no county government, boroughs ‚Äî with boundaries coterminous with the county boundaries ‚Äî each have a Borough Board made up of the Borough President, the borough's district council members, and the chairpersons of the borough's community boards. A mayor serves as the city's chief executive officer. The most populous and largest city in the state is New York City, with a population of over 8.5 million inhabitants and comprising just over of land ( total area, which includes water). The least populous city is Sherrill, New York, with just 3,071 inhabitants in 2010. The smallest city by area is Mechanicville, New York, which covers (of which is water). Some places containing the word \\"city\\" in their name are not cities. Examples include Johnson City, Garden City, and New City. Wards and other submunicipal divisions The wards of New York City as established in 1683 Several cities, such as Albany, are divided into wards for the purposes of municipal representation. Each ward elects one member to the city's legislative body, and the wards are redistricted roughly every ten years. These divisions can go by other names by city; in Buffalo they are known as districts. These divisions can either be numbered or named. New York City was divided into wards at various times in its history between 1683 and 1938, although they were gradually replaced by Assembly and Senate districts starting in the mid-19th century; the New York City Council is currently elected from special districts, which are allowed to cross borough lines. New York City has a unique system of divisions, some of which possess governmental power, see #Divisions unique to New York City.  Town  Map showing municipalities in New York, as well as cities not included within a town. New York City is shown as divided into boroughs. In New York, a town is a municipal corporation,.Y. TWN. LAW ¬ß 2 : NY Code - Section 2: Definition of town which is the major division of each county (excluding the five boroughs that comprise New York City), very similar to townships in other states such as Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana. Towns in New York are classified by the U.S. Census Bureau as minor civil divisions. As in most northeastern states, every square foot of New York is incorporated; all residents who do not live in a city or on an Indian reservation live in a town. These provide or arrange for the primary functions of local government. While some provide most municipal services for all town residents and selected services for residents of villages, some provide little more than road maintenance. There are 932 towns in New York. As of 2000, 45.8% of state residents were living in a town; 35.9% were living in a town but outside of a village. Whereas cities and villages can cross county boundaries, all towns in New York are within a single county. New York towns are classified by statute as being a town of the first class or a town of the second class. Additionally, a town of the first class can further be classified as a suburban town upon meeting certain criteria. Originally, towns of different classes possessed different powers. Since 1964, all towns, regardless of classification, have had the same legal powers as were once available only to suburban towns. Even so, towns of different classifications continue to have organizational differences and certain conditions that must be met before a town's classification changes. The town board serves as the legislative branch. The board is composed of one elected supervisor (or chief executive officer in suburban towns) and a specific number of elected council persons; towns of the second class generally have two but may have four council persons, whereas towns of the first class generally have four but can have two or six. The supervisor presides over the board, voting on all matters but not possessing veto or tie-breaking power. Certain towns operate under a town manager form of government, as permitted by legislation enacted in 1976. All town justices were originally part of a town's board. Today, justices belong to a separate judicial branch known as Town Court or Justice Court, part of New York's Justice Court system. A town may contain one or more villages. Many towns have no villages. Five towns are coterminous with their single village: Green Island in Albany County; East Rochester in Monroe County; and Scarsdale, Harrison and Mount Kisco in Westchester County. When such an entity is formed, officials from either unit of government may serve in both village and town governments simultaneously. A referendum is held to decide whether residents prefer a village-style or town-style government, which will then function primarily as a village or town but will perform some of the functions of the other form. Towns can contain several hamlets and communities. If the United States Postal Service (USPS) has a post office in a hamlet it often will use the name of that hamlet, as will the local fire department or elementary school. Businesses may also use the name of a hamlet as part of their name. The United States Census Bureau will, with consideration from the town, designate a census-designated place (CDP) that may use the name of one or more hamlets, though boundaries may differ from what is used by the ZIP code, local fire department, etc. Towns in New York may be further subdivided into wards, although as of 2017, only fifteen of the state's 932 towns used this system.\\"The Ward System of Town Government\\", Office of the General Counsel, State of New York In towns operating under the ward system, citizens vote for councilmen who represent a specific area (ward) of the town, as opposed to the at-large councilmen elected in the majority of the state's towns. Towns vary in size and population. The largest town by area is Brookhaven (Suffolk County), which covers , but more than half of that is water. The town of Webb (Herkimer County) has the greatest land area, at . The smallest town, Green Island (Albany County), covers . The town of Hempstead (Nassau County) has about 760,000 people (2010 census), making it more populous than any city in the state except New York City. Red House (Cattaraugus County), the least populous, has 38 permanent residents (2010 census). The use of \\"town\\" in a community's name is irrespective of municipal status. Elizabethtown, Germantown and Stephentown are towns. Cooperstown, home of the Baseball Hall of Fame, is a village, Jamestown and Middletown are cities, and Levittown is an unincorporated hamlet. Census-designated place A census-designated place (CDP) is defined by the United States Census Bureau as \\"a statistical entity defined for each decennial census according to Census Bureau guidelines, comprising a densely settled concentration of population...\\" that is not part of a city or a village \\"...but is locally identified by a name.\\" CDPs may cross town and county borders. CDPs are defined collaboratively by state and local officials and the Census Bureau. They are defined for each census, and it is commonplace to change boundaries and define new CDPs for each census. The Census Bureau formerly referred to CDPs as \\"unincorporated places\\" from 1950 through the 1970 decennial censuses. The term CDP was first used for the 1980 census, and minimum population criteria for CDPs were dropped with the 2000 Census.Census Designated Place (CDP) Program for the 2010 Census - Final Criteria , Federal Register, February 13, 2008 (Volume 73, Number 30). Retrieved 2008-12-05.  Hamlet  Sign for the Hamlet of Sand Lake within the Town of Sand Lake Though the term \\"hamlet\\" is not defined under New York law, many people in the state use the term hamlet to refer to a community within a town that is not incorporated as a village but is identified by a name, i.e. an unincorporated community. Hamlets often have names corresponding to the names of a local school district, post office, or fire district. Because a hamlet has no government of its own, it depends upon the town or towns that contain it for municipal services and government. Because they do not have governments, hamlets have no clear boundaries. Suffolk County publishes maps that give hamlet boundaries, but towns within the county also publish maps that conflict both in the number of hamlets and their boundaries. Nevertheless, all land not within a village is administered by the town. Most of the rest of New York's hamlets, however, have less defined boundaries, and most towns have areas that are not considered to be a part of any hamlet. The New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) puts hamlet names on rectangular green signs with white lettering at roadside locations of its choosing. The NYSDOT and local governments also provide community identification signs on some scenic byways to be placed at the roadside boundaries of hamlets, as decided by the sign provider. Many towns have special zoning or planning districts and planning strategies for their hamlets, and many place welcome signs at the gateways to the hamlets. Some hamlets are former villages that have dissolved their incorporation (Old Forge in Herkimer County; Rosendale, in Ulster County; and Andes in Delaware County, for example). The New York State Gazetteer, published by the New York State Department of Health in 1995, includes a list of hamlets in the state. Available at New York State Library Digital Image Project . The criteria used for inclusion in the Gazetteer are not stated. The Adirondack Park Agency also uses the term \\"hamlet\\", though as a land-use classification for private land under its Adirondack Park Land Use and Development Plan (APLUDP). The APLUDP extends the boundaries for its classification of hamlets \\"well beyond established settlements\\" to allow for growth.  Village  Pomona (red) in Rockland County is partly within two different towns. In New York, a village is an incorporated area. About 85% of villages fall within a single town. Villages in New York State are classified by the Census Bureau as incorporated places. Like all municipal corporations, villages have clearly defined legal boundaries. A village is a municipality that provides services to the residents, services that may or may not include garbage collection, management of cemeteries, street and highway maintenance, street lighting, and building codes. Some villages provide their own police and other municipal services. Villages have less autonomy than cities. Those services not provided by the village are provided by the town or towns containing the village. As of the 2000 census, 9.9% of the state's population was living in one of the 556 villages in New York. The legislature of a village is the board of trustees, composed of a mayor and (usually) four trustees. The board is responsible for approving mayoral appointments, managing village finances and property, and approving a budget. The mayor, who is generally the chief executive of the village, may vote in all business before the board and must vote to break a tie. The mayor generally does not possess veto power, unless this is provided for by local law. Administrative duties of the mayor include enforcing laws and supervising employees. A village may also have a full-time village manager who performs these administrative duties instead of the mayor. In 2007, sixty-seven villages had such a manager. Some villages have their own village justice, while others utilize the justice of the town or towns in which they are located. While most villages are subject to a uniform statewide Village Law, twelve villages operate under charters issued by the state legislature prior to 1874. Before a revision to the State Constitution in that year, villages were formed by the state legislature through granting of charters. Many villages reincorporated, dumping their charters in favor of the Village Law. The villages that retain their charters are Alexander, Carthage, Catskill, Cooperstown, Deposit, Fredonia, Ilion, Mohawk, Ossining, Owego, Port Chester, and Waterford. These villages must still comply with those aspects of Village Law that are not inconsistent with their charters. To be incorporated, the area of the proposed village must have at least 500 inhabitantsNew York Consolidated Law: Village, Article Two, Section 2-200, Population and area requirements. Retrieved 2011-12-08. and not be part of an existing city or village. Additionally, the proposed village can be no more than 5 square miles (13 km2) in area unless its boundaries are to be coterminous with a school, fire, improvement or other district, or the entire town. The process of incorporation begins with a petition by either 20% of residents or owners of 50% of assessed real property. If deemed legally sufficient, incorporation is then voted upon by the qualified voters living in the proposed village only. Some villages have fewer than 500 residents, having incorporated before the present population requirement of 500 or fallen below the 500-resident threshold after incorporation. A village may also be dissolved, returning all government control to the town level. The process of dissolution can be initiated by the village board itself, or upon the submission of a proper petition to the board. The village board must produce a \\"dissolution plan\\" that settles specific matters, such as the village's debts, its employees and property, and the financial impact dissolution would have on village and non-village town residents. This plan is voted upon by village voters only. About 15% of villages cross other municipal boundaries. More than 70 villages are located in two or more towns. Seven villages are in two counties. The village of Saranac Lake is in three towns and two counties. Five towns are coterminous with their single village and have a coterminous town-village form of government. Despite their names, Greenwich Village, the East Village, and Queens Village are not villages, but neighborhoods of the City of New York. Divisions unique to New York City=Boroughs Manhattan, 2\\\\. Brooklyn, 3\\\\. Queens, 4\\\\. The Bronx, 5\\\\. Staten Island A borough is one of the five major administrative divisions of the consolidated City of New York. Boroughs do not currently exist elsewhere in the state. Each of the five boroughs of the city is coextensive with a county of the state of New York. Under the New York State's General Municipal Law, a borough results when the towns, villages and cities in a county merge with the county itself. This occurred in 1898 when the city merged with surrounding counties, cities and towns to form its present configuration. The five boroughs are: *The Bronx (Bronx County) *Brooklyn (Kings County) *Manhattan (New York County) *Queens (Queens County) *Staten Island (Richmond County) The boroughs were originally intended to retain some local governance in the consolidated city. Each borough individually elects a borough president and used to elect two at-large city council members, in addition to those elected based on each borough's population. The borough presidents once wielded considerable power as members of the New York City Board of Estimate, but the position is now largely ceremonial and advisory. Boroughs function as counties for certain purposes, but have no county government. Each of the five New York City district attorneys, however, are still elected by county (for example, the district attorney for Brooklyn is called the Kings County District Attorney). Community districts There are fifty-nine community districts in New York City, each represented by an appointed advisory group called a community board. Each board consists of fifty unpaid members appointed by the borough president. Half of the members are nominated by the City Council members who represent the area. The power of the community boards is very limited. They serve in an advisory capacity regarding land use and zoning, budget, and various concerns of the community. The boards can recommend action on the part of the city government, but they cannot mandate it. Each is identified by borough name and a number (e.g. Manhattan Community Board 3). Special purpose units of government In New York, special purpose units of government provide specialized services only to those who live in the district, and are empowered to tax residents of the district for the services provided in common. Special districts often cross the lines of towns, villages, and hamlets, and occasionally cities or counties. School district School districts are the most common kind of special district in New York. They provide, arrange, or contract for all public education services, including special education and school transportation, the latter also for non-public schools. School districts are rarely precisely coextensive with the cities, towns, villages, or hamlets that bear the same name, meaning that a person living in one hamlet or village might send their children to a school associated with a different hamlet or village. Residents pay school taxes to the same school district in which they live and any children living with them attend school. All tax-paying residents are eligible for the STAR Program tax rebate, which in effect lessens the value of an individual's primary residence to lessen the tax burden on the residence. All but five school districts are separate from municipal governments. The exceptions are the five cities whose populations exceed 125,000 (Buffalo, New York, Rochester, Syracuse and Yonkers), in which education is part of the municipal budget. Schools in the city of New York are controlled by the New York City Department of Education, and the city is divided by the department into 11 \\"school regions\\" (10 geographic regions and a \\"District 75\\" for students with disabilities) There are five types of school districts in the state, each with slightly different laws. =Common school district= Common school districts, established in 1812, were the first type of school district in the state. In July 2004, there were only 11 such districts remaining. They are not authorized to provide secondary education. They must, therefore, contract with neighboring school districts to provide high school education for pupils in the district. Typically one trustee or a three-person board of trustees will govern the district. =Union free school district= In 1853, the legislature established union free school districts, which are districts resulting from a \\"union\\" of two or more common school districts, \\"free\\" from the restrictions that previously barred them from operating high schools. In July 2004, there were 163 school districts of this type. Despite being able to operate high schools, thirty-one of these districts provided only elementary education. Those districts that are not components of central school districts provide secondary education either by contracting with other districts or being located in one of the three central high school districts. Each union free school district is governed by a three- to nine-member board of education. =Central school district= Not to be confused with central high school districts, central school districts are the most prevalent type of school district in New York. In July 2004, there were 460 such districts. They began as a result of legislation in 1914. Central school districts may form from any number (including one) of common, union free, and/or central school districts. Central school districts are permitted to provide secondary education. Its board of education must consist of five, seven, or nine members and length of service must be three, four, or five years, each decided upon by the voters in the district. =Central high school district= There are only three central high school districts in New York state, all in Nassau County (Bellmore-Merrick Central High School District, Sewanhaka Central High School District, and Valley Stream Central High School District). Central high school districts provide secondary education to students in two or more common or union free districts. With creation authorized by the legislature in 1917 and repealed in 1944, creation was reauthorized exclusively for Suffolk County in 1981. Such districts already established were not affected by the repeal. =City school district= In those cities with populations exceeding 125,000 (New York City, Buffalo, Yonkers, Rochester, and Syracuse), the city school districts are coterminous with the city limits, and education is part of the municipal budget. These districts cannot incur debts or levy taxes. The governmental structure in all of these except for New York is that of an elected or appointed board of education. New York's public education is headed by a chancellor and has a 13-member all-appointed Department of Education Panel for Education Policy. The city school districts for the 57 cities having fewer than 125,000 people are separate from the municipal government and are authorized to levy taxes and incur debt. Each of them is governed by an elected board of education with five, seven, or nine members. Districts for smaller cities often extend beyond the city borders and are referred to as \\"enlarged city school districts\\", seven of which have reorganized as \\"central city school districts\\". =Supervisory school district (BOCES)= Owing to the extremely large number (730) of school districts, many of which are quite small, most of them are organized into 37 supervisory districts. Each of these has a Board of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES). Each BOCES provides services that are considered difficult for the member school districts to provide on their own, often including special classes for students with disabilities. Fire district Fire districts are public corporations that generally provide fire protection and other emergency response in towns outside villages. A fire district can levy taxes and incur debt just like other general purpose municipal corporations, although fire districts do not have home rule powers and the taxes are generally collected by the town or towns that the district serves. Fire districts depend on their towns for initial establishment, expansion of district territory, and dissolution, but are otherwise thereafter autonomous political entities able to exercise only those specific powers granted to them by statute. The district is governed by a board of elected commissioners. Villages generally provide their own fire protection, but joint town-village fire districts are permitted. A Joint Fire District is a fire district that encompasses more than one town, wholly or in part, and may also include a village. This is some times done to reduce duplication of services in a small area or to help spread the tax burden when there is a large difference in tax base between neighboring towns. A joint fire district may also be formed when a fire department in a village that has fire protection districts in the surrounding towns separates itself from the village government to obtain greater self-governance. This was seen in 2003 when the fire department in the village of Baldwinsville formed a joint fire district consisting of the village of Baldwinsville and parts of the towns of Lysander and Van Buren in Onondaga County. There were 868 fire districts in New York at the end of 2003. Fire protection district A fire protection district is established by a town board in order to contract fire protection services with any city, village, fire district or incorporated fire company. Unlike fire districts, fire protection districts are not authorized to levy property taxes and do not have an independently elected board of commissioners. The levy to support fire protection districts is part of the town levy and the oversight of the district is via the town board. Public benefit corporation/authority Public benefit corporations in New York operate like quasi-private corporations, generally with boards appointed by elected officials. They are a form of government bureaucracy in one sense but, unlike government agencies, public benefit corporations are exempt from some regulations. Of particular importance, they can take out their own debt, allowing them to bypass legal limits on state debt. This allows them to make potentially risky capital and infrastructure investments without putting so much of the credit of New York on the line. However, it also allows them to avoid many of the oversight and reporting regulations that apply to state government. Public benefit corporations get charters from New York and are usually designed to perform a specific, narrow function in the public interest. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority manages public transportation in the New York Metropolitan Area (this includes the New York subway and public bus systems, as well as Metro-North Railroad and the Long Island Rail Road, and the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority). The New York State Thruway Authority originally only maintained the New York State Thruway from New York City to the Pennsylvania border southwest of Buffalo, but due to budgetary maneuvering, now maintains the toll-free Interstate 287 corridor, and the New York State Barge Canal. Many regions also have authorities to manage their local public transportation such as the Central New York Regional Transportation Authority, which manages much of the public transportation in and around Syracuse; and the Capital District Transportation Authority for the Capital District area around Albany, Schenectady, Troy, and Saratoga Springs. At the end of 2005, there were 866 public benefit corporations, of which 266 were public authorities. Library district Library districts are usually coextensive with the same school district but raise taxes separately and serve all the residents of the library district. They often form cooperative associations with other library districts for shared services, purchasing and cross-library lending. Other types of special purpose units Other special districts may include emergency rescue squads (also known as Consolidated Health Districts), sanitation, police, water, sewer, park, and parking.

Excluding academies and theological seminaries, which have intermittently functioned in Georgia for centuries, TSU is the oldest university in Georgia and the Caucasus region. Over 18,000 students are enrolled and the total number of faculty and staff (collaborators) is 5,000. According to the U.S. News & World Report university rankings, TSU is ranked 359th in the world, tied with the University of Warsaw. The university has five branches in the regions of Georgia, six faculties, 60 scientific-research laboratories and centers, a scientific library (with 3,700,000 books and periodicals), seven museums, publishing house and printing press (newspaper Tbilisis Universiteti). The main founder of the university was a Georgian historian and academician, Ivane Javakhishvili. Among the co-founders were also several scientists, including Giorgi Akhvlediani, Shalva Nutsubidze, Dimitri Uznadze, Grigol Tsereteli, Akaki Shanidze, Andrea Razmadze, Korneli Kekelidze, Ioseb Kipshidze, Petre Melikishvili and Ekvtime Takaishvili. Professor Petre Melikishvili, a Georgian chemist, became the first rector of TSU. The Rector of TSU since September 2016 has been Giorgi Sharvashidze. TSU has six faculties: Law, Economics and Business, Humanities, Medicine, Social and Political Sciences, Exact and Natural Sciences, and the International School of Economics at Tbilisi State University as an autonomous graduate school of economics. History Tbilisi State University building backside in 1918 Tbilisi State University was founded in 1918 owing to the leadership of Georgian historian Ivane Javakhishvili and the group of his followers. It was the first and the only educational body of this type in Caucasus Region by that time. The university is housed in the former building of Georgian Nobility Gymnasium constructed by the architect Simon Kldiashvili from 1899 to 1906. Georgia has a tradition of education, as evidenced by the functioning of the School of Philosophy and Rhetoric of Phazisi in Colchis (4th century); as well as the setting up of cultural-enlightenment centers in Palestine (5th century), Syria (6th century), Greece (10th‚Äì15th centuries) and Bulgaria (11th century); Gelati and Iqalto Academies in Georgia (11th‚Äì12th centuries); However, as a result of political-economic decrease and at last becoming the colony of Russia, there had been no national higher educational Institution in Georgia for the next few centuries. Founder Ivane Javakhishvili Collector Coin Dedicated to the 100th Anniversary of the Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State University After Georgia became independent and declared itself a national democratic state, one of the first achievements of the Georgian people at the beginning of the 20th century was the foundation of the Georgian National University in Tbilisi. Afterwards, through the Bolshevik and Communist period, in spite of the forced ideology and fierce censorship, Tbilisi State University maintained schools in mathematics, psychology, philosophy, linguistics, and historiography. The foundation of the Academy of Science of Georgia and other higher educational institutions was encouraged by the university. The university was opened on 26 January 1918, the day of remembrance of the Georgian King David the Builder. A church in the University garden, named after the King, has been functioning since 5 September 1995. In 1989 the university was named after its founder - Ivane Javakhishvili. Petre Melikishvili, a chemist and professor, was elected as the first rector of the university. At its commencement, the university had one faculty - that of philosophy. Ivane Javakhishvili, a Georgian historian, delivered the first lecture. At the beginning of 1918 the board of professors and lecturers numbered 18, the student body of the university counted 369 students and 89 free listeners. Today the number of professors involved in tuition and training amounts to 3275, including 55 academicians and corresponding member of the academy, 595 professors and doctors, 1246 assistant professors and candidates of sciences. Over 35 thousand students are studying at the University and its eight regional branches. Important changes at the university began on 25 April 1994, when the scientific council of the University adopted \\"The Concepts of University Education\\", according to which since the year 1994 the university has transferred to the two-stage form of study (the step-by-step rearrangements were launched in 1992). At the end of the I stage of the reform implemented, at the beginning of 2005, the bodies functioning at TSU were: 22 faculties with 184 chairs, 8 branches with 46 faculties, 3 scientific-research and study-scientific institutes, 81 scientific-research laboratories and centers, 161 study laboratories and rooms, clinical hospitals and diagnostic centers, publishing and editorial houses, the library with 3,650,000 items, 5 dormitories. 95 educational programs were used at the bachelor's course, 194 at master's studies, and 16 at the single-step tuition. Schools that came into being at Tbilisi University were: * Mathematics (Andrea Razmadze for whom the department was renamed in 1944, Nikoloz Muskhelishvili, Ilia Vekua, Viktor Kupradze, Andro Bitsadze and others), * Physics (Elepter Andronikashvili, Mate Mirianashvili, Vagan Mamasakhlisov, Givi Khutsishvili Albert Tavkhelidze and others), * Psychology (Dimitri Uznadze and others), * Physiology (Ivane Beritashvili and others). * National Scholarly Schools of Georgian Historiography (Ivane Javakhishvili and others), * History of Literature (Korneli Kekelidze and others), * Georgian Philosophy (Shalva Nutsubidze and others), * Art Studies (Giorgi Chubinashvili and others), * Georgian and Caucasian Linguistics (Akaki Shanidze, Giorgi Akhvlediani, Arnold Chikobava and others), * Oriental and Classical Philology (Grigol Tsereteli, Simon Qaukhchishvili, Giorgi Tsereteli and others). * Kartvelology (Kartvelian Studies) The chairs and scientific research departments serve for preparation of postgraduate students and scientific degrees. 26 qualification councils operate for conferring scientific degrees in almost all fields of science. Medical education was restored at the university in 1994. Originally the specialty of medicine was opened at the faculty of biology and medicine, and the faculty of medicine became an independent unit in 2000. A center for the Management of Health Care and the Department for Continuous Medical Education were opened, and the board of trustees of medicine and medical information service were founded. The university diagnostic center provides the health care of the professors and lecturers and collaborators of the University. First Rector Prof. Petre Melikishvili A printing press was set up in 1923 and a publishing-house in 1933. The University Archive was founded in 1933. The scientific edition \\"The Proceedings of Tbilisi University\\" has been publishedisince 1919. The program Textbooks for Students has been functioning since 1996. The University publishes two weekly newspapers \\"Tbilisis Universiteti\\" (since 1927) and \\"Kartuli Universiteti\\" (since 1998). International conferences and symposia have been held at Tbilisi University such as International symposia of psychologists (1979, 1986), symposia on Georgian art (II-1977, IV- 1983, VI- 1989), international symposia on the teaching of the Russian language and literature (1980, 1984, 1988), problems of German literature (1983, 1989), Classical philology (1969, 1975, 1980,1990, 1995, 1996), religion and ethics (1907, international private law (1985), international symposia on Kartvelian Studies (I-1987, II-1988, III-1995). Caucasian studies is one of the major trends of scholarly research. \\"Caucasica\\", an international scholarly journal, has been published since 1998. International conferences dedicated to major problems of the present day have been held at the University: \\"Caucasus, problems of democratization\\" (1995), \\"The law reform in Georgia\\" (1995), \\"The University reform in Georgia\\" (1995), \\"Hellenistic Studies over the centuries\\" (2000). Summer schools are held for foreign scientists in Kartvelian studies (Kartvelologists). Faculties TSU has six faculties: Exact and Natural Sciences The faculty has eight departments, in mathematics, physics, chemistry, geography, computer sciences, biology, geology, electric and electronic engineering. 11 bachelor, 18 master and 10 doctoral degree programs operate at the faculty. Humanities History and Present Day: The Faculty of Humanities of the Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State University is the successor of the Faculty of Philosophy of the first Georgian University established in 1918. The mission of the faculty is to promote the introduction of modern researches and methodologies, the development of scientific work and research-based educational activities in the fields of humanities. Social and Political Sciences In May 2005, during the university reforms, six faculties were established out of 22 faculties at Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State University, the Faculty of Political and Social Sciences was one of them. The mission of the faculty is to prepare qualified specialists through education and research and to develop social science. The faculty has seven educational-scientific directions and offers its students the following Bachelor, Master, and Doctoral programs: Political Science, Journalism, International Relations, Human Geography, Sociology and Social Work.  Psychology and Educational Sciences  In October 2014 the direction of psychology was separated from the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences, and the Teaching and Research Institute of Pedagogy was separated from the Faculty of Humanities. Thus, the Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences was established as a result of merger of the above-mentioned educational directions. Presently about 1400 students are undergoing their studies at the Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences (three stages of education) and about 60 professors are teaching them; 4 bachelor's degree programs and up to 15 master's and doctoral degree programs are being implemented at the faculty. Economics and Business Faculty History: The Faculty of Economics and Business was established as an independent entity at the Tbilisi State University in 1931 on the basis of the Social-Economic Faculty founded in 1922. Until 1944, the Faculty of Economics was the first and the only educational and research center in the country. Now nearly all Georgian universities offer courses in economics, where lectures are delivered by the alumni of the Faculty of Economics. Until 2005 four faculties of the Tbilisi State University (Faculty of Economics, Microeconomics and Management, Marketing and Commerce, International Business) were preparing specialists in the field of economic and business. Establishment of the Faculty of Economics and Business, which is the largest faculty at the Tbilisi State University, is the result of the reforms that have been carried out in Georgian educational system and in TSU in 2005. Law The country's political unification and strengthening, economic growth and development created all necessary grounds for cultural development in Georgia that can perfectly be confirmed by the existence of cultural-educational centers of Gelati and Ikalto. Medicine The history of higher medical education originates from October 1918 when the Faculty of Medicine was established at the Tbilisi State University. Since May 1919, by decision of the Board of Professors, the Medical Faculty continued to exist as an independent unit until 1930 when the Tbilisi State Medical Institute was founded on the basis of the Medical Faculty. In 1995, higher medical education was restored at Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State University, first at the Faculty of Biology and Medicine as medical specialization, and in 2000 as an independent faculty. The faculty runs one- tier academic programs for physicians and dentists. Since 2006, within the framework of TEMPUS project, there has been operating a new bachelor program in occupational therapy in full accordance with the Bologna Process and Tuning Methodology.

He is currently on death row in Adjustment Center at San Quentin State Prison, California. He was convicted in 1996 of first-degree murder and four special circumstances (robbery, burglary, kidnapping, and a lewd act on a child) of 12-year-old Polly Klaas. Davis abducted Klaas on October 1, 1993, from her home in Petaluma, California. A San Jose, California, Superior Court jury returned a death sentence verdict on August 5, 1996. After the verdict was read, Davis stood and made an obscene finger gesture at the courtroom camera with both hands. Later, at his formal sentencing, Davis read a statement claiming that Klaas had said to Davis, \\"Just don't do me like my dad,\\" just before Davis killed her, implying that Klaas's father was a child molester. Polly's father, Marc Klaas, lunged at the defendant but was restrained by the bailiffs. Marc Klaas then left the courtroom to avoid causing further commotion. Judge Thomas C. Hastings proceeded, saying \\"Mr. Davis, this is always a traumatic and emotional decision for a judge. You made it very easy today by your conduct.\\" Early life Davis was born the third of five children in San Francisco. His parents, Bob and Evelyn Davis, were both alcoholics. His defense attorneys during his trial said that his mother had punished Davis for smoking by burning his hand. Davis is of English and Northern Paiute heritage. His maternal grandparents were from the Fort McDermitt reservation in Nevada. He and his mother spent part of his childhood with them. The couple divorced when Davis was 11. After the divorce, the children lived with their father, a longshoreman. Davis's father was sometimes unable or unwilling to care for his children, so they shuttled among family members and babysitters. Davis's father remarried twice. Davis resented both of his stepmothers. Bob Davis was mentally unstable and sometimes suffered from hallucinations. He is reported to have taken a gun outside the home and shot at mirages. At an early age, Davis tortured and killed animals. According to Ruth Baron, the mother of one of Davis's childhood friends, \\"He would douse cats with gasoline and set them on fire. He made a point of letting people know he carried a knife, and he used to find stray dogs and cut them, however Davis had a pleasant and a good side at times, he would take care of his brothers and sisters since his parents were divorced, his sister said \\"Richard was like our mother and father in the same time who took good care of us.\\" By the time he entered his teens, Davis was deeply involved in crime. He told a psychiatrist that stealing relieved whatever \\"tensions\\" were building up inside him. He dropped out of high school in his sophomore year. At 17, when Davis was in court, a judge told him that he could either go to the California Youth Authority or join the United States Army. He chose the latter. He received a discharge after 13 months' service. On October 12, 1973, Davis went to a party at the home of 18-year-old Marlene Voris. That night, Voris was found dead of a gunshot wound. There were seven suicide notes at the scene and the police concluded that she committed suicide. Friends of Voris believe Davis murdered her. In 1977, he told a psychiatrist that her death had deeply affected him and he had been hearing her voice in his head and also, \\"At times another voice would appear, telling him that she wanted to be assaulted or robbed or raped\\". A few weeks after Voris' death, Davis was arrested for attempting to pawn property he had stolen. He confessed to a string of burglaries in La Honda and served six months in the county jail. Five weeks after his release, on May 13, 1974, he was arrested for another burglary. He was sentenced to 6 months to 15 years in prison; however, he was released on parole after serving a year of his sentence.

Menton has always been a frontier town. For centuries, it formed the border between Provence and Genoa. It has been French ever since the plebiscite of 1860, when it soon became a fashionable tourist centre with grand mansions and gardens. Its temperate Mediterranean climate is especially favourable to the citrus industry, with which it is strongly identified. History The Menton area has been inhabited since the paleolithic era, and is the site of the original \\"Grimaldi Man\\" find of early modern humans, as well as remains of Neanderthals and Cro-Magnons.√âmile Rivi√®re, D√©couverte d'un Squelette Humain de l'√âpoque Pal√©olithique Dans les Cavernes des Baouss√©-Rousse dites Grottes de Menton (Discovery of a Human Skeleton from the Paleolithic in the Caverns of Baouss√©- Rousse also known as the Grottes de Menton), (J.-B. Bailli√®re et Fils, Paris, 1873) (in French) In Roman times, the Via Julia Augusta, a road connecting Placentia (now Piacenza) with Arelates (now Arles) passed through Menton, running along the Rue Longue in the old town.La rue Longue (Official site of the town of Menton, accessed April 2009) (in French) The first major settlement occurred during the 11th century CE, when the Count of Ventimiglia constructed the Ch√¢teau de Puypin (Podium Pinum) on the P√©pin hill, north and west of the modern town centre. During the 13th century, the seigneury of Puypin fell to the Vento family of Genoa who built a new castle along the Roman road, now the site of the Vieux-Ch√¢teau cemetery, providing the core around which the current town grew. Menton was thus incorporated into the Republic of Genoa. The first mention of Menton dates from 21 July 1262, in the peace treaty between Charles of Anjou and Genoa. Its position on the border between the Angevin-ruled Provence and the Republic of Genoa, which at the time claimed Monaco as its western limit, made it a coveted location. Menton, as part of Monaco, in 1664. Acquired in 1346 by Charles Grimaldi, Lord of Monaco, Menton was ruled by the Princes of Monaco until the French Revolution. Annexed during the Revolution, Menton remained part of France through the First Empire. It belonged to the district of Sanremo in the department of Alpes-Maritimes, which at the time included Monaco and Sanremo. In 1814, Menton was included in a reconstituted principality of Monaco which, after Napoleon's Hundred Days in 1815, became a protectorate of the King of Sardinia. The Princes of Monaco were obliged to do homage to the King for Menton, although not for Monaco itself. Roquebrune in 1848.Ermanno Amicucci. Nizza e l'Italia. Mondadori editore. Milano, 1939. In 1848, Menton, along with its neighbour Roquebrune, seceded from Monaco, due at least in part to a tax imposed on lemon exports.Menton on the French Riviera (accessed April 2009) They proclaimed themselves a \\"free city\\" during the 1848 revolutions related to the Italian Risorgimento, then two years later placed themselves under the protection of the Kingdom of Sardinia where they were administered by the House of Savoy for ten years.Ermanno Amicucci. Nizza e l'Italia. p 58-61 The Treaty of Turin concluded on 24 March 1860 between the Kingdom of Sardinia and Napoleon III's France called for the annexation of the County of Nice to France, subject to a plebiscite, as a reward for French assistance in Italy's war against Austria. The plebiscite, with universal adult male suffrage, was held on 15 and 16 April 1860, and resulted in an overwhelming vote in favour of annexation (833 for versus 54 against in Menton and Roquebrune), despite complaints of rigged elections from, among others, Nice- born Italian nationalist Giuseppe Garibaldi. The county of Nice was thus annexed to France that June, and Napoleon III paid 4 million francs in compensation to the prince of Monaco, who renounced his rights in perpetuity on 2 February 1861. The publication of Winter and Spring on the Shores of the Mediterranean (1861) by the English doctor James Henry Bennett had a profound effect on Menton, making it a destination for sufferers of tuberculosis. By the end of the 19th century, tourism was an important factor in Menton's growth. The town was popular with British and Russian aristocrats who built many of the hotels, villas, and palaces which still grace Menton today. Many of these hotels and palaces were pressed into service as hospitals during World War I to allow injured troops to recuperate in a pleasant climate. Sailing ships in Menton harbour, photograph by Jean Gilletta, early 1900s Menton was the only sizable settlement captured by Italy during its invasion of France in June 1940. Following the armistice of 22 June 1940, two-thirds of the territory of the commune was annexed by Italy as terra irredenta. The annexation lasted until 8 September 1943. Although officially returned to Vichy France, Menton was in fact occupied by Nazi Germany until its liberation by American and Canadian troops of the First Special Service Force on 8 September 1944.La lib√©ration de Menton (The Liberation of Menton, Official site of the town of Menton, Accessed April 2009) (in French) Geography The port and the old part of town View of the port of Menton Menton, nicknamed the Pearl of France, is located on the Mediterranean Sea at the Franco-Italian border, just across from the Ligurian town of Ventimiglia. The fishing industry was devastated in the 1980s and 1990s due to a combination of overfishing and hypoxia in the bay. At the time, the devastation was erroneously attributed to the dubiously nicknamed \\"killer algae\\" Caulerpa taxifolia (a non-native Asian tropical green alga first discovered in the Mediterranean Sea adjacent to the Oceanographic Museum of Monaco in 1984) spread throughout the coastal sea floor. Later, sound scientific findings revealed that the seaweed was adept at absorbing pollutants and excess nutrients, actually aiding the recovery of native Posidonia sea grassJaubert, J. M., J. R. M.

However, the milder winters (on average) and the warmer nights in summer (on average), compared to the rest of the French Mediterranean coastal area, provide Menton with a particular micro-climate, with significant warm- summer mediterranean climate (Csb) influences and characteristics, like coastal California and Oregon (experienced from Nice through Monaco and Menton, toward the Italian border) that is favorable to tangerine, orange and lemon groves, hence one of the town's symbols, the lemon. Winter frosts are extremely rare but may occasionally occur every few years.

It is taught within the French educational system, as a variety of Ni√ßard (i.e. Proven√ßal and Occitan). However, in nineteenth-century linguistic descriptions,James Bruny Andrews, Il dialetto di Mentone, in quanto egli tramezzi ideologicamente tra il provenzale e il ligure (The dialect of Menton, in which it is ideologically intermediate between Proven√ßal and Ligurian) in Archivio Glottologico Italiano XII, 1890/92, pp. 97-106. (in English) as well as in contemporary linguistic scholarship,J.-P. Dalbera, Interf√©rences entre proven√ßal et ligurien dans la g√©n√®se du syst√®me morphologique mentonnais (Interferences between Proven√ßal and Ligurian in the genesis of the Mentonnais morphological system) in Bulletin du Centre de romanistique et de latinit√© tardive 4-5, Nice, 1989, pp. 89-97.W.

(in Italian)Le mentonnais entre toutes les chaises ? in Lexique Fran√ßais-Mentonnais (Caserio & al. 2001) (in French) Mentonasc is described as an intermediate between Ni√ßard and the Intemelio dialect of Ligurian. Some scholars insist that Mentonasc is, at its base, a Ligurian dialect, with French influences coming only later,Werner Forner.√Ä propos du ligurien int√©m√©lien - La c√¥te, l'arri√®re-pays, Travaux du Cercle linguistique de Nice, 7-8, 1986, pp. 29-62.. Origin of the name Although the name's spelling and pronunciation in French are identical to those for the word that means \\"chin\\", there does not seem to be any link with this French word. According to the French geographer Ernest N√®gre, the name Menton comes from the Roman name Mento.Ernest N√®gre, General Toponym of France : Etymology of 35,000 place names, Geneva : Librairie Droz, 1990. Volume I : Pre-Celtic, Celtic, and Roman names, ¬ß 11 118, p 664 (in French). However, it is possible that the name of the city comes from Mons Ottonis (reconstituted) from the name of Otton II, the Count of Ventimiglia from 1162-1200.Fondation de Menton In Mentonasc, the city's name is Mentan (), and in Italian Mentone (). An inhabitant of Menton, un mentonnais or un mentonasque in French, would be O mentonasc in the local dialect. Annual town events The F√™te du Citron (Lemon Festival) takes place every February. The event follows a given theme each decade; past themes include Viva Espa√±a, Disney, Neverland, and India. The carnival lasts a few days, with different bands passing through Menton's streets on foot or on truck trailers. The Casino Gardens in the centre of town are decorated in the theme of the festival, using lemons and oranges to cover the exhibits, and huge temporary statues are built and covered with citrus fruit. The Casino Gardens are also the location for Menton's Christmas Festival. The Menton Classical Musical Festival is also held every year in the centre of the old town.

The city had an estimated urban population of 19,318 at June 2018. Wangaratta has recorded a population growth rate of almost 1% annually since 2016 to 2018 which is the second highest of all cities in North-Eastern Victoria. The city is located at the junction of the Ovens and King rivers, which drain the northwestern slopes of the Victorian Alps. Wangaratta is the administrative centre and the most populous city in the Rural City of Wangaratta local government area. History The original inhabitants of the area were the Pangerang peoples (Pallanganmiddang, WayWurru, Waveroo). The first European explorers to pass through the Wangaratta area were Hume and Hovell (1824) who named the Oxley Plains immediately south of Wangaratta. Major Thomas Mitchell during his 1836 expedition made a favourable report of its potential as grazing pasture. The first squatter to arrive was Thomas Rattray in 1838 who built a hut (on the site of the Wangaratta RSL) founding a settlement known as \\"Ovens Crossing\\". The Post Office in the area opened on 1 February 1843 as Ovens. The Ovens office, and the Kilmore office which opened the same day, were the fifth and sixth to open in the Port Phillip District and the first two inland offices. The name Wangaratta was given by colonial surveyor Thomas Wedge in 1848 after the \\"Wangaratta\\" cattle station, the name of which is believed to have been derived from an indigenous language and meaning \\"nesting place of cormorants\\" or \\"meeting of the waters\\". The first land sales occurred shortly afterward and the population at the time was around 200. The first school was established by William Bindall on Chisholm Street with 17 students. Gold was found nearby at Beechworth in February 1852 and by the end of the year more than 8,000 prospectors rushed the fields of Ovens and Beechworth. Wangaratta became a major service centre to these goldfields. As a result, the first bridge over the Ovens was completed in early 1855. A seven-member council incorporated the Borough of Wangaratta on 19 June 1863. The 1870s saw the settlement establish a number of key infrastructure and services including the first water supply. Wangaratta hospital was opened in 1871 and the fire brigade was established in 1872. The railway to Melbourne was opened on 28 October 1873. On 28 June 1880 in the nearby small town of Glenrowan, located some 10 km away, the final shootout that led to the capture of Australia's most famous bushranger, Ned Kelly occurred. In 1883, the railway was connected through to Sydney. The population at the turn of the century reached 2,500 and the centre had developed an imposing streetscape of hotels, commercial public and religious buildings. Cr George Handley, Mayor and Hubert Opperman in Wangaratta, 15 Nov 1927 after Opperman won the first stage of the Dunlop Grand Prix The Duke of Gloucester visited Wangaratta during his tour of Australia in 1934. George Handley (Mayor) and Duke of Gloucester on his visit to Wangaratta 22 Oct 1934 Bruck textile mills was established in 1946, employing over a thousand workers. Wangaratta was proclaimed a city on 15 April 1959 with a population of 12,000 people. New municipal offices were opened in 1980 which became the headquarters of the Rural City of Wangaratta after the amalgamation of municipalities in 1995. Population According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 18,710 people in Wangaratta. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 1.6% of the population. * 84.0% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 1.7%, Italy 1.4% and New Zealand 0.6%. * 87.3% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Italian at 2.1%. * The most common responses for religion were No Religion 29.1%, Catholic 28.4% and Anglican 15.1%.50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. Geography and landmarks The geographical layout of the city is unusual in that the business district is located at the north-eastern extremity of the urban area, with outlying suburbs extending only to the south and west. The reason for this arrangement is that the area beyond the rivers, to the north and east of the business district, was until the 1990s prone to flooding and so unsuitable for building. Levees were constructed in the 1990s to alleviate the flooding, however development in this area has been slow. Notable buildings include the Holy Trinity Anglican Cathedral and its Cathedral Close, St. Patrick's Catholic Church and the eccentric art d√©co courthouse. Climate Since the warmest month mean reaches , Wangaratta would have a humid subtropical climate (Cfa in the K√∂ppen climate classification). Despite its classification, it is located in a transitional region that also tends to receive dry searing winds from the northwest. April is the driest month; June is the wettest. Despite its location close to the Snowy Mountains and the ski fields, Wangaratta does not get severely cold or snowy in winter and daytime maximum temperatures are rather mild, although cold air drifting down from the mountains can cause frosty mornings during clear winter nights. Rain falls as thunderstorms in the summer, and in winter with cold fronts. Occasional severe heat waves are caused by hot, dry air from the central deserts of Australia moving over the area. Temperatures of and slightly above occur 2‚Äì4 times a year on average; however, heatwaves are often succeeded by cold fronts, which cause a significant drop in the temperature. The city gets 105.1 days annually, which is akin to Sydney and Wollongong. Wangaratta Old Post Office Wangaratta Library Holy Trinity Anglican Cathedral Wangaratta Roman Catholic Church Murphy Street in 1908 Rainfall averages out to a year, most of which falls in winter with passing frontal systems; however these can occur at any time of year, and the main form of rainfall in spring and summer is from thunderstorms. Extreme temperatures have ranged from on 3 January 1990 and again on 7 February 2009 to on 14 June 2006. Governance Government Centre In local government, the Wangaratta region is covered by the Rural City of Wangaratta. The council was created in 1994 as an amalgamation of a number of other municipalities in the region with the council chambers located at the Government Centre in central Wangaratta. The City is represented by seven councillors elected once every four years by postal voting. The mayor is elected from these councillors by their colleagues for a one-year term. In September 2013 the council was sacked by the state government. Victorian Local Government Minister Jeanette Powell said this was because \\"Council has failed to provide effective leadership and service for the community\\". The council will be replaced by an administrator who will serve until the 2016 local government elections. In state politics, Wangaratta is located in the Legislative Assembly district of Ovens Valley currently held by the National Party of Australia. In federal politics, Wangaratta is located in a single House of Representatives division‚Äîthe Division of Indi. The Division of Indi was seen as a safe Liberal Party of Australia seat from 1977 until 2013, when the sitting member, Sophie Mirabella was defeated by independent candidate Cathy McGowan. Industry There is a considerable wine and gourmet food industry in the nearby Milawa and King Valley region. Other notable industries in the area include Australian Textile Mills formerly Bruck Textiles, Wilson Fabrics that now occupies the old IBM facility, Merriwa Industries and Australian Country Spinners. Previously multi-national IBM manufactured computers in Wangaratta.IBM Culture and sport=Sport A Victorian Country Football League match in Wangaratta Australian rules football, cricket and Netball are the most popular sports There are four Australian rules football clubs in Wangaratta. The Wangaratta Football Club, the Wangaratta Rovers Football Club, both competing in the Ovens and Murray Football League, and the North Wangaratta Football Club, which competes in the Ovens and King Football League. The close proximity of the Rovers and Wangaratta grounds reflects the historical sectarian split in membership of the clubs; Rovers membership being predominantly Catholic and Wangaratta being predominantly Protestant. The Centrals Junior Football Club was established in 1938, and are affiliated with the Wangaratta & District Junior Football League. The Australian rules football club focusses on developing young people. Their home ground is the Bill O'callaghan oval on the HP Barr Reserve. The city hosted several games for the 2005 Australian Football International Cup event, with several countries competing in the sport of Australian rules football. The event was played at the City Oval and Showgrounds and set the attendance records for the tournament to date. Cricket in Wangaratta is organised by the Wangaratta and District Cricket Association. Clubs include Wangaratta Magpies, Rovers United Bruck, City Colts Cricket Clubs. Wangaratta City Football Club is a soccer club based at South Wangaratta Reserve.

Wangaratta has a horse racing club, the Wangaratta Turf Club, which schedules around eleven race meetings a year including the Wangaratta Cup meeting in April. The Wangaratta Greyhound Racing Club, which held regular meetings at the same venue, has been discontinued. Avian Park is no longer used. Golfers play at the course of the Wangaratta Golf Club on Yarrawonga Road, or at the course of the Jubilee Golf Club at Wangandary nearby. A nine-hole course is at Boorhaman to the north of Wangaratta. Between 1953 and 1956, the North Eastern Car Club ran motor racing meetings on the gravel and earth airstrip located on Wangarratta Common, south of the town centre.. The circuit ran up and down the airstrip, with a loop at the western end. The North East Windsport Club regularly sail ‚ÄúLand Yachts‚Äù called Blokarts (Blo-karts) at their sailing site at the nearby town of Springhurst, Victoria, The city is home to the Northeast Bushrangers who play in the Big V basketball league. They play their home games at the Wangaratta YMCA.

The Docker street campus offers a broad range of courses from business studies to music with a central area containing a cafeteria, library and student services. The Christensens Lane campus on the outskirts of Wangaratta is the home for the National Centre for Equine Education as well as providing courses in horticulture. In 2015 the Christensens Lane campus moved to a bigger site in Tone Road. And in 2016 Charles Sturt University also added a campus there. The old Christensens Lane campus was then dismantled to make way for a new housing estate. Transport Wangaratta railway station Roads are the most used transport infrastructure in Wangaratta. The Hume Freeway (M31) bypasses the city to the south and east, while the C314 now forms the main road through it (as Murphy Street and Wangaratta Road). The city is located at the junction of several other major roads, the Great Alpine Road (B500), Wangaratta-Yarrawonga Road (C374), Wangaratta-Whitfield Road (C521) and Wangaratta-Kilfeera Road (C523). A city bus service runs every half an hour during the day on weekdays and on Saturday mornings on a route covering Wangaratta's West End, the business district, Yarrunga and more recently, Yarrawonga Road. Rail transport services both passengers and freight. Wangaratta railway station is on the North East railway line, the main railway line between Sydney and Melbourne. It is served by the Albury V/Line rail service thrice-daily as well as the NSW TrainLink XPT service twice-daily in both directions. Historically, Wangaratta was the busy junction of several railway branch lines including; the broad gauge 5' 3\\"Yackandandah railway line, a narrow gauge 2' 6\\" Whitfield railway line and the broad gauge 5' 3\\" Bright and Beechworth railway line, all of which have since closed. Another short 5' 3\\" gauge branch line ran west to a wheat silo located on the north side of the Ovens River at Boorhaman. The current rail line through the town is the 4' 8\\" standard gauge rail opened in 1962. The Murray to the Mountains Rail Trail is a shared cycling and walking track that follows the way of the former Bright railway line. The Hume Freeway runs directly next to Wangaratta. Wangaratta is also serviced by a small regional airport, Wangaratta Airport.

She was lost in a collision with a friendly escort ship in February 1942. History Her keel was laid down on 7 November 1919 by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation's Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts. She launched on 22 August 1922 sponsored by Mrs. Carlos Bean, and commissioned on 15 October 1923 with Lieutenant Edmund W. Burrough in command. Operating out of New London, Connecticut from 1923 to 1925, S-26 visited St. Thomas and Trinidad from January to April 1924, and Hawaii from 27 April to 30 May 1925. Cruising from California ports, mainly Mare Island, San Diego, and San Pedro, California, S-26 visited Hawaii in the summers of 1927‚Äì1930. She also served in the Panama Canal area from March to May 1927, and in February 1929. Departing San Diego on 1 December 1930, she arrived at Pearl Harbor on 12 December. From then into 1938, S-26 served at Pearl Harbor. Sailing from there on 15 October 1938, she returned to New London on 25 March 1939. Entering a period of partial duty on 15 April that year, she resumed full duty on 1 July 1940. Following duty at New London and hydrogen tests at Washington, DC, S-26 sailed from New London on 10 December 1941, and arrived at Coco Solo, Panama on 19 December. Loss On the night of 24 January 1942, S-26 was accidentally rammed and sunk by the submarine chaser PC-460 (later renamed Sturdy) in the Gulf of Panama. After escorting a division of four S-Class submarines out of the harbor of Balboa, Panama on the Pacific Ocean side of the Panama Canal, PC-460 executed a 180 degree turn to return to port. Although PC-460 did signal her intentions, the message was received by only one submarine in the formation and not the S-26. Although PC-460 noticed S-26 prior to the collision and attempted to back her engines and made evasive maneuvers, the two vessels collided. S-26 was struck amidships on her starboard side and sank within seconds. Three men (the captain, executive officer, and a lookout) survived, and three officers and 43 crew members were killed. Though divers were sent down to the wreck over the following days, her hull was not salvaged.

History I-26 in this 1955 map. The connection along US 221 was never built. This highway was once connected to I-85 from opening until 1995; that year, I-85 was moved north to bypass Spartanburg, leaving I-585 as an orphan, segregated from the rest of the Interstate Highway system. There is a project underway to extend I-585 along US 176 to I-85's new location. The ramps from I-585 southbound to I-85 Bus. north and south opened on October 9, 2006; subsequent ramps between the two roads have since been reopened including a large fly- over ramp that overpasses the East Campus Boulevard exit. Currently, US 176 remains a freeway north of the I-85 Bus. interchange until a traffic signal with Upper Valley Falls Road, prior the interchange with I-85. Some vehicles on US 176 must cross oncoming traffic in order to access a some directions of I-85 as it is a typical diamond interchange. Exit list Exit numbers are based on US 176 mileage. Interstate 585 Business Interstate 585 Business (I-585 Bus) was a boulevard-grade business spur of I-585 along Pine Street, between Whitney Road (US 221) and St. John Street (US 29). It ran concurrently with US 176 and SC 9\\\\. Sometime between 2000 and 2012, the route was removed, with no current state or federal maps listing it, nor any physical signage.

On July 12, 2007, the CBOT merged with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) to form CME Group. CBOT and three other exchanges (CME, NYMEX, and COMEX) now operate as designated contract markets (DCM) of the CME Group. History Men working the floor at the Chicago Board of Trade as photographed by Stanley Kubrick for Look magazine in 1949 Trading floor at the Chicago Board of Trade in 1993 The concerns of U.S. merchants to ensure that there were buyers and sellers for commodities have resulted in forward contracts to sell and buy commodities. Still, credit risk remained a serious problem. The CBOT took shape to provide a centralized location, where buyers and sellers can meet to negotiate and formalize forward contracts. An early 1848 discussion between Thomas Richmond and W. L. Whiting regarding the propriety of creating a board of trade led to the March 13 meeting merchants and businessmen in favor of establishing it and a resulting resolution for such an establishment and a Constitution. A committee then developed bylaws that were adopted on the first Monday of April by 82 charter members of the Board of Trade. In 1864, the CBOT listed the first ever standardized \\"exchange traded\\" forward contracts, which were called futures contracts. In 1919, the Chicago Butter and Egg Board, a spin-off of the CBOT, was reorganized to enable member traders to allow future trading, and its name was changed to Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The Board's restrictions on trading after hours on any prices other than those at the Board's close gave rise to the 1917 case Chicago Board of Trade v. United States, in which the U.S. Supreme Court held that the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890's language outlawing \\"every contract ... in restraint of trade\\" was not to be taken literally, but rather should be interpreted under a \\"rule of reason.\\" On October 19, 2005, the initial public offering (IPO) of 3,191,489 CBOT shares was priced at $54.00 (USD) per share. On its first day of trading the stock closed up +49% at $80.50 (USD) on the NYSE. In 2007, the CBOT and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange merged to form the CME Group. Chicago Board of Trade Building Chicago Board of Trade Building Since 1930, the Chicago Board of Trade has been operating out of 141 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, in a building designed by architects Holabird & Root that is 605 feet (184 m) tall, the tallest in Chicago until the Richard J. Daley Center superseded it in 1965. This Art Deco building incorporates sculptural work by Alvin Meyer and is capped by a 31-foot (9.5 m) tall statue of the Roman goddess Ceres in reference to the exchange's heritage as a commodity market. Ceres is often claimed to be faceless because its sculptor, John Storrs, believed that the forty-five story building would be sufficiently taller than any other nearby structure and as a result that no one would be able to see the sculpture's face anyway. However, this popular rumor was disproved, with the sculptor intending to give the statue an ethereal and god-like look by being faceless. On May 4, 1977, the Chicago Board of Trade Building was designated a Chicago Landmark. The building is now a National Historic Landmark. Today the Board of Trade Building is closely joined by numerous skyscrapers in the heart of Chicago's busy Loop commercial neighborhood. Trading platforms=The Pit Clock on the front of the building The pit is a raised octagonal structure where open-outcry trading takes place. Operating during regular trading hours (RTH), the CBOT trading floor contains many such pits. The steps up on the outside of the octagon and the steps down on the inside give the pit something of the appearance of an amphitheater, and allow hundreds of traders to see and hear each other during trading hours. The importance of the pit and pit trading is emphasized by the use of a stylized pit as the logo of the CBOT. The Pit is also the title and subject of a classic novel (1903) by Frank Norris. Trades are made in the pits by bidding or offering a price and quantity of contracts, depending on the intention to buy (bid) or sell (offer). This is generally done by using a physical representation of a trader's intentions with his hands. If a trader wants to buy ten contracts at a price of eight, for example, in the pit he would yell \\"8 for 10\\", stating price before quantity, and turn his palm inward toward his face, putting his index finger to his forehead denoting ten; if he were to be buying one, he would place his index finger on his chin. If the trader wants to sell five contracts at a price of eight, they would yell \\"5 at 8\\", stating quantity before price, and show one hand with palm facing outward, showing 5 fingers. The combination of hand-signals and vocal representation between the way a trader expresses bids and offers is a protection against misinterpretation by other market participants. For historical purposes, an illustrated project to record the hand signal language used in CBOT's trading pits has been compiled and published. With the rise of electronic trading the importance of the pit has decreased substantially for many contracts, though the pit remains the best place to get complex option spreads filled.

Oaks, \\"The Historicity of the Book of Mormon\\" Mormon Truth and Book of Mormon Evidences: Not Proof, But Indications of Plausibility This claim, as well as all claims to historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon, are rejected by non-Latter Day Saint historians and scientists.Simon G. Southerton, Losing a Lost Tribe: Native Americans, DNA, and the Mormon Church (2004, Signature Books).Jerald and Sandra Tanner, Mormonism-Shadow or Reality? (1972, Modern Microfilm Company).Statement of Smithsonian Institution regarding Book of Mormon.A Linguist Looks at Mormonism. Linguistically based assertions are frequently cited and discussed in the context of the subject of the Book of Mormon, both in favor of and against the book's claimed origins. Both critics and promoters of the Book of Mormon have used linguistic methods to analyze the text. Promoters have published claims of stylistic forms that Joseph Smith and his contemporaries are unlikely to have known about, as well as similarities to Egyptian and Hebrew. Critics of the Book of Mormon claim there are places where the language is anachronistic and suggestive of a 19th-century origin consistent with Smith's upbringing and life experience, as well as the books and other literature published just preceding the time that the Book of Mormon was published.The Book of Mormon: Ancient or Modern. A problem with linguistic reviews of the Book of Mormon is that the claimed original text is either unavailable for study or never existed. Smith said that he returned the golden plates to an angel after he finished the translation. Native American language-development In 1922, LDS Church general authority B. H. Roberts conducted an in-depth review of the research regarding language development and dialects among the Native American peoples; Roberts's study which was published posthumously in 1985 as Studies of the Book of Mormon.Brigham D. Madsen, ed., B. H. Roberts: Studies of the Book of Mormon, Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1985. Under the assumption that the majority of Native Americans descend from the peoples described in the Book of Mormon, Roberts noted that linguistic evidence among the Native American peoples does not appear to support the Book of Mormon narrative, inasmuch as the diverse language stocks and dialects that exist would not have had enough time to develop from a single language dating from A.D. 400 (the approximate date of the conclusion of the Book of Mormon record). Roberts noted: Apologists from FARMS have published studies that claim that the linguistic evidence cited by Roberts does not necessarily contradict the narrative of the Book of Mormon. Specifically, if one adheres to the limited geography model, then it is possible that many of the peoples of the Book of Mormon are not the principal ancestors of the Native Americans.. See citations in note 4 therein. Linguistic anachronisms Critics of the Book of Mormon have claimed that a variety of linguistic anachronisms exist in it which cast doubt upon its historical authenticity. Linguistic anachronisms in the Book of Mormon are words that represent concepts that are not believed to have existed in the Americas between 2500 B.C. and A.D. 400, or in the Jewish world of Lehi's time‚Äîthe period of history covered by the narrative of the Book of Mormon. Mormon apologists dispute these claims, with some arguing that during the translation of the golden plates, Smith may have chosen words that he knew that were closest in meaning to the original concept written on the plates (i.e., a \\"translator's anachronism\\"). \\"Christ\\" and \\"Messiah\\" The words \\"Christ\\" and \\"Messiah\\" are used several hundred times throughout the Book of Mormon. The first instance of the word \\"Christ\\" dates to between 559 and 545 B.C.See 2 Nephi 10:3. The first instance of the word \\"Messiah\\" dates to about 600 B.C.1 Nephi 1:19. \\"Christ\\" is the English transliteration of the Greek word ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑœåœÇ (transliterated as Christ√≥s); it is relatively synonymous with the Hebrew word ◊û◊©◊ô◊ó, pronounced and rendered \\"Messiah\\".\\" Both words have the meaning of \\"anointed,\\" and are used in the Bible to refer to \\"the Anointed One\\". In Greek translations of the Old Testament (including the Septuagint), the word \\"Christ\\" is used for the Hebrew \\"Messiah\\", and in Hebrew translations of the New Testament, the word \\"Messiah\\" is used for the Greek \\"Christ\\".BibleGateway.com: A searchable online Bible in over 50 versions and 35 languages Any passage in the Bible that uses the word \\"Christ\\" can substitute the word \\"Messiah\\" or \\"the Messiah\\" with no change in meaning (e.g., ). The Book of Mormon uses both terms throughout the book. In the vast majority of cases, it uses the terms in an identical manner as the Bible, where it does not matter which word is used: Richard Packham argues that the Greek word \\"Christ\\" in the Book of Mormon challenges the authenticity of the work since Smith clearly stated that \\"there was no Greek or Latin upon the plates from which I, through the grace of the Lord, translated the Book of Mormon.\\" Apologists note that the word \\"Christ\\" is a translational equivalent to the term \\"Messiah\\", arguing that \\"it is no more anachronistic for pre- Christian era Book of Mormon peoples to believe in a coming Messiah/Christ than it was for Old Testament prophets to believe in a coming Messiah/Christ.\\" \\"Church\\" and \\"synagogue\\" The word \\"church\\" first occurs in 1 Nephi 4:26, where a prophet named Nephi disguises himself as Laban, a prominent man in Jerusalem whom Nephi had slain: > And he [Laban's servant], supposing that I spake of the brethren of the > church, and that I was truly that Laban whom I had slain, wherefore he did > follow me (). According to the Book of Mormon, this exchange happened in Jerusalem, around 600 B.C. The meaning of the word \\"church\\" in the Book of Mormon is more comparable to usage in the Bible than Modern English. The concept of a church, meaning \\"a convocation of believers\\", existed among the House of Israel prior to Christianity. For instance, Psalms speaks of praising the Lord \\"in the congregation of the saints\\"; the Septuagint contains the Greek word ecclesia for \\"congregation,\\" which is also translated as \\"church\\" in the New Testament. A similar question regards the word \\"synagogue\\", found in Alma 16:13: > And Alma and Amulek went forth preaching repentance to the people in their > temples, and in their sanctuaries, and also in their synagogues, which were > built after the manner of the Jews (). Critics of the Book of Mormon note that synagogues did not exist in their modern form before the destruction of the temple and the Babylonian captivity. The oldest known synagogue is located in Delos, Greece, and has been dated to 150 B.C.The Oldest Original Synagogue Building in the Diaspora: The Delos Synagogue Reconsidered,\\" Monika Tr√ºmper Hesperia, Vol. 73, No. 4 (Oct. - Dec., 2004), pp. 513‚Äì598 Mormon apologist William J. Adams cites archaeologist Lee I. Levine in suggesting that synagogues did in fact exist before the Babylonian captivity, though in a different form. Other anachronisms Craig L. Blomberg has pointed out several verses in the Book Mormon apparently similar to biblical verses in the King James version of the Bible. According to Blomberg, includes overt references to , , , and were most likely written with their direct influence in mind. Furthermore, Blomberg claims that contains allusions to . Blomberg summarizes his overall position on Book of Mormon anachronisms as follows: \\"Indeed, the entire Book of Mormon abounds with explicit references to Christ, to his life and ministry and to the three persons of the Godhead long before New Testament times ... even though none of these concepts or terms ever appear in these forms in the Old Testament or any other ancient Jewish literature.\\" Chiasmus Chiasmus is a form of rhetorical parallelism wherein key ideas familiar to the reader are inverted, usually for some kind of emphasis. Chiasmus appears in many languages, including English,Chiasmus appears in Shakespeare: Romeo (lines 175‚Äì76, lines 175‚Äì82, lines 159‚Äì70)Davis, William L. \\"Better a Witty Fool Than a Foolish Wit: The Art of Shakespeare's Chiasmus.\\" Text and Performance Quarterly 23 (2003): 311-30 Ugaritic, Biblical Hebrew,More Than Cake: Chiastic Structures in the Scripture. Aramaic, Greek,, Latin.Chiasms have been identified in Cicero's oration Pro Archia Poeta and Seneca the Younger, Thyestes and Ancient K'iche' Maya. It is found in the Bible and other ancient Middle Eastern poetry. Book of Mormon Examples of chiasmus can be found in the Book of Mormon. Some have argued chiasmus is evidence of the text's historical authenticity, suggesting it reflects the Semitic background of Nephi and other authors of the Book of Mormon. They claim that such findings support claims of Hebrew origins in the text on the basis that chiasmus is often found in Hebrew texts such as the Bible. In 1969, John W. Welch discovered a variety of instances of chiasmus in the Book of Mormon and along with his discovery came attention to the phenomenon. The most commonly cited example of chiasmus in the Book of Mormon is the prophet Alma's religious experience, as recorded in . Welch claims that it is unlikely, although not impossible,John W. Welch, \\"How Much Was Known about Chiasmus in 1829 When the Book of Mormon Was Translated?,\\" FARMS Review 15/1 (2003): 47‚Äì80. that Smith knew about chiasmus at the time of the Book of Mormon's publication, which implies that chiasmus could only be present in the text if indeed the text is a translation and not a fabrication. Others argue that chiasmus is not necessarily evidence of Hebrew origin.Robert Patterson, \\"Hebraicisms, Chiasmus, and Other Internal Evidence for Ancient Authorship in Green Eggs and Ham\\", Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, vol. 33, no. 4, Winter 2000, p. 163. Still others disagree on the extent to which chiasmus occurs in the text. With regard to the Alma chapter 36 chiasmus, one critic alleges that Welch \\"fashioned a chiasm by selecting elements from repetitious language, creatively labeling elements, ignoring text, pairing unbalanced elements, and even including asymmetrical elements\\".Earl M. Wunderli, \\"Critique of Alma 36 as an Extended Chiasm\\", Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought. Welch himself offers the following caution regarding a tendency of enthusiastic readers to see chiasmus where it is not actually present: > Some people, of course, have gone overboard with this search, and caution > must be employed; otherwise, it is possible to find chiasmus in the > telephone book, and the effort becomes meaningless . ... One must be careful > in this quest, however, to avoid the problems of the 'hammer syndrome'‚Äîto > the person holding a hammer, everything looks like a nail. To the person who > knows only chiasmus and no other form of literary composition, everything > may start looking like a chiasm. Hugh W. Pinnock, an LDS Church general authority, stated: > Because the study of Hebrew writing forms in the Book of Mormon can > strengthen testimony and be quite exciting, a number of researchers and > laypersons have become overly enthusiastic, much to the detriment of the > subject and integrity of their studies.Hugh Pinnock, \\"Finding Biblical > Hebrew and Other Ancient Literary Forms in the Book of Mormon,\\" Foundation > for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (1999): 11. Critics argue that there is no correlation between the appearance of chiasmus and the authenticity of the Book of Mormon because, among other things, chiasmus appears in many languages including eighteenth- and nineteenth- century English literature. Occurrence in other LDS scriptures Some claim writings in the form of chiasmus can also be found in the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price, two other works of scripture in the LDS canon that were dictated by Smith.Possible chiasmus in other LDS scripture: , , , and . Critics believe this supports their claim that Smith knew about chiasmus, and that it may have been a characteristic of his personal writing style. Apologists argue these examples should be considered a type of sporadic repetition rather than the full-fledged chiasmus that is claimed to be found in . Charles G. Kroupa and Richard C. Shipp are notable for publishing arguments for chiasmus in the Doctrine and Covenants in 1972.. In 1975, Shipp also produced a masters thesis titled, \\"Conceptual Patterns of Repetition in the Doctrine and Covenants and Their Implications\\" claiming that writings found in the Doctrine and Covenants had literary patterns similar to chiasmus.. In 2004, a study was published by LDS researchers which used statistical analysis to determine the likelihood that a chiastic structure in LDS works appeared by chance as opposed to being created deliberately. Mathematical formulas were used to calculate a set of probabilities that provided the ability to distinguish between strong and weak chiastic structures.. The authors concluded: > Based on these estimates, we conclude that the likelihood is high that > chiastic structure appeared by design in the Pentateuch and in the Book of > Mormon. Our estimates do not support such a conclusion for the Doctrine and > Covenants [or] the Book of Abraham ... indicating instead that chiasms could > have appeared in these works by chance.. Other works containing chiasmus Chiastic patterns have also been found in the Book of the Law of the Lord, a purported translation of an ancient text by James J. Strang. This book is not considered authentic by most Latter Day Saints. Critics point out that the presence of chiasmus in Strang's writing as well as in the literature of other cultures implies that the source could be non-Hebrew. Additionally, they claim that the examination of a post- translation text might make identifying chiasmus in the original language difficult, and that the presence of chiasmus is not necessarily indicative of ancient origins.See Ancient Chiasmus Studied (scroll to p 147) or Chiasmus and the Book of Mormon. Stylometry (wordprint studies)=Statistical analysis Stylometry is a method of statistical analysis used to determine authorship of various texts. It has been used to analyze disputed works of Shakespeare, contrast books of the Bible, identify the authors of twelve disputed Federalist Papers, and compare styles of various authors such as Jane Austen. In 1980, researchers at Brigham Young University used stylometric techniques they called \\"wordprint analysis\\" to examine the possible authors of the Book of Mormon. They reached the conclusion that none of the Book of Mormon selections they studied resembled writings of any of the suggested nineteenth-century authors, including Joseph Smith. Jerald and Sandra Tanner challenged these findings on various points, most notably questioning the reliability of the data sources used and the methodology of the \\"wordprint analysis.\\" Additionally, D. James Croft wrote in Sunstone that there were several flaws in the methodology that were vulnerable to criticism.D. James Croft, \\"Book Of Mormon 'Wordprints' Reexamined\\", Sunstone, March 1981, vol. 6:2, pp. 15‚Äì22. A more sophisticated approach was taken by Mormon researcher John Hilton and his non-LDS colleagues at Berkeley, who \\"went to great pains to immunize the methodology from criticism\\" through the use of control tests.Kevin L. Barney, \\"Reflections on the Documentary Hypothesis\\", Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, vol. 33, no. 1, Spring 2000, p. 85. The Berkeley group first used a variety of control tests with non-disputed authors (e.g., works by Mark Twain, and translated works from German) in an effort to: # Demonstrate the persistence of wordprints despite an author's effort to write as a different \\"character\\", and # Demonstrate that wordprints were not obliterated by translation (e.g., two different authors rendered by the same translator would still have different wordprints). Hilton concluded that, if wordprinting is a valid technique, then this analysis suggests that it is \\"statistically indefensible\\" to claim that Smith, Oliver Cowdery, or Solomon Spalding wrote the 30,000 words in the Book of Mormon attributed to Nephi and Alma.. One prominent Mormon scholar, John A. Tvedtnes, has rejected the use of wordprint evidence as the foundation for a testimony of the Book of Mormon's validity, though he did not dismiss its possible usefulness as a scientific tool to investigate the book's origins.. Upon review of the Berkeley study, another scholar, Kevin L. Barney, remains unconvinced of the validity of wordprint analysis: > I have always felt that the basis assumptions underlying Book of Mormon > wordprint studies are faulty. I concur with the assessment of John Tvedtnes, > who points out that (1) an English translation should reflect the language > of the translator rather than the original author, and (2) the particles > used in wordprint studies (such as \\"of\\") are often non-existent in Hebrew, > which tends to use syntax to express the meaning of English particles. However, in the same article, Barney confessed, \\"I frankly do not understand the statistics well enough to offer a useful critique of the studies.\\" In a peer-reviewed study using a traditional authorship method and a new pattern- classification technique, several researchers at Stanford University concluded that Sidney Rigdon, Solomon Spalding, and Oliver Cowdery were more likely to have written the book out of a pool of authors that also included Parley P. Pratt and two statistical control authors (Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and Joel Barlow). Smith was not included in the pool of authors because a set of original works written by Smith alone could not be identified with confidence.Jockers, M. L., D. M. Witten, and C. S. Criddle, 2008. \\"Reassessing authorship of the Book of Mormon using delta and nearest shrunken centroid classification\\". Literary and Linguistic Computing (2008) 23(4): 465‚Äì91. However, this study only examined the relative likelihood of the five above- mentioned authors writing the Book of Mormon, not the possibility of an author or authors outside the five-person pool.Life On Gold Plates: A New Book of Mormon Wordprint Analysis. Another study was published in the same journal that critiqued the methodology used in the earlier study and, using Smith's personal writings written in his own handwriting, concluded that stylometric evidence supports neither Smith nor a Spalding‚ÄìRigdon authorship.Schaalje, G. Bruce, Paul J. Fields, Matthew Roper, Gregory L. Snow. \\"Extended nearest shrunken centroid classification: A new method for open-set authorship attribution of texts of varying sizes\\", Literary and Linguistic Computing (2011). Proper names=Hebrew names Apologists note that many of the proper names in the Book of Mormon are Hebrew names found in the Bible (e.g., \\"Lehi\\", \\"Lemuel\\", \\"Ammon\\", and \\"Enos\\"). Tvedtnes, Gee and Roper argue that there are a number of Hebrew names found in the Book of Mormon which do not appear in the Bible but occur in other ancient sources. Examples of these are \\"Aha\\", \\"Ammonihah\\", \\"Chemish\\", \\"Hagoth\\", \\"Himni\\", \\"Isabel\\", \\"Jarom\\", \\"Josh\\", \\"Luram\\", \\"Mathoni\\", \\"Mathonihah\\", \\"Muloki\\", and \\"Sam\\". Hugh Nibley also states that many non-biblical names found in the Book of Mormon resemble words from ancient Hebrew (e.g., \\"Sariah\\", \\"Jarom\\", and \\"Josh\\").Since Cumorah, pp. 171, Nibley discusses non-biblical Hebrew names present in the Book of Mormon. Some names, like \\"Alma\\", are attested Hebrew names. Milton R. Hunter and Thomas Ferguson allege that Hebraic fragments and roots appear discernible in Nephite/Mulekite names such as \\"Zarahemla\\".Milton R. Hunter and Thomas Stewart Ferguson, Ancient America and the Book of Mormon, pp. 151‚Äì52. These names are often interpreted as evidence in favor of the Book of Mormon, since Smith's knowledge of Hebrew was limited to names found in the Bible. Critics have pointed out that many of the names in the Book of Mormon that are not drawn from the King James Bible are found in the local environment around Palmyra, New York, and would have been known to Smith..A Linguist Looks at Mormonism, More on Book of Mormon Names Richard Packham has pointed out that several Biblical Hebrew names, including \\"Aaron\\", \\"Ephraim\\", and \\"Levi\\" are listed as Jaredites in the Book of Ether. He argues that these are anachronisms, since the Jaredites are supposed to have originated from the time of the Tower of Babel, and presumably did not speak Hebrew.Packham, Richard. \\"A Linguist Looks at Mormonism\\". April 30, 2007. Mesoamerican names Mormon archaeologist Bruce W. Warren has noted that some Jaredite names may have become a part of later Nephite culture, suggesting that there may have been survivors or refugees of the great Jaredite battle besides Coriantumr. He cites the names \\"Kib\\", \\"Kish\\", \\"Shule\\", and \\"Com\\" as examples of Jaredite names that are similar to names found in ancient Mesoamerica. Egyptian names John Gee, John A. Tvedtnes, and Hugh Nibley argue that some Book of Mormon names appear to be Egyptian. Tvedtnes, Gee, and Roper note that William F. Albright considered the names \\"Paanchi\\" and \\"Pahoran\\" to be Egyptian names. In his book Lehi in the Desert, Nibley compares names found in the Book of Mormon with ancient Egyptian names from Upper Egypt. The comparisons show that many names in the Book of Mormon are similar to names in a certain region and era of ancient Egypt. Nibley postulates that names do not match exactly due to the process of metathesis. Parallels drawn by Nibley between Egyptian names and Book of Mormon names include \\"Paanchi\\" and \\"Pahoran\\", and further include several others including \\"Korihor\\" (Kherihor, a high priest at Thebes) and \\"Morianton\\" (Meriaton, an Egyptian prince),Lehi in the Desert, p. 27. His source for the Egyptian name is Hermann Ranke, Die Agyptischen Personennamen [\\"The Egyptian Personal Names\\"], Gluckstadt: Augustin, 1935. and \\"Ammon\\" (Amun, the most common name in ancient Egypt).Lehi in the Desert, pp. 25‚Äì31. Thomas Finley has disagreed with these claims.Finley, Thomas, \\"Does the Book of Mormon Reflect a Near Eastern Background\\", in Beckwith, Mosser and Owen, New Mormon Challenge: Responding to the Latest Defenses of a Fast-Growing Movement, Zondervan, 2002. Critics claim that the parallels drawn by Nibley and others ignore the possibility of simple coincidence and lack a defined methodology for assessing the importance of the parallels. Tvetdnes and Roper responded by noting that there are too many coincidences for such an assessment to be credible. Smith, in a letter written in 1843 to the Mormon publication Millennial Star, wrote that the name \\"Mormon\\" came from \\"the Egyptian Mon, hence with the addition of more, or the contraction, mor, we have the word Mormon, which means, literally, more good.\\"Gallacher, Stuart A, \\"Mormon: An example of folk etymology\\", Western Folklore, vol. 8, no. 1, January 1949, p. 23. Benjamin Urrutia suggests the name \\"Mormon\\" is derived from Egyptian \\"mor\\" (\\"love\\") and mon (\\"firmly established\\"), rendering \\"Mormon\\" as \\"love is firmly established.\\"Benjamin Urrutia, \\"The Name Connection,\\" New Era, June 1983, p. 39. Packham criticizes Smith's interpretation, stating that the English word \\"more\\" or \\"mor\\" is out of place in an Egyptian name.Packham, Richard. \\"A Linguist Looks at Mormonism: Notes on linguistics problems in Mormonism\\". Greek names Smith stated in a letter to the editor of Times and Seasons, \\"there was no Greek or Latin upon the plates from which I, through the grace of the Lord, translated the Book of Mormon.\\"Times and Seasons, vol.4, no. 13 (May 15, 1843) p. 194. Brian D. Stubbs has stated that though the language of the Mulekites isn't put forward in the Book of Mormon, it could have consisted of Phoenician, Greek, or Arabic.. Richard Packham has pointed out that the Book of Mormon contains some Greek and Latin names, some of which are hellenizations of Hebrew names (e.g., \\"Antipas\\", \\"Archeantus\\", \\"Esrom\\", \\"Ezias\\", \\"Judea\\", and \\"Zenos\\") and some of which are Greek or Latin.A Linguist Looks at Mormonism, More Greek Names.

Word choice in translation The mechanics of the method by which the Book of Mormon was claimed to have been translated have been examined by various scholars in order to determine how words were chosen. Various accounts from witnesses to the translation process exist, including David Whitmer and Martin Harris, two of the Three Witnesses. Statements of the exact methods used in translation vary depending upon the account. A number of these accounts were written many years after the events occurred. Method of translation LDS Church authorities do not claim to know the exact method by which translation and word choice was accomplished. In an address given in 1992 at a seminar for new mission presidents at the Missionary Training Center, church apostle Russell M. Nelson stated that \\"[t]he details of this miraculous method of translation are still not fully known.\\" In order to illustrate this, Nelson quoted the words Whitmer, who wrote regarding the use of a seer stone in the translation process over 50 years after it had occurred, > Joseph Smith would put the seer stone into a hat, and put his face in the > hat, drawing it closely around his face to exclude the light; and in the > darkness the spiritual light would shine. A piece of something resembling > parchment would appear, and on that appeared the writing. One character at a > time would appear, and under it was the interpretation in English. Brother > Joseph would read off the English to Oliver Cowdery, who was his principal > scribe, and when it was written down and repeated to Brother Joseph to see > if it was correct, then it would disappear, and another character with the > interpretation would appear. Thus the Book of Mormon was translated by the > gift and power of God, and not by any power of man.David Whitmer, \\"An > Address to All Believers in Christ\\", Richmond, Missouri: n.p., 1887, p. 12. Nelson also noted statements made by Smith's wife Emma, who gave her account of the translation method in 1856: > When my husband was translating the Book of Mormon, I wrote a part of it, as > he dictated each sentence, word for word, and when he came to proper names > he could not pronounce, or long words, he spelled them out, and while I was > writing them, if I made any mistake in spelling, he would stop me and > correct my spelling although it was impossible for him to see how I was > writing them down at the time. Even the word Sarah he could not pronounce at > first, but had to spell it, and I would pronounce it for him.(Edmund C. > Briggs, \\"A Visit to Nauvoo in 1856\\", Journal of History, January 1916, p. > 454.) Martin Harris (as quoted by Edward Stevenson in the Deseret News in 1881) described the translation process as follows: > By aid of the seer stone, sentences would appear and were read by the > Prophet . ... [W]hen finished [Smith] would say \\"Written,\\" and if correctly > written that sentence would disappear and another appear in its place, but > if not written correctly it remained until corrected, so that the > translation was just as it was engraven on the plates, precisely in the > language then used.Edward Stevenson, \\"One of the Three Witnesses,\\" reprinted > from Deseret News, 30 November 1881 in Millennial Star, 44 (6 February > 1882): 86‚Äì87. Word substitution One challenge in performing a linguistic analysis of the Book of Mormon is that no original text is available for analysis; only handwritten printers' copies transcribed from the original handwritten copies of the original English text, and a few pages of the original translation produced by Smith are available. As with any translation, the influence of the translator is inextricably part of the translated text in matters of word choice. Some Mormon scholars have theorized that when words are found in the Book of Mormon that seem anachronistic, or that refer to items not known to have existed in the pre-Columbian Americas during the period of time covered by the Book of Mormon (e.g., horse, elephant, chicken, cattle, swine, barley, bull, calf, and hilt), these words could be an approximation \\"in translation\\" to things that did exist in pre-Columbian America. One common criticism of the authenticity of the Book of Mormon is the belief that, if the accounts of the translation process are accurate, then there is very little room for error in the word choices used in the translation of the Book of Mormon (since each word was believed to be divinely approved and could not be written incorrectly). In other words, \\"steel\\" must mean steel, \\"hilt\\" must mean hilt, \\"elephant\\" must mean elephant, and so forth. However, as Whitmer was never directly involved in the translation and Harris was involved for only a brief period of time, Mormon apologists consider it unlikely that either of these accounts is as accurate as the accounts of Smith and Cowdery. Grammar Several critics have pointed to grammatical errors in the Early Modern English style of the Book of Mormon and made the argument that because the original manuscript, the printer's manuscript, and the first edition of the Book of Mormon appear to have contained hundreds of grammatical errors, the book was therefore fabricated by Smith and not divinely inspired.Perry Benjamin Pierce, 1899, \\"The Origin of the 'Book of Mormon'\\", American Anthropologist n.s. 1:675‚Äì94. Examples include (standard citations given): * \\"Adam and Eve, which was our first parents\\" (1 Nephi 5:11) * \\"And this he done that he might subject them to him\\" (Alma 2:10) * \\"that they did not fight against God no more\\" (Alma 23:7) * \\"thou remembereth the twelve apostles of the Lamb\\" (1 Nephi 12:9) * \\"and I have not written but a small part of the things I saw\\" (1 Nephi 14:28) * \\"therefore they did not look unto the Lord as they had ought\\" (1 Nephi 15:3) * \\"and the words of Amulek which was declared unto the people\\" (Alma 9 (preface)) * \\"Now the object of these lawyers were to get gain\\" (Alma 10:32) * 2 Nephi 1:30‚Äì32, Lehi speaks to Zoram: \\"And now, Zoram, I speak unto you: Behold, thou art the servant of Laban ... if ye shall keep the commandments of the Lord, the Lord hath consecrated this land for the security of thy seed with the seed of my son.\\" You/ye are plural pronouns and thou/thy are singular pronouns, but the text switches back and forth between them. * 2 Nephi 3:1, Lehi says: \\"And now I speak unto you, Joseph, my last-born. Thou wast born in the wilderness of mine afflictions ...\\" You is incorrectly used when addressing a single individual. * Mosiah 2:19‚Äì20, King Benjamin says: \\"O how you ought to thank your heavenly King! ... if you should render all the thanks and praise\\". You is the object form of the second person plural pronoun; ye is the subject form, but the object form is incorrectly used in subject position here and also in dozens of other places throughout the text. Apologist Stanford Carmack has responded to this issue by providing evidence of Early Modern English usage of the above forms: \\"many ostensibly defective forms reflect usage from earlier stages of the English language. Most of these are clearly attested in the textual record of EModE and even late ME‚Äîsome frequently, some rarely. ... BofM language is, generally speaking, only nonstandard from our standpoint, centuries after the Elizabethan era, which appears to be the epicenter of the book's syntax.\\" LDS Church apostle George A. Smith responded to this issue: \\"[when] the Lord reveals anything to men He reveals it in language that accords with their own. If any of you were to converse with an angel, and you used strictly grammatical language he would do the same. But if you used two negatives in a sentence the heavenly messenger would use language to correspond with your understanding, and this very objection to the Book of Mormon is an evidence in its favor.\\"Journal of Discourses 12:335 (15 November 1868). Parallelomania Critics of Book of Mormon linguistic studies often reject the claims of Mormon scholars on the grounds that the parallels they draw between Book of Mormon and other sources amounts to \\"parallelomania\\", which is defined as the \\"over use or improper use of parallels in the exposition of a text.\\" One researcher, Douglas F. Salmon, alleged that Mormon scholars' work in drawing parallels between the Book of Mormon and other sources fits this classification.Salmon, Douglas F., \\"Parallelomania and the Study of Latter-day Saint Scripture: Confirmation, Coincidence, or the Collective Unconscious?\\", Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, volume 33, number 2, Summer 2000, p. 131. Salmon notes: > There has been an exegetical trend during the last several decades to draw > endless parallels to text from the ancient Near East and beyond in an > attempt to validate the writings in the Book of Mormon and Pearl of Great > Price. The pioneer and leader in this effort has been the great LDS scholar > Hugh Nibley. In recent years the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon > Studies (FARMS) has continued this legacy. The number of parallels that > Nibley has been able to uncover from amazingly disparate and arcane sources > is truly staggering. Unfortunately, there seems to be a neglect of any > methodological reflection or articulation in this endeavor. Salmon also notes that Nibley was a critic of parallelomania where it is used to disparage the Book of Mormon, despite his extensive scholarship on the subject in defense of the Book of Mormon, noting that Nibley \\"ignores\\" the fact that parallels may suggest a unity of religious thought, or simple coincidence. He also goes on to demonstrate several instances where Nibley misrepresented the parallels and jumped to conclusions regarding the significance of his examples. Salmon's analysis of Nibley was itself later critiqued in a response to his article from William Hamblin of FARMS.William J. Hamblin, \\"Joseph or Jung? A Response to Douglas Salmon\\" , FARMS Review, volume 13, issue 2. Among other things, Hamblin criticized Salmon for critiquing a few weakly supported parallels made by Nibley while ignoring both much more strongly supported parallels made by Nibley and \\"a broader analysis\\" of Nibley's arguments.

These oysters have a strong inner shell layer composed of nacre, also known as \\"mother of pearl\\". Pearl oysters are not closely related to either the edible oysters of family Ostreidae or the freshwater pearl mussels of the families Unionidae and Margaritiferidae. Pinctada margaritifera and P. maxima are used for culturing South Sea and Tahitian pearls. They are cultured widely primarily in the central and eastern Indo-Pacific. A pearl oyster can be seen on the reverse side of the 1,000-peso note of the Philippines. Species of commercial value Opening and extracting pearls from farmed pearl oysters Cultivated pearl oyster (from Japan Shima, Mie) All species within the genus produce pearls. Attempts have been made to harvest pearls commercially from many Pinctada species. However, the only species that are currently of significant commercial interest are: * Gulf pearl oyster, Pinctada radiata; Persian Gulf, Red Sea, Mediterranean Sea and throughout the Indo-Pacific as far as Japan and Australia. * Black-lip oyster, Pinctada margaritifera; Persian Gulf and southwestern part of Indian Ocean; Fiji; Tahiti; Myanmar; Baja California; Gulf of Mexico * Gold-lip oyster, Pinctada maxima; Australia; Fiji; Tahiti; * White-lip oyster, Pinctada maxima; Australia; Fiji; Tahiti; Myanmar; * Pinctada mazatlanica; Mexico; Panama; * Akoya pearl oyster, Pinctada fucata (also called P. imbricata), Red Sea; Sri Lanka; Persian Gulf; Indian Ocean; Western Pacific Ocean; Australia; China; Venezuela; * Shark Bay pearl oyster Pinctada albina; Australia The various species of Pinctada produce different maximum sizes and colors of pearls, depending on the size of the species and the natural color of the nacre inside the shell. Black South Sea pearls, or Tahitian pearls come from the black-lip oyster; white and golden South Sea pearls from the white-lip and golden-lip oysters; and Akoya cultured pearls from Pinctada fucata martensii, the Akoya pearl oyster. Pearls are also obtained in commercial quantities from some species of the closely related winged oyster genus Pteria. Pearls are also produced from freshwater mussel species unrelated to pearl oysters. These freshwater species include Hyriopsis cumingii, Hyriopsis schlegelii, and a hybrid of the two species. At danger from the large demand for pearls, the typical lifespan of a pearl oyster is usually around 3 years to 14 years. Pinctada maxima are seeded at about 2 years of age and take 2 years to fully develop a pearl. They can be reseeded up to 3 or 4 times. Akoya pearls are harvested after about 9 to 16 months. Research carried out by biologist Aldemaro Romero Jr. allowed him to discover that the first animal population depleted by Europeans in the American continent was a pearl oyster species (Pinctada imbricata) off the coast of Venezuela. He analyzed historical records and used information about the biology of these and other species to explain its rapid disappearance.

Its most famous holders are the House of Percy (alias Perci), who were the most powerful noble family in Northern England for much of the Middle Ages. The heirs of the Percys, via a female line, were ultimately made Duke of Northumberland in 1766, and continue to hold the earldom as a subsidiary title. History=Percy family William de Percy, 1st Baron Percy, who came from the village of Percy in Normandy, was in the train of William I. After arriving in England following the Harrying of the North (1069‚Äì70), he was bestowed modest estates in Yorkshire by Hugh d'Avranches. However, by the reign of Henry II the family was represented by only an heiress, Agnes de Percy (died 1203) following the death of the third feudal baron. As her dowry contained the manor of Topcliffe in Yorkshire, Adeliza of Louvain, the widowed and remarried second wife of Henry I, arranged the marriage of Agnes with her own young half-brother, Joscelin of Louvain. After their wedding, the nobleman from the Duchy of Brabant in the Holy Roman Empire settled in England. He adopted the surname Percy and his descendants were later created Earls of Northumberland. The Percys' line would go on to play a large role in the history of both England and Scotland. As nearly every Percy was a Warden of the Marches, Scottish affairs were often of more concern than those in England.Northumberland Yesterday and To-day by Jean F. Terry, 1913, from Project Gutenberg =1309: 1st Baron Percy= In 1309, Henry de Percy, 1st Baron Percy purchased Alnwick Castle from Antony Bek, Bishop of Durham. The castle had been founded in the late 11th century by Ivo de Vesci, a Norman nobleman from Vassy, Calvados in Normandy. A descendant of Ivo de Vesci, John de Vesci, succeeded to his father's titles and estates upon his father's death in Gascony in 1253. These included the barony of Alnwick and a large property in Northumberland and considerable estates in Yorkshire, including Malton. Due to being under age, King Henry III of England conferred the wardship of John's estates to a foreign kinsman, which caused great offence to the de Vesci family. The family's property and estates had been put into the guardianship of Bek, who sold them to the Percys. From this time, the fortunes of the Percys, although they still held their Yorkshire lands and titles, were linked permanently with Alnwick and its castle. =1316: 2nd Baron Percy= Henry de Percy, 2nd Baron Percy, who was granted the lands of Patrick IV, Earl of March, in Northumberland, by Edward II in 1316, began to improve the size and defences of the castle. He was appointed to Edward III's Council in 1327 and was given the manor and castle of Skipton. Was granted, by Edward III, the castle and barony of Warkworth in 1328. He was at the siege of Dunbar and the Battle of Halidon Hill and was subsequently appointed constable of Berwick- upon-Tweed. In 1346, Henry commanded the right wing of the English Army which defeated a larger Scottish force at the Battle of Neville's Cross. His son, Henry de Percy, 3rd Baron Percy married Mary of Lancaster, an aunt of John of Gaunt's wife Blanche of Lancaster. 1377 creation 17th-century Percy Window in Petworth House, Sussex, displaying in stained glass 9 heraldic escutcheons of quartered arms of 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, father of 7th & 8th, 7th, 8th & 9th Percy Earls of Northumberland, each impaling the quartered arms of his wife. In 1377, the next Henry Percy was created Earl of Northumberland, which title he was given after the coronation of Richard II. Nor was this all, for he was that Northumberland whose doings in the next reign fill so large a part of Shakespeare's Henry IV, and he was the father of the most famous Percy of all, Henry Percy the fifth, better known as \\"Hotspur\\". Hotspur never became Earl of Northumberland, having been slain at Shrewsbury in the lifetime of his father, whose estates were forfeited under attainder on account of the rebellion of himself and his son against King Henry IV. 1416 creation Henry V restored Hotspur's son, the second Earl, to his family honours, and the Percys were staunch Lancastrians during the Wars of the Roses which followed, the third Earl and three of his brothers losing their lives in the cause. The fourth Earl was involved in the political manoeuvrings of the last Yorkist kings Edward IV and Richard III. Through either indecision or treachery he did not respond in a timely manner at the Battle of Bosworth Field, and thus helped cause his ally Richard III's defeat at the hands of Henry Tudor (who became Henry VII). In 1489, he was pulled from his horse and murdered by some of his tenants. The fifth Earl displayed magnificence in his tastes, and being one of the richest magnates of his day, kept a very large household establishment. Henry Percy, the sixth Earl of Northumberland, loved Anne Boleyn, and was her accepted suitor before Henry VIII married her. He married later to Mary Talbot, the daughter of the Earl of Shrewsbury, but as he died without a son, his nephew Thomas Percy became the seventh Earl. Thereafter, a succession of plots and counterplots‚Äîthe Rising of the North, the plots to liberate Mary Queen of Scots, and the Gunpowder Plot ‚Äì each claimed a Percy among their adherents. On this account the eighth and ninth Earls spent many years in the Tower, but the tenth Earl, Algernon, fought against King Charles in the Civil War, the male line of the Percy- Louvain house ending with Josceline, the eleventh Earl. The heiress to the vast Percy estates married the Duke of Somerset; and her granddaughter married a Yorkshire knight, Sir Hugh Smithson, who in 1766 was created the first Duke of Northumberland and Earl Percy, and it is their descendants who now represent the famous old house. The current duke lives at Alnwick Castle and Syon House, just outside London.

Henry I Sinclair, Earl of Orkney, Lord of Roslin ( 1345 1400) was a Scottish and a Norwegian nobleman. Sinclair held the title Earl of Orkney (which refers to Nor√∞reyjar rather than just the islands of Orkney) under the King of Norway. He was sometimes identified by another spelling of his surname, St. Clair. He was the grandfather of William Sinclair, 1st Earl of Caithness, the builder of Rosslyn Chapel. He was best known today because of a modern legend that he took part in explorations of Greenland and North America almost 100 years before Christopher Columbus. William Thomson, in his book The New History of Orkney,William P.L. Thomson,The New History of Orkney (Edinburgh: Birlinn, 2008). wrote: \\"It has been Earl Henry's singular fate to enjoy an ever-expanding posthumous reputation which has very little to do with anything he achieved in his lifetime.\\" Biography Henry Sinclair was the son and heir of William Sinclair, Lord of Roslin, and his wife Isabella (Isobel) of Strathearn.Crawford, Barbara E. William Sinclair, Earl Of Orkney, and His Family: A Study In The Politics Of Survival in Stringer, K. J. 'Essays on the Nobility of Medieval Scotland' Edinburgh: John Donald Publishers, 2004. . p. 234. Retrieved 27 February 2013. She was a daughter of Maol √çsa, Jarl of Orkney. Henry Sinclair's maternal grandfather had been deprived of much of his lands (the earldom of Strathearn being completely lost to the King of Scots). Sometime after 13 September 1358, Henry's father died, at which point Henry Sinclair succeeded as Baron of Roslin, Pentland and Cousland, a group of minor properties in Lothian. Although the Norwegian Jarldom of Orkney was not an inheritable position, successive appointments had operated as if it had been. After a vacancy lasting 18 years, three cousins ‚Äì Alexander de L'Arde, Lord of Caithness; Malise Sparre, Lord of Skaldale; and Henry Sinclair ‚Äì were rivals for the succession. Initially trialling de L'Arde as Captain of Orkney, King Haakon VI of Norway was quickly disappointed in de L'Arde's behaviour, and sacked him. On 2 August 1379, at Marstrand, near T√∏nsberg, Norway, Haakon chose Sinclair over Sparre, investing Sinclair with the Jarldom or Earldom in the Peerage of Scotland. In return Henry pledged to pay a fee of 1000 nobles before St. Martin's Day (11 November), and, when called upon, serve the king on Orkney or elsewhere with 100 fully armed men for 3 months. It is unknown if Haakon VI ever attempted to call upon the troops pledged by Henry or if any of the fee was actually paid. As security for upholding the agreement the new jarl left hostages behind when he departed Norway for Orkney. Shortly before his death in summer 1380, the king permitted the hostages to return home. In 1389, Sinclair attended the hailing of King Eric in Norway, pledging his oath of fealty. Historians have speculated that in 1391 Sinclair and his troops slew Malise Sparre near Scalloway, Tingwall parish, Shetland. It is not known when Henry Sinclair died. The Sinclair Diploma, written or at least commissioned by his grandson states: \\"...he retirit to the parts of Orchadie and josit them to the latter tyme of his life, and deit Erile of Orchadie, and for the defence of the country was slain there cruellie by his enemiis...\\" We also know that sometime in 1401: \\"The English invaded, burnt and spoiled certain islands of Orkney.\\" This was part of an English retaliation for a Scottish attack on an English fleet near Aberdeen. The assumption is that Henry either died opposing this invasion, or was already dead. Henri Santo Claro (Henry St. Clair) signed a charter from King Robert III in January 1404. It is supposed that he died shortly after that although his son did not take the title until 1412. Therefore, he died somewhere between 1404 and 1412, killed in an attack on Orkney, possibly by English seamen.Charter of King Robert III January 1404 Marriage and issue Henry I Sinclair, Earl of Orkney, married Jean Haliburton, daughter of Sir Walter de Haliburton, 1st Lord Haliburton of Dirleton, and had issue: *Henry II Sinclair, Earl of Orkney (c. 1375-1422), m.

David Menzies of Menzies, and Weem Fringe theories In the 1980s, modern alternative histories of Earl Henry I Sinclair and Rosslyn Chapel began to be published. Popular books (often derided as pseudo- history) such as The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail by Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh and Henry Lincoln (1982) and The Temple and the Lodge by Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh (1989) appeared. Books by Timothy Wallace-Murphy and Andrew Sinclair soon followed from the early 1990s onwards. The alleged voyage to North America Guysborough, Nova Scotia One of the most common theories about Sinclair is that he was one of the first Europeans to visit North America in a voyage pre-dating Columbus. In 1784, he was identified by Johann Reinhold ForsterJohann Reinhold Forster, History of the Voyages and Discoveries Made in the North, Printed for G.G.J. and J. Robinson, London, 1786 as possibly being the Prince Zichmni described in letters allegedly written around the year 1400 by the Zeno brothers of Venice, in which they describe a voyage throughout the North Atlantic under the command of Zichmni.T. J. Oleson, \\"ZENO, NICOL√í,\\" in Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 1, University of Toronto/Universit√© Laval, 2003‚Äì, accessed October 1, 2014 The authenticity of the letters (which were allegedly rediscovered and published in the early 16th century) are challenged by historians. Most regard the letters (and the accompanying map) as a hoax by the Zenos or their publishers. Moreover, the identification of Zichmni as Henry Sinclair has not been accepted by most historians, although it is taken for granted by the supporters of the theory. Some supporters of the theory contend that there are stone carvings of American plants in Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland.Knight & Lomas, The Hiram Key: Pharaohs, Freemasonry, and The Discovery of The Secret Scrolls of Jesus (London: Century, 1996 ).Timothy Wallace-Murphy, Marilyn Hopkins, Templars In America: From The Crusades To The New World (Red Wheel/Weiser, 2004 ). The Chapel was built by Henry Sinclair's grandson William Sinclair and was completed in 1486. Columbus made his first voyage in 1492. This is seen by writers Christopher Knight and Robert Lomas as being compelling evidence for the theory that Sinclair had sailed to America, although scholars have said the plants are simply stylised depictions of common European plants.Historian Mark Oxbrow, quoted in \\"The ship of dreams\\" by Diane MaClean, Scotsman.com, 13 May 2005 In addition, some writers such as Native American historian Evan Pritchard have claimed that Glooscap, the spiritual hero figure of the Mi'kmaq people, is in fact a depiction of an early European explorer, most likely Henry Sinclair.Holy Grail in AmericaHistory Channel press release for Holy Grail in America The claim that Henry Sinclair explored North America has been popularised by several other authors, notably by Frederick J. Pohl,Frederick J. Pohl, Prince Henry Sinclair: His Expedition To The New World In 1398 (London: Davis-Poynter, 1974; and published in America by Clarkson Potter, 1974). Andrew Sinclair,Andrew Sinclair, The Sword and the Grail ‚Äì The Story of the Grail, the Templars and the True Discovery of America (New York: Crown Publishers, 1992). Michael Bradley,Michael Bradley Grail Knights of North America: On The Trail of the Grail Legacy in Canada and the United States (Hounslow Press: Toronto, 1998) and his earlier Holy Grail Across the Atlantic: The Secret History of Canadian Discovery and Exploration (Hounslow: 1988) William S. Crooker (who claimed to have discovered Henry Sinclair's castle in Nova Scotia),William S. Crooker Tracking Treasure ‚Äì In Search of East Coast Bounty (Halifax, N.S., Nimbus, 1998). Steven Sora,Steven Sora, The Lost Colony of The Templars: Verrazano's Secret Mission To America (Destiny Books, 2004). and more recently by David Goudsward.David Goudsward, The Westford Knight and Henry Sinclair: Evidence of a 14th Century Scottish Voyage To North America (McFarland & Company, 2010). The claim is based on several separate propositions: #That the letters and map ascribed to the Zeno brothers and published in 1558 are authentic. #That the voyage described in the letters as taken by Zichmni around the year 1398 to Greenland actually reached North America. #That Zichmni is Henry Sinclair. The name \\"Zichmni\\" is either totally fictitious, or quite possibly a transliteration error when converting from handwritten materials to type. Johann Reinhold Forster tried to relate this to the name \\"Sinclair\\", but \\"Prince Sinclair\\" is not normal usage, while \\"Prince of Orkney\\" seems a better fit. Frederick Pohl claimed that the \\"Z\\" could have come from a misreading of the cursive \\"d'O\\" in \\"d'Orkney\\".Adriano Cappelli, Lexicon Abbreviaturarum. Dizionario di abbreviature latine ed italiane, usate nelle arte e codici specialmente del medio-evo, riprodotto con oltre 14,000 segni incisi... Milano, 1949 In addition, the \\"k\\" and \\"y\\" do not appear in Italian, so would need to be represented by other letters ‚Äì \\"ch\\" in Italian is a hard \\"k\\" sound, so might well have been used to represent the \\"k\\".  Alleged Templar connections  Intertwined with the Sinclair voyage story is the claim that Henry Sinclair was a Knight Templar and that the voyage either was sponsored by or conducted on the behalf of the Templars, though the order was suppressed almost half a century before Henry's lifetime. Knight and Lomas speculate that the Knights Templar discovered under the Temple Mount in Jerusalem a royal archive dating from King Solomon's times that stated that Phoenicians from Tyre voyaged to a westerly continent following a star called \\"La Merika\\". According to Knight and Lomas, the Templars learned that to sail to that continent, they had to follow a star by the same name. Sinclair supposedly followed this route.Simon Jenkins, The Guardian, Friday 20 January 2006 The theory also makes use of the supposed Templar connection to explain the name Nova Scotia (\\"New Scotland\\" in Latin). It is based on the 18th- century tale that some Templars escaped the suppression of their order by fleeing to Scotland during the reign of Robert the BruceChristopher Knight & Robert Lomas, The Second Messiah: Templars, the Turin Shroud and the Great Secret of Freemasonry, Fair Winds Press, 2001. and fought in the Battle of Bannockburn.Scotsman.com Heritage & Culture ‚Äì Myths & Mysteries, 10 Nov 2005. Claims persist that Rosslyn Chapel contains Templar imagery. Andrew Sinclair speculates that the grave slab now in the crypt is that of a Templar knight: According to author Robert Lomas, the chapel also has an engraving depicting a knight templar holding the sword over a head of an initiate, supposedly to protect the secrets of the templars. Rosslyn Chapel was built by Sir William St Clair, last St Clair Earl of Orkney, who was the grandson of Henry. According to Lomas, Sir William, the chapel builder, is also the direct ancestor of the first Grand Master of Masons of Scotland, also named William St Clair (Sinclair). According to Lomas, the Sinclairs and their French relatives the St. Clairs were instrumental in creating the Knights Templar. He claims that the founder of Templars Hugh de Payns was married to a sister of the Duke of Champaine (Henri de St. Clair),The claim that Hugues de Payens married Catherine St. Clair was made in Les Dossiers Secrets d'Henri Lobineau (1967), \\"Tableau G√©n√©alogique de Gisors, Guitry, Mareuil et Saint-Clair par Henri Lobineau\\" in Pierre Jarnac, Les Myst√®res de Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau, M√©langes Sulfureux (CERT, 1995). who was a powerful broker of the first Crusade and had the political power to nominate the Pope, and to suggest the idea and empower it to the Pope. However, a biography of Hugues de Payen by Thierry Leroy identifies his wife and the mother of his children as Elizabeth de Chappes. The book draws its information on the marriage from local church cartularies dealing chiefly with the disposition of the Grand Master's properties, the earliest alluding to Elizabeth as his wife in 1113, and others spanning Payen's lifetime, the period following his death and lastly her own death in 1170.Thierry Leroy, Hugues de Payns, chevalier champenois, fondateur de l'ordre des templiers (Troyes: edition de la Maison Boulanger, 1997). Criticisms of this theory One primary criticism of this theory is that if either a Sinclair or a Templar voyage reached the Americas, they did not, unlike Columbus, return with a historical record of their findings. In fact, there is no known published documentation from that era to support the theory that such a voyage took place. The physical evidence relies on speculative reasoning to support the theory, and all of it can be interpreted in other ways. For example, according to one historian, the carvings in Rosslyn Chapel may not be of American plants at all but are nothing more than stylized carvings of wheat and strawberries. Historians Mark Oxbrow, Ian Robertson,\\"The Da Vinci Connection\\", Sunday Herald, 14 November 2004 Karen Ralls and Louise Yeoman have each made it clear that the Sinclair family had no connection with the mediaeval Knights Templar. Karen Ralls has shown that among those testifying against the Templars at their 1309 trial were Henry and William Sinclair ‚Äì an act inconsistent with any alleged support or membership.Karen Ralls, The Templars and the Grail, Quest Books; 1st Quest edition (2003), p.110. ; The Knights Templar in England, p. 200f.Processus factus contra Templarios in Scotia , 1309, being the testimony against the Templars by Henry and William St Clair, translation available in Mark Oxbrow, Ian Robertson, Rosslyn and the Grail, p. 245‚Äì256.

His mother was Mary of Lancaster, daughter of Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster, son of Edmund, Earl of Leicester and Lancaster, who was the son of Henry III. Life Arms of Percy Henry Percy was originally a follower of Edward III of England, for whom he held high offices in the administration of northern England. At a young age, he was made Warden of the Marches towards Scotland in 1362, with the authority to negotiate with the Scottish government. In February 1367, he was entrusted with the supervision of all castles and fortified places in the Scottish marches. He went on to support King Richard II, was formally created an Earl on Richard's coronation in 1377, and was briefly given the title of Marshal of England. Between 1383 and 1384, he was appointed Admiral of the Northern Seas. After Richard elevated his rival Ralph Neville to the position of Earl of Westmorland in 1397, Percy and his son, also Henry and known as \\"Hotspur\\", supported the rebellion of Henry Bolingbroke, who became King as Henry IV. On King Henry IV's coronation, Henry Percy was appointed Constable of England and granted the lordship of the Isle of Man. Percy and Hotspur were given the task of subduing the rebellion of Owain Glynd≈µr, but their attempts to make peace with the Welsh rebels did not meet with the king's approval. Rebellion In September 1402 the Percys took part in the Battle of Homildon Hill, which led to the capture of many Scots nobles. Henry did not want them to be ransomed, leading to another quarrel. In 1403 the Percys turned against Henry IV in favour of Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March, and then conspired with Owain Glynd≈µr against Henry. The Percy rebellion failed at the Battle of Shrewsbury, where Hotspur was killed. Since the earl did not directly participate in the rebellion, he was not convicted of treason. However, he lost his office as Constable. In 1405 all three parties signed the Tripartite Indenture, which divided England up between them. Glynd≈µr was to be given Wales, and a substantial part of the west of England, Northumberland was to have received the north of England, as well as Northamptonshire, Norfolk, Warwickshire, and Leicestershire. The Mortimers were to have received the rest of southern England, below the river Trent.Trevor Royle, The Wars of the Roses; England's First Civil War, Abacus, 2009, p. 95 Later in 1405 Percy supported Richard le Scrope, Archbishop of York, in another rebellion, after which Percy fled to Scotland, and his estates were confiscated by the king. In 1408 Percy invaded England in rebellion once more and was killed at the Battle of Bramham Moor. His severed head was subsequently put on display at London Bridge. Marriages and issue In 1358, he married Margaret Neville (12 February 133912 May 1372), daughter of Ralph Neville, 2nd Baron Neville de Raby, and Alice de Audley. They had four sons (Harry \\"Hotspur\\" Percy, Thomas, Ralph, and Alan) and one daughter (Margaret). Canting arms of Lucy of Cockermouth Castle: Gules, three lucies hauriant argent In 1381, he married Maud Lucy (134318 December 1398), daughter of Sir Thomas de Lucy, 2nd Baron Lucy, and Margaret de Multon, and thus sister and heiress of Anthony Lucy, 3rd Baron Lucy (died 1368), of Cockermouth Castle, Cumbria, which estate he inherited on condition that he and his heirs male should bear the arms of Lucy (Gules, three lucies hauriant argent) quarterly with their own.Daniel Lysons and Samuel Lysons, 'Cockermouth', in Magna Britannia: Volume 4, Cumberland (London, 1816), pp. 40-45 http://www.british-history.ac.uk/magna-britannia/vol4/pp40-45 They had no issue.  In literature and media  Northumberland is a major character in Shakespeare's Richard II, Henry IV, part 1, and Henry IV, part 2. His position as a character in the Shakespearean canon inspired the character of Lord Percy Percy, heir to the duchy of Northumberland in the historical sitcom The Black Adder, set during the very late Plantagenet era. The novel Lion of Alnwick by Carol Wensby-Scott is the first volume of the Percy Saga trilogy which retells the story of \\"the wild and brilliant Percy family\\" and relates a fictionalised account of the lives of the 1st Earl of Northumberland and his son Henry \\"Hotspur\\" Percy. The other novels in the trilogy, Lion Dormant and Lion Invincible tell the story of his other descendants and their role in the English War of the Roses. Henry Percy and his son Hotspur are also essential characters in Edith Pargeter's novel, A Bloody Field by Shrewsbury which recounts the events leading up to the Battle of Shrewsbury in 1403. He is a major character in My Lord John by Georgette Heyer. Ancestry References =Sources *Rymer, Thomas Foedera, The Hague, 1739 *Beltz, G.F.

Detail from the 16th century stained glass Percy Window at Petworth House, Sussex Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland, (25 July 1421 ‚Äì 29 March 1461) was an English magnate. The Earldom of Northumberland was then one of the greatest landholdings in northern England; Percy also became Lord Poynings on his marriage. This title would bring him into direct conflict with the Poynings family themselves, and indeed, feuds with neighbouring nobles, both lay and ecclesiastical, would be a key occupancy of his youth. Percy married Eleanor Poynings, who outlived him; together they had four children. He was a leading Lancastrian during the Wars of the Roses, from which he managed to personally benefit, although his father died early in the war. He was not, however, to live to enjoy these gains, being killed at the Battle of Towton in 1461 on the defeated Lancastrian side. Early life and war with Scotland Percy was the son of Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland, and Lady Eleanor Neville, daughter of Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland, and his second wife, Joan Beaufort. Percy was knighted in 1426 together with Henry VI. He was appointed Warden of the Eastern March on the Scottish border on 1 April 1440, originally for four years, and subsequent extensions in 1444, and 1445, for the next seven years. This came as well with the custody of Berwick Castle and responsibility for its defence He was to hold this post until March 1461. In May 1448, Percy, with his father and Sir Robert Ogle, invaded Scotland and burnt Dunbar and Dumfries, for which, in revenge, the Scots attacked his father's castles of Alnwick and Warkworth. King Henry made his way north, and whilst at Durham sent Percy ‚Äì now Lord Poynings ‚Äì to raid Dumfrieshire; the sortie ‚Äì \\"only to return with some 500 cattle\\" ‚Äì of around 5,000 men failed, and he was captured whilst caught in a marsh following his father's defeat at the River Sark on 23 October. Sir Robert Ogle was now outlawed and the king used half of his estates to compensate Poynings for the ransom he had expended arranging his release from captivity. Tensions with Scotland remained, to the extent that Poynings, his father, and other nobles were requested to stay and guard the border rather than attend Parliament, for which they were excused. In summer 1451, with an Anglo-Scottish truce pending, Poynings was commissioned to treat with Scottish embassies. In July 1455, he successfully prevented an assault on Berwick by the Scottish King, James II, and was congratulated by the English King as a result. The remains of Berwick Castle today Feud with the Poynings In the late 1440s, the Yorkshire tenants of his father, the Earl of Northumberland, were in almost constant conflict with their neighbours, those of the Archbishop of York, involving armed skirmishes which Percy's brothers led. These events were deemed so severe that in 1448 they led to the only progress north for the King during his reign. The same year, because of a dispute over the inheritance his family received as a result of Henry Percy's marriage, the Earl of Northumberland's retainers had ejected the earl's relative, Robert Poynings, from his Sussex manors. A year later, Henry Percy ‚Äì now Lord Poynings by right of his wife ‚Äì took direct part, with his father, in raiding the manor of Newington Bertram in Kent, which was also enfeoffed by Robert. This attack also apparently involved cattle rustling and theft, and Robert later claimed it to be so brutal that he was \\"deterred from seeking a remedy at law for three years\\". Feud with Nevilles By the early 1450s, relations with a powerful neighbouring family, the Nevilles, became increasingly tense, and Poyning's brother Thomas, Lord Egremont, had finally ambushed a Neville force, returning from a wedding, near Sheriff Hutton, with a force of between 1,000 and 5,000 men. Although this was a bloodless confrontation, a precedent for the use of force in this particular dispute had already been laid in the previous violence in the region. By October 1453, Poynings was directly involved, with his father, brothers Egremont and Richard, and joined by Lord Clifford, in forcing a battle with John and Richard Neville at Topcliffe. The feud continued into the next year, when Poyning reportedly planned on attending parliament accompanied by a large force of men in February, and three months later both he and the earl were summoned by the king to attend council in attempt to impose a peace; a second letter was \\"written but not despatched\\". Neither, along with John Neville or Salisbury, did as requested. Wars of the Roses John Quartley's 19th- century depiction of the Battle of Towton During the Wars of the Roses, Percy followed his father in siding with the Lancastrians against the Yorkists. The Earl himself died at what is generally considered to be the first battle of the wars, at St Alban's on 22 May 1455, and Poynings was elevated as third Earl of Northumberland, without having to pay relief to the Crown, because his father had died in the King's service. He in his turn \\"swore to uphold the Lancastrian dynasty\\". Although a reconciliation of the leading magnates of the realm was attempted in October 1458 in London, he arrived with such a large body of men (thought to be around 1,500) that the city denied him entry. The new earl and his brother Egremont were bound over ¬£4,000 each to keep the peace. When conflict broke out again, he attended the so-called Parliament of Devils in October 1459, which condemned as traitors those Yorkists accused of, among other offences, causing the death of his father four years before. On 30 December 1460, Percy led the central \\"battle\\" or section of the victorious Lancastrian army at the Battle of Wakefield, following which, the army marched south, pillaging on the road to London. He fought against Warwick at the second Battle of St. Albans on 17 February 1461, and he commanded the Lancastrian van at the Battle of Towton on 29 March 1461, however, \\"his archers were blinded by snowstorms\\", and he was either slain in close fighting, or died of his wounds soon after. He was buried at St Denys's Church, York. He was posthumously attainted by the first parliament of the victorious Edward IV in November 1461, and his son and namesake was committed to the Tower. Estates, offices and finances The estates of the Earls of Northumberland had traditionally been in constant use as a source of manpower and wages in defence of the border since the Percy family first gained the office the previous century. The wages assigned to the third Earl were substantial: ¬£2,500 yearly in time of peace, and ¬£5,000 during war, as well as an annual payment for the maintenance of Berwick's upkeep (¬£66 in peacetime and ¬£120 in wartime). Percy often had to provide from his own resources, however, as \\"securing payment was not easy\\" from the Exchequer, (for example, in 1454 he received no payments at all). In July 1452 he gained a twenty-year fee-farm (¬£80 yearly, from Carlisle), although he subsequently lost it in favour of Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury, in July 1454. Throughout the 1450s, the Crown continually made efforts at paying Percy his Warden's wages and fees promptly (paying him full wartime rates for the whole of the year 1456‚Äì7, for example), and since he was a loyal Lancastrian he achieved this more often than his counterpart on the west march, Salisbury, who by now had publicly aligned himself with York. The fee farm of Carlisle was returned to Percy in November 1459, following Salisbury's attainder in Coventry. He also benefited from the attainder of York, being granted an annuity of ¬£66 from the latter's forfeited Wakefield Lordship in Yorkshire; he also received ¬£200 from the profits of Penrith. As a reward for his role in the Lancastrian victory at Ludford Bridge, he was made Chief Forester north of the River Trent and the Constable of Scarborough Castle on 22 December 1459 for life. He was nominated to a wide-ranging commission of oyer and terminer (from the old French, literally a commission \\"to hear and determine\\") on 30 May 1460, his new rank was a tactic to deal with the treasons and insurrections in Northumberland. On 3 July, he was granted Yorkshire, Derbyshire, and Cambridgeshire, all belonging to Salisbury, on a twelve-year lease. After the Yorkists captured Henry VI at the Battle of Northampton in 1460, they accused Percy of having looted York's northern estates during his exile in Ireland. This charge was likely to have had some truth in it, as it was his continued pillaging of those estates, with the Lords Clifford and Dacre, that led to York marching north to Wakefield in December 1460. These incomes, however collected, would have been vital to the Earl both personally and militarily as his northern estates especially had been a victim of feudal decline for most of the first half of the fifteenth century: even on the forfeit of the earldom to the Crown in 1461, his arrears have been calculated as still standing at approximately ¬£12,000. Family Arms of Poynings: Barry of six or and vert a bend gules. Subsequently quartered by Percy On or before 25 June 1435, by the arrangement in 1434 of his father and Cardinal Beaufort, he married Eleanor Poynings (c.1422-11 February 1484), suo jure Baroness Poynings, daughter and heiress of Sir Richard Poynings of Poynings in Sussex, by his second wife Eleanor Berkeley, a daughter of Sir John Berkeley of Beverston Castle in Gloucestershire. In 1446 she became heir general to her grandfather Robert Poynings, 4th Baron Poynings (1380‚Äì1446), inherited his title of Baron Poynings (which having been created by writ was able to descend to females) and his large estates across the south of England.

After losing his title when his father was killed fighting the Yorkists, he later regained his position. He led the rear guard of Richard III's army at the Battle of Bosworth, but failed to commit his troops. He was briefly imprisoned by Henry VII, but later restored to his position. A few years later he was murdered by citizens of York during a revolt against Henry VII's taxation. Origins Percy was the son of Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland, and his wife Eleanor Poynings, daughter of Sir Richard Poynings (d. 10 June 1429). His father was first cousin to (among others) Edward IV of England, Anne, Duchess of Exeter, Edmund, Earl of Rutland, Elizabeth, Duchess of Suffolk, Margaret of York, George, Duke of Clarence, and Richard III of England. Percy himself was second cousin to (among others) Elizabeth of York, Edward V of England, Richard, Duke of York, Arthur Plantagenet, 1st Viscount Lisle, Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury, Edward, Earl of Warwick, and Edward of Middleham. Both Perkin Warbeck and Lambert Simnel claimed to be his second cousins. Loss and restoration of title His father was loyal to the House of Lancaster. His wife, Maud Herbert, had in fact been first betrothed to Henry of Richmond, who would usurp the throne in 1485 and become Henry VII. He was killed in the Battle of Towton on 29 March 1461. The earldom of Northumberland was forfeited to the victorious Yorkists. The adolescent Percy was imprisoned in the Fleet Prison. He was transported to the Tower of London in 1464. In 1465, John Neville was named Earl of Northumberland in his place. Percy eventually swore fealty to Edward IV and was released in 1469. He petitioned for the return of his paternal titles and estates to him. He gained support by Edward IV himself. John Neville had to quit his title and was instead named Marquess of Montagu in 1470. However the restoration of the title to Percy was delayed by the Parliament of England until 1473. He was made a Knight of the Garter in 1474. For the following twelve years, Percy held many of the important government posts in northern England, such as warden of the east and middle marches, which were traditional in his family. Bosworth campaign and aftermath He commanded the Yorkist reserve at the Battle of Bosworth Field on 22 August 1485. Percy never committed his forces to the battle. His inactivity played an important part in the defeat and death of Richard III. Historians suspect him of treason in favour of victor Henry VII of England, although there is an alternative theory that his forces, placed behind those of King Richard, were in no position to take part in the battle before Richard was killed. Percy was arrested along with Ralph Neville, 3rd Earl of Westmorland and Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk. He was nominally imprisoned for several months but swore allegiance to the new King. Henry VII released him on terms of good behaviour. Percy was allowed to retain his titles and lands as well as being allowed to return to his old posts, and was in fact sent on diplomatic missions for the crown, something that would not have occurred had Henry VII not trusted him implicitly.  Marriage and progeny  At some time between 1473 and 1476 Percy married Maud Herbert (1448 ‚Äì 27 July 1485/1495), a daughter of William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke (1423‚Äì1469) by his wife Anne Devereaux. They had eight children: *Henry Percy, 5th Earl of Northumberland (14 January 1478 ‚Äì 19 May 1527), who married Catherine Spencer. *Alianore Percy, Duchess of BuckinghamSeveral occurrences of the alternate spelling of \\"Alianore\\" for \\"Eleanor\\" have been used for Eleanor Percy in history.

Taxes rose to finance the military action. Sir John Egremont of Yorkshire led a riot in protest at the high taxation, known as the Yorkshire rebellion. Percy was targeted by the rioters as he approached the city and slain on 28 April. He was buried at Beverley Minster.

Vernou, and commissioned on 30 January 1942, with Lieutenant Commander Jack H. Lewis in command. Battle of Midway The submarine sailed for Hawaii on 22 May and reached Pearl Harbor the following week. She sortied for Midway Island with Task Group 7.2 (TG 7.2) on 29 May in anticipation of a Japanese attack on that island. Her station during the ensuing Battle of Midway was northeast of Midway, and she remained there without contacting any enemy shipping until she was ordered back to Pearl Harbor on 9 June.  First patrol: June‚ÄìAugust 1942  On 26 June, Trigger got underway for the Aleutian Islands to patrol an area west of Cape Wrangell, Attu Island. She encountered six destroyers, three freighters and a patrol boat, attacking none, before calling at Dutch Harbor on 8 August en route back to Hawaii.  Second patrol: September‚ÄìNovember 1942  Trigger got a new skipper, Roy S. Benson (Class of 1929), before her second war patrol, conducted from 23 September to 8 November in \\"Empire Waters\\" (the seas immediately surrounding Japan). In the early morning hours of 5 October, the submarine sighted smoke on the horizon and headed for it. A vessel soon appeared, coming toward the submarine. As the target approached, the submarine identified it as a small ship. Trigger then surfaced and manned her machine guns. As the target neared, however, the submarine learned that the Japanese ship was larger than initially thought. Enemy shells soon began exploding close to Trigger, and the 4,000 ton ship turned and accelerated in an attempt to ram the submarine. Trigger barely avoided a collision as she submerged for an attack; she launched two torpedoes and heard one hit. She then surfaced and gave chase, only to have the target again open fire. The submarine missed with three more torpedoes and then discontinued the pursuit. Before dawn on the morning of 17 October, Trigger made a surface attack on a freighter off the Bungo Suido. She fired two spreads of torpedoes which sank Holland Maru with her guns still firing. That night, a destroyer came out of Bungo Suido and dropped a string of depth charges near the submarine. Trigger launched three torpedoes \\"down the throat\\" at the onrushing destroyer and, one minute later, observed an explosion so powerful it threw enough flame and water into the air to obscure the target. When the air cleared, the enemy ship was still intact, suggesting Trigger's first torpedo may have exploded prematurely, detonating the next two by its turbulence. The submarine fired one more torpedo as the enemy disappeared, but failed to score a hit. Near midnight of 20 October, Trigger fired a spread of four torpedoes from very close range, , in a surface attack on a 10,000-ton tanker. Two torpedoes hit the enemy ship as it turned in an attempt to ram. The submarine went to to evade a counterattack, and heard a heavy explosion as either gasoline, magazines, or boilers blew up. Trigger then came up to periscope level but found nothing in sight. (This sinking was not confirmed by JANAC postwar.) Four days later, Trigger attacked a large enemy tanker in ballast. A spread of three torpedoes produced three observed hits, one near the target's stern. The screws of the enemy ship stopped, and she began emitting heavy white smoke aft, but she soon got underway again. Trigger fired her last torpedo at the ship as it was moving off and missed. That night, she surfaced and began her homeward voyage.  Third patrol: December 1942‚ÄìJanuary 1943  From 3 December 1942 to 22 January 1943, the submarine conducted a combined minelaying and offensive patrol, again in waters surrounding the Japanese home islands. On 20 December, she began planting a minefield off Inubo Saki, Honsh≈´. Trigger planted the northern half of the field and was working on the southern part when a cargo ship passed her, heading into the newly-laid mines. Five minutes later, a violent explosion rocked the freighter which sank while an escort circled her. The submarine later heard another explosion from the direction of the minefield and, when she surfaced the next day, found the field was covered by smoke. On 22 December, Trigger sighted a ship approaching from Uraga and made a surface attack. A spread of three torpedoes produced one hit forward of the bridge, and the target started to settle by the bow. The submarine fired one more torpedo into the ship and, when last seen, Teifuku Maru was awash forward with her screws nearly out of the water. On 31 December 1942, she attacked a cargo ship loaded with planes. Trigger fired three torpedoes from extremely close range , and watched two hit. The target began to list to starboard and was down by the bow. Sound reported a heavy secondary explosion. The submarine came up to periscope level and saw the freighter with her stern high out of the water and a destroyer approaching. Trigger went deep and when she next came up for a look, there was nothing to be seen. (The sinking was not confirmed by JANAC postwar.) On 10 January 1943, a Japanese destroyer approached Trigger, and the submarine fired three torpedoes from . One hit under the well deck and folded the destroyer's forecastle up at a 45¬∞ angle, and another hit the target's stern. Soon, the destroyer sank on an even keel.  Fourth patrol: February‚ÄìApril 1943  Trigger stood out of Midway on 13 February to patrol off the Palau Islands. Two weeks later, she launched four torpedoes at a freighter, but the target managed to steer between them. Heavy air cover prevented a second attack. On 4 March, the submarine attacked a freighter in a rain squall, but all three of her torpedoes missed. On 15 March, Trigger sighted a convoy steaming in two columns. There were two freighters in the right hand column and three in the left, with an escort on the outboard bow of each column. Trigger worked her way between the two columns and launched three torpedoes at each of the leading ships. She hit the lead freighter in the left hand column twice but missed her target on the right because it unexpectedly changed course. Trigger then fired three more torpedoes at the right lead ship at just and observed two hits before the escorts forced her to go deep. When she surfaced again, there was nothing to be seen. Trigger was later officially credited with having sunk Momoha Maru, a 3,103-ton cargo ship. That night, the submarine fired six torpedoes at a ship that was being towed by a smaller freighter. Five of the torpedoes missed, and the sixth made a circular run and passed over the submarine's engine room. A shaken crew broke off the attack. On 20 March, the submarine launched three torpedoes at the lead ship in a convoy of four cargo ships. One hit caused the target to list 10¬∞ to port and stop, but it soon got underway and rejoined the convoy. Trigger terminated the patrol at the Submarine Base, Pearl Harbor, on 6 April.  Fifth patrol: April‚ÄìJune 1943  Between 30 April and 22 June, the submarine made a patrol which returned her to Empire waters. Directed by an Ultra from Pearl Harbor, Trigger lay athwart the projected track of Admiral Koga's task force returning from Truk. Koga's force came in sight the morning of 22 May, but zigged away, out of range, \\"a bitter disappointment\\".Blair, Silent Victory, p.428 On 28 May, Trigger contacted two freighters off Iro Saki and fired three torpedoes at the larger. One hit aft. When last seen, the ship was down by the stern. The next day, the submarine fired a spread of three torpedoes at a small cargo ship. Two missed and the third exploded prematurely. She then fired a fourth torpedo, which apparently hit but failed to explode. On 1 June, the submarine was searching for Japanese shipping off Sagami Nada when she sighted two columns of smoke. She closed the range toward a firing position, made out two cargo ships, and fired a spread of three torpedoes at each target. Hit in her stern, the lead ship, Noborikawa Maru, sank immediately. The second ship saw the torpedo wakes, turned and passed between them. Trigger then fired a torpedo at the oncoming ship; if the torpedo reached the target, it failed to explode. Again alerted by Ultra, on 10 June (her last day on station), Trigger sighted an aircraft carrier protected by two destroyers. She closed and fired six torpedoes from only . Although as she went deep the submarine heard four explosions, postwar accounting showed two of the torpedoes missed ahead and one failed to explode. The escorts kept Trigger down for several hours.Blair, Silent Victory, p.430 The damaged limped into Tokyo Bay and was out of action for almost a year. Admiral Lockwood (COMSUBPAC), who knew Hiy≈çs fate, was furious. Had the torpedoes functioned correctly, Benson would have sunk her. The next day, Trigger began her return voyage to Pearl Harbor; just after her triumphant return, the Mark 14 torpedo's defective Mark 6 exploder was ordered deactivated.  Sixth patrol: September 1943  On 1 September, after a yard overhaul, Trigger (now in the charge of Commander Robert \\"Dusty\\" Dornin was ready to begin her sixth war patrol. The patrol took her into the East China Sea, off the China coast, north of Formosa. On 17 September, she made two hits on a Japanese freighter, one aft and one on the bow, but both torpedoes proved to be duds. The next day, she again contacted the same ship and launched four torpedoes at her. One struck Yowa Maru, and the 6,435-ton cargo ship slid beneath the waves. 21 September was Triggers best day. She was patrolling some north of the Hoka Sho light when she sighted a convoy of three tankers and three freighters protected by Japanese planes. The submarine attacked the tankers first, firing three torpedoes at the leader and three at the second. One hit aft was seen on the lead tanker, and flames shot over into the air. The target's crew, dressed in whites, could be seen running forward to escape the fire. One torpedo hit the second tanker amidships, and it broke in half beneath the stack and sank immediately. Trigger turned and fired three stern tubes at the third tanker. This target swung toward the submarine, and all three torpedoes missed. Trigger then fired another torpedo which hit that ship's starboard side. When the submarine went deep, Dornin slipped and fell into the periscope well as the quartermaster was lowering it. He supported himself on his elbows, and the quartermaster heard his shouts in time to prevent a serious accident. Sonar reported two more explosions before the submarine came back up to periscope depth to resume the attack. Trigger fired two bow torpedoes at the third freighter in the column and scored two hits on the target which went down by the bow. The submarine then made two more attacks on the freighter, but all of her torpedoes either missed or were duds. During the three and one-half hours of action, Trigger sank two tankers, Shiriya and Shoyo Maru, and a freighter, Argun Maru, for a total of 20,660 tons of enemy shipping. The submarine returned to Midway on 30 September to be refitted and rearmed.  Seventh patrol: October‚ÄìDecember 1943  The East China Sea and Yellow Sea were Triggers objective for her seventh patrol. She stood out of Midway on 22 October and proceeded to her patrol area. At 22:00 on 1 November, she sighted a convoy that was steaming in two columns. When a ship in the nearer column overlapped one in the more distant group, Trigger fired a spread of three torpedoes at them. One torpedo struck the nearer freighter in the bow and one hit the farther ship amidships. The submarine saw the nearer ship go down by the bow, before she herself was forced to go deep where she was severely depth-charged by two escorts. Early the next morning (2 November), Trigger launched three torpedoes at a freighter and scored one hit. At 00:50, she attacked the ship again with another three-torpedo spread. Two of them hit forward, and Yawata Maru went down, bow first, in a vertical plunge. Two hours and 25 minutes later, Trigger launched three torpedoes at a 7,148-ton transport. All hit, and Delagoa Maru disintegrated. On 5 November, the submarine attacked a convoy of three cargo ships protected by one destroyer and two planes. Trigger fired three bow tubes at the second ship in the convoy and one bow tube at the third before going deep to avoid the escort which dropped 20 depth charges. Thinking she was clear, the submarine came to periscope depth and was greeted by five near bomb misses. On 13 November, Trigger made a submerged approach on a convoy of nine merchantmen and four escorts. After the Japanese ships zigged, the submarine found herself between two columns of ships, but Trigger had no torpedoes remaining in her bow tubes. She emptied her stern tubes at the last and biggest ship, believed to be a transport, from a pointblank range, . The target, which carried a large deck cargo, took one hit aft and one under her stack. The submarine went deep, received a short depth charge attack, and came up to periscope depth to learn that her target had gone down. On 21 November, Trigger sighted a cargo ship and closed to before firing four torpedoes. Two hits started the victim down by the bow as the submarine's crew took turns at the periscope to watch Eizan Maru sink. More than a fortnight later, the submarine arrived at Pearl Harbor on 8 December 1943.  Eighth patrol: January‚ÄìFebruary 1944  Trigger stood out to sea on New Year's Day 1944 to begin her eighth war patrol, this time in the Truk-Guam shipping lanes. On 27 January, she sighted the conning tower of an submarine dead ahead. Trigger set up to fire a bow shot from . She came to periscope depth and saw the Japanese submarine, then less than away, was preparing to attack. Trigger submerged to , expecting a torpedo at any minute, but sound heard no torpedo screws. She came up to periscope depth and saw the Japanese periscope so she decided to make an end around. When Trigger returned to periscope depth, the enemy had disappeared. Four days later, she contacted a convoy of three ships accompanied by two destroyers. The submarine scored two hits on the coastal minelayer Nasami, which disappeared in a cloud of smoke and debris. The nearer destroyer began closing the range, and Trigger missed it with four aft tubes. She caught up with the convoy again and fired five torpedoes at the last ship. Two hits produced flames that reached mast height and several secondary explosions that marked the end of the 11,933-ton converted submarine tender . Over three weeks later, the submarine terminated the patrol when she arrived at Pearl Harbor on 23 February.  Ninth patrol: March‚ÄìMay 1944  On 23 March, Trigger (now in the able hands of Commander Frederick J. \\"Fritz\\" Harlfinger II, and still with \\"Ned\\" Beach as executive officer) headed for the Palau Islands on her ninth war patrol. In the early morning of 8 April, she contacted a convoy of approximately 20 large ships with an estimated 25 escorts, and closed to attack. When she raised her periscope, she saw a destroyer away firing at the scope and attempting to ram. The submarine loosed four torpedoes at the convoy and went deep as several more escorts joined the attack. On her way down, she heard four explosions. Trigger ran at or more for 17 hours as six escorts dogged her trail and rained down numerous depth charges. Six exploded extremely close. When the submarine surfaced, her forward torpedo room was flooded to her deck plates, and the hull air induction and most compartments were in about the same condition. The bow planes, trim pump, sound gear, and both radars were all dead. Her radio antenna was grounded, and the submarine could not transmit. The crew spent the next four days making repairs \\"by use of spares, baling wire, and considerable ingenuity.\\" Trigger met submarine on 14 April and exchanged information by line gun. The next day, Triggers executive officer went on board Tang by a rubber boat, to borrow an air compressor part and to make plans for a coordinated search and attack. On 18 April, Tangs executive officer delivered spare parts for the air compressor to Trigger, and she continued on patrol. Shortly before midnight on 26 April, Trigger contacted a convoy of six ships off the eastern Palaus. She fired six torpedoes, from , at four ships that were closely bunched and overlapping. Four hits were seen and heard, with a big explosion on each ship. Suddenly, a terrific explosion blew up one of the closer ships. One of the more distant ships stood straight up on her bow and sank immediately. At six minutes after midnight, Trigger launched three torpedoes at another group of ships and heard one timed explosion. At 01:57, she launched four torpedoes at a damaged cargo ship and two at an escort. The cargo ship received two more hits. Five minutes later, the submarine fired three stern tubes at a group of three escorts, and the middle one disappeared in a cloud of smoke. During the attack, Trigger sank the 11,739-ton passenger/cargo ship Miike Maru and heavily damaged the destroyer escort Kasado, the 9,467-ton cargo ship , and the 8,811 ton cargo ship Asosan Maru. Trigger returned to Pearl Harbor on 20 May and four days later, headed for the United States for a major overhaul. She arrived at San Francisco, California, on 31 May and, after overhaul, returned to Hawaii on 11 September.  Tenth patrol: September‚ÄìNovember 1944  On 24 September, Trigger got underway to take station off the east coast of Formosa and perform life guard patrol for bomber strikes due on 12 October. The morning of the strikes, she rescued a pilot from aircraft carrier whose burning plane had crash-landed nearby. On 19 October, as the invasion of the Philippines was about to begin, Trigger contacted a convoy of two heavy cruisers, one cruiser, two other light cruisers, and several destroyers with air cover. Trigger had no chance to fire but reported the contact. On 30 October, she launched four torpedoes at a tanker but missed. She then fired another four from her stern tubes and heard one hit the target before running up the periscope to watch the other three blow off part of the stern, but the ship did not sink. Trigger went deep as 78 depth charges were rained down on her within the next hour, but caused no damage. The damaged 10,021-ton tanker Takane Maru was later sunk by submarines and . The next morning, Trigger received word from Salmon that she had been heavily damaged by depth charges and was unable to submerge. Trigger rendezvoused with Salmon that night and was joined by and Sterlet to escort the damaged submarine to Saipan. They were provided with air cover from the Mariana Islands and arrived at Tanapag Harbor on 3 November. A week later, Trigger departed with six other submarines but was ordered to discontinue her patrol on 17 November and returned to Guam.  Eleventh patrol: December 1944‚ÄìFebruary 1945  On 28 December 1944, Trigger headed for the Bungo Suido- Kii Suido area to begin her 11th war patrol. At 21:05 on 3 January 1945, she sighted a light, and radar made a doubtful contact. Thirty minutes later, a torpedo passed by her starboard side. Trigger reversed course and cleared the area but returned two days later. That day, she sighted a periscope at , and‚Äîrealizing that instead of hunting, she was being hunted‚Äîshe slipped away. On 29 January, the submarine made radar contact from on a large convoy with six escorts and well covered by aircraft. As she closed, the moon came out bright and clear. An enemy bomber turned and started in as radar picked up another plane coming in astern at . The submarine went deep, and the convoy slowly pulled away. The next day, the ship was ordered to terminate her patrol, and she returned to Guam on 3 February.  Twelfth patrol: March 1945  \\"USS Trigger Still on Patrol\\" plaque at the Independence Seaport Museum Trigger (with new skipper Commander David R. Connole) stood out to sea on 11 March to begin her 12th war patrol and headed for the Nansei Shoto area. On 18 March, she attacked a convoy west of the islands, sinking the cargo ship Tsukushi Maru No.3 and damaging another. She reported the attack on 20 March, and the submarine was subsequently ordered to radio as many movements of the convoy as possible to help find a safe passage through a known mined area of the East China Sea. On 24 March, Trigger was ordered to begin patrolling west of the islands the next day, outside the curve, and to steer clear of restricted areas. On 26 March, she was ordered to join a wolf pack called \\"Earl's Eliminators\\" and to acknowledge receipt of the message. A weather report came from the submarine that day but no confirmation of her having received the message. The weather report was Triggers last transmission. On 4 April, she was ordered to proceed to Midway, but she had not arrived by 1 May and was reported as presumed lost. Postwar records indicate she torpedoed and sank the repair ship on 27 March. The next day, Japanese planes and ships joined in a two-hour attack on a submarine heard by Silversides, , , and in adjacent areas. Threadfin was the only one of these submarines attacked that day, and she reported hearing many depth charges and several heavy explosions east of her after the attack on her ceased. Postwar Japanese records showed a Japanese aircraft detected and bombed a submarine on 28 March 1945. Kaibokan Mikura, CD-33, and CD-59 were then guided to the spot and delivered an intensive depth charging. After two hours, a large oil slick appeared. Trigger was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 11 July 1945. Trigger was immortalized and eulogized in Beach's 1952 book Submarine!. Destroyer escort (DE-1056, later FF-1056) was named in honor of Commander David R. Connole.  Awards  Trigger received 11 battle stars for World War II service and the Presidential Unit Citation for her fifth, sixth, and seventh war patrols. She is credited with sinking 18 ships (tied with and for seventh on the list of confirmed sinkings by number of ships), totaling 86,552 tons (seventh on the list of confirmed sinkings by tonnage), according to the official JANAC accounting postwar.Blair, pp.989-990.

He is now primarily remembered as the betrothed of Anne Boleyn, whom he was forced to give up before she became involved with and later married King Henry VIII.https://www.britannica.com/biography/Anne- Boleyn Early life Henry Percy was born about 1502,Karen Lindsey, Divorced, Beheaded, Survived, xvii, Perseus Books, 1995 the eldest son of Henry Algernon Percy, 5th Earl of Northumberland, by Catherine, daughter of Sir Robert Spencer. Through his mother he was a first cousin of William Carey, who was the brother-in-law to Anne Boleyn. When quite young, Henry was sent to serve as a page in Thomas Wolsey's household. It was a way for young aristocrats to learn about their societies. He was knighted in 1519. The principal source for the early passages of Percy's life is the biography of Wolsey by George Cavendish.Ives, p. 63. Involvement with Anne Boleyn Though his father had planned by 1516 to betroth Percy to Mary Talbot, the daughter of George Talbot, 4th Earl of Shrewsbury, he fell in love with Anne Boleyn, then a young lady about the court. Percy became betrothed to Anne, probably in the spring of 1523 when he was still page to Wolsey. On hearing the news, Wolsey scolded Lord Percy before his household, as permission for the marriage had not been sought from his father nor from the King. The latter had an interest due to the importance of the Northumberland earldom. While Cavendish claimed that the King already had a personal interest in Anne at this point, driving Wolsey's angry reaction, this has been debated.David Starkey, Six Wives: The Queens of Henry VIII, p.xxii. Starkey believes the story to be true. The intrigue was soon discovered, and the Earl of Northumberland sent for young Lord Percy. Besides the proposed Talbot match, another serious obstacle was that Anne was intended to wed James Butler, 9th Earl of Ormond (who was then a page in Wolsey's household). This match was intended to manage and resolve a dispute over the earldom of Ormond involving Sir Thomas Boleyn, her father, who had a somewhat feeble claim on the vast Ormond estates in Munster through his grandfather. Another significant reason for Percy's father's refusal to permit the match was that he believed Anne Boleyn, a mere knight's daughter, not a high enough rank for his son and heir. Marriage to Mary Talbot escutcheon showing arms of Henry Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland (c.1502‚Äì1537), KG, (with 16 quarters) impaling Talbot (with 9 quarters), paternal arms of his wife, all circumscribed by the Garter. Detail from Percy Window, Petworth House, Sussex Percy's father reportedly scolded him, saying \\"thou hast always been a proud, presumptuous, and unthrift waster,\\" and he was quickly and unhappily married to Lady Mary Talbot, daughter of the Earl of Shrewsbury, by early 1524 or in 1525, with earlier legal stages.Ives, p. 65, citing David Starkey. Starkey dates it at August 1525 or August 1526.p.xxii, David Starkey, Six Wives: The Queens of Henry VIII The old earl allowed the couple little in the way of comforts or income. Wolsey attempted to insinuate his own servants into the household as a means of controlling the young Henry.Bernard, G. W., \\"The Fall of the House of Percy\\", The Tudor Nobility, Manchester University Press, 1992 By 1528, only four years into their marriage, the couple's relationship had broken down irretrievably. Northumberland suspected his wife of spying on him for Norfolk, while her father worried that the young husband was abusing her and might even poison her. Northumberland was outraged at Shrewsbury's suspicions and refused to permit his father-in-law's servants to see or speak to his wife. When the countess's brother-in-law, William, Lord Dacre, asked the Duke of Norfolk to defend her, Northumberland told Norfolk that he, Northumberland, would never see her again as long as he lived. The couple may have separated shortly thereafter, at least temporarily, since Mary delivered a stillborn child at her father's home in April 1529. In 1532, Mary accused her husband of a precontract (i.e. betrothal with legal force) with Anne Boleyn. She confided her alleged grievance to her father, who then mentioned the matter to Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk. Anne Boleyn, consulted, ordered an inquiry. Northumberland denied the accusation on oath.Ives, p. 166 In 1536 Shrewsbury noted his daughter had been living with him for two and half years. At about the same time, Northumberland announced that he was bequeathing his entire inheritance to the King since he had no children, and he and his wife were not likely to have a legitimate heir. He was by then also estranged from his brothers, and did not want them to inherit his property.Harris, Barbara, J., English aristocratic women 1450 ‚Äì 1500: marriage, family, property and careers, pg. 177. Mary Talbot hated Henry heartily for the rest of his short life, and later sought a divorce. Border warfare In July 1522 Northumberland was made a member of the Council of the North; in October he was made deputy warden of the East Marches. His brother- in-law William Dacre suggested that, young as Northumberland was, he should be made warden the same year. On 19 May 1527 he succeeded his father as sixth Earl of Northumberland; he was made steward of the honour of Holderness on 18 June. On 2 December he became Lord Warden of the East and West Marches. Northumberland was constantly ill with an ague‚Äìa feverish, shivery illness, probably malaria‚Äìand was burdened with debt, and yet had to keep up an establishment and engage in fighting on his own account. Cardinal Wolsey treated him in a patronising manner. He was not often allowed to go to court, nor even to his father's funeral. His chief friend was Sir Thomas Arundell. In spite of all this, Northumberland was very active on the borders. He had leave in 1528 to come to London; in 1530, while he was at Topcliffe, he received a message from the king ordering him to go to Cawood and arrest Wolsey. He sent his prisoner south in the custody of Sir Roger Lascelles, while he remained to make an inventory of the Cardinal's goods. He was one of the peers who signed the letter to the Pope in July 1530 asking that the divorce might be hurried on, was a friend of Sir Thomas Legh, and possibly was a reformer. On 23 April 1531 he was created Knight of the Garter. On 11 May 1532 he was made High Sheriff of Northumberland for life and on 26 April, a privy councillor. Northumberland took part in the trial of his brother-in-law, Lord Dacre, who at first pleaded ‚Äònot guilty.‚Äô to charges of treason. Dacre, however, was ‚Äòover persuaded.‚Äô He changed his plea to guilty. He must have hoped for, or expected, leniency. The judges and Dacre then tried to get the king‚Äôs mercy. It wasn‚Äôt forthcoming. Dacre was executed at Tyburn by hanging, having been given false hope when a stay of execution arrived in the morning. Three other of Dacre‚Äôs party were also executed. Northumberland was accused of slackness on the borders, and also of having a sword of state carried before him when he went as justiciary to York. If illness was in part responsible, Eustace Chapuys also ranked him, on information which he had from his doctor, among the disaffected early in 1535. In May 1536 Northumberland, by now a man in broken health, formed one of the jury for the trial of Anne Boleyn. Anne is said to have confessed a precontract with him in the hope of saving her life. He collapsed following the verdict and had to be carried out.Ives pp. 339 and 341 Later life Having no children, Northumberland began to arrange his affairs. In February 1535 he wrote to Thomas Cromwell that he had decided to make the king his heir, a decision he confirmed later. In 1536 he was created Lord President of the Council of the North, and vicegerent of the Order of the Garter. Wressle Castle, Yorkshire, where Robert Aske requested Percy to join the Pilgrimage of Grace. In September 1536 he had a grant of ¬£1,000 to come to London to make arrangements about his lands. The matter was incomplete when the Pilgrimage of Grace began. Northumberland's brothers and mother were open sympathisers with the rebels, but the Earl himself remained loyal to the Crown. The rebel leader Robert Aske and his men came to Wressle Castle, where Percy was ill in bed, and asked him to resign his commands of the marches into the hands of his brothers, or at least go over to the rebels. He refused both requests; and when the lawyer William Stapleton went up to see him, he was in despair. Aske sent him to York, to protect him from his followers, who wanted to behead him. Northumberland made a grant to the king of his estates,Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII, ed. James Gairdner, vol. X, nos. 459 and 460 on condition that they pass to his nephew. When, however, his brother, Sir Thomas, was attainted and executed, Northumberland made the grant unconditional in June 1537. By this time his mind was fast failing. He moved to Newington Green, where Richard Layton visited him on 29 June 1537. Layton found him yellow and distended. Northumberland died on 29 June 1537, and was buried in Hackney church. Family He married, in 1524, Mary Talbot, daughter of George, 4th Earl of Shrewsbury, but left surviving no issue. They did have one known child, stillborn on April 1529 at the home of the earl of Shrewsbury, where Mary had gone to escape her husband. The earldom fell into abeyance on his death, but was revived in favour of his nephew Thomas. His widow lived until 1572. He left an illegitimate daughter, Isabel, who, in 1544, married Henry Tempest of Broughton. Northumberland's two brothers, Sir Thomas and Sir Ingelram Percy, took an active part in the management of his estates. They were both leaders of the Pilgrimage of Grace. Both were arrested. Sir Thomas was attainted and executed in 1537. His sons succeeded to the earldom: Thomas as seventh earl and Henry as eighth earl. Sir Ingelram Percy was confined in the Beauchamp Tower, where his name is to be seen cut in the stone. He was soon liberated, went abroad into exile, and died about 1540.

Classified for a long time as the only member of the family Myocastoridae, Myocastor is now included within Echimyidae, the family of the spiny rats. The coypu lives in burrows alongside stretches of water, and feeds on river plant stems. Originally native to subtropical and temperate South America, it has since been introduced to North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa, primarily by fur farmers. Although it is still hunted and trapped for its fur in some regions, its destructive burrowing and feeding habits often bring it into conflict with humans, and it is considered an invasive species.  Etymology  The genus name Myocastor derives from the two Ancient Greek words (), meaning \\"rat, mouse\\", and (), meaning \\"beaver\\".Nutria Biology. Nutria.com. 2007. Retrieved on September 5, 2007. Literally, therefore, the name Myocastor means \\"beaver rat\\". Two names are commonly used in English for Myocastor coypus. The name \\"nutria\\" (from Spanish word nutria, meaning 'otter') is generally used in North America, Asia, and throughout countries of the former Soviet Union; however, in most Spanish- speaking countries, the word \\"nutria\\" refers primarily to the otter. To avoid this ambiguity, the name \\"coypu\\" or \\"coipo\\" (derived from the Mapudungun language) is used in Latin America and parts of Europe. In France, the coypu is known as a ragondin. In Dutch, it is known as beverrat (beaver rat). In German, it is known as Nutria, Biberratte (beaver rat), or Sumpfbiber (swamp beaver). In Italy, instead, the popular name is, as in North America and Asia, \\"nutria\\", but it is also called castorino (\\"little beaver\\"), by which its fur is known in Italy. In Swedish, the animal is known as sumpb√§ver (marsh/swamp beaver). In Brazil, the animal is known as rat√£o-do-banhado (big swamp rat), n√∫tria, or caxingui (the last from the Tupi language).  Taxonomy  Skull The coypu was first described by Juan Ignacio Molina in 1782 as Mus coypus, a member of the mouse genus.C. A. Woods, L. Contreras, G. Willner-Chapman, H. P. Whidden (1992). Mammalian Species: Myocastor coypus. American Society of Mammalogists, 398: 1-8. The genus Myocastor was assigned in 1792 by Robert Kerr. Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, independently of Kerr, named the species Myopotamus coypus, and it is occasionally referred to by this name. Four subspecies are generally recognized: *M. c. bonariensis: northern Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, southern Brazil (RS, SC, PR, and SP) *M. c. coypus: central Chile, Bolivia *M. c. melanops: Chilo√© Island *M. c. santacruzae: Patagonia M. c. bonariensis, the subspecies present in the northernmost (subtropical) part of the coypu's range, is believed to be the type of coypu most commonly introduced to other continents.  Phylogeny  Comparison of DNA and protein sequences showed that the genus Myocastor is the sister group to the genus Callistomys (painted tree-rats). In turn, these two taxa share evolutionary affinities with other Myocastorini genera: Proechimys and Hoplomys (armored rats) on the one hand, and Thrichomys on the other hand.  Appearance  Large orange teeth are clearly visible on this coypu. The coypu somewhat resembles a very large rat, or a beaver with a small tail. Adults are typically in weight, and in body length, with a tail. It is possible for coypu to weigh up to , although adults usually average . They have coarse, darkish brown outer fur with soft dense grey under fur, also called the nutria. Three distinguishing features are a white patch on the muzzle, webbed hind feet, and large, bright orange-yellow incisors. The nipples of female coypu are high on her flanks, to allow their young to feed while the female is in the water. A coypu is often mistaken for a muskrat, another widely dispersed, semiaquatic rodent that occupies the same wetland habitats. The muskrat, however, is smaller and more tolerant of cold climates, and has a laterally flattened tail it uses to assist in swimming, whereas the tail of a coypu is round. It can also be mistaken for a small beaver, as beavers and coypus have very similar anatomies. However, beavers' tails are flat and paddle-like, as opposed to the round tails of coypus. Life history view in Full HD Coypus can live up to six years in captivity, but individuals uncommonly live past three years old; according to one study, 80% of coypus die within the first year, and less than 15% of a wild population is over three years old. Male coypus reach sexual maturity as early as four months, and females as early as three months; however, both can have a prolonged adolescence, up to the age of 9 months. Once a female is pregnant, gestation lasts 130 days, and she may give birth to as few as one or as many as 13 offspring. They generally line nursery nests with grasses and soft reeds. Baby coypus are precocial, born fully furred and with open eyes; they can eat vegetation with their parents within hours of birth. A female coypu can become pregnant again the day after she gives birth to her young. If timed properly, a female can become pregnant three times within a year. Newborn coypus nurse for seven to eight weeks, after which they leave their mothers. Habitat and feeding A coypu in a canal in Milan Besides breeding quickly, each coypu consumes large amounts of vegetation. An individual consumes about 25% of its body weight daily, and feeds year-round. Being one of the world's larger extant rodents, a mature, healthy coypu averages in weight, but they can reach as much as . They eat the base of the above-ground stems of plants, and often dig through the organic soil for roots and rhizomes to eat. Their creation of \\"eat-outs\\", areas where a majority of the above- and below-ground biomass has been removed, produces patches in the environment, which in turn disrupts the habitat for other animals and humans dependent on marshes.Ford, Mark, and J. B. Grace (1998). \\"Effects of Vertebrate Herbivores on Soil Processes, Plant Biomass, Litter Accumulation and Soil Elevation Changes in a Coastal Marsh.\\" Journal of Ecology 86(6): 974-982. Coypus are found most commonly in freshwater marshes, but also inhabit brackish marshes and rarely salt marshes.Lyon, W.J., and J.B. Milliet (2000). \\"Microbial Flora Associated with Louisiana Processed Frozen and Fresh Nutria (Myocastor coypus) Carcasses.\\" Journal of Food Science 65(6): 1041-1045. They either construct their own burrows, or occupy burrows abandoned by beaver, muskrats, or other animals. They are also capable of constructing floating rafts out of vegetation. Commercial and environmental issues Myocastor coypus Local extinction in their native range due to overharvesting led to the development of coypu fur farms in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The first farms were in Argentina and then later in Europe, North America, and Asia. These farms have generally not been successful long-term investments, and farmed coypu often are released or escape as operations become unprofitable. The first attempt at coypu farming was in France in the early 1880s, but it was not much of a success.National Wetlands Research Center (June 2000), Nutria, Eating Louisiana's Coast, United States Geological Survey The first efficient and extensive coypu farms were located in South America in the 1920s. The South American farms were very successful, and led to the growth of similar farms in North America and Europe. Coypus from these farms often escaped, or were deliberately released into the wild to provide a game animal or to remove aquatic vegetation.Carter, Jacoby, and Billy P. Leonard (2002). \\"A Review of the Literature on the Worldwide Distribution, Spread Of, and Efforts to Eradicate the Coypu (Myocastor coypus).\\" JSTOR. N.p., Web. 2 Nov. 2015. Coypus were introduced to the Louisiana ecosystem in the 1930s, when they escaped from fur farms that had imported them from South America. Coypu were released into the wild by at least one Louisiana nutria farmer in 1933 and these releases were followed by E. A. McIlhenny who released his entire stock in 1945 on Avery Island. In 1940, some of the nutria escaped during a hurricane and quickly populated coastal marshes, inland swamps, and other wetland areas. From Louisiana, coypus have spread across the Southern United States, wreaking havoc on marshland. Following a decline in demand for coypu fur, coypu have since become pests in many areas, destroying aquatic vegetation, marshes, and irrigation systems, and chewing through man-made items such as tires and wooden house panelling in Louisiana, eroding river banks, and displacing native animals. Damage in Louisiana has been sufficiently severe since the 1950s to warrant legislative attention; in 1958, the first bounty was placed on nutria, though this effort was not funded. By the early 2000s, the Coastwide Nutria Control Program was established, which began paying bounties for nutria killed in 2002. In the Chesapeake Bay region in Maryland, where they were introduced in the 1940s, coypus are believed to have destroyed of marshland in the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge. In response, by 2003, a multimillion-dollar eradication program was underway.\\"A Plague of Aliens\\" Feb/Mar 2003 edition of National Wildlife magazine, published by the National Wildlife Federation, article by Laura Tangley; accessed online December 8, 2006. In the United Kingdom, coypus were introduced to East Anglia, for fur, in 1929; many escaped and damaged the drainage works, and a concerted programme by MAFF eradicated them by 1989. However, in 2012, a \\"giant rat\\" was killed in County Durham, with authorities suspecting the animal was, in fact, a coypu. Marsh Dog, a US company based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, received a grant from the Barataria-Terrebonne National Estuary Program to establish a company that uses nutria meat for dog food products. In 2012, the Louisiana Wildlife Federation recognized Marsh Dog with \\"Business Conservationist of the Year\\" award for finding a use for this ecosustainable protein. In Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, nutria (Russian and local languages –ù—É—Ç—Ä–∏—è) are farmed on private plots and sold in local markets as a poor man's meat. As of 2016, however, the meat is used successfully in Moscow restaurant Krasnodar Bistro, as part of the growing Russian localvore movement and as a 'foodie' craze. It appears on the menu as a burger, hotdog, dumplings, or wrapped in cabbage leaves, with the flavour being somewhere between turkey and pork. In addition to direct environmental damage, coypus are the host for a nematode parasite (Strongyloides myopotami) that can infect the skin of humans, causing dermatitis similar to strongyloidiasis. The condition is also called \\"nutria itch\\".  Distribution  Native to subtropical and temperate South America, it has since been introduced to North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa, primarily by fur ranchers. The distribution of coypus outside South America tends to contract or expand with successive cold or mild winters. During cold winters, coypus often suffer frostbite on their tails, leading to infection or death. As a result, populations of coypus often contract and even become locally or regionally extinct as in the Scandinavian countries and such US states as Idaho, Montana, and Nebraska during the 1980s.Carter, Jacoby and Billy P. Leonard (Spring, 2002.) \\"A Review of the Literature on the Worldwide Distribution, Spread of, and Efforts to Eradicate the Coypu (Myocastor coypus)\\" Wildlife Society Bulletin 30(1): 162‚Äì175. During mild winters, their ranges tend to expand northward. For example, in recent years, range expansions have been noted in Washington and Oregon, as well as Delaware. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, nutria were first introduced to the United States in California, in 1899. They were first brought to Louisiana in the early 1930s for the fur industry, and the population was kept in check, or at a small population size, because of trapping pressure from the fur traders. The earliest account of nutria spreading freely into Louisiana wetlands from their enclosures was in the early 1940s; a hurricane hit the Louisiana coast for which many people were unprepared, and the storm destroyed the enclosures, enabling the nutria to escape into the wild. According to the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, nutria were also transplanted from Port Arthur, Texas, to the Mississippi River in 1941 and then spread due to a hurricane later that year. Nutria are spreading rapidly in Washington State. Herbivory damage to wetlands Zoo animal on logs Nutria herbivory \\"severely reduces overall wetland biomass and can lead to the conversion of wetland to open water. \\" Unlike other common disturbances in marshlands, such as fire and tropical storms, which are a once- or few-times-a-year occurrence, nutria feed year round, so their effects on the marsh are constant. Also, nutria are typically more destructive in the winter than in the growing season, due largely to the scarcity of above-ground vegetation; as nutria search for food, they dig up root networks and rhizomes for food. While nutria are the most common herbivores in Louisiana marshes, they are not the only ones. Feral hogs, also known as wild boars (Sus scrofa), swamp rabbits (Sylvilagus aquaticus), and muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus) are less common, but feral hogs are increasing in number in Louisiana wetlands. On plots open to nutria herbivory, 40% less vegetation was found than in plots guarded against nutria by fences. This number may seem insignificant, and indeed herbivory alone is not a serious cause of land loss, but when herbivory was combined with an additional disturbance, such as fire, single vegetation removal, or double vegetation removal to simulate a tropical storm, the effect of the disturbances on the vegetation were greatly amplified. \\" Essentially, this means, as different factors were added together, the result was less overall vegetation. Adding fertilizer to open plots did not promote plant growth; instead, nutria fed more in the fertilized areas. Increasing fertilizer inputs in marshes only increases nutria biomass instead of the intended vegetation, therefore increasing nutrient input is not recommended. Wetlands in general are a valuable resource both economically and environmentally. For instance, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service determined wetlands covered only 5% of the land surface of the contiguous 48 United States, but they support 31% of the nation's plant species. These very biodiverse systems provide resources, shelter, nesting sites, and resting sites (particularly Louisiana's coastal wetlands such as Grand Isle for migratory birds) to a wide array of wildlife. Human users also receive many benefits from wetlands, such as cleaner water, storm surge protection, oil and gas resources (especially on the Gulf Coast), reduced flooding, and chemical and biological waste reduction, to name a few. In Louisiana, rapid wetland loss occurs due to a variety of reasons; this state loses an estimated area about the size of a football field every hour. The problem became so serious that Sheriff Harry Lee of Jefferson Parish used SWAT sharpshooters against the animals. In 1998, the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF) conducted the first Louisiana coast-wide survey, which was funded by the Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection, and Restoration Act and titled the Nutria Harvest and Wetland Demonstration Program, to evaluate the condition of the marshlands. The survey revealed through aerial surveys of transects that herbivory damage to wetlands totaled roughly 90,000 acres. The next year, LDWF performed the same survey and found the area damaged by herbivory increased to about 105,000 acres. The LDWF has determined the wetlands affected by nutria decreased from an estimated 80,000+ acres of Louisiana wetlands in 2002‚Äì2003 season to about 6,296 acres during the 2010‚Äì2011 season. The LDWF stresses that coastal wetland restoration projects will be greatly hindered without effective, sustainable nutria population control. A claimed environmentally sound solution is the use of nutria meat to make dog food treats. Control efforts=New Zealand Coypus are classed as a \\"prohibited new organism\\" under New Zealand's Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996, preventing it from being imported into the country.  Great Britain In the UK, coypu escaped from fur farms and were reported in the wild as early as 1932. There were three unsuccessful attempts to control coypu in east Great Britain between 1943 and 1944. Coypu population and range increased causing damage to agriculture in the 1950s. During the 1960s, a grant was awarded to Rabbit Clearance Societies that included coypu. This control allowed for the removal of 97,000 coypu in 1961 and 1962. From 1962 to 1965, 12 trappers were hired to eradicate as many coypu as possible near the Norfolk Broads. The campaign used live traps allowing non-target species to be released while any coypu caught were shot. Combined with cold winters in 1962 to 1963, almost 40,500 coypu were removed from the population. Although coypu populations were greatly reduced after the 1962-1965 campaign ended, the population increased until another eradication campaign began in 1981. This campaign succeeded in fully eradicating coypu in Great Britain. The trapping areas were broken into 8 sectors leaving no area uncontrolled. The 24 trappers were offered an incentive for early completion of the 10-year campaign. In 1989 coypu were assumed eradicated as only 3 males were found between 1987 and 1989. Ireland A coypu was first sighted in the wild in Ireland in 2010. Some coypu escaped from a pet farm in Cork City in 2015 and began breeding on the outskirts of the city. Ten were trapped on the Curraheen River in 2017, but the rodents continued to spread, reaching Dublin via the Royal Canal in 2019. Animals were found along the River Mulkear in 2015. The National Biodiversity Data Centre issued a species alert in 2017, saying that coypu \\"[have] the potential to be a high impact invasive species in Ireland. [‚Ä¶] This species is listed as among 100 of the worst invasive species in Europe.\\" United States Trap for capturing coypu Nutria herbivory \\"is perhaps the least studied or quantified aspect of wetland loss\\". Many coastal restoration projects involve planting vegetation to stabilize marshland, but this requires proper nutria control to be successful. =Louisiana= The Coastwide Nutria Control Program, provides incentives for harvesting nutria. Starting in 2002, Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF) has performed aerial surveys just as they had done for the Nutria Harvest and Wetland Demonstration Program, only it is now under a different program title. Under the Coastwide Nutria Control Program, which also receives funds from CWPPRA, 308,160 nutria were harvested the first year (2002‚Äì2003), revealing 82,080 acres damaged and totaling $1,232,640 in incentive payments paid out to those legally participating in the program. Essentially, once a person receives a license to hunt or trap nutria, then that person is able to capture an unlimited number. When a nutria is captured, the tail is cut off and turned in to a Coastal Environments Inc. official at an approved site. Each nutria tail is worth $5, which is an increase from $4 before the 2006‚Äì2007 season. Nutria harvesting increased drastically during the 2009‚Äì2010 year, with 445,963 nutria tails turned in worth $2,229,815 in incentive payments. Each CEI official keeps record of how many tails have been turned in by each individual per parish, the method used in capture of the nutria, and the location of capture. All of this information is transferred to a database to calculate the density of nutria across the Louisiana coast, and the LDWF combines these data with the results from the aerial surveys to determine the number of nutria remaining in the marshes and the amount of damage they are inflicting on the ecosystem. Another program executed by LDWF involves creating a market of nutria meat for human consumption, though it is still trying to gain public notice. Nutria is a very lean, protein-rich meat, low in fat and cholesterol with the taste, texture, and appearance of rabbit or dark turkey meat. Few pathogens are associated with the meat, but proper heating when cooking should kill them. The quality of the meat and the minimal harmful microorganisms associated with it make nutria meat an \\"excellent food product for export markets\\". Several desirable control methods are currently ineffective for various reasons. Zinc phosphide is the only rodenticide currently registered to control nutria, but it is expensive, remains toxic for months, detoxifies in high humidity and rain, and requires construction of (expensive) floating rafts for placement of the chemical. It is not yet sure how many nontarget species are susceptible to zinc phosphide, but birds and rabbits have been known to die from ingestion. Therefore, this chemical is rarely used, especially not in large-scale projects. Other potential chemical pesticides would be required by the US Environmental Protection Agency to undergo vigorous testing before they could be acceptable to use on nutria. The LDWF has estimated costs for new chemicals to be $300,000 for laboratory, chemistry, and field studies, and $500,000 for a mandatory Environmental Impact Statement. Contraception is not a common form of control, but is preferred by some wildlife managers. It also is expensive to operate - an estimated $6 million annually to drop bait laced with birth-control chemicals. Testing of other potential contraceptives would take about five to eight years and $10 million, with no guarantee of FDA approval. Also, an intensive environmental assessment would have to be completed to determine whether any non-target organisms were affected by the contraceptive chemicals. Neither of these control methods is likely to be used in the near future. In Louisiana, a claimed environmentally sound solution is the killing of nutria to make dog food treats. =Atlantic coast= An eradication program on the Delmarva Peninsula, between Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic coast, where they once numbered in the tens of thousands and had destroyed thousands of acres of marshland, had nearly succeeded by 2012. =California= The first records of nutria invading California dates from the 1940s and 50s, when it was found in the agriculture-rich Central Valley and the south coast of the state, but by the 1970s the animals had been extirpated statewide. They were found again in Merced County in 2017, on the edge of the San Joaquin River Delta. State officials are concerned that they will harm infrastructure that sends water to San Joaquin Valley farms and urban areas. In 2019, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) received nearly $2 million in Governor Gavin Newsom's first budget, and an additional $8.5 million via the Delta Conservancy (a state agency focused on the Delta) to be spent over the course of three years. The state has adopted an eradication campaign based on the successful effort in the Chesapeake Bay, including strategies such as the \\"Judas nutria\\" (in which individualized nutria are caught, sterilized, fitted with radio collars, and released, whereupon they can be tracked by hunters as they return to their colonies) and the use of trained dogs. The state has also reversed a prior \\"no-hunting\\" policy, although hunting the animals does require a license. Gallery Nutria heart.

States with bilateral ties will exchange diplomatic agents such as ambassadors to facilitate dialogues and cooperations. Economic agreements, such as free trade agreements (FTA) or foreign direct investment (FDI), signed by two states, are a common example of bilateralism. Since most economic agreements are signed according to the specific characteristics of the contracting countries to give preferential treatment to each other, not a generalized principle but a situational differentiation is needed. Thus through bilateralism, states can obtain more tailored agreements and obligations that only apply to particular contracting states. However, the states will face a trade-off because it is more wasteful in transaction costs than the multilateral strategy. In a bilateral strategy, a new contract has to be negotiated for each participant. So it tends to be preferred when transaction costs are low and the member surplus, which corresponds to ‚Äúproducer surplus‚Äù in economic terms, is high. Moreover, this will be effective if an influential state wants control over small states from a liberalism perspective, because building a series of bilateral arrangements with small states can increase a state's influence. Examples * Australia and Canada have a bilateral relationship; both have similar governments and share similar values as well as having the same titular head of state. In 1895 the Government of Canada sent John Larke to Sydney to establish a trade commission and in 1935 Canada sent Charles Burchell (Australia's first Canadian High Commissioner) to formalise ties between the two countries. Both nations have been wartime allies, and their trade and economic relations are strong. * India and Nepal have had a bilateral relationship since ancient times even before the birth of the Buddha in 544 BC. In modern times, this traditional relationship has been confirmed by written treaties. The India-Nepal treaty of friendship was signed in July 1950. That provided economically and politically important effects for both countries. In 2011, the two countries signed a new Bilateral Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement. These bilateral treaties have played a significant role in the evolution of international investment law. Citizens of both countries can move across the border freely without passport or visa, live and work in either country and own property and business in either country. Gurkhas form a part of the Indian Army. Millions of Nepalis have been living in India for long periods of time. Oxford Journal * The United States has bilateral relationships with several East Asian countries, particularly South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan. The United States formed a bilateral alliance with Japan during the Security Treaty Between the United States and Japan. The U.S. also formed a bilateral alliance with Korea during the 1953 U.S.-South Korea Status of Forces Agreement and one with the Republic of China during the 1954 Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty. Unlike its relationship with European nations which takes multilateral alliances centered in NATO, the U.S. prefers a direct relationship with each of the East Asian countries. Rather than establishing a security alliance or hosting a summit, the U.S. tends to make a direct connection with each nation. From both historical and political perspectives, every country in the East Asian region can be an opponent or a target to any other. Therefore, it is comparatively difficult to construct multilateral alliances, which depend upon mutual reliance. A main U.S. reason for choosing a bilateral treaty was to avoid conflict, as might have been the case with multilateral treaties (e.g. risk of multilateral treaty defects). An example is the \\"hub and spokes\\" reference, where the U.S. is the \\"hub\\" and the East Asian countries are the \\"spokes\\"; they each have a connection with the U.S. but not with each other. ** There are multiple factors that are unique when discussing why the United States has chosen to form bilateral relations particularly with East Asian countries, in comparison to the multilateral relations, such as NATO. Firstly, the United States had existing and longer relations with countries in Europe. Thus it was easier for the United States to build and form this multilateral bond. Victor Cha states \\"Acheson argued that NATO was the product of a long, deliberative process, that West European powers had carefully developed their plan for collective defense before asking for U.S. help, and most revealing, that the United States viewed NATO as a mutual collective defense arrangement.\\" Another factor which contributed is the geography of East Asia compared to Europe. Because Europe is \\"connected\\", it is better for the security and economy. Whereas in East Asia, states are divided over a large space and is separated by large amounts of water and distance, making it a less admirable condition to form multilateral bonds for the United States. In East Asia, there are also a variety of regimes: communist, authoritarian regimes as well as democratic regimes. In comparison to the states in NATO, who are consisted of democracies, causing a level of difficulty in creating multilateral relations. Another factor is that the states in NATO recognised the same source of threat, which was USSR. This allowed for an agreement amongst these NATO states to form this multilateral relation. However, in the case with East Asia, there was no unified threat. For the ROC (Republic of China, otherwise known as Taiwan), China was seen as the threat. For the ROK (Republic of Korea, otherwise known as South Korea), DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea, otherwise known as North Korea) was the threat. Thus there was a great level of difficulty in the United States forming an alliance with East Asia as the threats were different. Among many of the different explanations behind the United States‚Äô choice of intervening in the bilateral alliances in East Asia, some social historians added that the U.S. decision makers firmly believed that unlike Europe, ‚Äúinferior‚Äù Asians presumably did not possess the level of sophistication and responsibility that was required for the complex organization of the multilateral security arrangements. Christopher Hemmer and Peter J. Katzenstein concluded, ‚Äútrust [was] absent, religion and domestic value were shared in only few cases, and race invoked as a powerful force separating the U.S. from Asia‚Äù. ** Victor Cha proposed the Powerplay (theory) in his article ‚ÄúPowerplay Origins of the U.S. Alliances Systems in Asia‚Äù, which explains the reasons behind the United States‚Äô decision in creating a series of bilateral alliances with East Asian countries. Powerplay is commonly used in any political or social situation when one uses its knowledge or information against others in order to gain benefits using situational advantages the one has. According to the powerplay theory, the alliances were created to both contain and constrain potential rogue allies (rogue state) from performing aggressive behavior that would trigger larger military conflict and involvement. The rogue allies (rogue states) include Taiwan's Kai Shek Chiang, who was publicly planning and looking forward to take back mainland China, and Korea's Syngman Rhee, who wanted to unify the Korean peninsula. The United States was also worried that Japan would recover its regional power in Asia. Cha concludes that the postwar United States planners had selected such a type of security architecture as an attempt to prevent aggression by the East Asian pro-west dictators and to increase leverage and states' dependency on the U.S. economy. ** The U.S.-Japan alliance was a bilateral security order created with the intention of preventing the expansion of Soviet power and communism in the Asia Pacific. The U.S. provided Japan, and the other Asia Pacific countries, with the offer of security protection and access to American markets, technology, and supplies in exchange for providing diplomatic, economic, and logistical support for the U.S., as this, according to John Ikenberry, would lead to the ‚Äúwider, American-centered anti-Communist postwar order\\". , Ikenberry G. John. \\"American Hegemony and East Asian Order.\\" Australian Journal of International Affairs, Vol. 58, No. 3, pp. 354-355, September 2004. * The United States also has a history of bilateral agreements with Panama, beginning with the Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty (1903) which established the United States' right to build a canal and own it and adjacent property across the otherwise-sovereign nation of Panama. This was replaced by The Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal and the Panama Canal Treaty (both signed 1977). A Bilateral Investment Treaty Amendment was signed by the two countries in 2000, and several more limited agreements have been signed between various law-enforcement and financial agencies of the two countries. History There has been a long debate on the merits of bilateralism versus multilateralism. The first rejection of bilateralism came after the First World War when many politicians concluded that the complex pre-war system of bilateral treaties had made war inevitable. This led to the creation of the multilateral League of Nations (which was disbanded in failure after 26 years). A similar reaction against bilateral trade agreements occurred after the Great Depression, when it was argued that such agreements helped produce a cycle of rising tariffs that deepened the economic downturn. Thus, after the Second World War, the West turned to multilateral agreements such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Despite the high profile of modern multilateral systems such as the United Nations and World Trade Organization, most diplomacy is still done at the bilateral level. Bilateralism has a flexibility and ease lacking in most compromise-dependent multilateral systems. In addition, disparities in power, resources, money, armament, or technology are more easily exploitable by the stronger side in bilateral diplomacy, which powerful states might consider as a positive aspect of it, compared to the more consensus-driven multilateral form of diplomacy, where the one state-one vote rule applies. A 2017 study found that bilateral tax treaties, even if intended to \\"coordinate policies between countries to avoid double taxation and encourage international investment\\", had the unintended consequence of allowing \\"multinationals to engage in treaty shopping, states‚Äô fiscal autonomy is limited, and governments tend to maintain lower tax rates.\\" See also * Multilateralism * Unilateralism * Multistakeholderism * Bilateral trade * Bilateral treaty * List of bilateral free trade agreements ReferencesExternal links The Rise of Bilateralism Category:International relations theory ","title":"Bilateralism"},{"id":"429155","text":"Bilateral may refer to any concept including two sides, in particular: *Bilateria, bilateral animals *Bilateralism, the political and cultural relations between two states *Bilateral, occurring on both sides of an organism (Anatomical terms of location ¬ß Medial and lateral) *Bilateral symmetry, symmetry between two sides of an organism *Bilateral filter, an image processing algorithm *Bilateral amplifier, a type of amplifier *Bilateral (album), an album by the band Leprous *Bilateral school, see Partially selective school (England) ","title":"Bilateral"},{"id":"429161","text":"A woman expressing attention, desire and hope.

Physiognomy is based on shapes of the features, and pathognomy on the motions of the features.

Smithson documented the construction of the sculpture in a 32-minute color film also titled Spiral Jetty. Built on the northeastern shore of the Great Salt Lake near Rozel Point in Utah entirely of mud, salt crystals, and basalt rocks, Spiral Jetty forms a , counterclockwise coil jutting from the shore of the lake. In 1999, the artwork was donated to the Dia Art Foundation who consider it one of their 11 locations and sites they manage. Since its initial construction, those interested in its fate have dealt with questions of proposed changes in land use in the area surrounding the sculpture. Dia partners with Great Salt Lake Institute at Westminster College, Holt/Smithson Foundation, and the Utah Museum of Fine Arts at the University of Utah to further advocate for Spiral Jetty. Visitors must ‚Äúleave no trace‚Äù when visiting the site. In order to preserve the work, Dia Art Foundation asks that visitors do not take existing rocks from the artwork, make fire pits, or trample vegetation. There are no facilities at the site so visitors must carry out any waste with them. Description The sculpture is built of mud, precipitated salt crystals, and basalt rocks. The sculpture forms a , counterclockwise coil jutting from the shore of the lake. The sculpture is sometimes visible and sometimes submerged, depending upon the water level of the Great Salt Lake. Construction Person standing in the middle of Spiral Jetty, viewed from the shore Smithson reportedly chose the Rozel Point site based on the blood-red color of the water and its connection with the primordial sea. The red hue of the water is due to the presence of salt- tolerant bacteria and algae that thrive in the extreme 27 percent salinity of the lake's north arm, which was isolated from freshwater sources by the building of a causeway by the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1959. Smithson was reportedly attracted to the Rozel Point site because of the stark anti- pastoral beauty and industrial remnants from nearby Golden Spike National Historic Site, as well as an old pier and a few unused oil rigs. While observing the construction of the piece from a helicopter, Smithson reportedly remarked \\"et in Utah ego\\" as a counterpoint to the pastoral Baroque painting et in Arcadia ego by Nicolas Poussin. To move the rock into the lake, Smithson hired Bob Phillips of nearby Ogden, Utah, who used two dump trucks, a large tractor, and a front end loader to haul the 6,650 tons of rock and earth into the lake. It is reported that Smithson had a difficult time convincing a contractor to accept the unusual proposal. Spiral Jetty was the first of his pieces to require the acquisition of land rights and earthmoving equipment. He began work on the jetty in April 1970. The work was actually constructed twice; the first time requiring six days. After contemplating the result for two days, Smithson called the crew back and had the shape altered to its present configuration, an effort requiring moving 7,000 tons of basalt rock during an additional three days. Phillips' son appeared on the PBS Antiques Roadshow program in 2017 with a photograph and collection of documents related to the building of the project. Construction contractor Robert \\"Bob\\" Phillips (August 5, 1939 ‚Äì April 11, 2016) worked for 40 years in construction, including positions as a bid estimator for Utah contracting companies Jack B. Parsons Construction, and Whitaker Construction. He often told people that his best-known construction job was ‚Äúthe only thing I ever built that ... was to look at and had no purpose.‚Äù Phillips was an expert at construction materials and techniques and was proficient in projecting the cost and effort required for a projected job. Phillips was uneasy about using earth-moving equipment in the muck around Rozel Point, where Smithson wanted to create the jetty. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs tricky working out on that lake,‚Äù Phillips said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs lots of backhoes buried out there.‚Äù Smithson, in hip-wader boots, was in full command on the site. ‚ÄúWhen we got out there, he just took over,‚Äù Phillips said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think he had done any geology work or anything on it. He just had in his mind what it should look like.‚Ä¶ He just had the eye for it. I assume it was the artist in him.‚Äù Smithson actually had Phillips‚Äô crew build the jetty twice. The first took six days of work, using heavy equipment, but two days later, Smithson had Phillips‚Äô team redo it, to create today's spiral shape. Phillips said Smithson liked to use words like ‚Äúentropy‚Äù to describe the interaction of the basalt and the lake. Robert Phillips was born in Spanish Fork, Utah, and grew up in Cache Valley. He married Judy Crocket in January 1961. They had four children. He earned a degree in entomology from Utah State University. He died of cancer in Ogden.Sean P. Means, Contractor brought Spiral Jetty to life, Salt Lake Tribune, April 19, 2016, p. A11 Ownership The sculpture was financed in part by a $9,000 USD grant from the Virginia Dwan Gallery of New York. In 1999, through the generosity of the artist Nancy Holt, Smithson‚Äôs wife, and the Estate of Robert Smithson, Spiral Jetty was donated to Dia Art Foundation. As owner and custodian of Spiral Jetty, Dia Art Foundation maintains the lease of Utah sovereign lands in Great Salt Lake upon which the artwork is sited, and is responsible for the stewardship of this iconic earthwork. Smithson died in a plane crash in Texas three years after finishing the Spiral Jetty. Preservation At the time Dia acquired Spiral Jetty, the work was fully submerged in the lake. Beginning in the early 2000s, however, sustained drought in Utah caused water levels to recede, and Spiral Jetty became visible for the first prolonged period in its history. As a result, the prominence of Spiral Jetty has risen dramatically over the past decade, increasing both the visitorship to the site and the public‚Äôs interest in the artwork, at the local, national, and international levels. Dia is committed to maintaining a photographic record of the work and documenting changes to the piece over time. Dia collaborates with two organizations in Utah, the Great Salt Lake Institute at Westminster College (GSLI) and the Utah Museum of Fine Arts (UMFA) at the University of Utah, who have been deeply involved in the advocacy of Spiral Jetty over the years. The issue of preservation has been complicated by ambiguous statements by Smithson, who expressed an admiration for entropy in that he intended his works to mimic earthly attributes in that they remain in a state of arrested disruption and not be kept from destruction. Dia's website states that visitors are prohibited from removing rocks from the artwork or from stepping on vegetation that is on the grounds of the artwork. Visitors are also prohibited from constructing fire pits near the artwork or on the parking lot. If caught, visitors will face strict fines. The website also states that visitors are instructed to carry out their waste. In 2008 plans were announced for exploratory oil drilling approximately five miles from the jetty.Kennedy, Randy. The New York Times. \\"Artists Rally for Spiral Jetty in Utah\\" February 6, 2008 This was met with strong resistance from artists, and the state of Utah received more than 3,000 e-mails about the plan, most opposing the drilling.Johnson, Kirk. The New York Times, March 27, 2008. \\"Plans to Mix Oil Drilling and Art Clash in Utah\\" Film In 1970 during the construction of the jetty, Robert Smithson wrote and directed a 32-minute color film, Spiral Jetty. The film was shot by Smithson and his wife Nancy Holt, and funded by Virginia Dwan and Douglas Christmas. The film documented the construction process and also formed an ancillary artwork. Smithson combines his interest in geology, paleontology, astronomy, mythology and cinema, stating that he had an interest in documenting \\"the earth's history\\". In conjunction with filmed sequences of the jetty, Smithson incorporates footage of dinosaurs in a natural history museum and the ripped pages from a history text. During this scene, Smithson refers to the institutions of history: \\"the earth's history seems at times like a story recorded in a book, each page of which is torn into small pieces. Many of the pages and some of the pieces of each page are missing\\". Smithson's narrative supports an alternative view of historical discourse and the art object's placement or production outside of the museum institution. His writings also indicate that the helicopter film sequences over the jetty were a method of \\"recapitulating the scale of the jetty\\". By visually disorienting the viewer, Smithson is able to negate a time and place for the materiality of the artwork or create what he calls a \\"cosmic rupture\\".Smithson, Robert. The Spiral Jetty, 1970, published in Robert Smithson: The Collected Writings, edited by Nancy Holt, New York University Press, pp. 109-113 Through this state, the viewer is meant to be unable to categorize or classify the site, and will be left in a state free from the dialect of history.  Legacy  The work was named Utah's official state work of land art in 2017. April 2020 marks the Spiral Jetty's 50th anniversary, which Smithson referred to shortly before his untimely death in 1973 as \\"the work of the decade\\".

Biography Auerbach, who was Jewish and born in Berlin, was trained in the German philological tradition and would eventually become, along with Leo Spitzer, one of its best-known scholars.Auerbach (1993), p. xiii After participating as a combatant in World War I, he earned a doctorate in 1921 at University of Greifswald, served as librarian at the Prussian State Library for some years, and in 1929 became a member of the philology faculty at the University of Marburg, publishing a well-received study entitled Dante: Poet of the Secular World. With the rise of National Socialism Auerbach was forced to vacate his position in 1935. Exiled from Nazi Germany, he took up residence in Istanbul, Turkey, where he wrote Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature (1946), generally considered his masterwork.Wellek, Rene. \\"Erich Auerbach (1892‚Äì1957).\\" Comparative Literature 10: 1 (Winter, 1958), 93‚Äì95.

The design originates in the Late Middle Ages as a symbol of death and especially as a memento mori on tombstones. In modern contexts, it is generally used as a hazard symbol that warns of danger, usually in regard to poisonous substances, such as deadly chemicals. History of the symbol humeri in ossuaries, as in the example above from Sedlec (Czech Republic). The symbol is an ancient one, becoming widespread with the medieval Danse Macabre symbolism.

It became associated with piracy from the 14th century onwards, possibly even earlier. By the 15th century, the symbol had developed into its familiar form. The symbol came to be used to mark the entrances of many graveyards, particularly Spanish cemeteries and also as an easily identifiable warning on poison and other dangerous liquid and powder containers since the 19th century. The skull and crossbones were also popular on crucifixes made in Northern Europe during the 18th and 19th century, worn on rosaries or as larger wall hangings in religious orders Memento Mori and symbolising Christ's victory over death.

Symbol for poison international pictogramme for poisonous substances. The skull and crossbones has long been a standard symbol for poison. In 1829, New York State required the labeling of all containers of poisonous substances. The skull and crossbones symbol appears to have been used for that purpose since the 1850s. Previously a variety of motifs had been used, including the Danish \\"+ + +\\" and drawings of skeletons. In the 1870s poison manufacturers around the world began using bright cobalt bottles with a variety of raised bumps and designs (to enable easy recognition in the dark) to indicate poison, but by the 1880s the skull and cross bones had become ubiquitous, and the brightly coloured bottles lost their association. As the skull-and-crossbones symbol has also entered popular culture in the context of piracy and is undoubtedly its most well known icon, and since cartoonish pirates have become popular characters with children, there have been concerns that the \\"poison\\" symbol might have the effect of attracting the curiosity of small children familiar with \\"pirates\\" as depicted as a toy or play theme. For this reason, in the United States there has been a proposal to replace the skull and crossbones by the \\"Mr. Yuk\\" symbol. However, Mr. Yuk and his graphic rendering are registered trademarks and service marks of his creator, the UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, and the rendering itself is additionally protected by copyright. This means that the name and graphic image cannot be used without a license from the owner--unlike the Skull and crossbones, which is in the public domain.

It is considered an historic branch of personality psychology, which extended into psychoanalysis and sociology. The name dates from 1867, having been introduced by the German philosopher Julius Bahnsen, though the discipline itself dates back to classical antiquity. In German psychology, the term character was often used in place of personality. As such, characterology was the study of personality, its development, and its differences between individuals. The term personality however, which was dominant in English use, came to be preferred after the end of World War II. In the 1920s, the term characterology was appropriated by American writer Leander Hamilton McCormick to promote a physiognomical and phrenological pseudoscience. McCormick's views have further been regarded as scientific racism.

It is endemic to the California Floristic Province. It is the sole species in the genus Umbellularia. The tree was formerly known as Oreodaphne californica. In Yuki, it is called p≈çl‚Äô-cum ≈çl. In Oregon, this tree is known as Oregon myrtle, while in California it is called California bay laurel, which may be shortened to California bay or California laurel. It has also been called pepperwood, spicebush, cinnamon bush, peppernut tree, headache tree, mountain laurel, and balm of heaven. The tree's pungent leaves have a similar flavor to bay leaves, though stronger, and it may be mistaken for bay laurel. The dry wood has a color range from blonde (like maple) to brown (like walnut). It is considered an excellent tonewood and is sought after by luthiers and woodworkers. The tree is a host of the pathogen that causes sudden oak death. Habitat This tree, on Permanente Creek in Rancho San Antonio County Park, Santa Clara County, California, is one of the largest of its species in the state. Since this photograph, the tree was split, and half the tree broke off and fell in a storm. The other half is still thriving, and has more or less resumed the original canopy shape. Lignotuber near ground level provides fire-resistant storage of energy and sprouting buds if fire damage requires replacement of the trunk or limbs. This tree mostly inhabits redwood forests, California mixed woods, yellow pine forest, and oak woodlands. Bays occur in oak woodland close to the coast, and in northern California where moisture is sufficient, usually in or near riparian areas. During the Miocene, oak-laurel forests were found in Central and Southern California. Typical tree species included oaks ancestral to present-day California oaks, and an assemblage of trees from the laurel family, including Nectandra, Ocotea, Persea, and Umbellularia. Only one native species from the laurel family, Umbellularia californica, remains in California today. Distribution In the north, it reaches its distributional limit through southwest Oregon to (infrequently) Newport, Lincoln County, Oregon, on the coast, extending from there south through California to San Diego County. It is also found in the western foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains. It occurs at altitudes from sea level up to 1600 m. An isolated, more northern occurrence of the species can be found in Tacoma, Washington, around Snake Lake near the Tacoma Nature Center.http://www.pnwherbaria.org/data/results.php?DisplayAs=WebPage&ExcludeCultivated;=Y&GroupBy;=ungrouped&SortBy;=Year&SortOrder;=DESC&SearchAllHerbaria;=Y&QueryCount;=1&IncludeSynonyms1;=Y&Genus1;=Umbellularia&Species1;=californica&Zoom;=4&Lat;=55&Lng;=-135&PolygonCount;=0 There are also two recorded instances of trees growing in coastal British Columbia.http://bridge.botany.ubc.ca/herbarium/details.php?db=vwsp.fmp12&layout;=vwsp_web_details&recid;=160896&ass;_num=V227198http://bridge.botany.ubc.ca/herbarium/details.php?db=vwsp.fmp12&layout;=vwsp_web_details&recid;=91360&ass;_num=V209829 Naturalized occurrence of species in Snake Lake Park, Tacoma, Washington Description It is an evergreen tree growing to 30 m tall with a trunk up to 80 cm thick. The largest recorded tree is in Mendocino County, California, and measured (as of 1997) 108 feet (33 m) in height and 119 feet (36 m) in spread. The leaves are entire and lance-shaped about long. They may substitute for the Mediterranean bay leaf in cooking. The fragrant leaves are smooth- edged and lance-shaped, 3‚Äì10 cm long and 1.5‚Äì3 cm broad, similar to the related bay laurel, though usually narrower, and without the crinkled margin of that species. The flowers are small, yellow or yellowish-green, produced in small umbels (hence the scientific name Umbellularia, \\"little umbel\\"). Unlike other \\"bay laurels\\" of the genus Laurus, Umbellularia has perfect flowers (male and female parts in the same flower). The fruit, also known as \\"California bay nut\\", is a round and green berry 2‚Äì2.5 cm long and 2 cm broad, lightly spotted with yellow, maturing purple. Under the thin, leathery skin, it consists of an oily, fleshy covering over a single hard, thin-shelled pit, and resembles a miniature avocado. Umbellularia is in fact closely related to the avocado's genus Persea, within the family Lauraceae. The fruit ripens around October‚ÄìNovember in the native range. Uses=Historical usage Umbellularia has long been valued for its many uses by Native Americans throughout the tree's range, including the Cahuilla, Chumash, Ohlone, Pomo, Miwok, Yuki, Coos, and Salinan people. The Concow tribe call the plant s≈ç-ƒì‚Äô-b√§ (Konkow language). Poultices of Umbellularia leaves were used to treat rheumatism and neuralgias. A tea was made from the leaves to treat stomach aches, colds, sore throats, and to clear up mucus in the lungs. The leaves were steeped in hot water to make an infusion that was used to wash sores. The Pomo and Yuki tribes of Mendocino County treated headaches by placing a single leaf in the nostril or bathing the head with a laurel leaf infusion. The chemical responsible for the headache-inducing effects of Umbellularia is known as umbellulone. Both the flesh and the inner kernel of the fruit have been used as food by Native Americans. The fatty outer flesh of the fruit, or mesocarp, is palatable raw for only a brief time when ripe; prior to this the volatile aromatic oils are too strong, and afterwards the flesh quickly becomes bruised, like that of an overripe avocado.FeralKevin: Foraging, Bushcraft, Permaculture, and Rewilding blog. Native Americans dried the fruits in the sun and ate only the lower third of the dried mesocarp, which is less pungent. The hard inner seed underneath the fleshy mesocarp, like the pit of an avocado, cleaves readily in two when its thin shell is cracked. The pit itself was traditionally roasted to a dark chocolate-brown color, removing much of the pungency and leaving a spicy flavor. Roasted, shelled \\"bay nuts\\" were eaten whole, or ground into powder and prepared as a drink which resembles unsweetened chocolate. The flavor, depending on roast level, has been described variously as \\"roast coffee,\\" \\"dark chocolate\\" or \\"burnt popcorn\\". The powder might also be used in cooking or pressed into cakes and dried for winter storage. It has been speculated that the nuts contain a stimulant; however this possible effect has been little documented by biologists. Modern usage The leaf can be used in cooking, but is spicier and \\"headier\\" than the Mediterranean bay leaf, and should be used in smaller quantity. Umbellularia leaf imparts a somewhat stronger camphor/cinnamon flavor compared to the Mediterranean bay. Some modern-day foragers and wild food enthusiasts have adopted Native American practices regarding the edible roasted fruit, the bay nut. Umbellularia californica is also used in woodworking. It is considered a tonewood, used to construct the backs and sides of acoustic guitars. The wood is very hard and fine, and is also made into bowls, spoons, and other small items and sold as \\"myrtlewood\\". It is also grown as an ornamental tree, both in its native area, and further north up the Pacific coast to Vancouver in Canada, and in western Europe. It is occasionally used for firewood. According to a modern Miwok recipe for acorn soup, \\"it is essential that you add a generous amount of California laurel\\" when storing acorns to dry, to keep insects away from the acorns. One popular use for the leaves is to put them between the bed mattresses to get rid of, or prevent, flea infestations. The wood is used as lumber in furniture making, especially highly figured specimens. = \\"Myrtlewood\\" money = \\"Myrtlewood\\" is the only wood still in use as a base \\"metal\\" for legal tender. During the 1933 \\"interregnum of despair\\" between Franklin Roosevelt's election and his inauguration, the only bank in the town of North Bend, Oregon‚Äîthe First National‚Äîwas forced to temporarily close its doors, precipitating a cash-flow crisis for the City of North Bend. The city solved this problem by minting its own currency, using myrtlewood discs printed on a newspaper press. These coins, in denominations from 25 cents to $10, were used to pay employees, with the city promising to redeem them for cash as soon as it became available. However, when the bank reopened and the city appealed for people to bring their myrtlewood money in to redeem it, many opted to keep their tokens as collector's items. After several appeals, the city announced that the tokens would remain legal tender in the city of North Bend in perpetuity. The unredeemed tokens have become very valuable, because of scarcity and historical interest. Fewer than 10 full sets are believed to exist. Sudden oak death Umbellularia californica is a host of Phytophthora ramorum, the pathogen that causes the disease sudden oak death. It is important in this sense because it is one of two tree species (tanoak is the other) on which the pathogen readily produces spores.

She was named for Captain Nathan Hale (1755‚Äì1776), a Connecticut schoolteacher who served in the Continental Army and known most famously for giving his life as a spy during the American Revolutionary War. Construction and commissioning The contract for Nathan Hales construction was awarded on 3 February 1961. Construction began on 2 October 1961 by the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics in Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 12 January 1963, sponsored by the wife of Admiral George Whelan Anderson, Jr., and commissioned on 23 November 1963 in a subdued ceremony due to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy the day before. Operational history Nathan Hale entered service on 21 May 1964 with her home port at Charleston, South Carolina, and performed deterrent patrols as a member of the United States Atlantic Fleet. She was originally outfitted with the Polaris missile system and in the 1970s underwent conversion to the Poseidon missile system. In the period 1967-68 she underwent overhaul and refueling, and was subsequently transferred to the Pacific Fleet, home ported in Pearl Harbor, HI, and operating out of Agana, Guam. By April 1986 she had completed 69 deterrent patrols in the Atlantic and Pacific. Decommissioning and disposal Nathan Hale was decommissioned on 3 November 1986 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 31 January 1987. Ex-Nathan Hale entered the Navy's Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Bremerton, Washington on 2 October 1991. Recycling of Ex-Nathan Hale was completed on 5 April 1994. In fiction Nathan Hales hull number, \\"623\\", was used on the submarine portraying the fictional U.S. Navy nuclear submarine USS Sawfish in the 1959 film On the Beach. However, the U.S. Navy did not cooperate in the making of On the Beach, and the submarine portraying USS Sawfish was in reality the British Royal Navy diesel-electric submarine , which bore no connection to USS Nathan Hale. Nathan Hale was the name of the U.S. Navy nuclear submarine in the 1967 novel \\"Pre-Empt\\" by John R. Vorhies. Pub Date: Oct. 23rd, 1967, Publisher: Regnery. The novel involved a U.S. Navy nuclear missile submarine commander who goes rogue and threatens to launch his submarine's missiles unless all the world's nuclear powers surrender their nuclear weapons to an international body.

The Liseuse is an antique desk form which was popular in France during the 18th century and produced again in the first part of the 19th century. It was copied in several continental countries and in the United Kingdom. Many Liseuses are polyvalent pieces of furniture with a double or triple use.

Hansen. \\"'Buchanan's Blunder' The Utah War, 1857‚Äì1858\\", in Military Affairs 25, 3 (1961): 121‚Äì131 the Mormon War, or the Mormon Rebellion was an armed confrontation between Mormon settlers in the Utah Territory and the armed forces of the United States government. The confrontation lasted from May 1857 to July 1858. There were some casualties, mostly non-Mormon civilians. The war had no notable military battles.  Overview  In 1857‚Äì58, President James Buchanan sent U.S. forces to the Utah Territory in what became known as the Utah Expedition. The Mormons, fearful that the large U.S. military force had been sent to annihilate them and having faced persecution in other areas,Missouri Executive Order 44 made preparations for defense. Though bloodshed was to be avoided, and the U.S. government also hoped that its purpose might be attained without the loss of life, both sides prepared for war. The Mormons manufactured or repaired firearms, turned scythes into bayonets, and burnished and sharpened long-unused sabres. Rather than engaging the Army directly, Mormon strategy was one of hindering and weakening them. Daniel H. Wells, Lieutenant-General of the Nauvoo Legion, instructed Major Joseph Taylor: > On ascertaining the locality or route of the troops, proceed at once to > annoy them in every possible way. Use every exertion to stampede their > animals and set fire to their trains. Burn the whole country before them and > on their flanks. Keep them from sleeping, by night surprises; blockade the > road by felling trees or destroying the river fords where you can. Watch for > opportunities to set fire to the grass on their windward, so as, if > possible, to envelop their trains. Leave no grass before them that can be > burned. Keep your men concealed as much as possible, and guard against > surprise. The Mormons blocked the army's entrance into the Salt Lake Valley, and weakened the U.S. Army by hindering them from receiving provisions. pp. 499, 500, 511 The confrontation between the Mormon militia, called the Nauvoo Legion, and the U.S. Army involved some destruction of property and a few brief skirmishes in what is today southwestern Wyoming, but no battles occurred between the contending military forces. At the height of the tensions, on September 11, 1857, between 95 and 120 California-bound settlers from Arkansas, Missouri and other states, including unarmed men, women and children, were killed in remote southwestern Utah by a group of local Mormon militia. They first claimed that the migrants were killed by Indians but it was proven otherwise. This event was later called the Mountain Meadows Massacre and the motives behind the incident remain unclear. The Aiken massacre took place the following month. In October 1857, Mormons arrested six Californians traveling through Utah and charged them with being spies for the U.S. Army. They were released but were later murdered and robbed of their stock and $25,000. pp. 562‚Äì563\\"Brigham Young and Wild Bill Hickman\\", Salt Lake City Messenger, Newsletter #77, February 1991, Utah Lighthouse Ministry Other incidents of violence have also been linked to the Utah War, including an Indian attack on the Mormon mission of Fort Lemhi in eastern Oregon Territory, modern day Idaho. They killed two Mormons and wounded several others. The historian Brigham Madsen notes, \\"[T]he responsibility for the [Fort Limhi raid] lay mainly with the Bannock.\\"William G. Hartley, \\"Dangerous Outpost: Thomas Corless and the Fort Limhi/Salmon River Mission\\", Mormon Historical Studies, Fall 2001, pp 135‚Äì162. Retrieved 2008-04-10. David Bigler concludes that the raid was probably caused by members of the Utah Expedition who were trying to replenish their stores of livestock which had been stolen by Mormon raiders.David L. Bigler, Fort Limhi: The Mormon Adventure in Oregon Territory, 1855‚Äì1858Leonard Arrington, Brigham Young: American Moses, 255 Taking all incidents into account, MacKinnon estimates that approximately 150 people died as a direct result of the year-long Utah War, including the 120 migrants killed at Mountain Meadows. He points out that this was close to the number of people killed during the seven-year contemporaneous struggle in \\"Bleeding Kansas\\".William P. MacKinnon, \\"Loose in the Stacks: A Half Century with the Utah War and Its Legacy\\", Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, Vol. 40, No. 1, 43, 60. In the end, negotiations between the United States and the Latter- day Saints resulted in a full pardon for the Mormons (except those involved in the Mountain Meadows murders), the transfer of Utah's governorship from church President Brigham Young to non-Mormon Alfred Cumming, and the peaceful entrance of the U.S. Army into Utah. Background The Utah Territory (blue with black outline) and proposed State of Deseret (dotted line). Modern map underlaid for reference. Exodus to the Utah Territory The Mormon Trail from Illinois to Great Salt Lake City. Old Spanish Trail, the southern route into California. Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), often called Mormon pioneers, began settling in what is now Utah (then part of Alta California in the Centralist Republic of Mexico) in the summer of 1847. Mormon pioneers began leaving the United States for Utah after a series of severe conflicts with neighboring communities in Missouri and Illinois resulted, in 1844, in the death of Joseph Smith, Jr., founder of the Latter-day Saint movement. Brigham Young and other LDS Church leaders believed that the isolation of Utah would secure the rights of Mormons, and would ensure the free practice of their religion. Although the United States had gained control of the settled parts of Alta California and Nuevo M√©xico in 1846 in the early stages of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, legal transfer of the Mexican Cession to the U.S. came only with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ending the war in 1848. LDS Church leaders understood that they were not \\"leaving the political orbit of the United States\\", nor did they want to.Sarah Gordon (2002), The Mormon Question: Polygamy and Constitutional Conflict in Nineteenth Century America, p. 109 When gold was discovered in California in 1848 at Sutter's Mill, which sparked the famous California Gold Rush, thousands of migrants began moving west on trails that passed directly through territory settled by Mormon pioneers. Although the migrants brought opportunities for trade, they also ended the Mormons' short-lived isolation. In 1849, the Mormons proposed that a large part of the territory which they inhabited be incorporated into the United States as the State of Deseret. Their primary concern was to be governed by men of their own choosing rather than \\"unsympathetic carpetbag appointees\\", whom they believed would be sent from Washington, D.C. if their region were given territorial status, as was customary.Peter Crawley, \\"The Constitution of the State of Deseret\\", BYU Studies, 29 (4) p. 7 (1989) They believed that only through a state run by church leadership could they maintain their religious freedom. The U.S. Congress created the Utah Territory as part of the Compromise of 1850. President Millard Fillmore selected Brigham Young, President of the LDS Church, as the first governor of the Territory. The Mormons were pleased by the appointment, but gradually the amicable relationship between Mormons and the federal government broke down. Governor Brigham Young was appointed to office by President Millard Fillmore in 1850. President James Buchanan was inaugurated in March 1857. The Presidential campaign of 1856 featured extensive denunciation of polygamy and Mormon governance in Utah. Senator Stephen A. Douglas was a leading proponent of popular sovereignty. Polygamy, popular sovereignty, and slavery At these times, the leadership of the LDS Church supported polygamy or \\"plural marriage\\" as it was called by the Mormons. It is estimated that 20-25% of Latter-day Saints were members of polygamous households with the practice involving approximately one third of Mormon women who reached marriageable age. The LDS Church in territorial Utah viewed plural marriage as religious doctrine until 1890, when it was removed as an official practice of the Church by Wilford Woodruff. However, the rest of American society rejected polygamy, and some commentators accused the Mormons of gross immorality. During the Presidential Election of 1856 a key plank of the newly formed Republican Party's platform was a pledge \\"to prohibit in the territories those twin relics of barbarism: polygamy and slavery\\".GOP Convention of 1856 in Philadelphia, Independence Hall Association Website The Republicans associated the Democratic principle of popular sovereignty with the party's acceptance of polygamy in Utah, and turned this accusation into a formidable political weapon. Popular sovereignty was the theoretical basis of the Compromise of 1850 and the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act of 1854. This concept was meant to remove the divisive issue of slavery in the Territories from national debate, allowing local decision making, and forestalling armed conflict between the North and South. But during the campaign, the Republican Party denounced the theory as protecting polygamy. Leading Democrats such as Stephen A. Douglas, formerly an ally of the Latter- day Saints, began to denounce Mormonism in order to save the concept of popular sovereignty for issues related to slavery. The Democrats believed that American attitudes toward polygamy had the potential of derailing the compromise on slavery. For the Democrats, attacks on Mormonism had the dual purpose of disentangling polygamy from popular sovereignty, and distracting the nation from the ongoing battles over slavery. Theodemocracy Many east-coast politicians, such as President James Buchanan, were alarmed by the semi-theocratic dominance of the Utah Territory under Brigham Young. Young had been appointed territorial Governor under Millard Fillmore. In addition to popular election, many early LDS Church leaders received quasi-political administrative appointments at both the territorial and federal level that coincided with their ecclesiastical roles, including the powerful probate judges. In analogy to the federal procedure, these executive and judicial appointments were confirmed by the Territorial Legislature, which largely consisted of popularly elected Latter-day Saints. Additionally, LDS Church leaders counseled Latter-day Saints to use ecclesiastical arbitration to resolve disputes among church members before resorting to the more explicit legal system. Both President Buchanan and the U.S. Congress saw these acts as obstructing, if not subverting, the operation of legitimate institutions of the United States. Numerous newspaper articles continued to sensationalize Mormon beliefs and exaggerated earlier accounts of conflicts with frontier settlers. These stories led many Americans to believe that Mormon leaders were petty tyrants and that Mormons were determined to create a Zionist, polygamous kingdom in the newly acquired territories. Many felt that these sensationalized beliefs, along with early communitarian practices of the United Order, also violated the principles of republicanism as well as the philosophy of laissez-faire economics. James Strang, a rival to Brigham Young who also claimed succession to the leadership of the church after Joseph Smith's death, elevated these fears by proclaiming himself a king and resettling his followers on Beaver Island in Lake Michigan, after the main body of the LDS Church had fled to Utah. People also believed that Brigham Young maintained power through a paramilitary organization called the Danites. The Danites were formed by a group of Mormons in Missouri in 1838. Most scholars believe that following the end of the Mormon War in the winter of 1838, the unit was partially disbanded.While Bagley and others believe that Mormon culture was inherently violent, Thomas Alexander and others conclude that Utah Territory was less violent than other contemporaneous societies. These factors contributed to the popular belief that Mormons \\"were oppressed by a religious tyranny and kept in submission only by some terroristic arm of the Church ... [However] no Danite band could have restrained the flight of freedom-loving men from a Territory possessed of many exits; yet a flood of emigrants poured into Utah each year, with only a trickle ... ebbing back.\\" Federal appointees The White House in 1846. The federal government maintained significant control over territories such as Utah, and the President chose federal officers for the territories with the advice and consent of the Senate. The appointments did not require the approval of the territory's inhabitants. These circumstances were not helped by the relationship between \\"Gentile\\" (non-Mormon) federal appointees and the Mormon territorial leadership. The territory's Organic Act held that the governor, federal judges, and other important territorial positions were to be filled by appointees chosen by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, but without any reference to the will of Utah's population‚Äîas was standard for all territorial administration. Some federal officials sent by the President maintained essentially harmonious relationships with the Mormons. For instance, from 1853‚Äì1855, the territorial supreme court was composed of two non-Mormons and one Mormon. However, both of these non-Mormons were well respected in the Latter-day Saint community, and were genuinely mourned upon their deaths. Others had severe difficulties adjusting to the Mormon-dominated territorial government and the unique Mormon culture. Historian Norman Furniss writes that although some of these appointees were basically honest and well- meaning, many were highly prejudiced against the Mormons even before they arrived in the territory and woefully unqualified for their positions, while a few were down-right reprobates. On the other hand, the Mormons had no patience for the federal domination entailed in territorial status, and often showed defiance toward the representatives of the federal government. In addition, while the Saints sincerely declared their loyalty to the United States and celebrated the Fourth of July every year with unabashed patriotism, they were undisguisedly critical of the federal government, which they felt had driven them out from their homes in the east. Like the contemporary abolitionists, Latter-day Saint leaders declared that the judgments of God would be meted out upon the nation for its unrighteousness. Brigham Young echoed the opinion of many Latter-day Saints when he declared \\"I love the government and the Constitution of the United States, but I do not love the damned rascals that administer the government.\\"J Keith Melville, Theory and Practice of Church and State During the Brigham Young Era at 47‚Äì48 The Mormons also maintained a governmental and legal regime in \\"Zion\\", which they believed was perfectly permissible under the Constitution, but which was fundamentally different from that espoused in the rest of the country. The Latter-day Saints and federal appointees in the Territory faced continual dispute. These conflicts regarded relations with the Indians (who often differentiated between \\"Americans\\" and \\"Mormons\\"), acceptance of the common law, the criminal jurisdiction of probate courts, the Mormon use of ecclesiastical courts rather than the federal court system for civil matters, the legitimacy of land titles, water rights, and various other issues. Many of the federal officers were also appalled by the practice of polygamy and the Mormon belief system in general, and would harangue the Mormons for their \\"lack of morality\\" in public addresses. This already tense situation was further exacerbated by a period of intense religious revival starting in late 1856 dubbed the \\"Mormon Reformation\\". Beginning in 1851, a number of federal officers, some claiming that they feared for their physical safety, left their Utah appointments for the east. The stories of these \\"Runaway Officials\\" convinced the new President that the Mormons were nearing a state of rebellion against the authority of the United States. According to LDS historians James B. Allen and Glen M. Leonard, the most influential information came from William W. Drummond, an associate justice of the Utah territorial supreme court who began serving in 1854. Drummond's letter of resignation of March 30, 1857 contained charges that Young's power set aside the rule of law in the territory, that the Mormons had ignored the laws of Congress and the Constitution, and that male Mormons acknowledged no law but the priesthood. > He further charged the Church with murder, destruction of federal court > records, harassment of federal officers, and slandering the federal > government. He concluded by urging the president to appoint a governor who > was not a member of the Church and to send with him sufficient military aid > to enforce his rule.Allen and Leonard, pp. 298‚Äì299 The U.S. Capitol in 1846. American lawmakers were deeply suspicious about Mormonism, their government, and the practice of polygamy. This account was further supported by Territorial Chief Justice Kinney in reports to Washington, where he recited examples of what he believed to be Brigham Young's perversion of Utah's judicial system and further urged his removal from office and the establishment of a one-regiment U.S. Army garrison in the territory. There were further charges of treason, battery, theft, and fraud made by other officials including Federal Surveyors Utah Expedition pp. 114‚Äì124 and Federal Indian Agents. Utah Expedition pp. 124‚Äì211 Furniss states that most federal reports from Utah to Washington \\"left unclear whether the [Mormons] habitually kicked their dogs; otherwise their calendar of infamy in Utah was complete\\". As early as 1852, Dr. John M. Bernhisel, Utah's Mormon delegate to Congress, had suggested that an impartial committee be sent to investigate the actual conditions in the territory. This call for an investigation was renewed during the crisis of 1857 by Bernhisel and even by Senator Stephen A. Douglas. However, the President would not wait. Under massive popular and political pressure, President Buchanan decided to take decisive action against the Mormons soon after his inauguration on 4 March 1857. President Buchanan first decided to appoint a new governor in place of Brigham Young. The position was offered to several individuals who refused, and the President finally settled on Alfred Cumming during the summer. While Young became aware of the change in territorial administration through press reports and other sources, he received no official notification of his replacement until Cumming arrived in the Territory in November 1857. Buchanan also decided to send a force of 2,500 army troops to build a post in Utah and to act as a posse comitatus once the new governor had been installed. They were ordered not to take offensive action against the Mormons, but to enter the territory, enforce the laws under the direction of the new governor, and defend themselves if attacked. Troop movements=July‚ÄìNovember 1857: tactical standoff Colonel Albert Sidney Johnston led the Utah Expedition to put down a Mormon rebellion against the Union. In the Civil War, he became a high ranking general in the Confederate Army and was killed at the Battle of Shiloh on April 6, 1862. Daniel H. Wells was a member of the LDS Church First Presidency, commander of the Nauvoo Legion, and later mayor of Salt Lake City. =Preparations= Although the Utah Expedition had begun to gather as early as May under orders from General Winfield Scott, the first soldiers did not leave Fort Leavenworth, Kansas until 18 July 1857. The troops were originally to be led by Gen. William S. Harney. However, affairs in \\"Bleeding Kansas\\" forced Harney to remain behind to deal with skirmishes between pro-slavery and free-soiler militants. The Expedition's cavalry, the 2nd Dragoons, was kept in Kansas for the same reason. Because of Harney's unavailability, Col. Edmund Alexander was charged with the first detachment of troops headed for Utah. However, overall command was assigned to Col. Albert Sidney Johnston who did not leave Kansas until much later. As it was, July was already far into the campaigning season, and the army and their supply train were unprepared for winter in the Rocky Mountains. The army was not given instructions on how to react in case of resistance. The Mormons' lack of information on the army's mission created apprehension and led to their making defensive preparations. While rumors spread during the spring that an army was coming to Utah and that Brigham Young had been replaced as governor, this was not confirmed until late July. Mormon mail contractors, including Porter Rockwell and Abraham O. Smoot, received word in Missouri that their contract was canceledYoung, Brigham (September 13, 1857), \\"The United States and Utah Army\\", Journal of Discourses, 5: 226 and that the Army was on the move. The men quickly returned to Salt Lake City and notified Brigham Young that U.S. Army units were marching on the Mormons. Young announced the approach of the army to a large group of Latter-day Saints gathered in Big Cottonwood Canyon for Pioneer Day celebrations on 24 July. Young disagreed with Buchanan's choices for governor of the territory. Although Young's secular position simplified his administration of the Territory, he believed his religious authority was more important among a nearly homogeneous population of Mormons.Young, Brigham (September 13, 1857), \\"The United States and Utah Army\\", Journal of Discourses, 5: 228 Young and the Mormon community feared renewed persecution and possibly annihilation by a large body of federal troops. Mormons remembered previous conflicts when they had lived near numerous non-Mormons. In 1838, they had been driven from Missouri into Illinois by direction of the Governor of Missouri who issued the infamous Extermination Order. Mormons' state of mind was further alarmed when they learned in late June 1857 that LDS Apostle Parley P. Pratt had recently been murdered while serving a mission in Arkansas. Fearing the worst, Young ordered residents throughout Utah territory to prepare for evacuation, making plans to burn their homes and property and to stockpile food and stock feed. Guns were manufactured and ammunition was cast. Mormon colonists in small outlying communities in the Carson Valley and San Bernardino, California were ordered to leave their homes to consolidate with the main body of Latter-day Saints in Northern and Central Utah. All LDS missionaries serving in the United States and Europe were recalled. Young also sent George A. Smith to the settlements of southern Utah to prepare them for action. Young's strategies to defend the Saints vacillated between all-out war, a more limited confrontation, and retreat. Kanosh was a Ute chief and Mormon convert. He met with Brigham Young on September 1, 1857 along with other Indian leaders. An alliance with the Indians was central to Young's strategy for war, although his relations with them had been strained since the settlers' arrival in 1847. Young had generally adopted a policy of conversion and conciliation towards native tribes.Leonard Arrington, Brigham Young: American Moses, 217 Some Mormon leaders encouraged intermarriage with the Indians so that the two peoples might \\"unite together\\" and their \\"interests become one\\".David Bigler, Fort Limhi: The Mormon Adventure in Oregon Territory, 1855‚Äì1858, 147. Members of the Bannock tribe. The Bannock led a raid on the Latter-day Saint mission of Fort Limhi in February 1858. On 30 August-1 September, Young met with Indian delegations and gave them permission to take all of the livestock then on the northern and southern trails into California (the Fancher Party was at that time on the southern trail).Dinnick Huntington Diary, August 30 and September 1, 1857 This meeting may have been Young's attempt to win Indian support against the United States and refrain from raids against Mormon settlements. In sermons on 16 August, and again one month later, Young publicly urged the emigrant wagon trains to keep away from the Territory. Despite Young's efforts, Indians attacked Mormon settlements during the course of the Utah War, including a raid on Fort Limhi on the Salmon River in Oregon Territory in February 1858 and attacks in Tooele County just west of Great Salt Lake City. Major General Stewart Van Vliet of the U.S. Army. In early August, Young re-activated the Nauvoo Legion. This was the Mormon militia created during the conflict in Illinois. The Nauvoo Legion was under the command of Daniel H. Wells and consisted of all able-bodied men between 15 and 60. Young ordered the Legion to take delaying actions, essentially harassing federal troops. He planned to buy time for the Mormon settlements to prepare for either battle or evacuation, and create a window for negotiations with the Buchanan Administration. Thus, in mid-August, militia Colonel Robert T. Burton and a reconnaissance unit were sent east from Salt Lake City with orders to observe the oncoming American regiments and protect LDS emigrants traveling on the Mormon trail. =Captain Van Vliet= On 18 July 1857, U.S. Army Captain Stewart Van Vliet, an assistant quartermaster, and a small escort were ordered to proceed directly from Kansas to Salt Lake City, ahead of the main body of troops. Van Vliet carried a letter to Young from General Harney ordering Young to make arrangements for the citizens of Utah to accommodate and supply the troops once they arrived. However, Harney's letter did not mention that Young had been replaced as governor, nor did it detail what the mission of the troops would be once they arrived and these omissions sparked even greater distrust among the Saints.Leroy R. Hafen & Ann W. Hafen (eds.), Mormon Resistance: A Documentary Account of the Utah Expedition, 1857‚Äì1858, 39‚Äì40. On his journey, reports reached Van Vliet that his company might be in danger from Mormon raiders on the trail. The Captain therefore left his escort and proceeded alone.The Stewart Van Vliet Papers Van Vliet arrived in Salt Lake City on 8 September. Historian Harold Schindler states that his mission was to contact Governor Young and inform him of the expedition's mission: to escort the new appointees, to act as a posse comitatus and to establish at least two and perhaps three new U.S. Army camps in Utah. Conversing with Van Vliet, Young denied complicity in the destruction of the law offices of U.S. Federal Judge Stiles and expressed concern that he (Young) might suffer the same fate as the previous Mormon leader, Joseph Smith, to which Van Vliet replied, \\"I do not think it is the intention of the government to arrest you,\\" said Van Vliet, \\"but to install a new governor of the territory\\". p. 507. Van Vliet's instructions were to buy provisions for the troops and to inform the people of Utah that the troops would only be employed as a posse comitatus when called on by the civil authority to aid in the execution of the laws. Van Vliet's arrival in Salt Lake City was welcomed cautiously by the Mormon leadership. Van Vliet had been previously known by the Latter-day Saints in Iowa, and they trusted and respected him. However, he found the residents of Utah determined to defend themselves. He interviewed leaders and townspeople and \\"... attended Sunday services, heard emotional speeches, and saw the Saints raise their hands in a unanimous resolution to guard against any 'invader.'\\" Allen and Leonard, p. 301 Van Vliet found it impossible to persuade resentful Mormon leaders that the Army had peaceful intentions. He quickly recognized that supplies or accommodations for the Army would not be forthcoming. But Young told Van Vliet that the Mormons did not desire war, and \\"if we can keep the peace for this winter I do think there will be something turned up that may save the shedding of blood.\\"Leroy R. Hafen & Ann W. Hafen (eds.), Mormon Resistance: A Documentary Account of the Utah Expedition, 1857‚Äì1858, 47. However, marking a change from earlier pronouncements, Young declared that under threat from an approaching army he would not allow the new governor and federal officers to enter Utah.Wilford Woodruff, Journal of Wilford Woodruff, 5:96. Nevertheless, Van Vliet told Young that he believed that the Mormons \\"have been lied about the worst of any people I ever saw\\".Wilford Woodruff, Journal of Wilford Woodruff, 5:93. He promised to stop the Utah Expedition on his own authority, and on September 14 he returned east through the Mormon fortifications then being built in Echo Canyon (see below). Upon returning to the main body of the army, Van Vliet reported that the Latter-day Saints would not resort to actual hostilities, but would seek to delay the troops in every way possible. He also reported that they were ready to burn their homes and destroy their crops, and that the route through Echo Canyon would be a death trap for a large body of troops. Van Vliet continued on to Washington, D.C. in company with Dr. John M. Bernhisel, Utah Territory's delegate to Congress. There, Van Vliet reported on the situation in the west and became an advocate for the Latter-day Saints and the end of the Utah War. =Martial law= As early as 5 August, Young had decided to declare martial law throughout the Territory and a document was printed to that effect.Religious Education Archive: 19th Century Mormon Publications: \\"Proclamation by the Governor\\" dated 5 August 1857 However, historians question the intent of this proclamation as it was never widely circulated, if at all, and while copies of the document exist, there is no mention of it in any contemporary sources.Everett Cooley (ed.), Diary of Brigham Young, 80 n. 80. One commentary opines that \\"during most of August the Mormon leaders had not precisely focused on a strategy for dealing with the approaching army; and after the first proclamation was struck off, they likely had second thoughts about a direct confrontation with the federal government. On August 29, Brigham Young instructed Daniel H. Wells to draft a second proclamation of martial law.\\"Mormon Publications: 19th Century ‚Äì Proclamation by the governor On 15 September, the day after Van Vliet left Salt Lake City, Young publicly declared martial law in Utah with a document almost identical to that printed in early August. This second proclamation received wide circulation throughout the Territory and was delivered by messenger to Col. Alexander with the approaching army. The most important provision forbade \\"all armed forces of every description from coming into this Territory, under any pretense whatsoever\\".\\"Proclamation of Governor Young,\\" Leroy R. Hafen & Ann W. Hafen (eds.), Mormon Resistance: A Documentary Account of the Utah Expedition, 1857‚Äì1858, 65. It also commanded that \\"all the forces in said Territory hold themselves in readiness to march at a moment's notice to repel any and all such invasion.\\" But more important to California and Oregon bound travelers was the third section that stated \\"Martial law is hereby declared to exist in this Territory ... and no person shall be allowed to pass or repass into, through or from this territory without a permit from the proper officer.\\" =Contact= South Pass. The high desert of southwestern Wyoming held little cover for either the U.S. army or the Nauvoo Legion. Echo Canyon formed the most direct route into the Salt Lake Valley. The Nauvoo Legion fortified the narrowest sections of the canyon in case the army attempted to break through. There is disagreement as to how effective their preparations would have been had battle occurred. The Nauvoo Legion finally made contact with federal troops in late September just west of South Pass. The militia immediately began to burn grass along the trail and stampede the army's cattle. In early October, Legion members burned down Fort Bridger lest it fall into the hands of the army. A few days later, three large Army supply trains that were trailing the main army detachments were burned by Mormon cavalry led by Lot Smith. Associated horses and cattle were \\"liberated\\" from the supply trains and taken west by the militia.Allen and Leonard, pp. 300‚Äì301 Few if any shots were fired in these exchanges, and the Army's lack of cavalry left them more or less open to Mormon raids. However, prisoners were captured by both sides, and the army began to grow weary of the constant Mormon harassment throughout the fall. At one point, Colonel Alexander mounted roughly 100 men on army mules to combat the Mormon militia. In the early morning of 15 October, this \\"jackass cavalry\\" had a run-in with Lot Smith's command and fired over 30 bullets at the Mormons from 150 yards. No one was killed, but one Mormon took a bullet through his hat band, and one horse was grazed.D.G. Littleford, Utah War: U.S. Government Versus Mormons Settlers, 8. In addition, through October and November, between 1,200 and 2,000 militiamen were stationed in Echo Canyon and Weber Canyon. These two narrow passes lead into the Salt Lake Valley, and provided the easiest access to the populated areas of northern Utah. Dealing with a heavy snowfall and intense cold, the Mormon men built fortifications, dug rifle pits and dammed streams and rivers in preparation for a possible battle either that fall or the following spring. Several thousand more militiamen prepared their families for evacuation and underwent military training. Colonel Alexander, whom his troops called \\"old granny\\", decided not to enter Utah through Echo Canyon due to Van Vliet's report, news of the Mormon fortifications and a propaganda campaign by Brigham Young. But determined to fulfill his orders to enter the Territory, he decided to move around the Mormon defenses and enter Utah from the north along the Bear River. However, Alexander's force was stopped by a heavy blizzard in late October. Colonel Johnston took command of the combined U.S. forces in early November, but by this time the command was hampered by a lack of supplies, animals, and the early onset of winter. Johnston was a more aggressive commander than Alexander but this predicament rendered him unable to immediately attack through Echo Canyon into Utah. Instead, he settled his troops into ill-equipped winter camps designated Camp Scott and Eckelsville, near the burned-out remains of Fort Bridger, now in the state of Wyoming. Johnston was soon joined by the 2nd Dragoons commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Philip St. George Cooke, who had accompanied Alfred Cumming, Utah's new governor, and a roster of other federal officials from Fort Leavenworth. However, they too were critically short of horses and supplies. On 21 November, Cumming sent a proclamation to the citizens of Utah declaring them to be in rebellion, and soon after, a grand jury was formed at Camp Scott, which indicted two Mormon prisoners, Brigham Young, and over 60 other members of the Mormon hierarchy for treason. Johnston awaited resupply and reinforcement and prepared to attack the Mormon positions after the spring thaw. December 1857 ‚Äì March 1858: winter intermissionSoldiers advance up the Colorado River= During this winter season, Lt. Joseph Christmas Ives was embarking on an assigned task of exploring and surveying the Colorado River by steamship to determine the extent of the river's navigability. While steaming upstream in the Explorer from the Colorado River Delta toward Fort Yuma in early January 1858, Ives received two hastily written dispatches from his commanding officer informing him of the outbreak of the Mormon War. These letters reported that Mormons were already engaged in hostilities with United States Army forces who were attempting to enter Utah from the east, and Ives's expedition took on a new meaning. The War Department was now considering launching a second front in Utah via the Colorado. Ives, who had anticipated a leisurely ascent of the river, was instructed to disregard his original orders. He was now ordered to ascend the Colorado to the head of navigation with utmost speed to determine the feasibility of transporting troops and war materiel up the Colorado by steamer to the mouth of the Virgin River, and thence overland to Utah. It was also rumored in Washington that Mormons might try to retreat down the Colorado River and into Sonora. An army advancing up the Colorado River would cut off this escape route. Ives was instructed to proceed with extreme caution, since treacherous Mormons might already be lurking on the Colorado above Yuma. Meanwhile, George Alonzo Johnson, a merchant who had an established business transporting goods by steamship between the Colorado River Delta and Fort Yuma, was upset that he had not been awarded command of the expedition's original exploratory mission. When Ives was chosen instead, he used the rumors of Indian unrest and purported Mormon designs on the Colorado river and successfully organized a second armed expedition in competition with Ives. He obtained an escort of soldiers commanded by Lt. James A. White from Fort Yuma's acting commander, Lt. A. A. Winder. On 31 December 1857, several days before Ives's arrival at Fort Yuma, Johnson's party steamed upstream from Yuma aboard the steamer \\"General Jesup\\". Ives arrived at Yuma on the evening of 5 January 1858. Reacting to Johnson's departure and urgent dispatches from Washington, Ives had taken an overland shortcut on horseback in order to reorganize his command prior to the steamer's arrival and to facilitate a rapid ascent to the Virgin River as commanded. Ives' party steamed up the Colorado River with frequent contact with Mojaves and other natives who traded with them and were allowed to board their vessel. Determining that they could not ascend the river beyond Black Canyon they turned back downstream. During their descent, the Mojave informed Ives that Mormons had recently been among the Mojaves and were inciting unrest by intimating that the real purpose of the river expedition was to steal Indian lands. Upon hearing of Ives's steamer on the Colorado, Mormons feared that Ives might be bringing an army to Utah from the South. Jacob Hamblin, famed Mormon missionary of the Southwest, whose activities including establishing and maintaining Mormon-Indian alliances along the Colorado, set out in March with three other companions from Las Vegas to learn more about Ives's intentions. From excited Indians they learned of the approach of an \\"army\\" marching overland from Yuma - which in reality was Ives's packtrain. Hamblin's group made direct contact with Ives expedition by sending Tha√Øes Haskell, to hail the steamer's crew from the bank while the other Mormons remained in hiding. He was to pass himself off as a renegade from Utah and then learn as much as possible about Ives's intentions; however, his guise failed since one of Ives's men who had been to Utah claimed to recognize him as a Mormon bishop. The journals of members of the Ives expedition as well as the Mormons from Hamblin's group attest to the tension and war hysteria among both the US Army and the Mormons in these remote territories. =Thomas L. Kane= Thomas L. Kane in the uniform of a Union lieutenant colonel in 1861. He received a brevet promotion to major general in 1865. Fortunately, the lull in hostilities during the winter provided an opportunity for negotiations, and direct confrontation was avoided. As early as August 1857, Brigham Young had written to Thomas L. Kane of Pennsylvania asking for help. Kane was a man of some political prominence who had been helpful to the Mormons in their westward migration and later political controversies. In December, Kane contacted President Buchanan and offered to mediate between the Mormons and the federal government. In Buchanan's State of the Union address earlier in the month, he had taken a hard stand against the Mormon rebellion, and had actually asked Congress to enlarge the size of the regular army to deal with the crisis. However, in his conversation with Kane, Buchanan worried that the Mormons might destroy Johnston's Army at severe political cost to himself, and stated that he would pardon the Latter-day Saints for their actions if they would submit to government authority. He therefore granted Kane unofficial permission to attempt mediation, although he held little hope for the success of negotiations.Richard D. Poll, Quixotic Mediator: Thomas L. Kane and the Utah War at 12, 13 Upon approval of his mission by the President, Kane immediately started for Utah. During the heavy winter of 1857‚Äì1858, he traveled under the alias \\"Dr. Osborne\\" over 3,000+ miles from the East coast to Utah, first by ship to Panama, crossing the isthmus via the newly constructed (1855) Panama Railway, and then taking a second ship to San Francisco. Upon learning that the Sierra passes were blocked for the winter, he immediately took a ship to San Pedro, the unimproved harbor for what is now Los Angeles. He was met there by Mormons who took him overland through San Bernardino and Las Vegas, to Salt Lake City on the strenuous southern branch of the California Trail, arriving in February 1858. Details of the negotiations between Kane and Young are unfortunately unclear. It seems that Kane successfully convinced Young to accept Buchanan's appointment of Cumming as Territorial governor, although Young had expressed his willingness to accept such terms at the very beginning of the crisis. It is uncertain if Kane was able to convince Young at this time to allow the army into Utah. However, in early March Kane traveled to the Johnston's winter base at Fort Bridger. Although his relationship with Colonel Johnston was poor, he eventually persuaded Governor Cumming to travel to Salt Lake City without his military escort under guarantee of safe conduct. As they descended Echo Canyon to Salt Lake city, Kane and the Mormon militia men successfully fooled Cumming as to the size of the armed contingent lining the canyon, something of which Cumming later complained bitterly. Cumming was courteously received by Young and the Utah citizenry in mid-April, and was shortly installed in his new office. Cumming thereafter became a moderate voice, and opposed the hard-line against the Mormons proposed by Colonel Johnston and other federal officials still at Camp Scott. Kane left Utah Territory for Washington, D.C. in May to report to President Buchanan on the results of his mission. April‚ÄìJuly 1858: resolutionMove south= Brigham Young intended to evacuate the Latter-day Saints to the Bitterroot Valley, which is now in Montana. He believed conditions there were sufficient for the Mormons to live, but difficult enough that it would not be coveted by anyone else. However, circumstances necessitated a \\"Move South\\" rather than a \\"Move North\\". Despite Thomas Kane's successful mission, tension continued throughout the spring and summer of 1858. Young was willing to support Cumming as governor, but he still feared persecution and violence if the army entered Utah. Indeed, as the snows melted, approximately 3,000 additional U.S. Army reinforcements set out on the westward trails to resupply and strengthen the Army's presence. In Utah, the Nauvoo Legion was bolstered as Mormon communities were asked to supply and equip an additional thousand volunteers to be placed in the over one hundred miles of mountains that separated Camp Scott and Great Salt Lake City. Nevertheless, by the end of the winter Young had decided to enforce his \\"Sevastopol Policy\\", a plan to evacuate the Territory and burn it to the ground rather than fight the army openly. Members of the Hudson's Bay Company and the British government feared that the Mormons planned to seek refuge on Vancouver Island off the coast of British Columbia.Richard Bennett, The Lion and the Emperor: The Mormons, the Hudson's Bay Company, and Vancouver Island, 1846‚Äì1858, BC Studies, no. 128 Winter 2000/01 David Bigler has shown that Young originally intended this evacuation to go northwards toward the Bitterroot Valley in present day Montana. However, the Bannock and Shoshone raid against Fort Limhi in February 1858 blocked this northern retreat. Consequently, at the end of March 1858, settlers in the northern counties of Utah including Salt Lake City boarded up their homes and farms and began to move south, leaving small groups of men and boys behind to burn the settlements if necessary. As early as February 1858, Young had sent parties to explore the White Mountains on what is now the Utah/Nevada border where he, erroneously, believed there were valleys that could comfortably harbor up to 100,000 individuals. Residents of Utah County just south of Salt Lake were asked to build and maintain roads and to help the incoming inhabitants of the northern communities. Mormon Elias Blackburn recorded in his journal, The roads are crowded with the Saints moving south. ... Very busy dealing out provisions to the public hands. I am feeding 100 men, all hard at work.Walker and Dant, p. 102. Even after Alfred Cumming was installed as governor in mid- April, the \\"Move South\\" continued unabated. The movement may have included the relocation of nearly 30,000 people between March and July. Historians Allen and Leonard write: > It was an extraordinary operation. As the Saints moved south they cached all > the stone cut for the Salt Lake Temple and covered the foundations to make > it resemble a plowed field.

Brigham Young replied that if the troops were > withdrawn from the territory, the people would stop moving. ...Allen/Leonard > p. 308 =Peace Commission= Senator Sam Houston of Texas strenuously opposed the Utah Expedition. In the meantime, President Buchanan had come under considerable pressure from Congress to end the crisis. In February 1858, Senator Sam Houston of Texas stated that a war against the Mormons would be > ... one of the most fearful calamities that has befallen this country, from > its inception to the present moment. I deprecate it as an intolerable evil. > I am satisfied that the Executive has not had the information he ought to > have had on this subject before making such a movement as he has directed to > be made.Mormon Resistance at 258 On 1 April, Senator Simon Cameron of Pennsylvania declared that he would support a bill to authorize volunteers to fight in Utah and other parts of the frontier only because > ... this war is a war of the Administration; and I desire that the > responsibility of it shall be on the Administration. I have no faith in > their ability to conduct it; and I believe that before a year has passed > over it will be evident to every citizen of the country that they have > committed a great blunder ...Congressional Globe, 4/1/1858. Therefore in April, the President sent an official peace commission to Utah consisting of Benjamin McCulloch and Lazarus Powell, which arrived in June. The commission offered a free pardon to the Mormons for any acts incident to the conflict if they would submit to government authority. This included permitting Johnston's Army into the Territory. The commissioners further assured that the government would not interfere with their religion. They also hinted that once the new governor was installed and the laws yielded to, \\"a necessity will no longer exist to retain any portion of the army in the Territory, except what may be required to keep the Indians in check and to secure the passage of emigrants to California.\\"Mormon Resistance, 331. While all these private assurances were inducements for the Latter-day Saints to bend to federal will, Buchanan maintained a tougher stance in his public statements. Brigham Young accepted Buchanan's terms and pardon, although he denied Utah had ever rebelled against the United States. Buchanan's proclamation was also unpopular among the Mormon rank and file. Arthur P. Welchman, a member of a company of missionaries that was recalled due to the war, wrote of the document: Lt. Col. Philip St. George Cooke had led the Mormon Battalion and had an abiding respect for the Latter-day Saints. Lt. Col. Charles Ferguson Smith relieved General Johnston of the command of the Department of Utah in 1860. > June ‚Äì On the head-waters of the Sweet-Water, met Grosebecks' camp going to > Platt Bridge for a train of goods. By these Brethren we had a proclamation > from President Buchannan to the Inhabitants of Utah read to us. It was so > full of lies, and showed so much meanness, that it elicited three groans > from the company. On 19 June, a newly arrived reporter for the New York Herald somewhat inaccurately wrote, \\"Thus was peace made ‚Äì thus was ended the 'Mormon war', which ... may be thus historisized: ‚Äì Killed, none; wounded, none; fooled, everybody.\\"William P. McKinnon, Causes of the Utah War, Fort Douglas Vedette (2007). At the end of June 1858, the Army troops under General Johnston entered the Salt Lake Valley unhindered. Riding through the still empty streets of Salt Lake City on June 26, an embittered Johnston was heard to say that he would have given \\"his plantation for a chance to bombard the city for fifteen minutes\\".DONALD L. MOORMAN & GENE A. SESSIONS, CAMP FLOYD AND THE MORMONS: THE UTAH WAR at 49 Lt. Col. Charles Ferguson Smith stated that he \\"did not care a damm who heard him; he would like to see every dammed Mormon hung by the neck.\\" Philip St. George Cooke, who had led the Mormon Battalion during the Mexican War, merely bared his head in respect. In early July, the Mormons from the northern settlements began to return to their homes after it was clear that no more reinforcements were being sent into Utah from either the east or west. Johnston's Army settled in Camp Floyd, in a valley 50 miles southwest of Salt Lake City and separated from Provo (the second-largest city in the territory) by Utah Lake and a small range of mountains. This remote location, neighbor only to a few farms and ranches, was chosen to decrease friction between the troops and the Mormons. The Army and the Mormons continued in a fragile co-existence until the troops left in 1861 when called back east for service in the American Civil War. Consequences Although Eastern editors continued to condemn the Mormons' religious beliefs and practices, they praised their heroism in the face of military threat. By the time Governor Cumming was securely placed in office, the Utah War had become an embarrassment for President Buchanan. Called 'Buchanan's Blunder' by elements of the national press, the President was criticized for: * failing to officially notify Governor Young about his replacement, * incurring the expense of sending troops without investigating the reports on Utah's disloyalty to the United States, * dispatching the expedition late in the season, and * failing to provide an adequate resupply train for the winter. However, the people of Utah lost much during the brief period of conflict. Largely due to their evacuation, the settlers' livelihoods and economic well- being were seriously impacted for at least that year and perhaps longer. Field crops had been ignored for most of the two-month-long planting season and livestock herds had been culled for the journey. A year's worth of work improving their living conditions had essentially been lost. Some poverty would be widespread in the territory for several years. A number of Mormon settlements in Idaho, Nevada and California would not be resettled for decades and some were permanently abandoned. In addition, Utah was under nominal military occupation. Historian Leonard J. Arrington noted that \\"the cream of the United States Army\\" reviled the Mormon settlers. Relations between the troops and their commanders with the Mormons were often tense. Fortunately, the near isolation of Camp Floyd kept interaction to a minimum, as troops stayed on or near their base. Settlers living near the 7,000 troops quartered in Cedar Valley did sell the troops lumber for building construction, farm produce and manufactured goods. When the army finally abandoned Camp Floyd in 1861 at the outbreak of the American Civil War, surplus goods worth an estimated four million dollars were auctioned off for a fraction of their value. However, in 1862, new troops arrived and built Fort Douglas in the foothills east of Salt Lake City. One consequence of the Utah War was the creation of the famous Pony Express. During the war, Lot Smith and the Nauvoo Legion burned roughly 52 wagons belonging to outfitters Russell, Majors and Waddell. The government never reimbursed the outfitters for these losses, and in 1860 they formed the Pony Express to earn a government mail contract to keep them from falling into bankruptcy. In the aftermath of the Utah War, Republicans won control of the House of Representatives in 1858. But every significant bill that they passed fell before the votes of southern Democratic Senators or suffered a presidential veto. The federal government remained stalemated and little could be done. By 1860, sectional strife split the Democratic Party into northern and southern wings, indirectly leading to the election of Republican Abraham Lincoln in 1860. Popular sovereignty, the defense of which had been a major cause of the Utah Expedition, was finally repudiated when the resolution of the slavery question sparked the American Civil War. Yet with the start of the Civil War, Republican majorities were able to pass legislation meant to curb the Mormon practice of polygamy such as the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act of 1862. However, President Abraham Lincoln did not enforce these laws; instead Lincoln gave Brigham Young tacit permission to ignore the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act in exchange for not becoming involved with the American Civil War. General Patrick Edward Connor, commanding officer of the federal forces garrisoned at Fort Douglas, Utah beginning in 1862 was explicitly instructed to not confront the Mormons. In March 1863, Judge Kinney issued a writ against Young for violation of the Suppression of Polygamy Act. The writ was served by the United States marshal and the prisoner promptly appeared at the state-house where an investigation was held. A $2,000 bail bond was posted awaiting the decision of the grand jury. p. 614 The all Mormon grand jury refused an indictment citing a lack of evidence for Young's marriage to Amelia Folsom in January of that year.T.B.H. Stenhouse, The Rocky Mountain Saints, Chapter LI, p. 605 In the end, the Utah War started a slow decline for Mormon isolation and power in Utah. The Latter-day Saints lost control of the executive branch and the federal district courts, but maintained political authority in the Territorial Legislature and the powerful probate courts. In 1869, the Transcontinental Railroad was completed, and soon large numbers of \\"Gentiles\\" arrived in Utah to stay. Despite this, complete federal dominance was slow in coming. Conflict between the Mormons and the federal government, particularly over the issue of polygamy, would continue for nearly 40 years before Utah was finally made a state in 1896, and was perhaps not fully resolved until the Smoot Hearings of 1904‚Äì1907.

The colored triangle is the gamut available to the sRGB color space typically used in computer monitors; it does not cover the entire space. The corners of the triangle are the primary colors for this gamut; in the case of a CRT, they depend on the colors of the phosphors of the monitor. At each point, the brightest possible RGB color of that chromaticity is shown, resulting in the bright Mach band stripes corresponding to the edges of the RGB color cube. In color reproduction, including computer graphics and photography, the gamut, or color gamut , is a certain complete subset of colors. The most common usage refers to the subset of colors which can be accurately represented in a given circumstance, such as within a given color space or by a certain output device. Another sense, less frequently used but still correct, refers to the complete set of colors found within an image at a given time. In this context, digitizing a photograph, converting a digitized image to a different color space, or outputting it to a given medium using a certain output device generally alters its gamut, in the sense that some of the colors in the original are lost in the process. Introduction The term gamut was adopted from the field of music, where in middle age Latin \\"gamut\\" meant the entire range of musical notes of which musical melodies are composed; Shakespeare's use of the term in The Taming of the Shrew is sometimes attributed to the author/musician Thomas Morley. In the 1850s, the term was applied to a range of colors or hue, for example by Thomas De Quincey, who wrote \\"Porphyry, I have heard, runs through as large a gamut of hues as marble.\\" In color theory, the gamut of a device or process is that portion of the color space that can be represented, or reproduced. Generally, the color gamut is specified in the hue‚Äìsaturation plane, as a system can usually produce colors over a wide intensity range within its color gamut; for a subtractive color system (such as used in printing), the range of intensity available in the system is for the most part meaningless without considering system-specific properties (such as the illumination of the ink). When certain colors cannot be expressed within a particular color model, those colors are said to be out of gamut. A device that can reproduce the entire visible color space is an unrealized goal within the engineering of color displays and printing processes. Modern techniques allow increasingly good approximations, but the complexity of these systems often makes them impractical. While processing a digital image, the most convenient color model used is the RGB model. Printing the image requires transforming the image from the original RGB color space to the printer's CMYK color space. During this process, the colors from the RGB which are out of gamut must be somehow converted to approximate values within the CMYK space gamut. Simply trimming only the colors which are out of gamut to the closest colors in the destination space would burn the image. There are several algorithms approximating this transformation, but none of them can be truly perfect, since those colors are simply out of the target device's capabilities. This is why identifying the colors in an image which are out of gamut in the target color space as soon as possible during processing is critical for the quality of the final product. Representation of gamuts The CIE 1931 color space chromaticity diagram comparing the visible gamut with sRGB's and color temperature Gamuts are commonly represented as areas in the CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram as shown at right, with the curved edge representing the monochromatic (single-wavelength) or spectral colors. The accessible gamut depends on the brightness; a full gamut must therefore be represented in 3D space, as below: The pictures at left show the gamuts of RGB color space (top), such as on computer monitors, and of reflective colors in nature (bottom). The cone drawn in grey corresponds roughly to the CIE diagram at right, with the added dimension of brightness. The axes in these diagrams are the responses of the short-wavelength (S), middle-wavelength (M), and long-wavelength (L) cones in the human eye. The other letters indicate black (Blk), red (R), green (G), blue (B), cyan (C), magenta (M), yellow (Y), and white colors (W). (Note: These pictures are not exactly to scale.) The top left diagram shows that the shape of the RGB gamut is a triangle between red, green, and blue at lower luminosities; a triangle between cyan, magenta, and yellow at higher luminosities, and a single white point at maximum luminosity. The exact positions of the apexes depends on the emission spectra of the phosphors in the computer monitor, and on the ratio between the maximum luminosities of the three phosphors (i.e., the color balance). The gamut of the CMYK color space is, ideally, approximately the same as that for RGB, with slightly different apexes, depending on both the exact properties of the dyes and the light source. In practice, due to the way raster-printed colors interact with each other and the paper and due to their non-ideal absorption spectra, the gamut is smaller and has rounded corners. The gamut of reflective colors in nature has a similar, though more rounded, shape. An object that reflects only a narrow band of wavelengths will have a color close to the edge of the CIE diagram, but it will have a very low luminosity at the same time. At higher luminosities, the accessible area in the CIE diagram becomes smaller and smaller, up to a single point of white, where all wavelengths are reflected exactly 100 percent; the exact coordinates of white are determined by the color of the light source. Limitations of color representation=Surfaces Spectrum of a color-optimal reflective material. CIE FL4 in CIE xyY. In the beginning of the 20th century, industrial demands for a controllable way to describe colors and the new possibility to measure light spectra initiated intense research on mathematical descriptions of colors. The idea of optimal colors was introduced by the Baltic German chemist Wilhelm Ostwald. Erwin Schr√∂dinger showed in his 1919 article ' (Theory of Pigments with Highest Luminosity) that the most-saturated colors that can be created with a given total reflectivity are generated by surfaces having either zero or full reflectance at any given wavelength, and the reflectivity spectrum must have at most two transitions between zero and full. Thus two types of \\"optimal color\\" spectra are possible: Either the transition goes from zero at both ends of the spectrum to one in the middle, as shown in the image at right, or it goes from one at the ends to zero in the middle. The first type produces colors that are similar to the spectral colors and follow roughly the horseshoe-shaped portion of the CIE xy chromaticity diagram, but are generally less saturated. The second type produces colors that are similar to (but generally less saturated than) the colors on the straight line in the CIE xy chromaticity diagram, leading to magenta-like colors. Schr√∂dinger's work was further developed by David MacAdam and Siegfried R√∂sch. MacAdam was the first person to calculate precise coordinates of selected points on the boundary of the optimal color solid in the CIE 1931 color space for lightness levels from Y = 10 to 95 in steps of 10 units. This enabled him to draw the optimal color solid at an acceptable degree of precision. Because of his achievement, the boundary of the optimal color solid is called the MacAdam limit. On modern computers, it is possible to calculate an optimal color solid with great precision in seconds or minutes. The MacAdam limit, on which the most saturated (or \\"optimal\\") colors reside, shows that colors that are near monochromatic colors can only be achieved at very low luminance levels, except for yellows, because a mixture of the wavelengths from the long straight-line portion of the spectral locus between green and red will combine to make a color very close to a monochromatic yellow. Light sources Light sources used as primaries in an additive color reproduction system need to be bright, so they are generally not close to monochromatic. That is, the color gamut of most variable-color light sources can be understood as a result of difficulties producing pure monochromatic (single wavelength) light. The best technological source of monochromatic light is the laser, which can be rather expensive and impractical for many systems. However, as optoelectronic technology matures, single-longitudinal-mode diode lasers are becoming less expensive, and many applications can already profit from this; such as Raman spectroscopy, holography, biomedical research, fluorescence, reprographics, interferometry, semiconductor inspection, remote detection, optical data storage, image recording, spectral analysis, printing, point-to-point free- space communications, and fiber optic communications. Systems that use additive color processes usually have a color gamut which is roughly a convex polygon in the hue-saturation plane. The vertices of the polygon are the most saturated colors the system can produce. In subtractive color systems, the color gamut is more often an irregular region. Comparison of various systems Comparison of some RGB and CMYK color gamut on a CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram Following is a list of representative color systems more- or-less ordered from large to small color gamut: * Laser video projector uses three lasers to produce the broadest gamut available in practical display equipment today, derived from the fact that lasers produce truly monochromatic primaries. The systems work either by scanning the entire picture a dot at a time and modulating the laser directly at high frequency, much like the electron beams in a CRT, or by optically spreading and then modulating the laser and scanning a line at a time, the line itself being modulated in much the same way as in a DLP projector. Lasers can also be used as a light source for a DLP projector. More than three lasers can be combined to increase the gamut range, a technique sometimes used in holography. * Digital Light Processing or DLP technology is a trademarked technology from Texas Instruments. The DLP chip contains a rectangular array of up to 2 million hinge-mounted microscopic mirrors. Each of the micromirrors measures less than one-fifth the width of a human hair. A DLP chip's micromirror tilts either toward the light source in a DLP projection system (ON) or away from it (OFF). This creates a light or dark pixel on the projection surface. Current DLP projectors use a quickly rotating wheel with transparent colored \\"pie slices\\" to present each color frame successively. One rotation shows the complete image. * Photographic film can reproduce a larger color gamut than typical television, computer, or home video systems. * CRT and similar video displays have a roughly triangular color gamut which covers a significant portion of the visible color space. In CRTs, the limitations are due to the phosphors in the screen which produce red, green, and blue light. * Liquid crystal display (LCD) screens filter the light emitted by a backlight. The gamut of an LCD screen is therefore limited to the emitted spectrum of the backlight. Typical LCD screens use cold-cathode fluorescent bulbs (CCFLs) for backlights. LCD Screens with certain LED or wide-gamut CCFL backlights yield a more comprehensive gamut than CRTs. However, some LCD technologies vary the color presented by viewing angle. In Plane Switching or Patterned vertical alignment screens have a wider span of colors than Twisted Nematic. * Television normally uses a CRT, LCD, LED or plasma display, but does not take full advantage of its color display properties, due to the limitations of broadcasting. HDTV is less restrictive, but still somewhat less than, for example, computer displays using the same display technology. * Paint mixing, both artistic and for commercial applications, achieves a reasonably large color gamut by starting with a larger palette than the red, green, and blue of CRTs or cyan, magenta, and yellow of printing. Paint may reproduce some highly saturated colors that cannot be reproduced well by CRTs (particularly violet), but overall the color gamut is smaller. * Printing typically uses the CMYK color space (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black). Very few printing processes do not include black; however, those processes (with the exception of dye- sublimation printers) are poor at representing low saturation, low intensity colors. Efforts have been made to expand the gamut of the printing process by adding inks of non-primary colors; these are typically orange and green (see Hexachrome) or light cyan and light magenta (see CcMmYK color model). Spot color inks of a very specific color are also sometimes used. * A monochrome display's color gamut is a one-dimensional curve in color space. Wide color gamut The Ultra HD Forum defines wide color gamut (WCG) as a color gamut that is wider than Rec. 709. Common wide color gamut standards include: * DCI-P3 * Adobe RGB * Rec. 2020, used in HDR10 and Dolby Vision video.

The album was released on March 31, 1992, the same day as the Springsteen's Human Touch album. Lucky Town peaked at number three on the Billboard 200, with \\"Better Days\\" (paired with Human Touch's \\"Human Touch\\") peaking at number one on the Mainstream Rock and #16 on the Billboard Hot 100. Lucky Town has since sold more than one million copies in the United States. Background Springsteen was working on Human Touch, which he intended to release sometime in 1990, but the project took him longer than he thought. He shelved the project in early 1991 and came back to it in September of the same year. Intending to record one more song for the album (\\"Living Proof\\"), he ended up with 10 new songs, which became Lucky Town. Once he completed Lucky Town, he decided to release both albums at the same time. While most of the songs from the album have received few performances since the reunion of the E Street Band, \\"If I Should Fall Behind\\" was played at every show during the 1999‚Äì2000 Reunion Tour and was included in the Live in New York City DVD and CD release. Themes Compared to Human Touch, Lucky Town has a more stripped down, folksy sound and is more personal in its songs' lyrics. Human Touch consisted of mostly love songs, while Lucky Town focuses on more specific events in Springsteen's life. The opening track \\"Better Days\\" expresses his desire to start over after some rough patches in his life (his divorce from his first wife). \\"Living Proof\\" is about the birth of his first son and \\"Local Hero\\" is about a time that he saw a picture of himself in a store window.

The song was inspired by the Gulf War. Critical reception Upon release the album received generally positive reviews. Rolling Stone gave the album a positive review (a combined review with its companion album, Human Touch), but thought that the aims of the two albums \\"would have been better realized by a single, more carefully shaped collection.\\" In a mostly positive review, Allmusic said of the album: \\"While Human Touch was a disappointing album of second-rate material, Lucky Town is an ambitious collection addressing many of Springsteen's major concerns and moving them forward.\\" Robert Christgau of The Village Voice called it a \\"ponderous, well-crafted disappointment, a shorter and by most accounts lighter piece of work than its more songful corelease Human Touch.\\" Bill Wyman of The Chicago Reader compared it favorably to Human Touch, calling Lucky Town \\"obviously the superior work\\" and \\"a much more interesting beast, primarily because of the potency of the first three numbers [which] could have made a respectable anchor to a strong album.\\" However, he added that \\"the record's illegitimate beginnings soon take their toll, and formula returns to the fore...What themes there are on the record - a sort of Catholic wonder and love of life alternating with the usual fears and worries of the characters in Springsteen's ongoing New Jersey gothic - never come alive.\\" Greg Kot of The Chicago Tribune later wrote that Lucky Town was \\"highly underrated...containing some of the strongest songwriting of Springsteen's career and ranks as one of his most completely realized albums.\\" Track listing All songs are written by Bruce Springsteen. # \\"Better Days\\" ‚Äì 4:08 # \\"Lucky Town\\" ‚Äì 3:27 # \\"Local Hero\\" ‚Äì 4:04 # \\"If I Should Fall Behind\\" ‚Äì 2:57 # \\"Leap of Faith\\" ‚Äì 3:27 # \\"The Big Muddy\\" ‚Äì 4:05 # \\"Living Proof\\" ‚Äì 4:49 # \\"Book of Dreams\\" ‚Äì 4:24 # \\"Souls of the Departed\\" ‚Äì 4:17 # \\"My Beautiful Reward\\" ‚Äì 3:55 Unreleased outtakes Eleven songs were written during these sessions with the song \\"Happy\\" being the only outtake and eventually released on the Tracks box set.Brucebase ‚Äì Lucky Town ‚Äì Studio Sessions Personnel * Bruce Springsteen ‚Äì guitar, lead vocals, keyboards, bass guitar, harmonica, percussion * Gary Mallaber ‚Äì drums * Roy Bittan ‚Äì keyboards on \\"Leap of Faith\\", \\"The Big Muddy\\" and \\"Living Proof\\" * Patti Scialfa ‚Äì backing vocals on \\"Better Days\\", \\"Local Hero\\" and \\"Leap of Faith\\" * Soozie Tyrell ‚Äì backing vocals on \\"Better Days\\", \\"Local Hero\\" and \\"Leap of Faith\\" * Lisa Lowell ‚Äì backing vocals on \\"Better Days\\", \\"Local Hero\\" and \\"Leap of Faith\\" * Randy Jackson ‚Äì bass guitar on \\"Better Days\\" * Ian McLagan ‚Äì Hammond organ on \\"My Beautiful Reward\\" ;Technical * Anton S.

It was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the bullhead (any large-headed fish, especially the catfish, miller's thumb, and sculpin). Her keel was laid down by the Electric Boat Company of Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 16 July 1944 sponsored by Mrs. Howard R. Doyle, and commissioned 4 December 1944 with Commander W. T. Griffith in command.  Operations  Bullhead served in the Pacific Theater of Operations during World War II. The war operations of Bullhead extended from 21 March to August 1945 during which time she completed two war patrols. Her area of operations included the Java Sea and South China Sea and the Gulf of Siam.  First patrol  During the greater portion of her first war patrol Bullhead performed lifeguard services and on two occasions bombarded Pratas Island, China, damaging enemy radio installations. She also rescued three airmen from a downed B-29 Superfortress following an airstrike on the China coast.  Second patrol  On her second patrol, in May and June 1945 in the Gulf of Siam and the South China Sea, Bullhead sank two small freighters, a schooner and a sub chaser totaling 1800 tons and damaged two more sub chasers and another small freighter, all in gun actions.Bullhead's 1945 records claims are one ship sunk 30 May; one ship sunk 18 June; one ship sunk and three damaged 19 June and one ship sunk 25 June; for confirmation of two ships sunk by Bullhead 18 & 19 June ‚Äì see  Third patrol and sinking  USS Bullhead Memorial Park in Albuquerque, New Mexico, dedicated 7 April 1979 On 31 July 1945 Bullhead left Fremantle submarine base, Western Australia to commence her third war patrol. Her orders were to patrol in a \\"wolfpack\\" with and in the Java Sea until 5 September and then head for Subic Bay in the Philippines. Bullhead reported on 6 August that she had passed through Lombok Strait. That was the last word received from Bullhead. On 12 August, Capitaine, planning to arrive on 13 August, ordered Bullhead to take position the following day in a scouting line with Capitaine and Puffer. Receiving no reply, Capitaine reported on 15 August, \\"Have been unable to contact Bullhead by any means since arriving in area.\\" Since the British submarines and Thorough, were in the same general area as Bullhead, and and passed through in transit at various times, it is difficult to determine precisely which of the many Japanese anti-submarine attacks was the one that sank Bullhead. However, one occurred on 6 August 1945, when a Mitsubishi Ki-51 from the 73rd Independent Chutai (literally \\"company\\" or squadron) of the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force attacked with depth charges. It claimed two direct hits, and for ten minutes thereafter, there was a great amount of gushing oil and air bubbles rising in the water. Since the position given is very near the Balinese coast, it is presumed that the proximity of mountain peaks shortened Bullhead's radar range and prevented her from receiving a warning of the plane's approach. 84 men were lost while serving on USS Bullhead during her service.  Commendations  Bullhead received two battle stars for her World War II service.

Career Garrels graduated from Harvard University's Radcliffe College in 1972. She subsequently worked at ABC in several positions for about ten years, including serving as Moscow bureau chief and correspondent until she was expelled in 1982, and as Central American bureau chief from 1984 to 1985. Garrels was the NBC News correspondent at the U.S. State Department. She joined NPR in 1988 and reported on conflicts in Chechnya, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Israel and the West Bank. Garrels was the Edward R. Murrow Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations at the Council on Foreign Relations in 1996, and is a member of the board of the Committee to Protect Journalists. Garrels was one of the 16 Western journalists who remained in Baghdad and reported live during the 2003 Iraq War. Shortly after her return from Iraq, she published Naked in Baghdad, a memoir of her time covering the events surrounding the invasion. She subsequently returned to Iraq several times for NPR. She was an embedded reporter with the U.S. Marines during the November 2004 attack on Fallujah. Garrels also covered the January 2005 Iraqi national elections for an interim government, as well as constitutional referendum and the December 2005 elections for the first full term Iraqi government. As sectarian violence swept much of central Iraq Garrels continued to report from Baghdad, Najaf and Basra. In 2007 Garrels was criticized by FAIR for using confessions by prisoners who had been tortured during a story about an Iraqi Shiite militia (broadcast on NPR's Morning Edition). Garrels later defended her story on NPR's \\"Letters\\" program, saying: \\"Of course, I had doubts. But the details that were given seemed to me to gel with other things that I had heard from people who had not been tortured. But I was as uncomfortable as the listeners were with the conditions.\\" Garrels retired in 2010. In March 2016, Garrels published Putin Country: A Journey into the Real Russia with Farrar, Straus, and Giroux . Awards Garrels won a Courage in Journalism Award from the International Women's Media Foundation (IWMF) in 2003. In 2004 she was awarded the George Polk Award for Radio Reporting for her coverage of the war in Iraq. Personal life Garrels was married to J. Vinton Lawrence, one of two CIA paramilitary officers from the Special Activities Division stationed in Laos in the early 1960s, who worked with the Hmong tribesman and the CIA-owned airline Air America.\\"Award-winning journalist recounts Iraq war stories to Housy students\\", The Corner Report, January 11, 2006, accessed April 21, 2006 Garrels lives in Connecticut.

Don't Tell Me! is an hour-long weekly news radio panel show produced by WBEZ and National Public Radio (NPR) in Chicago, Illinois. On the program, panelists and contestants are quizzed in humorous ways about that week's news. It is distributed by NPR in the United States, internationally on NPR Worldwide and on the Internet via podcast, and typically broadcast on weekends by member stations. The show averages about 6 million weekly listeners on air and via podcast. Format Taping of a 2010 episode at the Chase Auditorium, with panelists Adam Felber, Roxanne Roberts, and Keegan- Michael Key Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! is usually recorded in front of a live audience in Chicago at the Chase Auditorium beneath the Chase Tower on Thursday nights. Until May 2005, the show was recorded in one of Chicago Public Radio's studios, with no audience and often with one or more panelists calling in from other locations. The show also often travels to various cities in the United States and produces a road show in front of a live audience for promotional and station-related purposes. In situations where shows cannot be recorded in front of an audience, shows are recorded at the studios of WBEZ with panelists using videotelephony to appear, a situation which has occurred during the coronavirus pandemic. A show previous to the halting of traveling and Chase Auditorium shows at Atlanta's Fox Theatre was recorded with no audience due to public health concerns after all on-air and recording personnel had arrived. The show is hosted by playwright and actor Peter Sagal. When the program had its debut in January 1998, Dan Coffey of Ask Dr. Science was the original host, but a revamping of the show led to his replacement in May of that year. The show has also been guest-hosted by Tom Bodett, Luke Burbank, Adam Felber, Peter Grosz, Tom Papa, Mike Pesca, Richard Sher, Bill Radke, Susan Stamberg, Robert Siegel, Brian Unger, Drew Carey, Tom Hanks, Helen Hong, Jessi Klein,Wait Wait' For March 11, 2017: Guest Host Jessi Klein with Not My Job Guest Neal Brennan\\" and Faith Salie when Sagal was on vacation. Carl Kasell, who also served as the newsreader on Morning Edition, was the show's official judge and scorekeeper until his retirement on May 17, 2014, after which the role was taken over permanently by journalist Bill Kurtis. In addition to Kurtis, Korva Coleman, Corey Flintoff, Jean Cochran and Chioke I'Anson among others, have also served this role in the past. Wait Wait... listeners also participate by telephoning or sending emails to nominate themselves as contestants. The producers select several listeners for each show and call them to appear on the program, playing various games featuring questions based on the week's news. Prior to October 21, 2017, the usual prize for winning any game was to have Kasell (named \\"Scorekeeper Emeritus\\" following his retirement) record a greeting on the contestant's home answering machine or voice mail system. The current prize is to have any one show panelist or staff member of the contestant's choice record the greeting, including Sagal, Kurtis, or Kasell prior to his death in April 2018. Several shows a year, usually coinciding with holidays or local National Public Radio (NPR) member station pledge drives, are compiled from segments from past episodes, or feature holiday-related theme programming (such as for the 4th of July, an entire program based on questions from American history adapted to fit the current events format), and are either recorded in front of an audience for later broadcast, or at WBEZ's studio facilities without an audience. Panelists In addition to the regular panelists listed below, the show also occasionally features one-off guest panelists.

Don't Tell Me! feature the following format: Opening tease As with other NPR programs, Wait Wait offers a one-minute top-of-hour billboard teasing the program that will follow the network's hourly newscast (which traditionally starts at 1 minute past the hour). In this minute, the host offers a humorous comment on the week's news, mentions the identity of the week's interview guest, and sets up an out-of-context reading by Kurtis of a quote or game title from the episode. Who's Bill This Time? The contestant is asked to identify the speaker or explain the context of three quotations from that week's major news stories as read by Bill Kurtis. Each answer is followed by a humorous discussion of the story by the host and the panelists. Two correct answers constitute a win for the contestant. Prior to Kasell's retirement, the segment was known as \\"Who's Carl This Time?\\" and he read the quotations. Panel questions In two separate segments each week, the host asks the panelists questions regarding less serious stories in the week's news, awarding them one point for each correct answer. The questions are phrased similarly to those featured on The Match Game or Hollywood Squares to allow the panelists to offer a comedic answer in addition to their real guess as well as a hint from the host if needed. The answer is often followed by a discussion of the story. Bluff the Listener Each panelist reads an unusual story, all sharing a common theme. Only one of the three stories is genuine; the contestant wins the prize by choosing it. A sound bite from a person connected to the genuine story is played to reveal whether the contestant's guess is correct. Regardless of the outcome, the panelist whose story is chosen scores one point. Not My Job A celebrity guest calls in (or occasionally appears on stage) to be interviewed by the host and the panelists as well as take a three-question multiple-choice quiz. In Wait Waits early years, \\"Not My Job\\" guests were mainly culled from NPR's roster of personalities and reporters; the pool of guests later expanded to include guests of greater celebrity. As the segment's title suggests, the guests are quizzed on topics that are not normally associated with their field of work. For example, former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was asked questions on the history of Hugh Hefner and Playboy magazine, while author Salman Rushdie was asked about the history of Pez candy. Often, the subject matter of the quizzes serve as an oblique yet comic juxtaposition to the guests' fields of work, such as when Mad Men creator/producer Matthew Weiner was quizzed on ways people try to cheer others up (\\"Glad Men\\") in a March 2015 appearance.\\"Not My Job: 'Mad Men' Creator Matthew Weiner Gets Quizzed On Glad Men,\\" from NPR.org (3/28/2015) Stacey Abrams, who revealed that she wrote romance novels, was quizzed on fictional and historical \\"bromances.\\" Two correct answers from the guest constitute a win, with the prize going to a randomly selected listener who contacted the show but was not chosen as an on-air contestant. Listener Limerick Challenge Kurtis reads three limericks connected to unusual news stories, leaving out the last word of each. The contestant wins the prize by correctly completing any two of them. The limericks are written by Philipp Goedicke;Limerick Lesson by Philipp Goedicke Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me. after the contestant answers each one, Sagal provides a humorous summary of the relevant story. Lightning Fill-in-the-Blank In the final round, each panelist is given a series of eight fill-in-the-blank questions about news stories, both serious and frivolous, and must answer as many as he or she can in one minute (though given the show's loose format, the time limit is sometimes extended or ignored altogether), scoring two points for each correct answer. The questions often begin with \\"serious\\" news topics for the first few questions, but often degenerate into more and more unusual topics, with the eighth and final question often being particularly humorous. After the quiz, the panelist with the highest score is declared the week's champion (in the event of a tie for first place, the tying contestants are declared co- champions). Panelists do not receive prizes for winning.  Panelists' Predictions  Following the credits at the end of the show, the three panelists are asked to offer a comic \\"prediction\\" about an ongoing news story, often one discussed earlier in the program. Television In 2008, National Public Radio reached an agreement with CBS Entertainment to create a television pilot of Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!'Wait' may soon get answer on TV vision, Chicago Tribune, September 9, 2008 Peter Sagal and Carl Kasell would be in the pilot, and Doug Berman would be the executive producer.\\"Wait, Wait\\" To Become TV Show? - mediabistro.com The pilot was not picked up for regular production. On November 16, 2011, BBC America announced that the show would make its television debut with a \\"2011 Year in Review\\" special airing on December 23, to be retransmitted by NPR stations on the 24th and 25th. The taping included two American panelists‚Äî\\"Wait Wait\\" regulars Paula Poundstone and Alonzo Bodden‚Äîand British newcomer Nick Hancock. In December 2018, NBCUniversal announced it was developing a television version of Wait Wait‚Ä¶ Don't Tell Me! Live cinema On May 2, 2013, an episode was performed at the NYU Skirball Center for the Performing Arts in New York City and was streamed live via satellite as a Fathom Events presentation to hundreds of cinema theaters throughout the United States and Canada. The show included host Peter Sagal, announcer Carl Kasell, and panelists Mo Rocca, Paula Poundstone, and Tom Bodett. Celebrity guest Steve Martin won in the Not My Job segment. Parodies Al Franken's former talk radio show, The Al Franken Show, contained a segment called \\"Wait Wait... Don't Lie to Me!\\", where contestants had to determine if a soundbite played was truth, lie, or \\"weasel\\" (technically true, but designed to deceive). The podcast Welcome to Night Vale fictional community radio station alludes to a show following Cecil's news broadcast titled \\"Wait, Wait, Don't! No, Don't! Please, Don't!\\" The FX/FXX comedy You're the Worst features a parallel parody of the show called Tip of My Tongue within its universe.

In 19th-century Anglo maritime folklore, it was a kind of after-life for sailors who had served at least fifty years at sea.. In literature Fiddler's Green appears in Frederick Marryat's novel The Dog Fiend; Or, Snarleyyow, published in 1856, as lyrics to a sailors' song: > At Fiddler‚Äôs Green, where seamen true When here they‚Äôve done their duty The > bowl of grog shall still renew And pledge to love and beauty. Herman Melville describes a Fiddler's Green as a sailors' term for the place on land \\"providentially set apart for dance-houses, doxies, and tapsters\\" in his posthumous novella Billy Budd, Sailor, in 1924. Fiddler's Green is the title of a 1950 novel by Ernest K. Gann, about a fugitive criminal who works as a seaman after stowing away. The author Richard McKenna wrote a story, first published in 1967, entitled \\"Fiddler's Green\\", in which he considers the power of the mind to create a reality of its own choosing, especially when a number of people consent to it. The main characters in this story are also sailors, and have known of the legend of Fiddler's Green for many years. Fiddler's Green is an extrasolar colony mentioned in Robert A. Heinlein's novels The Cat Who Walks Through Walls and Friday. In Neil Gaiman's The Sandman comic book series, Fiddler's Green is a place located inside of the Dreaming, a place that sailors have dreamed of for centuries. Fiddler's Green is also personified as a character as well as a location in the fictional world, the former largely based upon casual associations of G. K. Chesterton. From November 12 to 14, 2004, a comic book convention promoted as \\"Fiddler's Green, A Sandman Convention\\" was held at the Millennium Hotel in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Author Neil Gaiman and several Sandman series artists and others involved in the series' publication participated in the convention, with profits benefiting the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund. In George Romero's 2005 film Land of the Dead, the safe, upper-class high-rise condo building is called \\"Fiddler's Green.\\" In music * A song called \\"Fiddler's Green\\" or more often \\"Fo'c'sle Song\\", was written by John Conolly, a Lincolnshire songwriter. It has been recorded by Tim Hart and Maddy Prior for their album Folk Songs of Olde England Vol. 2 (1968), by The Dubliners for their album Plain and Simple (1973), and by The Irish Rovers for their album Upon a Shamrock Shore: Songs of Ireland & the Irish (2000).

It is the main cultural and artistic center of the Val di Chiana after Arezzo. History Tabula Cortonensis The Palazzo Comunale. Cortona eventually became a Roman colony under the name Corito. The origin-legends and ancient names of Cortona are described by George Dennis.George Dennis, The Cities and Cemeteries of Etruria, Chapter LVI (Everyman's Library 1907, II, 379ff.) In the final stages of the Gothic War (535‚Äì554), Cortona was sacked and destroyed. Cortona became a Ghibellinian city state in the 13th century, with its own currency. From 1325 to 1409, the Ranieri-Casali family successfully ruled the town. After being conquered by Ladislaus of Naples in 1409, Cortona was sold to the Medici in 1411. In 1737, the senior branch of the Medici line became extinct and Cortona came under the authority of the House of Lorraine. Following the Italian Wars of Independence, Tuscany‚ÄîCortona included‚Äîbecame part of the Kingdom of Italy. Cortona foundation legend The foundation of Cortona remains mixed in legends dating to classic times. These were later reworked especially in the late Renaissance period under Cosimo I de' Medici. The 17th-century Guide of Giacomo Lauro, reworked from writings of Annio da Viterbo, states that 108 years after the Great Flood, Noah entered the Valdichiana via the Tiber and Paglia rivers. He preferred this place better than anywhere else in Italy, because it was so fertile, and dwelt there for thirty years. One of Noah's descendants was Crano, his son who came to the hilltop and, liking the high position, the fine countryside and the calm air, built the city of Cortona on it in 273 years after the Great Flood. Cortona DOC In 2000 Cortona established Cortona DOC (Denominazione di Origine Controllata), which has 29 members that produce and control 14 different types of wines.  Main sights  Via Nazionale or Ruga Piana. The prevailing character of Cortona's architecture is medieval with steep narrow streets situated on a hillside at an elevation of that embraces a view of the whole of the Valdichiana. From the Piazza Garibaldi (still referred to by the local population by its older name, Piazza Carbonaia) is a fine prospect of Lake Trasimeno, scene of Hannibal's ambush of the Roman army in 217 BC (Battle of Lake Trasimene). Parts of the Etruscan city wall can still be seen today as the basis of the present wall. The main street, via Nazionale, is the only street in the town with no gradient, and is still usually referred to by locals by its older name of Ruga Piana. Inside the Palazzo Casali is the Museo dell'Accademia Etrusca, displaying items from Etruscan, Roman, and Egyptian civilizations, as well as art and artefacts from the Medieval and Renaissance eras. The distinguished Etruscan Academy Museum had its foundation in 1727 with the collections and library of Onofrio Baldelli. Among its most famous ancient artefacts is the bronze lampadario or Etruscan hanging lamp, found at Fratta near Cortona in 1840 and then acquired by the Academy for the large sum of 1600 Florentine scudi. Its iconography includes (under the 16 burners) alternating figures of Silenus playing panpipes or double flutes, and of sirens or harpies. Within zones representing waves, dolphins and fiercer sea- creatures is a gorgon-like face with protruding tongue. Between each burner is a modelled horned head of Achelous. It is supposed that the lampadario derived from some important north Etruscan religious shrine of around the second half of the 4th century BC. A later (2nd century BC) inscription shows it was rededicated for votive purposes (tinscvil) by the Musni family at that time.P. Bruschetti et al., Il Museo dell'Accademia Etrusca di Cortona, Catalogo (2nd Ediz., Calosci, Cortona 1996). See also George Dennis, as above, 387-89. The Museum contains several other important Etruscan bronzes. The Fra Angelico Annunciation. Etruscan chamber-tombs nearby include the Tanella di PitagoraG. Dennis, as above, 390‚Äì393. (halfway up the hill from Camucia): the fine masonry of the tomb stands exposed, but was formerly covered by an earth mound. Two at the foot of the hillside at Il Sodo, and a complex in Camucia itself. Il Sodo I, the 'Grotta Sergardi' commonly known as 'Il Melone', contains a passage, opening into parallel passages leading to square inner chambers, within a mound about in circumference. Although the chambers are paved with slabs of masonry the walls are constructed of pieces of rock roughly-formed into bricks.G. Dennis, as above, pp. 393‚Äì96. This tomb can be visited. Il Sodo II contained a large stone-stepped altar platform with carved sphinxes devouring warriors.La Cortona dei Principes, ed P.Zamarchi Grassi, Cortona 1992. The town's chief artistic treasures are two panels by Fra Angelico in the Diocesan Museum, an Annunciation and a Madonna and Child with Saints. A third surviving work by the same artist is the fresco above the entrance to the church of San Domenico, likewise painted during his stay at Cortona in 1436. The Diocesan Museum houses also a group of work by Giuseppe Maria Crespi, known as Lo Spagnuolo, called Ecstasy of Saint Margaret. The Academy Museum includes the very well known painting Maternit√† of 1916 by the Cortonese artist Gino Severini. There are also examples of the works of Pietro da Cortona. The villa Bramasole built in 1504 was used as the location for the 2003 film Under the Tuscan Sun.  Renaissance architecture  The Church of Santa Maria Nuova, 1554, a central square-plan Renaissance church. Santa Maria Nuova, built by Giorgio Vasari in 1554, is a domed church with a centralized Greek cross layout. Inside are four large columns which supports the lantern of the cupola. At the sides the four arms of the cross branch out covered with barrel-vaults, while four small cupolas arise in the spaces of the angles. The interior contains paintings depicting a Nativity by Alessandro Allori, San Carlo Borromeo administers communion to those afflicted by Plague by Baccio Ciarpi, and an Annunciation by Empoli. The church is in poor condition, and the interior is not open for visitors. Santa Maria delle Grazie al Calcinaio was built in 1484‚Äì1515 by Francesco di Giorgio Martini to shelter a putatively miraculous icon of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the \\"Madonna del Calcinaio\\".G. Binding, Meister der Baukunst. Geschichte des Architekten- und Ingenieurberufes (Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, Darmstadt 2004), p. 158. This image was originally painted on the timbers of a lime-vat, a calcinaio, hence the name. A centralized Renaissance design was applied to the design of the nave: the eastern part of the building was generally developed into a centralized form, which would then be crowned with a large cupola, foreshadowing the cathedral at Florence. The restored interior has unusually high arches.

Close to Oxford Street and Regent Street, it is home to fashion and lifestyle retailers, including many independent fashion boutiques. Streets crossing, or meeting with, Carnaby Street are, from south to north, Beak Street, Broadwick Street, Kingly Court, Ganton Street, Marlborough Court, Lowndes Court, Fouberts Place, Little Marlborough Street and Great Marlborough Street. The nearest London Underground station is Oxford Circus. History Irvine Sellars and other boutiques, Carnaby Street, 1968 Carnaby Street derives its name from Karnaby House, which was built in 1683 to the east. The origin of the name is unknown. The street was probably laid out in 1685 or 1686. First appearing in the ratebooks in 1687, it was almost completely built up by 1690 with small houses. A market was developed in the 1820s. In his novel, Sybil (1845), Benjamin Disraeli refers to \\"a carcase- butcher famous in Carnaby-market\\".Benjamin Disraeli (1845) Sybil, chapter 1 This area is notable for a cholera outbreak in 1854 leading to an early application of fundamental epidemiological principles to resolve the crisis. John Snow, the physician who recognised the cases were concentrated near a pump on Broad Street communicated the finding on a map-based graphic. It led to the pump being locked and the reduction in cases of cholera was rapid. 20th century In 1934, Amy Ashwood Garvey and Sam Manning opened the Florence Mills Social Club,Garvey, Amy Ashwood (1897‚Äì1969) , BlackPast.org a jazz club that became a gathering place for supporters of Pan-Africanism,Black History in Westminster, City of Westminster at number 50. The first boutique, His Clothes, was opened by John Stephen in 1957 after his shop in Beak Street burned down and was followed by other men's fashion retailers including Gear, Mates, Ravel, and more. Harry Fox and Henry Moss opened Lady Jane, the first women's fashion boutique in 1966 and later rented Foubert's Place to I Was Lord Kitchener's Valet, their first outlet in the area. Round the corner in Kingly Street, Tommy Roberts opened his gift shop Kleptomania. He moved to Carnaby Street in 1967 and went on to make fame in the King's Road, Chelsea, with his Mr Freedom shop. By the 1960s, Carnaby Street was popular with followers of the mod and hippie styles. Many independent fashion designers such as Mary Quant, Marion Foale and Sally Tuffin, Lord John, Merc, Take Six, and Irvine Sellars had premises in the street and various underground music bars such as the Roaring Twenties opened in the surrounding streets. Bands such as the Small Faces, The Who, and The Rolling Stones appeared in the area to work (at the legendary Marquee Club round the corner in Wardour Street), shop, and socialise, it became one of the coolest destinations associated with 1960s Swinging London. The Carnaby Street contingent of Swinging London stormed into North American and international awareness with the 15 April 1966 publication of Time magazine's cover and article that extolled this street's role: In October 1973, the Greater London Council pedestrianised the street. Vehicular access is restricted between 11 am and 8 pm. A comparison of before and after number of pedestrians entering the area indicated a 30% increase in pedestrian flows as a result of the pedestrianisation. A campaign commenced early in 2010 to call for pedestrianisation in the adjacent area of Soho. Westminster City Council erected two green plaques, one at 1 Carnaby Street dedicated to fashion entrepreneur John Stephen, who began the Mod fashion revolution and another at 52/55 Carnaby Street is dedicated to the Mod pop group The Small Faces and their manager Don Arden. 21st century To celebrate the memory of Freddie Mercury after the release of Bohemian Rhapsody, the Carnaby Street arch is getting a rework with Queen's logo being put up until early 2019. Despite John Stephen closing his final business in 1975 (he died in 2004 aged 70) and the gradual movement to novelty shops with appeal to the ever increasing tourist trade, the boutique trade founded in Carnaby Street in 1957 by Stephen is still visible through the many shops of that ilk that still exist in the street today. Although featured in many books about London, the only book published which is exclusively about Carnaby Street and traces the history from the 1600s to 1970 is simply entitled Carnaby Street and was written by Tom Salter in 1970. Cultural impact Carnaby Street in 2006 In 1966 Lady Jane, the first ladies' fashion boutique opened, creating a public sensation when they had models getting dressed in the window, bringing Carnaby Street to a standstill. This typified the relaxed sexual attitude the era brought about. Carnaby Street was satirised by The Kinks in their 1966 hit, \\"Dedicated Follower of Fashion\\", which contains the line \\"Everywhere the Carnabetian Army marches on, each one a dedicated follower of fashion\\". It was mentioned in the 1967 film Smashing Time. One of the songs, \\"Carnaby Street\\", features the lyric: \\"You'll pay for the gear on display to appear on the scene/ It's no good being mean/ They'll have your every bean\\". In 1969, Peggy March recorded an album called In der Carnaby Street, with a hit song of the same name. A song by The Jam, \\"Carnaby Street\\", was written by bassist Bruce Foxton. It was the B-side of single \\"All Around the World\\". The season 15 episode of The Simpsons, \\"The Regina Monologues\\", features Carnaby Street. Carnaby Street the Musical opened in 2013. The show is set in the 1960s. The video game Heavy Rain has a location named Carnaby Corner North.

One of twelve frigates constructed in Australia during World War II, Barcoo (named after the Barcoo River), was laid down by Cockatoo Docks and Engineering Company, Ltd. at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard in 1942, and commissioned into the RAN in early 1944. Most of the ship's wartime service was spent in New Guinea waters; with primary duties including patrol, convoy escort, troop transport, along with the shelling of Japanese positions. In April 1945, Barcoo was attached to the Borneo campaign. She was the command ship for a landing craft division at the Tarakan landings in May, and directly supported the North Borneo landings in June, before being assigned to general escort and fire support roles. After World War II, Barcoo was converted into a survey ship. In 1948, the ship spent over a week aground on West Beach, South Australia after bring driven ashore by a storm. Barcoo spent the rest of her career surveying the waters of Australia and New Guinea, except for periods of deactivation from 1949 to 1951, and from 1956 to 1959. She was decommissioned for the final time in 1964, and sold for scrapping. Design and construction Barcoo was one of twelve frigates built in Australia during World War II.Royal Australian Navy, HMAS Barcoo She and seven other vessels were constructed to the British River-class design. Barcoo was in length, with a beam of , and a draught of . The frigate displaced 1,340 tonnes at standard load and 1,923 tonnes at full load. Propulsion machinery consisted of two Admiralty 3-drum boilers, feeding steam to reciprocating vertical triple expansion engines, which provided to drive two propeller shafts. Maximum speed was , and maximum range was at . The ship's company consisted of 140 personnel. Main armament for the frigate consisted of two QF /45 calibre Mark XVI guns in single HA/LA Mark XX mounts. This was supplemented by two QF 40 mm Bofors in single Mark VII mounts, and six QF 20 mm Oerlikons in single Mark III mounts. The ship also carried three anti-submarine mortars (one Hedgehog and two Squids) as well as depth charge throwers. Barcoo was laid down by the Cockatoo Docks and Engineering Company, Ltd., Sydney on 21 October 1942. The ship was launched on 26 August of the following year by the wife of Richard Keane, the Minister for Trade and Customs. Barcoo was commissioned at Sydney on 17 January 1944. Operational history=World War II After several weeks of working up, Barcoo was tasked to New Guinea in March 1944 for convoy escort duty. Barcoo and the corvette shelled Japanese positions on Kar Kar Island and at Banabun Harbour. From June to August, the frigate was heavily involved in convoy escort and troop transport duties. On 28 August, Barcoo rescued two United States Army Air Force pilots who had been forced to ditch their P-47 Thunderbolts at sea. During September and October, Barcoo returned to Sydney for maintenance refits. Returning to the New Guinea operations area, Barcoo operated against Japanese positions in New Guinea during November, including the shelling of Wilde Bay. Convoy escort and patrol duties continued until late January 1945, when the frigate returned to Australia. Barcoo was deployed again to New Guinea in late March 1945, and in April was assigned to United States Navy Task Force 78.1 to support the Borneo campaign. For the Tarakan landings on 1 May, Barcoo was designated as the ship in charge of the landing craft tank division of the assault force. Barcoo was also involved in the North Borneo landings in June, then was assigned to general escort and fire support duties for the rest of the campaign. The frigate fired in anger for the last time on 3 August 1945, during a bombardment of the village of Soengaipaten in Borneo. Barcoo received the three battle honours for her wartime service: \\"Pacific 1944‚Äì45\\", \\"New Guinea 1944\\", and \\"Borneo 1945\\". The ship had sailed over from commissioning until the end of World War II on 15 August. Post-war Immediately after the war, Barcoo was tasked with repatriation of soldiers and prisoners-of-war, along with patrols of reoccupied areas. After this, the frigate was docked for an eight-month refit at Williamstown Naval Dockyard to convert her into a survey ship.Gillett, Australian and New Zealand Warships since 1946, p. 51 Modification work was completed in July 1946, and the ship began surveying operations in August 1946. During her remaining career, she carried the pennant numbers F375 and A245 at various times. Barcoo aground on West Beach in April 1948 The ship was almost constantly deployed on survey operations in the waters of Australia and New Guinea for the next three years. In 1947, Barcoo conveyed Australian officials to Timor for visits to the governor of Portuguese (East) Timor and the Dutch colonial administrative centre in West Timor.Frame, No Pleasure Cruise, pp. 199‚Äì200 During April 1948, Barcoo and the sloop were deployed together for surveying operations off South Australia.Morley, Severe storm beaches ship On 11 April 1948, Barcoo ran aground at West Beach, South Australia, having been driven ashore by a violent storm.Gillett, Australian Ships, p. 117 Despite attempts to lighten the frigate by removing munitions and stores, the combined efforts of three tugboats were unable to pull Barcoo off the beach. A dredger was brought from Adelaide, which cleared a channel behind the stranded frigate. On the evening of 20 April, over a week after the initial beaching, Barcoo was able to be refloated. Warrego towed Barcoo to Port Adelaide for inspection and repairs. Barcoo was placed in reserve in May 1949. She was recommissioned in March 1951 for use as a training vessel for anti-submarine exercises. The ship resumed survey duties of the Australian coast from July 1952 to April 1956, then returned to Sydney and was paid off on 25 September. The ship was reactivated for further survey work on 7 December 1959. By this point, the ship's armament had been reduced to a single 40 mm Bofors gun. Other modifications around the time of her reactivation included the strengthening of the forward tripod mast, and the addition of a deckhouse on the aft deck.Gillett, Australian and New Zealand Warships since 1946, p. 50 Decommissioning and fate Morshead War Veterans Home, Lyneham, Australian Capital Territory. Barcoo was decommissioned for the final time on 21 February 1964. The frigate had travelled during her career. The ship was sold for scrapping on 15 February 1972 to N. W. Kennedy, Ltd., Vancouver. The frigate was towed from Sydney to Hong Kong in March, then was taken to Taiwan to be broken up.

She was launched on 15 January 1944 by Jean MacArthur, the wife of General Douglas MacArthur. The ship was commissioned into the RAN on 25 May 1945, with construction work completing on 26 June. The destroyer was originally to be named Chingilli, but this was changed to Kurnai (after the Kurnai or Gunai Aborigines) before construction started.Cassells, The Destroyers, pp. 25‚Äì6 The name was changed yet again prior to the ship's launch to Bataan; honouring ties between Australia and the United States by recognising the stand by US troops during the Battle of Bataan, and reciprocating the US decision to name a cruiser in honour of the Australian cruiser , lost at the Battle of Savo Island. On entering service, Bataan sailed to Japan via the Philippines; although arriving too late to participate in combat, she was present in Tokyo for the official Japanese surrender on 2 September 1945. Bataan remained in Japanese waters until 18 November, serving as representative of the Australian military and helping coordinate the repatriation of prisoners-of-war. Between late 1946 and late 1949, the destroyer spent 17 months over four tours of duty in Japanese waters with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. The rest of these three years was spent operating in Australian waters. Bataan operating off Korea In late June 1950, Bataan was en route to Japan for a fifth tour when the Korean War started. From early July 1950 until 29 May 1951, the destroyer operated off Korea; patrolling and blockading, escorting aircraft carriers, and bombarding shore targets. A second Korean tour occurred between 4 February and 31 August 1952, with Bataan fulfilling most of the same duties as before. Bataan was presented with the battle honour \\"Korea 1950‚Äì52\\" for her service. In November 1953, Bataan visited Singapore. This was the only time since the Korean War, and the only time for the rest of her career, that the destroyer would leave Australian waters. Decommissioning and fate Bataan paid off at Sydney on 18 October 1954, and was laid up in reserve awaiting conversion to an anti-submarine escort.Gillett & Graham, Warships of Australia, p. 166 The conversion was cancelled in 1957, with Bataan placed on the disposal list,Whitley, 'Destroyers of World War II, pp. 19-20 then sold for scrap to T. Carr and Company of Sydney in 1958.

A Democrat, he was appointed by United States President Woodrow Wilson to serve as Secretary of the Navy during World War I. He became a close friend and supporter of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who served as his Assistant Secretary of the Navy and later was elected as United States President. Roosevelt appointed Daniels as his Ambassador to Mexico, 1933‚Äì1941. Daniels was a vehement white supremacist and segregationist and, along with Charles Aycock and Furnifold Simmons, was a leading perpetrator of the 1898 Wilmington insurrection. As Secretary of the Navy, Daniels handled policy and formalities in World War I while his top aide, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, handled the major wartime decisions. As ambassador to Mexico after its revolution, Daniels dealt with the anti-American government and its expropriation of American oil investments. In North Carolina in the early 20th century, he had been a leading progressive, supporting public schools and public works, and calling for more regulation of trusts and railroads. He supported prohibition and women's suffrage, and used his newspapers to support the regular Democratic Party ticket. He was a powerful supporter of the Ku Klux Klan, although never a member. Daniels believed that \\"the greatest folly and crime\\" in U.S. history was giving 'Negroes' the vote. He and his newspaper \\"championed the white supremacy cause in frequent news reports, vigorously worded editorials, provocative letters, and vicious front page cartoons that called attention to what the newspaper called the horrors of 'negro rule.'\\" Daniels argued that as long as African Americans had any political power, they would block progressive reforms.Craig, 1913 He was highly influential in the state legislature's passage in 1900 of a suffrage amendment that effectively disenfranchised most blacks in the state, excluding them from the political system for decades until the late 20th century. They were also excluded from juries and subject to legal racial segregation. Early life and career Josephus Daniels was born in 1862 to a shipbuilder and his wife in Washington, North Carolina, located on the Pamlico River in Beaufort County. The state had seceded from the Union in 1861. Before the boy was 3, his father was killed by a Confederate sharpshooter, because of his well-known Union sympathies. The father was attempting to leave with Federal forces evacuating Washington, N.C. during the Civil War. Young Daniels moved with his widowed mother and two siblings to Wilson, North Carolina. He was educated at Wilson Collegiate Institute and at Trinity College (now Duke University). Daniels edited and eventually purchased a local newspaper, the Wilson Advance. Within a few years, he became part owner, along with his brother Charles, of the Kinston Free Press and the Rocky Mount Reporter. He studied law at the University of North Carolina (today the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) and was admitted to the bar in 1885, but did not practice law. After becoming increasingly involved in the North Carolina Democratic Party and taking over the weekly paper Daily State Chronicle, Daniels served as North Carolina's state printer in 1887‚Äì1893. He was appointed as chief clerk of the Federal Department of the Interior under Grover Cleveland in 1893-95. Marriage and family In 1888, Daniels married Addie Worth Bagley. She was the granddaughter of former Governor Jonathan Worth. They had four sons: Josephus, Worth Bagley, Jonathan Worth, and Frank A. Daniels II. Jonathan followed his father into public service, serving as a special assistant and, briefly, White House Press Secretary to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1940s. Raleigh News and Observer In 1894, with the financial assistance of industrialist Julian S. Carr, also a white supremacist, Daniels acquired a controlling interest in the Raleigh News & Observer, and left his federal position. Under his leadership, the paper was a strong advocate for the Democratic Party, which at the time was struggling to maintain its power in the state against a fusion of the Republicans and Populists.Zogry, \\"Josephus Daniels,\\" p. 303. According to Daniels in his autobiography, \\"The News and Observer was relied upon to carry the Democratic message and to be the militant voice of White Supremacy, and it did not fail in what was expected.\\" In the Findings of the Wilmington Race Riot Commission, Daniels is the only name mentioned as a cause of the Wilmington insurrection of 1898, Daniels printed numerous articles intended to stoke fears of black men as rapists of white women. A lone white woman noticing a black man in her vicinity would be written up in the paper as a narrowly avoided rape. Daniels also argued that achieving political office emboldened black men to commit more outrages against white women. He hired Norman E. Jennett to spread his message among the 25% of white voters who were illiterate. Daniels admitted later that actual assaults committed by black men on white women were very few in number. However his newspaper coverage had the desired effect of winning Populists over to the Democratic Party. Newspapers were sold at cost to the Democratic Party, which distributed them to white voters.Zucchino, pp. 76-82 According to historian Helen Edmonds, the paper \\"led in a campaign of prejudice, bitterness, vilification, misrepresentation, and exaggeration to influence the emotions of the whites against the Negro.\\" The result was the only successful coup d'√©tat in American history, the overthrow of an elected government by force. The Democratic \\"white supremacy\\" campaign led to Democratic victories in 1898 and 1900. Having regained control of the state legislature, the Democrats passed a suffrage amendment raising barriers to voter registration, which affected most African Americans in the state. The political exclusion was maintained into the late 1960s. Later in life, while discussing his success, \\"Daniels admitted that the paper was occasionally excessive in its bias toward Democrats and that stories were not fully researched before publication and probably could not be 'sustained in a court of justice.'\\" He supported a number of progressive causes, such as public education and anti- child-labor laws. As Secretary of the Navy, he banned the consumption of alcohol aboard U.S. naval vessels. Josephus Daniels never apologized for using the newspaper to encourage white supremacist violence in 1898. In his memoir he spoke positively about the actions of Red Shirts and how his white supremacy campaign had crushed \\"Negro domination.\\" The News and Observer remained under Daniels' family control until 1995, when it was sold to The McClatchy Company. In 2006 the newspaper published an editorial apologizing for its role in the Wilmington Massacre of 1898.Zucchino, pp. 343-344 Secretary of the Navy Daniels supported southerner Woodrow Wilson in the 1912 presidential election. After Wilson's victory, he was appointed as Secretary of the Navy. Letter from Daniels confirming that the Navy Cross was conferred on Ernesto Burzagli in the name of the President of the United States in 1919. Captain Burzagli was an officer in the Royal Italian Navy. Secretary Daniels held the post from 1913 to 1921, throughout the Wilson administration, overseeing the Navy during World War I. Franklin D. Roosevelt, a future US president, served as his Assistant Secretary of the Navy.Haugen, Brenda. (2006). Franklin Delano Roosevelt, p. 42. Edwin Denby. Daniels believed in government ownership of armor-plate factories, and of telephones and telegraphs. At the end of the First World War, he made a serious attempt to have the Navy permanently control all radio transmitters in the United States. If he had succeeded amateur radio would have ended, and it is likely that radio broadcasting would have been substantially delayed. Teetotaler Daniels banned alcohol from United States Navy ships in General Order 99 of June 1, 1914. (After the end of Prohibition in 1933, ship commanders determined that alcohol continue to be banned on board ship but that limited access to beer be maintained for sailors with 45 days or more of service on their records. Limited access to harder alcoholic beverages by officers to be distributed at their discretion was subsequently maintained for use on shore during official leave from onboard duty.)\\"A Hundred Years Dry: The U.S. Navy's End of Alcohol at Sea,\\" Staff of the United States Naval Institute, USNI News, internet website , accessed 15 Oct 2018. In 1917, Secretary Daniels determined that no prostitution would be permitted within a five-mile radius of naval installations. In New Orleans, this World War I directive resulted in the shutting down of brothels in Storyville. It had long-lasting consequences for servicemen and others during subsequent decades.Stanonis, Anthony. (1997). \\"An Old House in the Quarter: Vice in the Vieux Carr√© of the 1930s.\\" Loyola University New Orleans History Writing Award. On March 15, 1919, Daniels issued General Order No. 456, prohibiting all forms of work on the Christian Sabbath (Sunday). He ordered, > In order to insure a proper observance of the Lord's Day in the Navy of the > United States, and to provide the officers and men with rest and recreation > so essential to efficiency, the following order will be carry out: Hereafter > all commanding officers and others officially concerned will see to it that > aboard ships and on shore stations to which they are attached, no work of > any character whatsoever is performed except works of necessity. This order > will be construed and embracing target practice, and drills of every > character, inspection of ship and crew, clothing inspection, issuing of > small stores, and all other ship activities that violate the letter and > spirit of this order. No vessel of the Navy shall begin cruise on Sunday > except in case of emergency ... During World War I, Daniels created the Naval Consulting Board to encourage inventions that would be helpful to the Navy. Daniels asked Thomas Edison to chair the Board, as the Secretary was worried that the US was unprepared for the new conditions of warfare and needed new technology.Scott, Lloyd N. (2002). Naval Consulting Board of the United States, pp. 286-288. Additionally, Daniels was the first Secretary of the Navy to sponsor naval aviation. He established the first naval air station at the Pensacola Navy Yard, claiming \\"aircraft must form a large part of our naval force for offensive and defensive operations\\".Daniel J. Carrison, The United States Navy (Praeger, 1968), p. 117. The Newport Sex Scandal erupted due to a Navy sting operation, overseen by Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt, that was conducted in 1919. Begun as an attempt to clean up what was seen as \\"immoral conditions\\" at Naval Station Newport, it expanded to investigations of the civilian population in Newport. It resulted in the arrests for homosexual activity of some 17 sailors and a prominent Episcopal Navy chaplain, with imprisonment imposed for some. When the tactics used in the sting operation became known, it attracted national news coverage. Congress undertook an investigation, resulting in both Secretary Daniels and Roosevelt being rebuked by a Congressional committee. The report called FDR's behavior \\"reprehensible,\\" and said that the actions \\"violated the code of the American citizen and ignored the rights of every American boy who enlisted in the Navy to fight for his country.\\".. Daniels published The Navy and the Nation (1919), which was primarily a collection of war addresses he had made as Secretary of the Navy. Later life After leaving government service in 1921, Daniels resumed the editorship of the Raleigh News and Observer. Daniels strongly supported Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt for president in 1932. Ambassador to Mexico President Roosevelt appointed Daniels as United States Ambassador to Mexico a post which he held from 1933 thru 1941. He expected Daniels to help carry out his \\"Good Neighbor Policy\\" in Latin America. But Daniels' arrival in Mexico City was marred by a violent demonstration when a group of Mexicans stoned the American Embassy.Dent, David W. (1995). U.S.-Latin American Policymaking: A Reference Handbook, p. 313. Roosevelt appointed Daniels in order to heal the rift caused by the US invasion of Mexico during its civil war. Daniel's speeches and policies while serving as Ambassador to Mexico are believed to have improved US-Mexican relations. He praised a proposed Mexican plan for universal popular education and, in a speech to US consular officials, advised them to refrain from interfering too much in the affairs of other nations.Lee A. Craig, Josephus Daniels: His Life and Times (2013) pp 399-410 =Anti-Catholicism= American Catholics bitterly attacked Daniels for failing to oppose the virulent attacks on the Catholic Church by the Mexican government during and after its revolution. Daniels was a staunch Methodist, and worked with Catholics in the U.S., but had little sympathy for the Church in Mexico. He believed that it represented the landed aristocracy, which stood opposed to his version of liberalism. In Mexico, the main issue was the government's efforts to shut down Catholic schools; Daniels publicly approved these attacks and praised anti-Catholic Mexican politicians. In a July 1934 speech at the American Embassy, Daniels praised the anti- Catholic efforts that had been led by the former president, Plutarco El√≠as Calles: > General Calles sees, as Jefferson saw, that no people can be both free and > ignorant. Therefore, he and President Rodriguez, President-elect Cardenas > and all forward-looking leaders are placing public education as the > paramount duty of the country. They all recognize that General Calles issued > a challenge that goes to the very root of the settlement of all problems of > tomorrow when he said: 'We must enter and take possession of the mind of > childhood, the mind of youth.'E. David Cronon, \\"American Catholics and > Mexican Anticlericalism, 1933-1936,\\" Mississippi Valley Historical Review > (1958) 45#2 pp. 201-230 in JSTOR; quote p. 207 Daniels warned the Mexicans they should not be so harsh against the Church.Robert H. Vinca, \\"The American Catholic Reaction to the Persecution of the Church in Mexico, from 1926-1936,\\" Records of the American Catholic Historical Society of Philadelphia (1968) Issue 1, pp 3-38. Return to North Carolina In 1941, his son, Jonathan, was named a special assistant to Roosevelt. At that time, Daniels resigned his ambassadorial post in Mexico to return to North Carolina. There he resumed the editor's post at the News & Observer, and continued his outspoken editorial style. Daniels published several recollections of his years in public office. In addition to The Navy and the Nation, he wrote Our Navy at War (1922), The Life of Woodrow Wilson (1924), and The Wilson Era (1944). Daniels and his son Jonathan were passengers on Franklin Roosevelt's 1945 funeral train from Raleigh until Roosevelt's burial at his home of Springwood in Hyde Park, New York. The father and son rode the train back to Washington, D.C. in the company of widow Eleanor Roosevelt and the new President, Harry S. Truman.FDR's Funeral Train by Robert Klara During the course of his life, Daniels operated several newspapers, culminating with the News & Observer, which is still in operation. He served in public office with a strong belief in improving conditions for labor and the working class. The story of Daniels' life closely mirrors that of North Carolina during the same time period. From the catastrophe of Civil War to national prominence, Daniels was a prime example of the strengths and weaknesses that marked the progress of his state. In 1941, he retired to Raleigh due to his wife's poor health; she died in 1943. After completing a five-volume autobiography, in which he expressed regret over his vicious attacks (but not the overall righteousness) of the White Supremacy campaign of the late 19th century, Daniels died in Raleigh on January 15, 1948 at the age of eighty-five. He is buried in Historic Oakwood Cemetery of that city. Daniels divided his shares of the News and Observer among all his children and Jonathan became editor. The family retained control until it sold the paper in 1995.Zogry, \\"Josephus Daniels,\\" p. 304. Legacy and honors According to historian John Milton Cooper: :Josephus Daniels epitomized, often simultaneously, much of the best and worst in the post-Civil War South. Lifelong sympathy for the poor and underprivileged led him to champion the causes of public education, organized labor, women's rights, freedom of the press, religious liberty, and democratic government....Yet at the same time he fully shared, even capitalized upon, the prejudices of his fellow Southern whites....Despite frequent clashes with party conservatives, Daniels never wavered in his Southern Democratic loyalty, and though his early Negrophobia mellowed decidedly in later years, he declined to question white supremacy....Daniels broke with Bryan in the 1920s over the antievolution crusade and the Ku Klux Klan. Similarly in spite of a common attachment to peace, the two men split during World War I. In personality and as a public figure, Daniels combined two sets of contrasting qualities: gentle amiability and combative controversiality; unaffected simplicity of character and outlook and shrewd, skillful management of men and affairs....On balance, his contributions to the South fell heavily on the side of humanitarianism and progress, and both his newspaper and his sons continued Daniels's example of enlightened, responsible journalism and public service.John Milton Cooper, Jr., \\"Daniels, Josephus,\\" in John A. Garraty, ed., Encyclopedia of American biography (1974) pp 252-253. *After his wife's death in 1943, in 1944 the S.S. Addie Daniels was commissioned in her honor. *In 1956, the new Daniels Middle School in Raleigh was named after him. On June 16, 2020, the Wake County Board of Education voted unanimously to rescind the naming of the school and to rename it Oberlin Middle School. Daniels Hall on North Carolina State University's main campus is also named after him.North Carolina State University: Daniels Hall On June 22, 2020, the NC State Board of Trustees voted to rename Daniels Hall. Chancellor Randy Woodson said \\"Josephus Daniels had strong ties to white supremacy and played a leading role in the Wilmington insurrection of 1898. The building‚Äôs name had served as a constant reminder of a shameful part of our state‚Äôs history.\\" Until the future renovations are completed, the building has been temporarily denoted \\"Beat Navy Hall\\" in recognition of the strong partnerships with the US Army and the academic departments within the building. * *His home, Wakestone, is now a National Historic Landmark. It is now used as a Masonic Temple. A statue of Daniels formerly stood in Nash Square in Raleigh. It was removed on June 16, 2020, after the killing of George Floyd and subsequent widespread civil unrest. Members of his family approved of the removal. In fiction In Harry Turtledove's \\"Southern Victory\\" series of alternate history novels, Daniels was US Secretary of the Navy during the timeline's analog of World War I, and the US Navy named a destroyer escort after him during the series's version of World War II.

Laid down in 1915, wartime shortages and design modifications meant the ship was not completed until 1922, earning her the nickname \\"HMAS Longdelayed\\". Adelaide served with the Royal Navy's Special Service Squadron during 1924 and 1925, and was involved in the 1927 Malaita massacre. She was decommissioned in 1928, but was modernised and returned to service just before World War II began. During the war, Adelaide was involved in successful efforts to secure the colony of New Caledonia for Free France, was present during the Japanese midget submarine attack on Sydney Harbour, and intercepted the German blockade runner Ramses. The cruiser was decommissioned in 1946, and broken up for scrap in 1949. Design and construction The design of Adelaide was modified from the Chatham subclass of the light cruisers, with similarities to the Birmingham subclass. The ship was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of , and a draught of .Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 5 The initial ship's company stood at 33 officers and 450 sailors, but by 1941, this had dropped to 26 officers and 436 sailors. The propulsion system consisted of Parsons turbines providing to two propeller shafts. As designed, the ship had a maximum speed of , but modifications during her career saw this increase to during the 1920s, then drop to by 1941. The cruiser was originally fuelled by both coal and oil, but the ship's refit in 1938‚Äì39 saw her converted to oil only, along with the removal of the foremost funnel and boilers.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 6 Adelaide was laid down at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard, Sydney on 20 November 1915.Royal Australian Navy, HMAS Adelaide (I) She was launched on 27 July 1918 by Lady Helen Munro Ferguson, the wife of the Governor-General of Australia, Sir Ronald Munro Ferguson.Perryman, Ships Named Adelaide, p. 1 Construction was not completed until 31 July 1922 because of wartime shortages, loss of machinery part forgings for items that could not be made in Australia to enemy action, and modifications based on wartime experience: the ship was consequently nicknamed \\"HMAS Longdelayed\\". She was finally commissioned into the RAN on 5 August 1922. Adelaide cost 1,271,782 pounds to build. Gun crew loading one of Adelaide 6-inch guns in 1939 The ship's badge was based on the municipal seal of the City of Adelaide. Her motto was \\"Ut Prosint Omnibus Conjuncti\\", Latin for \\"United for the Common Weal\\".Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 9 Some incorrect versions of the ship's badge show the motto as \\"United We Stand\\", the motto for . Armament At launch, the cruiser's armament consisted of nine BL 6-inch Mk XII naval guns, a single QF 3-inch anti-aircraft gun, a single Ordnance QF 12-pounder 8 cwt field gun, four QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss saluting guns, ten .303-inch machine guns (a mix of Lewis and Maxim guns), two submerged broadside 21-inch torpedo tubes, and two depth charge chutes. The number of machine guns was increased to twelve in 1924. During a refit in 1938 and 1939, Adelaides armament was altered. One 6-inch gun, the field gun, the anti-aircraft gun, and the torpedo tubes were all removed. They were replaced with three 4-inch anti-aircraft guns. Fire-control equipment was also upgraded at this time.Perryman, Ships Named Adelaide, p. 2 During May and June 1942, the anti-aircraft armament was supplemented by six 20 mm Oerlikon guns. Another refit lasting from June to September 1943 saw a second 6-inch gun removed, the 4-inch armament reduced to two guns, and four hydraulic depth charge throwers installed. Operational history=1922‚Äì1939 Adelaide sailing into Burrard Inlet in British Columbia, Canada, during the 1924 Special Service Squadron world cruise. After a brief sea-trials and working up period off Jervis Bay, Adelaide spent the period from commissioning until February 1924 operating on standard duties and exercises throughout the Australia Station. On 18 April 1924, following a brief refit, she joined the Royal Navy's Special Service Squadron for a flag- showing cruise outside Australian waters. During the voyage, Adelaide visited New Zealand, Fiji, Hawaii, the western coasts of Canada and the United States, the Panama Canal (becoming the first RAN ship to travel through), the Caribbean, and eastern Canada, before reaching Portsmouth on 28 September. The cruiser left for home on 10 January 1925, sailing via the Mediterranean, Ceylon, Singapore, and Thursday Island, and reached Sydney on 7 April. In October 1927, Adelaide was called to the Solomon Islands in response to the killing of a district officer, a cadet, and fifteen native police by Kwaio natives at Malaita. Arriving at Tulagi on 14 October, an officer and sixteen sailors were sent ashore to reinforce local law enforcement. The ship then proceeded to Malaita to protect the landing of three platoons of troops on 17 October, then remained in the area to provide personnel support for the soldiers as they searched for the killers, in what became the Malaita massacre. Adelaide returned to Australia on 23 November. Over the next year, Adelaide continued a pattern of exercises and promotional visits to Australian ports. The cruiser was paid off into reserve on 27 June 1928. During 1938 and 1939, the ship underwent a 60,000 pound modernisation, which included the conversion from both coal and oil as fuel to oil-only (requiring the removal of two boilers and an exhaust funnel), and alterations to the cruiser's armament. The cruiser was recommissioned on 13 March 1939, and undertook exercises with the Australian and New Zealand Squadrons. The ship returned to Sydney in late April, and was paid off again on 17 May, so that the ship's company could be sent to England aboard to commission the new light cruiser . With the threat of war in Europe imminent, Adelaide was prepared for a return to service, and was commissioned on 1 September.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 7 World War II The ship was initially used for convoy escort and protection duties in Australian waters. In September 1940, Adelaide carried the French official Henri Sautot from the New Hebrides (later Vanuatu) to Noum√©a, New Caledonia. Sautot had been appointed governor by Free French leader Charles de Gaulle, following attempts by Vichy France to gain control of the French colony. On 3 September, while en route, Adelaide collided with the merchant vessel SS Coptic. (Although both ships only suffered minor damage, the Shaw, Savill & Albion Line sued the Australian government in 1947 for ¬£35,000 in damages.) After Sautot landed, on 25 September, Adelaide patrolled off the coast, to counter a perceived threat from the Vichy sloop Dumont d'Urville. The Australian cruiser remained in the area until the situation had stabilised, returning to Sydney on 8 October. Adelaide resumed escort and patrol duties around Australia and New Guinea waters. During May to July 1942, Adelaide was docked at Garden Island for a refit, focused primarily on increasing the ship's anti-aircraft weapon outfit.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 8 Consequently, the ship was one of several major Allied vessels in Sydney Harbour during the Japanese midget submarine attack of 31 May 1942.Gillett, Warships of Australia, pp. 193‚Äì4 After the refit, Adelaide was assigned to Fremantle for convoy escort work in the Indian Ocean. In November 1942, Adelaide, along with the Dutch cruiser and the Australian corvettes and , escorted a convoy across the southern Indian Ocean. On 28 November, the ships spotted an unidentified vessel, which claimed to be the Norwegian merchantman Taiyang. Officers aboard Adelaide recognised the ship as the German blockade runner Ramses, but did not receive a response to their challenging until two boats were lowered from the ship, followed by the sound of an explosion from a scuttling charge. Adelaide opened fire, hitting with the third salvo onwards, and continued shooting until Ramses sank eight minutes later, then recovered the Germans from the boats. Adelaide continued to operate from Fremantle until October 1944, apart from a refit at Williamstown Naval Dockyard from June to September 1943, where further armament alterations were made. On 8 October 1944, the cruiser made for Sydney. On 26 February 1945, Adelaide was decommissioned, but then recommissioned on 19 May to serve as a tender to the naval base . Adelaide was awarded the battle honours \\"Pacific 1941‚Äì43\\" and \\"East Indies 1942\\" for her wartime service. Decommissioning and fate Adelaides main-mast at Ku-ring- gai Chase National Park Adelaide was decommissioned for the final time on 13 May 1946. The ship was stripped of equipment during 1947, and on 24 January 1949, the hulk was sold to Australian Iron and Steel for breaking up. Adelaide was towed by the tug to Port Kembla during 1 and 2 April, where she was scrapped. As a memorial to the ship the main-mast was erected alongside the Sphynx Memorial in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, Sydney, in about 1950.Cassells, The Capital Ships, p. 10 An information plaque with a diagram of the ship was installed nearby. One of the cruiser's 6-inch guns was found at a rubbish tip in Victoria; this was restored, then placed on display at HMAS Cerberus, Victoria. The ship's bell came first to the Amazon Hotel in Exeter, England, removed to the Spice Lounge restaurant in Exmouth. In 2014, a shield removed from HMAS Adelaide during a refit in 1943 and dumped on a tip on the Mornington Peninsula, Victoria, was transported to Perth for refurbishment. A member of the Royal Australian Artillery Historical Society of Western Australia, which had been searching for such a shield for 20 years as a match for a 6-inch Mk XI naval gun it held from HMAS Sydney, a ship scrapped in 1928, had spotted the shield at location. The naval gun and shield were installed at the Leighton Battery in September 2015 to replicate the original 6-inch guns at site.

Born in Medina, New York, he was a star student at Cornell University, where he became interested in beetles and started on a revision of the Nearctic Silphidae. He graduated in 1942, the same year that he married his high school sweetheart Mary Ennis. His first job was at the New York State Conservation Department, studying the stomach contents of game birds, but in July 1942 he joined the US Army (as a private) and was sent to Lowry Air Force Base to study the Sperry bombsight. After this diversion into non-insect work, he went to Avon Park Air Force Range in Florida to survey the mosquito population and control it, and from there to the Army School of Malariology in Panama to teach mosquito taxonomy. In October 1945 he was discharged and returned to Cornell for graduate study, where he studied under Robert Matheson and Walter Muenscher, receiving a master's degree in 1946 and the doctorate in 1948, where he returned to beetle work, revising the Oedemeridae. He started the Coleopterist's Bulletin in 1947, while still a grad student. In July 1948, the newly minted Dr. Arnett moved to Arlington, Virginia and went to work for the USDA as a beetle taxonomist. He returned to academia in 1954 however, as head of the biology department of Saint John Fisher College in Rochester, New York, then to The Catholic University of America in 1958, where he published his best-known work Beetles of the United States (1963). In 1966 Arnett moved to Purdue University, later spending three years as Henry L. Beadel Fellow at the Tall Timbers Research Station near Tallahassee, Florida, and then in 1973 moving to Siena College in Loudonville, New York. In 1979 he resigned his position to write full-time, publishing several books, then in 1982 founding Flora and Fauna Publications in Gainesville, Florida. The company was bought by E.J. Brill Publishers, but in 1989 they stopped doing biology, and he formed Sandhill Crane Press to continue with his work. He also founded the Center for Systematic Entomology during this time. He died at his home in Gainesville, while working on a new handbook American Beetles, which was published posthumously.

One of four ships ordered from the United States, Darwin entered service in 1984. During her career, she has operated in the Persian Gulf, as part of the INTERFET peacekeeping taskforce, and off the Solomon Islands. The frigate underwent a major upgrade during 2007 and 2008. She was decommissioned on 9 December 2017 and was supposed to be scuttled as a dive wreck in Tasmania, but the deal was pulled by the Tasmanian Government and her fate remains uncertain. Design and construction Following the cancellation of the Australian light destroyer project in 1973, the British Type 42 destroyer and the American Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigate were identified as alternatives to replace the cancelled light destroyers and the Daring-class destroyers.Jones, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 220 Although the Oliver Hazard Perry class was still at the design stage, the difficulty of fitting the Type 42 with the SM-1 missile, and the success of the Perth-class acquisition (a derivative of the American Charles F. Adams-class destroyer) compared to equivalent British designs led the Australian government to approve the purchase of two US-built Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates in 1976.Frame, Pacific Partners, pp. 102, 162 A third was ordered in 1977, followed by a fourth (Darwin), with all four ships integrated into the USN's shipbuilding program.Frame, Pacific Partners, p. 162MacDougall, Australians at war, p. 345Hooton, Perking-up the Perry class A further two ships were ordered in 1980, and were constructed in Australia.

Two helicopters can be embarked: either two S-70B Seahawk or one Seahawk and one AS350B Squirrel. The ship was laid down by Todd Pacific Shipyards at Seattle, Washington on 3 July 1981, to the Perry class Flight III design. The Adelaides were built as part of the United States Navy's construction program, so were assigned USN hull numbers; Darwin was FFG-44. She was launched on 26 March 1982 and commissioned into the RAN on 21 July 1984. Operational history During her career, Darwin has been deployed to the Persian Gulf on five occasions: during 1990, 1991, 1992, 2002, and 2004. Darwin was deployed to East Timor as part of the Australian-led INTERFET peacekeeping taskforce from 19 September to 3 November 1999. From 14‚Äì18 February 2001 Darwin was berthed in the Mumbai harbour in column RE for the International Fleet Review. The ship was deployed to the Solomon Islands in 2001. Darwin underwent a major upgrade and refit at Garden Island during 2007 and 2008, returning to service prior to November 2008. On the morning of 13 March 2009, Darwin was one of seventeen warships involved in a ceremonial fleet entry and fleet review in Sydney Harbour, the largest collection of RAN ships since the Australian Bicentenary in 1988. The frigate did not participate in the fleet entry, but was anchored in the harbour for the review. Following an overhaul of the RAN battle honours system, Darwin was granted three battle honours in 2010: \\"East Timor 1999\\", \\"Persian Gulf 2003-03\\", and \\"Iraq 2003\\". In October 2013, Darwin participated in the International Fleet Review 2013 in Sydney. April 2014 saw Darwin, as part of Combined Task Force 150, intercept 1,032 kg of heroin on a dhow off the east coast of Africa, followed in July by a further 6,248 kg of hashish on a dhow in the Indian Ocean. As of 7 January 2016, Darwin has sailed over 1 million nautical miles. In February 2016, Darwin was one among the 100 ships participating in the International Fleet Review 2016 in Vishakhapattanam. In March 2016, Darwin intercepted a small, stateless fishing vessel about 170 nautical miles off the coast of Oman. On board they found more than 2,000 pieces of weaponry, including 1,989 AK-47 assault rifles and 100 rocket propelled grenades. According to a U.S. assessment, the weapons were initially sent from Iran and were likely intended for Houthi rebels in Yemen. In May 2016, Darwin made three seizures of heroin worth $800 million of the coast of Africa. The Royal New Zealand Navy invited the Royal Australian Navy to send a vessel to participate in their 75th Birthday Celebrations over the weekend of 19‚Äì21 November 2016; however, following the Kaikoura earthquake on New Zealand's South Island, Darwin was sent to aide in humanitarian and disaster relief operations. Darwin was decommissioned in a ceremony held at Garden Island, Sydney on 9 December 2017. She and the other Adelaides are to be replaced by the s. Fate In August 2018, Australian Defense Minister Marise Payne announced that Darwin would be scuttled as a reef in Skeleton Bay, near St Helens, Tasmania. The ship was expected to be scuttled sometime in 2019, but the Tasmanian Government later rejected the proposal citing costs. In response, a new campaign emerged attempting to preserve her as a museum ship. On 21 August 2019, several oil drums under Darwin caught fire at Henderson.

The movement came into being when it became clear that neither of Canada's two main right-of-centre political parties, the Reform Party of Canada/Canadian Alliance (CA) and the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada (PC), was independently capable of defeating the governing Liberal Party. The objective of the movement, therefore, was to merge the two parties into a single party (or, if this was not possible, to find a power- sharing arrangement between the two parties). The goal of uniting the right was accomplished in December 2003 with the formation of the Conservative Party of Canada. 1987‚Äì1993: Fragmentation on the political right The Reform Party came into being in 1987, due in part to opposition to Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservative government that ruled Canada from 1984 to 1993. A significant number of Western Canadians had strongly disliked what they perceived as the Mulroney government's pro-Quebec approach and rampant use of patronage. They also viewed the Meech Lake Accord and Charlottetown Accord as not in the West's best interests. Other Western conservatives felt that Mulroney's government was not sufficiently neo-liberal in its fiscal taxation and federal spending policies while some social conservatives were critical of the government's failed attempts to regulate and reduce abortion in Canada. In the 1993 election the upstart Reform Party won 52 seats in the west, and the once-powerful PCs led by newly minted Prime Minister Kim Campbell were reduced to only two seats in Parliament. Both parties were, however, almost completely shut out of Ontario and Quebec in this election, and also in the elections of 1997 and 2000. The two central Canadian provinces together represented over half the seats in the House of Commons; in the 1993, 1997 and 2000 elections, the total number of central Canadian seats held, collectively, by the Reform Party/Canadian Alliance and the PCs never rose above six, out of a total of over 170 available seats. With two right-wing parties competing for power, it became apparent that unseating the governing Liberals would be next to impossible. In the 1997 election, both the PCs and the Reform Party respectively polled roughly 19% each in popular support. Reform emerged with 60 Western seats and Official Opposition status, while the demoralized PCs emerged from the brink of oblivion with 20 Eastern seats and regained party status (a minimum of 12 seats is required for official party status in the House of Commons of Canada, allowing the party to have seats on parliamentary committees, guaranteed speaking time in the Commons, additional office space in the east and west blocks of Parliament, and multimillion-dollar federal funding for party research and staffing). More importantly, the Liberals emerged with only a five-seat majority in the election, and many pundits suggested that the combined PC and Reform votes would have been enough to unseat the Liberals or at least reduce them to minority status. The Liberals under Jean Chr√©tien had governed Canada since 1993, and were never really threatened by the divided right during the Chr√©tien era. Especially important in the Liberals' electoral success was the province of Ontario. From 1993 to 2004, the Liberals utterly dominated Canada's most populous province. Both Reform and the PC Party received many votes, but because of the first past the post (FPTP) system, this was not enough to win more than a handful of Ontario's approximately 103 seats. At the same time, the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, who some suggested were kindred spirits in policy and direction to Reform and Blue Tory PCs, had formed a provincial government under Premier Mike Harris. Barriers to a merger There were many barriers to a merger. Polls had found that two-thirds of traditional PC voters would vote for the Liberals before endorsing a united Canadian Alliance/PC party. Some Westerners also had deep concerns that the new party would be dominated by Central Canada, much as they thought the Progressive Conservatives had been. Leadership and MPs from both sides of the division also opposed a merger out of concerns that both parties were distinct political entities and not part of a larger conservative movement. 1995‚Äì1996: Early efforts to unite the right During the 1995 Quebec referendum, Reform leader Preston Manning implored the two sitting PC MPs, Elsie Wayne and Jean Charest, to sit in Parliament with the Reform Party caucus. The combined weight of 52 Reform MPs and two PC MPs would have allowed a unified caucus to replace the 53-member separatist Bloc Qu√©b√©cois caucus as Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition. Charest, however, refused to merge and instead focused his efforts on rebuilding the shattered PC Party. In 1996, David Frum and Ezra Levant organized the \\"Winds of Change\\" conference in Calgary, an early attempt to encourage the Reform Party of Canada and Progressive Conservative Party of Canada to merge so that a united rightwing party could defeat the Liberal Party of Canada in the subsequent election. Manning and Charest were both invited to attend but declined.Canadian Press, \\"Reform, Tories should merge, right-wing group says\\", Globe and Mail, May 15, 1996 1997‚Äì2000: The United Alternative / Canadian Alliance left After the second Liberal win in 1997, it became increasingly obvious that having two right-of-centre parties was splitting the vote and ensuring further Liberal majorities. Reform leader Manning was criticized by some members in his own party and by Western media for not \\"broadening the popular base of Reform.\\" Manning had originally suggested that the Reform Party was meant to be a new party, a third way as a populist alternative that could replace the complacent Liberals and PCs as a new national movement, but this hope was clearly not materializing beyond the Manitoba-Ontario border. There was some hope for cooperation from the PCs when Charest stepped down as leader in 1998. Several credible political figures, including Manitoba Progressive Conservative cabinet minister Brian Pallister, Major-General Lewis MacKenzie, former Reform MP Stephen Harper, and the former Alberta treasurer Jim Dinning were all encouraged to run as Unite the Right candidates by both sides of the conservative divide in the 1998 Progressive Conservative leadership convention. But the two candidates on the final ballot, Prairie anti- free- trade activist David Orchard and former Prime Minister Joe Clark, were both opposed to a merger. Clark was re-elected leader of the PC Party and insisted that the only way to unite the right would be for Reformers to join the PCs under the \\"big tent\\" of the Progressive Conservatives Party. Reformers were convinced that a union would have to involve the creation of a new party, as opposed to one party being enveloped by the other. Therefore, the Reform Party launched a number of efforts to convince like-minded PCs to join with them in creating a new united right-of-centre movement for Canada regardless of the agenda of the PC leadership. A secondary goal of the movement was to at least have the current parties agree not to run two right-of-centre candidates in the same ridings in the next federal election. A series of informal conferences and mini-conventions were staged under the auspices of Manning and the Reform Party on the benefits of a \\"United Alternative.\\" While the United Alternative movement was focused on creating a broader coalition for conservative voters, it had to compete with social conservatives who wanted the Reform Party to shift further to the right, as opposed to the moderate centre and Red Toryism. These members believed that the Reform Party could become a political opposite to the New Democratic Party by only running candidates in the West. In times of minority, the NDP has influenced left- leaning tendencies in the Liberal Party's social policies. Many Reformers argued that the Reform Party could influence the Progressive Conservative Party's social policies in a similar manner by forcing the PCs to adopt more right-wing solutions in order to obtain support from Western Reform MPs in future minority PC governments. In 1998, under the auspices of 1993 Reform Party candidate and ardent social conservative Craig Chandler, a controversial \\"Unite the Right\\" conference was held in Toronto, Ontario. The conference attracted a great deal of negative media attention for not just including MPs and delegates from the Reform and Progressive Conservative parties, but also leadership officials from the right-wing social conservative Christian Heritage Party, Social Credit Party, the Confederation of Regions Party, Family Coalition Party of Ontario and delegates from the Freedom Party of Ontario. After this conference, polls were conducted that suggested that many Progressive Conservative supporters would rather vote Liberal than vote for a new merged Reform/PC political entity. The efforts to create a United Alternative did not sit well with the leadership of the Progressive Conservatives. The PC Party eventually passed an amendment to the party's constitution stating that the party had to run a candidate in every federal riding in the next election. Having been rebuffed by PC leader Joe Clark, Manning urged the Reform Party membership to \\"Think Big\\" and eventually a real \\"United Right\\" effort was launched. In early 2000, the Reform Party held two national conventions in Ottawa that culminated in its demise and the creation of the \\"Canadian Conservative Reform Alliance\\", or CCRA. However, a number of pundits pointed out that if the word \\"party\\" was added on to the end of the name, the acronym would actually be CCRAP. Consequentially, the name was changed to the \\"Canadian Reform Conservative Alliance\\", more commonly known as the Canadian Alliance. Not all Reformers were in favour of the creation of a new right-wing political party. Some Reformers were actually populists who did not necessarily aspire to right-wing solutions for government in Canada. Led by Reform MPs Darrel Stinson and Myron Thompson, a protest movement was launched known as \\"Grassroots United Against Reform's Demise\\" or GUARD. The movement sent letters and e-mails to party members and officials urging them to not vote in favour of a new party. Ultimately, Manning's bid to create a new party was successful, although the personal consequences for his initiative would be high. The Canadian Alliance leadership race was expected to be a pro forma contest in which Manning's leadership would be easily reconfirmed. However, the race quickly became a contest. Many CA members felt that a new party needed a new leader. Eventually Manning's bid for the CA leadership was defeated by Alberta Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) and Provincial Treasurer Stockwell Day. While the party was seen by some as a happy union of former Reformers and Blue Tory PCs who were disaffected with Joe Clark's Red Tory leadership, the Canadian Alliance was still seen by many as merely the Reform Party in new clothes. Furthermore, many Reformers became disaffected with the CA due to Manning's ouster as the movement's leader. 2000‚Äì2002: Fragmentation of the Canadian Alliance  After a below- expectations result in the 2000 election and the failure of the CA to reduce Joe Clark's PCs to independent status, a year of factional in-fighting began in 2001 over Stockwell Day's troubled leadership of the Canadian Alliance. Several controversies surrounding Day's personality, statements, and actions led to a number of disaffected CA officials and MPs, including party stalwarts Deborah Grey and Chuck Strahl, to formally break with the Alliance caucus. Thirteen MPs left the Canadian Alliance during this period of instability. The thirteen MPs sat as the Democratic Representative Caucus (DRC) and eventually decided to affiliate themselves with the PCs, sitting as one group in the House of Commons and holding joint meetings. The DRC also launched its own website and began setting up \\"Democratic Reform Party\\" constituency associations in anticipation of a snap election. After the near collapse of the Canadian Alliance and the rise in defections to the DRC, it appeared that the right in Canada would remain fractious and fragmented into the foreseeable future. From September 2001 to May 2002, three separate elected right-wing political entities existed in the House of Commons (the PCs, the CA and the DRC). Many journalists and media analysts were convinced that the Right would totally melt down in a future election with so many conflicting factions competing for the same voter base. When asked by reporters in January 2002 about the troubles on the right, Liberal Heritage Minister Sheila Copps aptly conveyed the glee of the governing Liberals at the fractiousness in the conservative movement when she quipped, \\"burn, baby, burn!\\" Many political pundits were convinced that with no credible national alternative, the Liberals would easily cruise to a fourth straight majority victory in a future 2004 election. The almost constant turmoil and change in leadership of the Official Opposition between 2000 and 2002 led to a fair perception that the Chr√©tien government was getting a free ride from a hived opposition. 2002: New leadership In April 2002, Stockwell Day was replaced as leader of the Canadian Alliance by Stephen Harper, one of the original \\"Class of '88\\" founders of the Reform Party. Unlike Day, Harper proved to be an able leader and managed to repair most of the damage that his predecessor's leadership had caused. With Harper at the helm, all but two DRC MPs who had left the party's caucus returned to the Canadian Alliance. With Day no longer running the Canadian Alliance, a merger was also much more agreeable to many stalwart Tory members. PC Party Leader Joe Clark, who had spurned off many attempts to unite the right during his leadership, announced his impending retirement as PC Party Leader in August 2002 after the PC-DRC Coalition Caucus dissolved. A leadership election was scheduled for May 2003. On May 31, 2003, Peter MacKay of Nova Scotia won the PC leadership election. Unlike Clark, MacKay supported open discussions on the concepts of a united party, but promised that, on his watch, no full-fledged union would take place. Shortly after becoming leader, MacKay signalled his openness to broad \\"talks\\" with the Canadian Alliance with regard to creating more unity on the right. 2003: Merger negotiations Over the summer and autumn of 2003, a series of protracted negotiations took place between PC and CA \\"emissaries\\": Bill Davis, Don Mazankowski and Loyola Hearn for the PCs and Gerry St. Germain, Ray Speaker and Scott Reid for the CA. The identities of the emissaries was public knowledge, but the participation of Belinda Stronach (daughter of auto-parts magnate Frank Stronach) as chair and moderator for the discussions was not publicly known until later. The negotiations were largely motivated by the juggernaut takeover of the Liberal Party by the extremely popular and successful former Liberal finance minister Paul Martin, and the marked reduction in membership and political donations for both parties due to voter frustration with the status quo Liberal hegemony. Polls showed both the beleaguered PC and Alliance parties losing a large number of seats in the next election to a Martin-led Liberal team across Canada if an amenable solution was not found. 2003‚Äì2004: Creation of the Conservative Party of Canada The goal of a united right was realized in the Autumn of 2003. The summer negotiations eventually produced the Conservative Party Agreement-in-Principle between the PCs and the CA on the establishment of a new Conservative Party of Canada. On October 16, 2003, Alliance leader Stephen Harper and Progressive Conservative leader Peter MacKay announced the formation of the new united conservative party. Both leaders insisted that the union was not about egos, and was really about making an enormous contribution to protecting tangible democratic freedoms and political choice in Canada. Harper was widely quoted by many media officials during the press conference when he stated, \\"Our swords will henceforth be pointed at the Liberals, not at each other.\\" The main sticking point during the autumn negotiations had been the method of choosing the merged party's leader. The PCs pushed for an equal number of votes for each riding that would benefit their lower but much more nationally representative membership (65,000); the Alliance hoped for a one- member one vote system that would benefit their much larger, but centralized Western membership (120,000). Harper conceded the issue. In early December, 95.9% of the CA membership approved the union, and 90.4% of the PC Party delegates also endorsed the initiative in a national convention. The party was officially formed on December 7, 2003. Harper was elected leader of the fledgeling Conservative Party of Canada on March 20, 2004, by the new party's 350,000 members spread out across 301 equally weighted federal ridings. Peter MacKay was appointed deputy leader. Aftermath Months later, Liberal Prime Minister Paul Martin called for a general election. However, in the interim between the formation of the new party and the selection of its new leader, investigations into the Canadian Sponsorship scandal and the investigation by the Gomery Commission had knocked some wind out of the Liberal Party's political sails, resulting in the election being backed up to late June as opposed to early April. This allowed the Conservatives to be more prepared for the race, unlike the 2000 snap election. For the first time since the 1984 election, the Liberal Party would have to deal with a united conservative opposition. Polls indicated an increase in support for the new Conservative Party and by all pollster indications by mid-campaign, it seemed as if Harper was on the verge of becoming Prime Minister of a minority government. But even at their highest level of support the Conservatives were still some percentage points off the combined total of the two separate right-wing parties that had run in the last election. A number of prominent ex-PCs also chose to support the Liberals. These included MPs Scott Brison, Keith Martin, and John Herron, who crossed the floor to the Liberals. Lukewarm endorsements of Liberal Party candidates at the onset of the campaign were extended by former PC MPs Joe Clark, Brian Mulroney, Andr√© Bachand, Rick Borotsik, and former federal PC Party president Bruck Easton. Harper's new Conservatives emerged from the election with a larger parliamentary caucus of 99 MPs. Chuck Cadman, a former CA MP who failed to win the Conservative Party nomination in his riding, was re-elected as an independent. The Liberals were reduced to a thin minority government, relegating the governing party to obtaining support from at least two of the three opposition parties to pass legislation. In the 2006 Canadian federal election, after a decade of work, the Conservatives seemed to attain their goal of being an electable \\"United Alternative\\" when they were given a minority government by the electorate. In the 2011 federal election, the Conservatives under Harper won a majority government, the first majority for a main right-of-center party since the defeat of the Campbell PC Party in 1993. Provincial 'Unite the Right' The term 'Unite the Right' has been used to describe the union of centre-right parties in provinces with a strong New Democratic Party (NDP). United in one right-leaning party, individuals who would vote either Liberal or Conservative federally have joined at different occasions to stop the left-leaning NDP. Examples of this are the Liberal Party of British Columbia and the Saskatchewan Party. Historically, the British Columbia Social Credit Party was British Columbia's right-leaning coalition party between 1952 and 1991. In 2004, the British Columbia Unity Party and British Columbia Conservative Party entered into unsuccessful merger negotiations. In Alberta, the Alberta Party Political Association, known in its short form as the Alberta Party, began as an alliance of the Social Credit Party of Alberta, Western Canada Concept, and the Heritage Party of Alberta in 1986. In 2006 the Alberta Alliance entered into merger negotiations with the Alberta Party and the Social Credit Party. The Social Credit Party terminated merger discussions, the Alberta Alliance merged with the Wildrose Party of Alberta to create the Wildrose Alliance, and the Alberta Party has shifted to become a centrist party. In 2017, the renamed Wildrose Party and the Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta merged to form the United Conservative Party. In the 1970s, the Social Credit Party of Saskatchewan merged into the Progressive Conservative Party of Saskatchewan. Eventually members of the Saskatchewan Liberal Party and the Progressive Conservatives united to create the Saskatchewan Party. From 1936 to 1970 the Union Nationale in Quebec was a coalition party of right-wing Liberals and Conservatives.

She was laid down by John I. Thornycroft and Company, and commissioned into the Royal Navy in 1952. Initially assigned to the Home Fleet, Duchess spent her early career on exercises and port visits. She was involved in celebrations for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II during 1953, and escorted the royal yacht in 1954. The destroyer was reassigned to the Mediterranean Fleet in late 1954, and was involved in exercises, port visits, and anti-weapons-smuggling patrols of Cyprus. During the 1956 Suez Crisis, Duchess operated as plane guard and escort to the British carrier force, and was the last ship to leave Port Said after the British-French invasion failed. The destroyer was reassigned to the Home Fleet in early 1957, then was sent back to the Mediterranean as leader of the 5th Destroyer Squadron later that year. A modernisation refit ran from late 1958 to the start of 1961, after which, Duchess resumed operations with the Mediterranean Fleet. In 1963, tensions leading to the Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia confrontation resulted in Duchess being assigned to the Far East Fleet as part of a strengthening of British assets in South East Asia. Following the 1964 Melbourne-Voyager collision, Duchess was loaned to the RAN as a temporary replacement for . The ship was deployed to the Far East Strategic Reserve throughout the 1960s, and operated as an escort for the Vietnam War troopship on several occasions. The original four-year loan was extended to 1972, at which point the ship was purchased outright by the Australian government. Duchess was converted into a training ship during 1973 and 1974, and spent the rest of her career operating on midshipman training cruises in Australian, New Zealand, and South Pacific waters. Duchess was replaced in the training role in 1977, and was decommissioned. The destroyer was sold for scrap in 1980. Design and construction The Daring class was an evolution of the Battle-class destroyer; larger and with a heavier armament built around three twin turrets.McCart, Daring Class Destroyers, pp. ix‚Äìx Sixteen Darings were provisionally ordered on 20 July 1944, as part of the 1944 wartime construction programme.McCart, Daring Class Destroyers, p. 219 Duchess was the last of eight to have her order confirmed, on 29 March 1945, the other eight were later cancelled as unnecessary due to the end of World War II.McCart, Daring Class Destroyers, pp. ix, 219 Their size and capability made the ships capable of performing duties previously restricted to light cruisers, and as the destroyer classification was initially considered inappropriate, they were referred to as \\"Daring-class warships\\" for the first part of their careers.McCart, Daring Class Destroyers, p. x As designed, the Daring-class ships had a standard displacement of 2,950 tons, with a full load displacement of 3,580 tons. Length was overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a maximum draught of . Propulsion machinery consisted of two oil-fuelled boilers (for Duchess, these were supplied by Forster Wheeler), connected to Parsons double reduction geared turbines from English Electric, which supplied to the ship's two propeller shafts. Top speed was , with an effective range of , while a cruising speed of allowed the ship to cover . Duchess, along with three of her sister ships, were fitted with alternating current internal electrics; a break from Royal Navy practice. The intended ship's company for Duchess was 278. The main armament of a Daring-class destroyer consisted of six QF 4.5-inch Mk I ‚Äì V naval guns, arranged in three twin turrets, two located forward, the third aft.McCart, Daring Class Destroyers, p. ix For anti-aircraft warfare, the ships were fitted with four to six 40 mm Bofors guns: a reduction from the wartime-intended eight.McCart, Daring Class Destroyers, pp. 219‚Äì20 Both main and anti-aircraft guns were radar-controlled. Two 5-tube launchers for 21 inch (533 mm) torpedoes were installed, along with a Squid anti-submarine mortar. Duchess was laid down by John I. Thornycroft and Company of Woolston at Southampton on 8 July 1948.Cassells, The Destroyers, p. 34 Construction of the Daring class was a transition away from riveting as a method of hull fabrication: some ships had a mix of riveting and welding, while Duchesss hull was all-welded.McCart, Daring Class Destroyers, p. 220 She was launched on 9 April 1951 by the Countess Mountbatten of Burma, and commissioned into the Royal Navy on 23 October 1952.Cassells, The Destroyers, p. 35 Operational history=Royal Navy1953‚Äì1956= Duchess was initially assigned to the British Home Fleet in January 1953.McCart, Daring Class Destroyers, p. 52 During January, the ship was involved in training exercises with other Home Fleet units. On 26 January, while alongside in Portland Harbour, a furnace explosion and oil fire in A boiler room killed a stoker and severely burned three others. Although able to sail that afternoon, it took a further ten days of dockyard work to repair the damage. During February and March, Duchess and other ships of the Home Fleet sailed to Gibraltar for exercises. Most of April was taken up with self- maintenance, and May was spent on further training. At the end of May, Duchess, , and sailed to London, where they participated in the opening celebrations of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. After a brief visit to the Isle of Wight, Duchess sailed to Spithead for the Coronation Fleet Review, which occurred on 15 June. After the review, Duchess, Swiftsure, and visited east coast ports before sailing to Invergordon for fleet exercises.McCart, Daring Class Destroyers, p. 53 During the exercises, Duchess was plane guard for the carrier . Duchess returned to Portsmouth in July, underwent six weeks of maintenance, then sailed on 1 September to rejoin Eagle and other ships for exercises in the Denmark Strait. The exercise ended on 3 October, and after transporting personnel of 812 Naval Air Squadron to Loch Goyle, Duchess joined Eagle while the latter undertook flying training. On 6 October, a helicopter crashed while attempting to deliver mail to the destroyer: Duchess seaboat was able to rescue one of the two flight crew, while the other sank with the helicopter. Duchess continued to accompany Eagle until 24 October, when she detached to return to Portsmouth. The rest of 1953, along with most of January 1954, was spent in refit. On 5 February, Duchess joined units of the Home Fleet on the Spring Training Cruise. The cruise included multi-national exercises in the Mediterranean, a port visit to Oran, and a joint Home- Mediterranean Fleets exercise. Duchess returned to Portsmouth on 23 March. On 29 April, the destroyer departed for Gibraltar to meet the royal yacht Britannia, which was carrying Queen Elizabeth II on the final legs of her Commonwealth Tour. Duchess was part of the escort force until Britannia reached the Thames Estuary on 13 May.McCart, Daring Class Destroyers, p. 54 The destroyer then proceeded to Invergordon for Home Fleet exercises. On 19 June, Duchess and sister ship were detached for a three-week flag-showing cruise around the Baltic Sea. Port visits were made to Oslo, Copenhagen, and Stockholm before Duchess returned to Portsmouth. On 31 August, the ship was paid off and recommissioned. She was reassigned to the Mediterranean Fleet, and sailed on 10 September for Malta. On 15 October, Duchess was part of a demonstration of naval power for the Emperor of Ethiopia. The rest of the year was spent on exercises, including NATO exercise Novex 54, along with port visits to Elba with the cruiser in November.McCart, Daring Class Destroyers, p. 55 In early January 1955, Jamaica and Duchess made a formal visit to Algiers, which was then followed by more exercises. On 24 March, while moored at Naples, Duchess was rammed by the United States merchant ship SS Excambion. Damage to the destroyer included punctured hull plating on the starboard bow, impact damage to the starboard stern plates where the collision forced them into the wharf, and damage to the superstructure. Temporary repairs were effected, and the destroyer was able to sail to the Malta Dockyard on 30 March. Repairs took most of April, and it was not until 22 May that the ship was deployed again, on a cruise to the eastern Mediterranean.McCart, Daring Class Destroyers, p. 56 Duchess visited Istanbul, Alexandria, and Cyprus before returning to Malta's Grand Harbour on 22 June. Two days later, with her Mediterranean deployment at an end, Duchess departed for Portsmouth via Gibraltar. On her 1 July arrival, the destroyer was docked for maintenance. Resuming operations on 28 September, Duchess sailed to Scottish waters for exercises: first anti-submarine and torpedo firing training off Clyde, then plane guard duties near Rosyth while Eagles aircraft practiced high-altitude intercepts. After a visit to Hamburg, the destroyer returned to Portland. Exercises and port visits continued into 1956, and on 21 February, Duchess paid off and recommissioned at Portsmouth Dockyard. On 3 March, the destroyer sailed to rejoin the Mediterranean Fleet.McCart, Daring Class Destroyers, p. 57 After a series of working up exercises, Duchess participated in the 60-ship Exercise Medflex Dragon in April. During the exercise, the naval correspondent for The Daily Telegraph was convinced by the officers to place a small article in the paper jokingly asking for \\"any spare coronets\\" to decorate the wardroom with. In response, Anne, Duchess of Westminster, arranged to have her coronet supplied to the destroyer. Medflex Dragon concluded on 20 April, and Duchess underwent six weeks of maintenance. Port visits to Istanbul and Golcuck followed, along with a stint patrolling the Cyprus coastline to intercept Greek weapons smugglers.McCart, Daring Class Destroyers, p. 58 She returned to Malta in mid-July, and was in Grand Harbour when the Suez Canal was claimed and nationalised by Egypt. =Suez Crisis= The Mediterranean Fleet began gearing up to retaliate, with Duchess undertaking shore bombardment and convoy escort training during August and September, and also serving as plane guard to Eagle as the carrier worked up. On 29 October, Duchess left Malta to join the escort of the carriers Eagle, , and . The carrier force arrived off the Egyptioan coast on 31 October, and on 1 November, airstrikes commenced. During this, Duchess was plane guard for Eagle. On 6 November, the joint British- French invasion commenced, with the destroyer escorting one of the landing craft groups into shore, then standing by off Port Said for anti-air and anti- submarine defence. During 7 and 8 November, Duchess performed patrols off Port Said and was rotated through the plane guard stations of all three carriers. On 9 November, Duchess departed for Malta. She returned to Port Said on 17 November, and was again attached to the carrier force as an escort and plane guard. From 27 November to 16 December, the destroyer was sent to Cyprus for more anti-smuggler patrols, but the ship was recalled to cover the final withdrawal of British forces from Port Said. She remained in or near Port Said Harbour until 22 December: although due to sail that morning with the last troop convoy, Duchess remained on station until 20:00 in the unsuccessful hope that a junior officer of the West Yorkshire Regiment kidnapped early in the crisis would be returned. Consequently, Duchess was the last Royal Navy vessel to leave Port Said at the end of the Suez Crisis.McCart, Daring Class Destroyers, p. 59 =1957‚Äì1964= After spending Christmas at Grand Harbour, Duchess sailed from Malta on 1 January 1957 with sister ships and , bound for Portsmouth. After a three-month maintenance docking, Duchess was assigned to the Home Fleet. On 17 May, Duchess and Diamond sailed to meet the Royal Yacht Britannia at the River Humber. Britannia was conveying Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh to Denmark for a state visit. The two destroyers accompanied the royal yacht to Copenhagen, then back to the Moray Firth at the visit's conclusion. On 28 May, the destroyers rejoined the Home Fleet for a fleet review. The destroyers were then assigned to escort the carrier , with the three ships departing on 30 May for the International Naval Review at Hampton Roads in the United States. The review occurred on 12 June, after which Duchess sailed to Bermuda, then back to the United Kingdom.McCart, Daring Class Destroyers, p. 60 On her return, the ship visited Liverpool for the 750th anniversary of King John's Charter founding the city, then proceeded to Portsmouth. On 27 August, Duchess paid off and was recommissioned.McCart, Daring Class Destroyers, pp. 60‚Äì1 On 3 September, Duchess left Portsmouth to join the Mediterranean Fleet as leader of the 5th Destroyer Squadron.McCart, Daring Class Destroyers, p. 61 Workups were conducted at Silema Creek during September, followed by port visits to Tripoli and Civitavecchia in October, then self-maintenance and day sails from Malta for the rest of the year. 1958 commenced with a seven-week Cyprus patrol. By the end of the patrol on 21 February, the destroyer had developed a leak in her hull, but was able to reach Malta without difficulty. March consisted of participation in Exercise Marjex, followed by port visits to Taranto and Ancona, joint exercises with the Italian Navy, and a visit to Venice before returning to Malta. Major fleet exercises occurred in April and early May. Duchess was due to return to the United Kingdom in May, but unrest in Lebanon (which would escalate into the 1958 Lebanon crisis) required the destroyer to join a response force off Cyprus, which she remained with until 4 July. The destroyer sailed to Malta, then Portsmouth, and was docked for maintenance after arriving on 11 July. Work concluded in September, and Duchess spent the next three months undertaking exercises and port visits in British, Dutch, and French waters. The destroyer reached Spithead on 9 December, and was paid off into reserve later that day. The destroyer was taken into Portsmouth Dockyard hands for a two-year refit. Modifications during this period included the deletion of the aft torpedo launcher and its replacement with a deckhouse for additional accommodation, introduction of centralised messing arrangements, and fitting of air-conditioning to the operations room and sickbay.McCart, Daring Class Destroyers, pp. 61‚Äì2 Intentions at the time were to install a Sea Cat missile launcher on the roof of the new deckhouse during a later refit, but in 1964, the decision was made to fit the launcher to new-build ships only.McCart, Daring Class Destroyers, p. 221 Duchess was recommissioned on 3 January 1961, with post-refit workups and maintenance dominating the ship's activities until early April.McCart, Daring Class Destroyers, p. 62 From April until July, she was involved in a program of anti-submarine warfare training and general exercises, interspersed with short maintenance periods. On 24 July, Duchess sailed from Portsmouth, bound for Malta and the Mediterranean Fleet. On 7 August, while en route, a port visit to Ajaccio was almost cancelled when a possible mutiny aboard a British merchant ship was reported: the destroyer was to sail to assist, but was not required. Duchess reached Grand Harbour on 18 August, and was drydocked for maintenance. Returning to service in September, the rest of Duchess year was dominated by exercises and flag-showing port visits.McCart, Daring Class Destroyers, pp. 62‚Äì3 Exercises and port visits resumed in January 1962, and continued until 26 March, when the destroyer left Malta heading for Portsmouth.McCart, Daring Class Destroyers, p. 63 In addition to the schedule of Home Fleet exercises, Duchess made official visits to Stockholm and Helsinki with in May, underwent refit from July to October, as in November was part of the search for the helicopter that crashed off St David's Head carrying Lord Windlesham. On 17 December, the ship's fifth commission was paid off. Duchess was recommissioned on 2 January 1963. Originally intended to be deployed with the Mediterranean Fleet, the December 1962 Brunei Revolt and tensions in South East Asia that would shortly escalate into the Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia confrontation prompted a strengthening of British assets in the region, including the assignment of Duchess to the Far East Fleet.McCart, Daring Class Destroyers, pp. 63‚Äì4 The destroyer left Portsmouth on 8 April bound for Singapore, with visits en route to Gibraltar, Malta, Port Said, and Aden.McCart, Daring Class Destroyers, pp. 64‚Äì5 Arriving on 12 June, the ship spent the next few weeks on day exercises, before being docked in the King George VI Graving Dock for three weeks of maintenance.McCart, Daring Class Destroyers, p. 65 Tactical exercises took up late July and early August, after which, Duchess was deployed to patrol off North Borneo and Sarawak. A visit to Hong Kong occurred in early September, followed by guardship duties off Sandakan. Further patrols of North Borneo occurred in October, and on 7 November, the destroyer was called to assist the British merchantman Woodburn, which had run aground off Singapore's Horsburgh Lighthouse. Exercises continued until 23 December, when Duchess arrived at Singapore for maintenance and leave.McCart, Daring Class Destroyers, p. 66 She resumed operations on 10 February 1964, transporting a contingent of Gurkhas to the Sarawak River, then visited Hong Kong. Transfer Following the loss of the Australian-built Daring-class destroyer in a collision with the aircraft carrier on 10 February 1964, both the United Kingdom and the United States offered to loan ships to the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) as a temporary replacement; the Royal Navy offering Duchess or while the United States Navy offered two destroyers: US Ships and . The Admiralty suggested Defender because she had just completed a major modernisation, and Duchess because her location in South East Asia meant she could be handed over quickly. Duchess was seen as the more favourable vessel for the British offer: in addition to the proximity, the ship was due to undergo refit in June, and doing so while in Australian hands meant the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) could make any modifications they felt necessary. Unlike Duchess, Defenders internal electrics were configured for DC power, and the ship lacked air-conditioning.Royal Australian Navy, HMAS Duchess The loan of Duchess to the RAN was offered on 18 February, and accepted on 25 February by the Australian government. The loan period was for four years, with no cost for the ship itself, although the RAN would be financially responsible for running costs and modifications. During the loan period, the RAN intended to construct two modified frigates ( and ) as permanent replacements.Frame, A Cruel Legacy, pp. 21‚Äì22 Duchess concluded her exercise program on 9 March, and returned to Singapore for maintenance. She left Singapore for Australia on 6 April, visiting Darwin and Townsville before reaching Sydney on 19 April. The ship was handed over to the RAN that day. The destroyer was then sailed to Williamstown Naval Dockyard for modification. On 8 May, the handover was completed, and the ship was commissioned into the RAN as HMAS Duchess.McCart, Daring Class Destroyers, p. 211 Refits were completed in November, and the destroyer spent the rest of the year undertaking trials and working up exercises. Royal Australian Navy From January to March 1965, Duchess was deployed to the Far East, and undertook numerous patrols of the Malaysian and Borneo coasts. In late May, Duchess was assigned to the escort screen for the troopship as she made her first of twenty-five Vietnam War troop transport runs to V≈©ng T√†u. Duchess escorted the former carrier for the entire voyage, with the two ships returning to Sydney on 5 July.Nott & Payne, The Vung Tau Ferry, p. 169 After a maintenance period, Duchess was deployed to the Far East Strategic Reserve (FESR) on 11 August. After a short period of patrols, the destroyer and were detached to meet Sydney off Manus Island on 20 December, and joined the troopship on her second voyage to Vietnam.Nott & Payne, The Vung Tau Ferry, p. 170Grey, Up Top, p. 106 The three ships reached V≈©ng T√†u on 28 September, and departed two days later: after clearing the Market Time area, the two destroyers broke off and headed for Hong Kong. A brief period of maintenance concluded on 26 October, and Duchess resumed patrols until the end of the year. 1966 commenced with more Borneo patrols and a stint at guardship at Tawau. The destroyer returned to Darwin on 2 March, then sailed to Sydney for a seven-month refit. The rest of the year was spent exercising in eastern Australian waters. In January 1967, the destroyer was again deployed to the FESR. As the Confrontation had concluded, the deployment was characterised by fewer patrols and more exercises and port visits. During the six-month assignment, Duchess called into Telok Kekek, Pulau Langkawi, Pulau Song Song, Bangkok, Hong Kong, and Singapore. She returned to Sydney on 17 June and docked for refits. On 12 October, the four-year loan of the ship was extended to April 1972. The refit concluded on 3 June 1968, and the destroyer was assigned to multinational exercises; first with the Royal New Zealand Navy off Auckland, then with British, New Zealand, and American units in the Solomon Sea. Duchess was then deployed to the FESR, and arrived in Singapore on 10 October. A program of port visits was interrupted in November by the need to escort Sydney on her twelfth Vietnam voyage.Nott & Payne, The Vung Tau Ferry, p. 174 On 18 November, Duchess met Sydney off Singapore, and accompanied the troopship to and from the warzone, before sailing to Hong Kong. Official visits to ports in South Korea and Japan followed, with Duchess back in Hong Kong for the Christmas-New Year break. January and February 1969 saw the destroyer travel as far east as Pakistan. The destroyer returned to Singapore on 25 March, via Thailand and Hong Kong, then after a short exercise period, the destroyer headed for Sydney. Maintenance and local exercises dominated the ship's schedule until November, when she headed north to escort Sydney on the latter's fifteenth voyage.Nott & Payne, The Vung Tau Ferry, p. 175 After reaching V≈©ng T√†u on 28 November, then escorting the troopship from the warzone, Duchess peeled off to commence another FESR deployment. After a short maintenance period in Singapore, the destroyer visited Subic Bay, then headed to Hong Kong for the end of the year. After participating in a week of fleet exercises in mid-January 1970, Duchess began a sequence of port visits: Port Swettenham, Kota Kinabalu, Manila, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Osaka (coinciding with Expo '70), Kobe, and Subic Bay before returning to Singapore. This was followed by SEATO exercises in the South China Sea during March and April. Duchess returned to Sydney on 5 June, and was docked for a refit, which lasted until 8 February 1971. On 18 March, Duchess was again deployed to the Far East. The destroyer met Sydney off Singapore on the troopship's nineteenth on 3 April.Grey, Up Top, p. 108Nott & Payne, The Vung Tau Ferry, p. 176 The two ships arrived in V≈©ng T√†u on 5 April, and returned to Hong Kong on 8 April.Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, p. 306 After a sequence of port visits, Duchess and met Sydney on 17 May for transportation run twenty. V≈©ng T√†u was reached on 22 May, with departure a day later.Nott & Payne, The Vung Tau Ferry, pp. 176‚Äì7 Duchess sailed to Hong Kong, then on 8 June departed for Australia, arriving on 25 May and commencing a mid-cycle docking which ran until 13 November. In January 1972, Duchess joined , , and for a task group deployment to Asian waters. The deployment included SEATO exercises and port visits to Port Klang and Surabaya, before the ships arrived in Fremantle on 14 April. After proceeding to Sydney for maintenance, Duchess resumed exercising in local waters. During a surface firing exercise on 25 July, a shell from B turret hit one of the elevated barrels of A turret. In August, with her loan period up, Duchess was purchased outright from the Royal Navy for GB¬£150,000. After a midshipman training cruise to Port Moresby in August, the ship spent the rest of the year on exercises and training. On 5 January 1973, Duchess arrived at Williamstown Naval Dockyard for conversion into a training ship. The aft funnel was streamlined, and the remaining torpedo launcher, aft gun turret, and Squid mortar were all removed.Cassells, The Destroyers, pgs 34‚Äì5, 238 This allowed for the installation of an extended aft superstructure, with classrooms, instructor offices, and additional accommodation for the embarked trainees. The former turret's loading bay was converted into library and study areas. A semi-enclosed charthouse was fitted above and behind the bridge for navigation training. The refit concluded on 14 August 1974, with Duchess replacing as the RAN's dedicated training vessel. From January 1975 to July 1976, Duchess operated on a sequence of training cruises, visiting ports along the eastern Australian coast, as well as New Zealand and the South Pacific. She was docked from July to October at Cockatoo Island Dockyard to combat hull corrosion, then resumed her training schedule. Her final training cruise ran during August and September 1977, after which, Duchess was replaced by . Decommissioning and fate Handover of training duties to Jervis Bay was done on 23 September 1977. On 23 October, Duchess was decommissioned. The ship was sold to Tung Ho Steel for breaking up as scrap on 7 May 1980, and departed Sydney under tow for Taiwan on 9 July. Following a 2010 reorganisation of RAN battle honours, the destroyer's involvement in the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation while in RAN service was recognised with the battle honour \\"Malaysia 1965‚Äì66\\".

The original category is as it says, it was originally bound with the idea that the book would be used in a library setting where the book would receive harder use than those usual trade editions sold to the public. The aftermarket library binding is the method of binding serials, and re- binding paperback or hardcover books, for use within libraries. Library binding increases the durability of books, as well as making the materials easier to use.  Purpose  Library binding is a way to increase the life of books and periodicals used in libraries. This is done by sewing the pages in place and by reinforcing the spine for each volume. The goal of library binding is long-term preservation. However, library bound books also benefit library patrons by ensuring that the volume in hand is complete, opened with ease, and easy to photocopy. In addition, many libraries re-bind damaged books in library bindings regardless of whether they were originally paperback or hardcover.  Methods and materials  The buckram used to cover library bound books comes in a variety of colors. Most library binders use a method of bookbinding called oversewing to secure the volumes. Oversewing involves cutting or milling off the spines of the volumes, creating a block of loose pages. Then the loose sheets are combined into small units or signatures, which are secured with overlock stitching. The separate signatures then get sewn together, creating a single book block. Often a piece of linen is glued to the book block spine for further support. The spine of the volume sometimes is rounded and backed to keep the spine from caving in. But if the paper of the volume is too fragile, or the book block is too thick, the spine is left flat. The book block is placed in a sturdy cover or case, with special paper covering the inside covers. The most common cloth used by library binders to cover the boards of the book is buckram coated with acrylic. Acrylic coatings are generally resistant to water, mold, insects, and ultra-violet light. The buckram used is a 100% cotton, bulky fabric designed to withstand wear and tear. Smaller books may be bound in c-cloth, a lighter weight cloth that may or may not have an acrylic coating. The information about the volume (such as title and call number) is hot-stamped onto the spine. Bound serials are typically all bound in the same color of buckram, in order to indicate the relationship of the volumes.  After market library binders  Library-bound volumes in wooden bookcases Library binding is done at a commercial library binding company. Sending books to the library binder is a mass production process. The library will gather and set aside their volumes which they want library bound, and then box and ship these books to a library binding company. The binding company handles each volume one at a time, and then places all the items from the shipment back into boxes and sends them back to the library. * Commercial library binding factories were first established in America and England in the early twentieth century. Since then, there have emerged several prominent library binding companies (including Dague Bookbindery, Ocker & Trapp, or Wert Bookbinders). Although they are commercial enterprises, library binders act as partners to the library world. The operations they perform on books and serials help extend the life of these materials, making them more accessible to library users. The goal should always be to do as little damage to the volume as possible. A volume should not be sent to a commercial library binder if the papers in the volume are brittle, if the volume appears to have value as an artifact, if the item can be repaired or treated in-house, or if the item needs preparatory conservation treatment. * Library binders and libraries agree on the conditions of the services provided and the prices charged, and then sign a contract confirming these. The library binder insures against the loss of volumes and corrects any mistakes (such as the wrong color buckram cloth, or the incorrect title stamped on the spine).State of Connecticut Binding Contract 1993 * The Library Binding Institute is the main source of information and standards on library binding. In conjunction with the National Information Standards Organization, the Library Binding Institute has published standards of library binding that should be used by all binding companies. These include technical specifications (for the different methods of library binding) and material specifications (for the materials used in library binding).

The SkyTrain is the second longest driverless transit system in the world. The automated guideway transit (AGT) is a fully automated, driverless, grade-separated transit system in which vehicles are automatically guided along a guideway. The vehicles are often rubber tired or steel wheeled, but other systems including air cushion and maglev systems have also been used in experiments. The guideway normally provides both physical support, like a road, as well as the guidance. In the case of fixed-route systems, the two are often the same in the same way that a rail line provides both support and guidance for a train. For systems with multiple routes, most AGT systems use smaller wheels riding on the guideway to steer the vehicle using conventional steering arrangements like those on a car. AGT covers a wide variety of systems, from limited people mover systems commonly found at airports, to more complex mass transit systems like the Vancouver SkyTrain. In the people mover role the term \\"automated people mover\\" (APM) is sometimes used, although this distinction is relatively rare because most people movers are automated. Larger systems span a variety of conceptual designs, from subway-like advanced rapid transit (ART) systems to smaller (typically two to six passengers) vehicles known as personal rapid transit (PRT) which offer direct point-to-point travel along a switched network. Origins in mass transit AGT was originally developed as a means of providing mass transit services aimed at serving rider loads higher than those that could be served by buses or trams, but smaller than those served by conventional subways. Subways were too expensive to build in areas of lower density, such as smaller cities or the suburbs of larger ones, which often suffer the same gridlock problems as larger cities. Buses could be easily introduced in these areas, but did not offer the capacities or speeds that made them an attractive alternative to car ownership. Cars drive directly from origin to destination, while buses generally work on a hub-and-spoke model that can increase increase trip times. AGT offered a solution that fit between these extremes. Much of the cost of a subway system is due to the large vehicle sizes, which demand large tunnels, large stations and considerable infrastructure throughout the system. The large vehicles are a side-effect of the need to have considerable space between the vehicles, known as \\"headway\\", for safety reasons due to the limited sightlines in tunnels. Given large headways and limited average speed due to stops, the only way to increase passenger capacity is to increase the size of the vehicle. Capital costs can be reduced by elevating the tracks instead of burying them, but the large tracks needed present a major visual barrier, and the steel-wheels-on-steel- rails are very noisy rounding bends. Headway can be reduced via automation, a technique that was becoming feasible in the 1960s. As the headway is decreased, the size of vehicle needed to transport a given number of passengers per hour also decreases, which, in turn, decreases the infrastructure needed to support these smaller vehicles. Everything from track supports to station size can be reduced, with similar reductions in capital costs. Additionally, the lighter vehicles allow for a wider variety of suspension methods, from conventional steel wheels, to rubber tires, air cushion vehicles and maglevs. Since the system has to be automated in order to reduce the headways enough to be worthwhile, by automating the steering as well the operational costs can also be reduced compared to crewed vehicles. One key problem in an automated system is the steering system's negotiation of turns in the right-of-way. The simplest solution is to use a rigid guideway, like conventional rails or steel rollercoasters. For lighter AGTs, these solutions were over-specified given the size of the vehicle, so the guideway was often separate from the running surface. Typical solutions used a single light rail embedded in the ground or attached to the guideway wall, with a wheel or slider that was pressed against the guideway rail and steered the running wheels through a linkage. A suspension-like system is needed to smooth out the imperfections in the guideway and provide a comfortable ride. More modern systems can eliminate the rail and replace it with a \\"virtual\\" one that is read by sensors on the vehicle without the need for any mechanical connection. AGT systems, and the personal rapid transit concept (or \\"dial-a- cab\\"), became a major area of research after the publication of the HUD reports in 1968, and subsequent funding by the US Department of Transportation. Political support was particularity strong in states with large concentrations of aerospace companies; with the ending of Project Apollo and the winding down of the Vietnam War, there was concern that these companies would be left with few projects in the 1970s and 80s. Expecting widespread deployment of PRT systems through the late 1970s and 80s, many of the major US aerospace companies entered the AGT market, including Boeing, LTV and Rohr. Car companies followed suit, including General Motors and Ford. This, in turn, sparked off a wave of similar developments around the world. However, the market for these systems proved to be overestimated, and only one of these US-designed small AGT's was constructed as a mass transit system, the Morgantown PRT. Small systems The Tampa International Airport People Movers DFW Skylink at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport Although the mass transit world showed a lack of interest, AGT systems quickly found a number of niche roles that they have continued to fill to this day. Tampa International Airport was the world's first to incorporate an AGT system as an inter-terminal connector in 1971. Its landside/airside set up allows the airport to increase capacity without spreading out. The LTV Airtrans was another early AGT systems which was installed at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and went into operation in January 1975 (later replaced by the DFW Skylink system in 2005). Similar systems followed at airports around the world, and today they are relatively universal at larger airports, often connecting terminals with distant long-term parking lots. Similar systems were also a fixture of a number of amusement parks, notably the Walt Disney World Monorail System and the Toronto Zoo Domain Ride. The Getty Center in Los Angeles uses a unique vertically oriented AGT to bring visitors from a parking lot off Interstate 405 to the Center at the top of a hill in Brentwood; this system places the motor outside the vehicle at the top of the guideway to reduce the weight lifted up the hill and thus improve efficiency.Portland Cement Association. Getty Center tram guideway. Retrieved August 27, 2008. Small AGT systems are also used as circulator or feeder systems within urban centers. The city of Miami installed its Metromover system in 1986 and later extended it by 4.4 miles and added 12 new stations it in 1994. Similar INNOVIA APM 100 systems operate in Singapore's Bukit Panjang district and in Guangzhou, China. Over time, the aerospace firms that had initially designed most of these systems left the industry and sold off the AGT divisions to other companies. Most of these were picked up by existing transportation conglomerates, and through additional mergers and buyouts, many of these are today owned by either Siemens or Bombardier. During the same period, a number of new companies entered the field with systems designed solely for these smaller installations. Poma, Doppelmayr and the Leitner Group, better known for their ski lift systems, provide AGT systems for the airport market. Large systems Taipei Metro VAL256 train on the Wenhu line Las Vegas Monorail Although the smaller vehicle systems were not successful in the marketplace, larger AGT were simpler to integrate into existing mass transit systems. Many higher capacity AGT systems that looked and operated in a fashion similar to a small subway have since become a common fixture of many existing metro systems, often as a way to serve outlying areas or as feeders to a metro system. Kobe's Port Liner is the world's first mass transit AGT, which began operating in 1981. It connects Kobe's main rail station, Sannomiya Station, with the dockyard areas and Kobe Airport to the south. Many similar systems have been built elsewhere in Japan. The V√©hicule Automatique L√©ger (VAL) system in Lille, France, opened in 1983, is often cited as the first AGT installed to serve an existing urban area. Larger scale INNOVIA advanced rapid transit (ART) systems in Toronto, and Vancouver followed in the next few years, and then the Docklands Light Railway in London. VAL and ART systems have seen continued installations around the world such as in Airport Express in Beijing and have been joined by a variety of new systems with similar features, like the AnsaldoBreda Driverless Metro. Automated monorail systems, such as the Innovia Monorail 200 system in Las Vegas, are becoming more common AGT systems. Monorails are less obtrusive because they only require a single, narrow guidebeam. AGT renaissance Once limited to larger airports and a small number of metro systems, AGT have undergone something of a renaissance since the late 1990s. Lower capital costs compared to conventional metros have allowed AGT systems to expand quickly, and many of these \\"small\\" systems now rival their larger counterparts in any measure. For instance, the Vancouver SkyTrain started operations in 1986, but has expanded so rapidly that its track length roughly matches the Toronto subway which pre-dates it by 30 years. Although the original introduction of PRT systems did not result in the widespread adoption as expected, Morgantown Personal Rapid Transit in West Virginia's success, along with a renewed interest in new forms of transit, has led to several new PRT projects since 2000. London Heathrow Airport has installed a PRT system, known as ULTra, to connect Terminal 5 with the long- term carpark; its full operation began in September 2011.

Its origin is disputed. The curry is usually creamy and orange-coloured. It is among the United Kingdom's most popular dishes. Composition Chicken tikka masala is composed of chicken tikka, boneless chunks of chicken marinated in spices and yogurt that are roasted in an oven, served in a creamy curry sauce.Lloyd, J and Mitchinson, J. The Book of General Ignorance. Faber & Faber, 2006. A tomato and coriander sauce is common, but no recipe for chicken tikka masala is standard; a survey found that of 48 different recipes, the only common ingredient was chicken. The sauce usually includes tomatoes (frequently as pur√©e), cream, coconut cream and spices like many versions of its namesake masala spice mix. The sauce and chicken pieces may be coloured orange using foodstuffs such as turmeric, paprika, tomato pur√©e or with food dye. The dish shares some similarity with butter chicken, both in the method of creation and appearance. Origins The origin of the dish is not certain. Some trace the origins of the dish to the South Asian community in Britain and others claim that the dish was created in the Indian subcontinent. The Multicultural Handbook of Food, Nutrition and Dietetics credits its creation to Bangladeshi migrant chefs in the 1960s, after migrating from what was then East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). At the time, these migrant chefs developed and served a number of new inauthentic ‚Äò‚ÄôIndian‚Äô‚Äô dishes, including chicken tikka masala. Historians of ethnic food Peter and Colleen Grove discuss various origin-claims of chicken tikka masala, concluding that the dish \\"was most certainly invented in Britain, probably by a Bangladeshi chef\\". They suggest that \\"the shape of things to come may have been a recipe for Shahi Chicken Masala in Mrs Balbir Singh‚Äôs Indian Cookery published in 1961\\". Rahul Verma, a food critic who writes for The Hindu, said he first tasted the dish in 1971 and that its origins were in Punjab, India. He said \\"It's basically a Punjabi dish not more than 40‚Äì50 years old and must be an accidental discovery which has had periodical improvisations\\". Another explanation is that it originated in a restaurant in Glasgow, Scotland. This version recounts how a British Pakistani chef, Ali Ahmed Aslam,Biography of Ali Aslam the possible inventor proprietor of the Shish Mahal restaurant in the west end of Glasgow,Campaign to establish the priority of Glasgow invented chicken tikka masala by improvising a sauce made from yogurt, cream, and spices. In 2013, his son Asif Ali told the story of its invention in 1971 to the BBC's Hairy Bikers TV cookery programme: In July 2009, then British Member of Parliament Mohammad Sarwar tabled an Early Day Motion in the House of Commons asking that Parliament support a campaign for Glasgow to be given European Union protected geographical status for chicken tikka masala. The motion was not chosen for debate, nor did Sarwar speak on this subject in Parliament. Popularity In 2001, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook mentioned the dish in a speech acclaiming the benefits of Britain's multiculturalism, declaring: Chicken tikka masala is served in restaurants around the world, including Indian restaurants in Britain and North America. According to a 2012 survey of 2,000 people in Britain, it was the country's second-most popular foreign dish to cook, after Chinese stir fry.

It was released in South Korea on 31 August 2002 for Microsoft Windows. The game has spawned an animated series, Ragnarok the Animation, and a sequel game, Ragnarok Online 2: Legend of the Second. Player characters exist in a world with a player environment that gradually changes with the passage of time. Major changes in the features and history of the world take place as episodes in the RO timeline. Gameplay The gameplay is heavily based around Norse mythology, wherein the characters are taken from the stories around Ragnar√∂k. Player characters interact in a 3D environment but are represented by 2D character sprites for front, back, side and diagonal facings. The major types of server- supported gameplay are Player vs Environment, Guild vs Guild, Player vs Player. Also supported by the game server are Group vs Group, Arena Combat, Player vs Monster, Player vs All, and various other specific scenarios at designated instance locations in the game world. Non-player character-run challenges and contests are also available with prizes, awards, and/or in a specific hall of fame listing. Players can sign up for quests and submit them for rewards as well as access storage and teleport services for a small fee. Every town will have the usual stores and shops where players can purchase and sell their items. The stores differ from city to city because each city is affiliated with a different job that players can choose from; therefore, the goods each sell are relatively for that particular job that the city is affiliated with. Quests usually provide a unique reward such as learning a new skill or receiving a rare item. The job system initially consisted of 13 classes, which has increased to over 50 via several updates. Each class specializes in certain skills corresponding to archetypes in a role-playing game. Additionally, numerous equipment are exclusive to particular classes. The greatness of the equipment depends on the character attribute status. Once a player reaches player level 99 and job level 50, they can 'rebirth' their character (not applicable to expansion classes and Super Novices). Rebirthing brings a character back to level 1 for both player level and job level. Reborn characters generally work the same as regular characters up until the second class. Instead of a second class, characters that are born can transcend to a new second job, different from those of a character that hasn't been reborn. These transcended job types have more skills and a larger number of 'stat points' to allocate to characters compared to second classes. The experience curve for transcendent jobs is significantly higher. Players are given the option to advance onto their third classes which provide an additional set of skills as well as allowing with player to break through the traditional level cap of 99. Setting Ragnarok Online is divided into a series of maps on two major continents, each of which has its own terrain and native monsters, though many monsters are present in multiple regions. Transportation between maps requires loading the new map and monsters are unable to travel from one map to another unless directly associated with the player such as a pet, mount, or hireling. Areas from Norse mythology are included.  Development  The official Ragnarok Online servers underwent massive game system changes in 2010, which has been titled \\"Renewal\\". Renewal revamped game mechanics, changed the behavior and interaction of stats, gears, and modifiers in the stat system, changed the way and amount of character experience, and introduced the 3rd Job Classes. There are various other changes that come with Renewal, including interface and hotkey alterations, as well as skill changes.  Reception Ragnarok Mobile Gravity Co. Ltd. released eight separate games for the mobile phone allowing players to experience the game on the road. Each version focuses on the main aspect of certain classes based on the version of the game they have. Though not placed in the server, players control their character and complete a series of quests or tasks. As players earn zeny (the in-game currency) they are able to send the zeny to their real accounts. Also, a ranking is present where characters are ranked by the amount of zeny the character has.

Qmin by Anil Ashokan, Greg ElmsThe Science of Cooking, Peter Barham, Springer: 2001. . p. 118.The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook by Beth Hensperger Etymology The earliest appearance of \\"naan\\" in English is from 1803 in a travelogue of William Tooke.Russia, or a Complete Historical Account of all the Nations which compose that Empire, London, p. 168: \\"The most common dishes are onoschi, or vermicelli; plav, or boiled rice; nan, pancakes, and the meats which the law permits.\\" (referring to the eating habits of the central Turks). Other attestations in English can be found in the Oxford English Dictionary, s.v. naan. The Persian word nƒÅn 'bread' is attested in Middle Persian as n'n 'bread, food', which is of Iranian origin, and is a cognate with Parthian ngn, Kurdish nan, Balochi nagan, Sogdian nŒ≥n-, and Pashto n…ôŒ≥an 'bread'.Manfred Mayrhofer, Etymologisches W√∂rterbuch des Altindoarischen, Heidelberg 1996, vol. 2, p. 6, Naan may have derived from bread baked on hot pebbles in ancient Persia. The form naan has a widespread distribution, having been borrowed in a range of languages spoken in Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent, where it usually refers to a kind of flatbread (tandyr nan). The spelling naan has been recorded as being first attested in 1979,, but dates back at least to 1975,Milton Glaser and Jerome Snyder. \\"Delhi Delights\\", New York Magazine, August 11, 1975, p. 73 and has since become the normal English spelling.  Varieties = Western Asia  Naan as known today originates from Mesopotamia, ancient Egypt, and the Indian Subcontinent. The most familiar and readily available varieties of naan in Western countries are those from the Indian subcontinent. In Iran, as well as in other West Asian nations or ethnic groups in the region, from which the word originated, n√¢n () does not carry any special significance, as it is the generic word for any kind of bread. File:Baking bread by nomad women in Lar National Park.jpgNan in Iran File:Iranian Bread 1.JPGN√¢n-e barbari in Iran File:Naan Sangak.jpgN√¢n-e sangak in Iran File:Taftan nan 01.jpgN√¢n-e t√¢ftun in Iran  South Asia  Naan in parts of the Indian subcontinent usually refers to a specific kind of thick flatbread (another well-known kind of flatbread is chapati. Generally, it resembles pita and, like pita bread, is usually leavened with yeast or with bread starter (leavened naan dough left over from a previous batch); unleavened dough (similar to that used for roti) is also used. Naan is cooked in a tandoor, from which tandoori cooking takes its name. This distinguishes it from roti, which is usually cooked on a flat or slightly concave iron griddle called a tava. Modern recipes sometimes substitute baking powder for the yeast. Milk or yogurt may also be used to impart distinct tastes to the naan. Milk used instead of water will, as it does for ordinary bread, yield a softer dough.Harold McGee. On Food and Cooking. Scribner. 2nd Ed, 2004. Also, when bread starter (which contains both yeast and lactobacilli) is used, the milk may undergo modest lactic fermentation. Typically, it is served hot and brushed with some water but in some other cultures such as those in the Indian Subcontinent, they brush ghee or butter. It can be used to scoop other foods or served stuffed with a filling. A typical naan recipe involves mixing white or whole wheat flour with active dry yeast, salt, and water. The dough is kneaded for a few minutes, then set aside to rise for a few hours. Once risen, the dough is divided into balls (about 100 g or 3.5 oz each), which are flattened and cooked. In Pakistani cuisine, naans are typically flavoured with fragrant essences, such as rose, khus (vetiver), or with butter or ghee melted on them. Nigella seeds are commonly added to naan as cooked in Indian and Bangladeshi restaurants throughout the UK. Raisins, lentils and spices can be added. Naan can also be covered with, or serve as a wrap for, various toppings of meat, vegetables, or cheeses. This version is sometimes prepared as fast food. It can also be dipped into such soups as dal and goes well with sabzis (also known as shaakh). Indonesia In Indonesia, naan is popular in Indian Indonesian and Arab Indonesian community as well as Malay, Acehnese and Minangkabau‚Äìwith other variant of roti like roti canai. This dish usually locally known as roti naan or roti nan and cooked using Indonesian spices, such as garlic with local taste. http://www.bakingwithnyssaeda.com/2015/07/indonesian-flatbread.html Myanmar Naan bya () in Burma is sometimes served at breakfast with tea or coffee. It is round, soft, and blistered, often buttered, or with p√® byouk (boiled peas) on top, or dipped in thousoup (mutton soup). Luri fi√ß√° in Rohingya is similar to naan, but made of rice and served at festivals with beef, mutton, vegetables, and soups. It is a national cake of Rohingya in Arakan. Naan pizza is a type of pizza where naan is used as the crust instead of the traditional pizza dough.

During 1941, Napier operated in the Mediterranean, before being transferred to the British Eastern Fleet at the start of 1942, then to south Atlantic operations in early 1944. In 1945, Napier was assigned to the British Pacific Fleet, and spent the rest of World War II in the fight against Japan.

Napier was the first of the eight-ship N class laid down under the War Emergency Programme when construction started at the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company shipyard in Govan, Scotland on 26 July 1939. The destroyer was launched on 22 May 1940 by the wife of one of the company directors, and was commissioned into the RAN on 28 November 1940. Although commissioned as an Australian warship, Napier remained the property of the Royal Navy. The ship was named after Scottish Admiral Sir Charles Napier, with the ship's badge taken from the family coat of arms, and cost 403,960 pounds to build. Operating history During the ship's first weeks of operation, several sailors threatened to mutiny by refusing to leave the mess decks; this was defused when the ship's first lieutenant humorously threatened to \\"flog 'em out of the mess decks with ropes' ends\\".Frame & Baker, Mutiny!, pp. 153‚Äì4 In January 1941, \\"Napier\\" carried Winston Churchill to the Royal Navy base at Scapa Flow from nearby Scrabster when Churchill accompanied Lord Halifax there for his departure for the United States to serve as British Ambassador.Larson, Erik.

Napier and sister ship were transferred to the Mediterranean, arriving in time to participate in the evacuation of Crete. Napier was then assigned to Port Said for two-and-a-half months, serving as control ship for the harbour's defence at night, while undergoing repairs and refits in the day. On completion in August, the destroyer was assigned as lead ship of the 7th Destroyer Flotilla. During the remainder of the year, Napier participated in the Tobruk Ferry Service, escorted convoys through the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, and transferred troops between Cyprus and Hafia. At the start of 1942, Napier, Nestor, and were transferred to the British Eastern Fleet. The ships' first task was to escort the carrier to the Malaya-Java area. In June, Napier and Nestor returned to the Mediterranean for Operation Vigorous, a major convoy to support besieged Malta. Napier returned to duties with the Eastern Fleet after the unsuccessful convoy run, and in September participated in the Madagascar campaign, particularly the surrender of Majunga and the occupation of Tamatave. The destroyer commenced patrols of the East Indian Ocean in October, which she continued until March 1943, when she joined the Atlantic anti- submarine force based in South Africa. At the start of 1944, Napier was assigned to Indian waters. Later in the year, the ship sailed to Australia for a long period of refitting at Williamstown, but returned to the Eastern Fleet in early November. During December, Napier supported operations of the 74th Indian Infantry Brigade. In January 1945, Napier took part in landings at Akyab and Ramree.Gillett & Graham, Warships of Australia, p. 162 In early 1945, Napier was reassigned to the British Pacific Fleet, changing her pennant from G97 to D13. During May, the destroyer was part of the escort screen for the carrier air raids on Sakishima.Cassells, The Destroyers, p. 53 Napier was present in Tokyo Bay on Victory over Japan Day (2 September 1945), when the Japanese Instrument of Surrender was signed. After supporting the occupation landings, the destroyer sailed to Sydney.

Lerner Publishing Group. Jonathan H. X. Lee, Kathleen M. Nadeau Encyclopedia of Asian American Folklore and Folklife, Volume 1 page 973 ABC-CLIO, 2011 , 9780313350665 The various cuisines are derived from Pakistan's ethnic and cultural diversity. Cuisine from the eastern provinces of Punjab and Sindh are characterized as \\"highly seasoned\\" and \\"spicy\\", which is characteristic of flavors of the East. Cuisine from the western and northern provinces of Azad Jammu & Kashmir, Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Tribal Areas and the Gilgit- Baltistan are characterized as \\"mild\\" which is characteristic of flavors of the adjoining regions of Central Asia and Western Asia. International cuisine and fast food are popular in the cities. Blending local and foreign recipes (fusion food), such as Pakistani Chinese cuisine, is common in large urban centers. Furthermore, as a result of lifestyle changes, ready-made masala mixes (mixed and ready-to-use spices) are becoming increasingly popular. However, given the diversity of the people of Pakistan, cuisines generally differ from home to home and may be different from mainstream Pakistani cuisine. Historical influences Pakistani national cuisine is the inheritor of Indo-Aryan and Iranic culture and Muslim culinary traditions. The earliest formal civilizations were the Mohenjo-daro () and Harappan civilizations in Pakistan. At around 3000 BCE, sesame, eggplant, and humped cattle were domesticated in the Indus Valley, and spices like turmeric, cardamom, black pepper and mustard were harvested in the region concurrently. For at least a thousand years, wheat and rice formed the basic foodstuff in the Indus Valley. The arrival of Islam () within the Indian subcontinent, influenced the local cuisine to a great degree. Since Muslims are forbidden to eat pork () or consume alcohol, halal () dietary guidelines are strictly observed. Pakistanis focus on other types of meat, such as beef, chicken and fish, with vegetables, as well as traditional fruit and dairy. The influence of Central Asian, South Asian and Middle Eastern cuisine in Pakistani food is ubiquitous. Elements Pakistani dishes are known for having aromatic and sometimes spicy flavors. Some dishes contain liberal amounts of oil, which contribute to a richer, fuller mouthfeel and flavour. Brown cardamom, green cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, mace, and black pepper are the most commonly used spices in the making of a wide variety of dishes throughout Pakistan. Cumin seeds, chili powder, turmeric and bay leaves are also very popular. In the Punjab province, it is further diluted with coriander powder. Garam masala (a mixture of aromatic spices) is a very popular blend of spices used in many Pakistani dishes. Regional cuisines= Balochistan  Balochi cuisine is the food and cuisine of the Baloch people from the Balochistan region, comprising the Pakistani Balochistan province, the Sistan and Baluchestan Province in Iran and Balochistan, Afghanistan. Baloch food has a regional variance in contrast to the many cuisines of Pakistan and Iran. Among the most popular Balochi dishes are Balochi sajji (skewed lamb or chicken filled with rice) and dampukht (meat slow-cooked in fats). Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Rice dishes and kebabs feature prominently in Pashtun cuisine. Lamb is eaten more often in Pashtun cuisine than any other Pakistani cuisines. Kabuli Palaw, chapli kabab, tika, and mutton karahi are the most famous dishes. Historical variations include Peshawari cuisine. The Pashtun and Balochi cuisines are traditionally non-spicy. = Kalash Punjab Since Punjabi identity is considered geographical and cultural, almost all inhabitants of Punjab follow some variations within the cuisine, but on the other hand show many similarities together. This cuisine then falls into the broad category of Punjabi cuisine. Regional cuisine is mutual with some differences in many regions, including the South Punjab regions. Bong Paye (made from legs and joints of cow, goat, buffalo or sheep), Nihari (usually made from buffalo or veal shanks and bone marrow), Murgh Chanay or Murgh Cholay (Chicken and Chickpeas slow cooked in butter) are considered authentic Punjabi delicacies in Pakistani cuisines. =South PunjabSindh Sindhi cuisine refers to the native cuisine of the Sindhi people from Sindh, Pakistan. Sindhi Cuisine is considered to be spicy and consists of a variety of chicken dishes. Sindhi Biryani (made from white rice, chicken and regional spices) is particularly popular picnic food. =Karachi= The cuisine of Karachi is similar to the Mughlai cuisine, which is influenced by Hyderabadi cuisine. Hunza Kashmir  Kashmiri cuisine is the cuisine of the Kashmir Valley region. Rice is the staple food of Kashmiris and has been so since ancient times. Meat (chicken, mutton, beef, or fish), along with rice, is the most popular food item in Kashmir. Kashmiris consume meat voraciously. Meal structure Punjabi/Sindhi-style wooden woven plate for chapati (flat bread) Pakistanis generally eat three meals a day, which are breakfast, lunch, and dinner. During the evening, many families have tea, which goes along with baked/fried snacks from a local bakery (or prepared at home). During the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, the eating patterns change to suhur, pronounced ‚ÄúSehar‚Äù in Pakistan, and iftar. It is considered proper to eat only with the right hand as per Islamic tradition (also a tradition in many other Asian cultures). Many Pakistani families, particularly when guests are too many to fit at a table, eat sitting at a cloth known as DastarkhƒÅn, which is spread out on the floor. In Pakistan, many street eateries serve food on a takht, in a style similar to what is seen in Afghanistan. A takht is a raised platform, where people eat their food sitting cross-legged, after taking their shoes off. Most Pakistanis used to eat on a takht. Pakistanis often eat with their hands, scooping up solid food along with sauce with a piece of baked bread (naan) or rice. Breakfast Having Nihari and Halwa Puri in breakfast is popular among people living in Lahore. A typical Pakistani breakfast, locally called nƒÅshtƒÅ (), consists of eggs (boiled/scrambled/fried/omelette), a slice of loaf bread or roti, parathas, sheermal with tea or lassi, kulcha with chole, qeema (minced meat), fresh seasonal fruits (mangoes, apples, melons, bananas, etc.), milk, honey, butter, jam, shami kebab or nuts. Sometimes breakfast includes baked goods like bakarkhani and rusks. During holidays and weekends, halwa poori and chickpeas are sometimes eaten. In Punjab, sarson ka saag (mustard leaves) and maakai ki roti (cornbread) is a local favourite. Punjabi people also enjoy khatchauri, a savory pastry filled with cheese. Pakistan is not unlike many other Asian nations, in the sense that meat dishes are eaten as breakfast, especially on holidays. A traditional Sunday breakfast might be Siri-Payay (the head and feet of lamb or cow) or Nihari () (a dish which is cooked overnight to get the meat extremely tender. The name \\"Nihari\\" comes from the Arabic word \\"Nihar\\", meaning \\"Day\\" or \\"Day break\\".) Many people used to take \\"Bong\\" (Shank curry) in their Sunday brunch. Lunch A typical Pakistani lunch consists of meat curry along with rice or a pile of roti. Daal chawal is among the most commonly taken dishes at lunch. Breads such as roti or naan are usually served for dinner, but have become more common during the day so that rice may be served for dinner. Popular lunch dishes may include aloo gosht (meat and potato curry) or any vegetable with mutton. Chicken dishes like chicken karahi are also popular. Alternatively, roadside food stalls often sell just lentils and tandoori rotis, or masala stews with chapatis. People who live near the main rivers also eat fish for lunch, which is sometimes cooked in the tandoori style. Dinner gobi aloo, seekh kebab, and beef karahi Dinner is considered the main meal of the day as the whole family gathers for the occasion. Food which requires more preparation and which is more savoury (such as biryani, nihari, pulao, kofte, kebabs, qeema, korma) are prepared. Lentils are also a dinnertime staple. These are served with roti or naan along with yogurt, pickle and salad. The dinner may sometimes be followed by fresh fruit, or on festive occasions, traditional desserts like kheer, gulab jamun, shahi tukray, gajraila, qulfi or ras malai. Snacks and fast foods Pakistani snacks comprise food items in Pakistan that are quick to prepare, spicy, usually fried, and eaten in the evening or morning with tea or with any one of the meals as a side dish. A given snack may be part of a local culture, and its preparation and popularity can vary from place to place. These snacks are often prepared and sold by hawkers on footpaths, railway stations and other such places, although they may also be served at restaurants. Some typical snacks are Dahi Bhala, Aloo tikki, chaat & Samosa Chaat, Bun kebab, Chana Masala, Chapli kebab, Shami kebab, Seekh Kebab, Malai Tikka Kebab (Meat and Yogurt), Reshami Kebab, Pakora, and Papar. Others include Katchauri, pakoras‚Äîeither neem pakoras or besan (chickpea) Pakoras, Gol Gappay, Samosas‚Äîvegetable or beef, Bhail Puri, Daal Seu, Panipuri, and egg rolls. Nuts, such as pistachios and pine nuts, are also often eaten at home. Main courses Lahori Beef Karahi, usually served with freshly made tandoori naan In Pakistan, main courses are usually served with wheat bread (either roti or naan) or rice. Salad is generally taken as a side dish with the main course, rather than as an appetizer beforehand. Assorted fresh fruit or sometimes desserts are consumed at the end of a meal. Meat plays a much more dominant role in Pakistani food, compared to other South Asian cuisines. According to a 2003 report, an average Pakistani consumed three times more meat than an average Indian.Global Production and Consumption of Animal Source Foods, The American Society for Nutritional Sciences J. Nutr. 133:4048S-4053S, November 2003. Retrieved on 27 March 2007 Of all the meats, the most popular are goat, lamb and mutton, beef and chicken, which are particularly sought after as the meats of choice for kebab dishes or the classic beef shank dish nihari. Seafood is generally not consumed in large amounts, though it is very popular in the coastal areas of Sindh and the Makran coast of Balochistan and was a dominant element of the cuisine of the former East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). Curries, with or without meat, combined with local vegetables, such as bitter gourd, cauliflower, eggplant, okra, cabbage, potatoes, rutabaga, saag, and chili peppers are most common and cooked for everyday consumption. A typical example is aloo gosht (literally \\"potatoes and meat\\"), a homestyle recipe consisting of a spiced meat and potato stew, and is ubiquitously prepared in many households. Korma is a classic dish of Mughlai origin made of either chicken or mutton, typically eaten with naan or other bread, and is very popular in Pakistan. Vegetable and legume dishes There are plenty of vegetarian-friendly dishes which are popular in Pakistan. These are often cooked using traditional spices and flavoring agents such as chilies, turmeric, garlic, ginger, cumin, cloves, cinnamon, fennel seeds, etc. Vegetable and legume dishes are also very popular in Pakistan. Dishes such as Baingan bartha and Sarson da saag are typical examples eaten in most homes. Aloo mutter is made with potatoes and peas. There are plenty of vegetables which are grown seasonally in Pakistan, which are cooked into tasty and spicy curries which are eaten for lunch or dinner. Some vegetable dishes, such as \\"aloo paratha\\" and \\"channa puri\\" are also consumed for breakfast. Meat dishes The meat dishes in Pakistan include bovine, ovine, poultry and seafood dishes. The meat is usually cut in 3 cm cubes and cooked in a stew. The minced meat is used for Kebabs, Qeema, and other meat dishes. The meat dishes are also cooked with pulses, legumes and rice. Barbecue and kebabs Meat and grilled meat have played an important role in Pakistan for centuries. Kebabs are a staple item in Pakistani cuisine today, and one can find countless varieties of kebabs all over the country. Each region has its own varieties of kebabs, but some like the Seekh kebab, Chicken Tikka, and Shami kebab are especially popular throughout the country and in some other parts of South Asia. File:Chicken Tikka.jpgA variety of dishes cooked by barbecuing Image:Pakistani Food Beef Kabobs.jpgSeekh kebab (minced meat on skewers), a famous Pakistani food specialty File:Chapli Kebab.jpgChapli kebab is another famous Pakistani food specialty Pulses Various kinds of pulses or legumes, make up an important part of Pakistani cuisine. While lentils (called daal) and chickpeas (called channa/chanay ki daal) are popular ingredients in homestyle cooking, they are traditionally considered to be inexpensive food sources. Because of this reason, they are typically not served to guests who are invited for dinner or during special occasions. Combining meat with lentils and pulses, whether in simple preparations or in elaborate dishes such as haleem. Beans such as black-eyed peas (lobia) and kidney beans (rajma) are sometimes served in a tomato-based masala sauce, especially in Punjab. Chickpeas, red kidney beans, and other legumes are also popular in Pakistani cooking. They are usually cooked in a spicy gravy and served with rice or traditional flatbread (roti). Chickpeas, known as channa, are also a common breakfast food when served with puri. \\"Channa chaat\\" is another favorite street food and iftaar dish, which is made of chickpeas, chopped onions, tomatoes, and chilies, and seasoned with spices (chaat masala) and tamarind paste. There are a wide variety of lentils, known as daal, that are consumed in Pakistan and frequently consumed with rice. \\"Daal chawaal\\" (lentils and rice) is known as a popular comfort food in many Pakistani households. Rice dishes Sindhi biryani Pakistan is a major exporter and consumer of rice. Basmati is the most popular type of rice consumed in Pakistan. Dishes made with rice include many varieties of pulao: * Maash pulao - A sweet and sour pulao baked with mung beans, apricots and bulgur (a kind of roughly milled cracked wheat). Exclusively vegetarian. * Matar pulao - Pulao made with peas. * Murgh pulao - Chicken and stock added. Creates a brown rice. * Yakhni pulao - Meat and stock added. Creates a brown rice. * Kabuli Palaw - is an Afghan dish, which is popular in Pashtun dominated regions in Pakistan such as the Tribal Areas, FATA, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in North-West Pakistan, and Balochistan in the South-West Pakistan. It is a variety of pilaf, consisting of steamed rice mixed with raisins, carrots, and lamb Biryani is a very popular dish in Pakistan, and has many varieties, such as Lahori and Sindhi biryani. Tahiri, which is a vegetarian form of biryani, is also popular. All of the main dishes (except those made with rice) are eaten alongside bread. To eat, a small fragment of bread is torn off with the right hand and used to scoop and hold small portions of the main dish. Pickles made out of mangoes, carrots, lemon, etc. are also commonly used to further spice up the food. In the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, feasts using mountains of spiced rice combined with pieces of slowly roasted lamb are often served for guests of honour. These kind of pulaos often contain dried fruit, nuts, and whole spices such as cloves, saffron and cardamom. Kabuli Palaw is very popular in Pashtun dominated regions in Western Pakistan. Such rice dishes have their origins in Central Asia and the Middle East. Varieties of bread Chapati (bread) with a piece of chicken meat Peshwari naans freshly made in the tandoor (open oven) Pakistanis eat breads made of wheat flour as a staple part of their daily diet. Pakistan has a wide variety of breads, often prepared in a traditional clay oven called a tandoor. The tandoori style of cooking is common throughout rural and urban Pakistan, and also has strong roots in neighboring India, Iran and Afghanistan. Some of these are: * Chapati - Most common bread made in urban homes, where a tandoor is not available. Chapatis are cooked over a flat or slightly convex dark colored pan known as 'tava'. Chapatis are made of whole-wheat flour and are thin and unleavened. Tortillas are probably the most common analogous to chapatis, though chapatis are slightly thick. A variant, known as 'romali roti' (lit. Handkerchief bread), is very thin and very large in size. * Kandahari Naan - Long, salty naan originating in Western Pakistan and commonly eaten with Peshawari Karahi or Chapli Kebab. * Kulcha - This is a type of naan usually eaten with chickpeas and potatoes and mostly popular in urban centers of Punjab. * Naan - In Urdu, the national language of Pakistan, the word Naan means bread. Unlike chapatis, naans are slightly thicker, typically leavened with yeast and mainly made with white flour. Some varieties like Roghani and Peshwari naan may also be sprinkled with sesame seeds. Naans are seldom, if ever, made at home since they require tandoor based cooking and require prep work. Numerous varieties of plain, as well as stuffed naans are available throughout Pakistan and each region or city can have their own specialty. Naan is a versatile bread and is eaten with almost anything. For instance, 'saada naan' or 'plain naan', is often served with Siri-Payay (cow's head and trotters) or Nihari (slow cooked beef stew) for breakfast in many parts of the country. * Paratha - A flat, layered bread made with ghee or cooking oil and generally cooked on a 'tava'. However, a 'tandoor' based version is also common in rural areas. Parathas are very similar to pastry dough. Parathas most likely originated in the Punjab, where a heavy breakfast of parathas with freshly churned butter and buttermilk was commonly consumed by the farmers to prepare themselves for the hard day of work ahead. However, parathas are now a common breakfast element across the country. Along with the plain layered version, many stuffed versions, such as 'Aloo ka Paratha' (Potato stuffed paratha), 'Mooli ka Paratha' (Radish stuffed paratha), and 'Qeemah ka Paratha' (Ground meat stuffed paratha) are popular. * Puri - This is a breakfast bread made of white flour and fried. Typically eaten with sweet semolina halwa or gravy (made out of chickpeas and potatoes). Puri is a fairly urban concept in Pakistan and puris are not part of rural cuisine anywhere in Pakistan. However, Halwa Puri has now become a favored weekend or holiday breakfast in urban Pakistan, where it is sometimes sold in shift carts or in specialty breakfast shops. * Roghani Naan (lit. Buttered Naan) - It is a preferred variety of Naan sprinkled with white sesame seeds and cooked with a small amount of oil. * Roti - This bread is extremely popular all over Pakistan. Tandoori rotis are baked in a clay oven, known as a tandoor, and are consumed with just about anything. In rural Pakistan, many houses have their own tandoors, while the ones without it use a communal one. In urban Pakistan, bread shops or \\"nanbai\\"/\\"tandoor\\" shops are fairly common and supply fresh, tandoor baked breads to household customers. * Sheermal ‚Äì Saffron-flavored traditional flatbread. It is a festive bread prepared with milk ('sheer') and butter with added candied fruits. Sheermal is often a vital part of food served in marriages, along with taftan. It is often sweetened. * Taftan - This is a leavened flour bread with saffron and a small amount of cardamom powder baked in a tandoor. The taftan made in Pakistan is slightly sweeter and richer than the one made in neighboring Iran. Desserts Gulab jamun Popular desserts include Peshawari ice cream, sheer khurma, qulfi, falooda, kheer, feerni, zarda, shahi tukray and rabri. Sweetmeats are consumed on various festive occasions in Pakistan. Some of the most popular are gulab jamun, barfi, ras malai, kalakand, jalebi and panjiri. Pakistani desserts also include a long list of halvah, such as multani, hubshee, and sohan halvah. Kheer made of roasted seviyaan (vermicelli) instead of rice is popular during Eid ul-Fitr. Gajraila is a sweet made from grated carrots, boiled in milk, sugar, cream and green cardamom, topped with nuts and dried fruit. It is popular in Pakistan, as well as in other parts of South Asia, including Afghanistan. Tea varieties Pakistanis drink a great deal of tea, which is locally called \\"chai.\\" Both black (with milk) and green teas are popular and there are different varieties common in different parts of Pakistan. * In Gilgit-Baltistan and Chitral, as well as areas near the Chinese border, salty Tibetan-style butter tea is consumed. * Doodh Pati Chai is made by cooking tea leaves with milk and sugar, sometimes served with cardamom for fragrance. Extremely sweet, this is a local variation of a builder's tea. * \\"Kashmiri chai\\" or \\"noon chai\\", a pink, milky tea with pistachios and cardamom, is consumed primarily at special occasions, weddings, and during the winter, when it is sold in many kiosks. * \\"Sabz chai\\" or \\"kahwah\\", a green tea often served after every meal in Kashmir, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and the Pashtun belt of Balochistan, served with saffron and nuts. * Sulaimani chai is black tea served with lemon. Beverages Besides tea, there are other drinks that may be included as part of the Pakistani cuisine. All of them are non-alcoholic as the consumption of alcohol is prohibited by Islam. During the 20th century, beverages such as coffee and soft drinks have also become popular in Pakistan. It is very common to have soft drinks nowadays with Pakistani meals. * Almond sherbet - Sherbet made with almonds * Baraf Gola - Frozen Ice in a cup mould served with syrup as a topping * Kashmiri chai/Gulabi chai - A milky tea known for its pink color, with an either sweet or salty taste * Lassi - Milk with yogurt, with an either sweet or salty taste * Lemonade (Limu pani) * Qehwa - Green tea with cardamom * Sardai - Mixture of different nuts and kishmish * Sathu - Famous drink from Punjab * Sherbet (syrup mixed in water) * Sherbet-e- Sandal - Drink made with the essence of sandal wood * Sikanjabeen - Lemonade (mint is also added) * Sugarcane juice (Ganney ka ras) * Thaadal - A sweet drink from Sindh Halal Observant Muslims follow the Islamic law that lists foods and drinks that are halal, permissible to consume. The criteria specify both what foods are allowed and how the food must be prepared. The foods addressed are mostly types of meat. Foreign influences File:McDonald's Sargodha.jpgMcDonald's outlet at Queens Road, Sargodha File:Faisalabad D-Ground KFC.jpgKFC outlet at D-Ground, Faisalabad File:A Pizza Hut Restaurant in Karachi Pakistan.jpgPizza Hut restaurant in Karachi In addition to the traditional food, fast food is also very famous across the country. In big cities, there is a presence of outlets of many International Fast Food Restaurants that includes KFC, McDonald's, Pizza Hut, Subway, Domino's, Burger King, Hardee's, Papa John's Pizza, Dunkin' Donuts, Baskin- Robbins and Taco Bell etc. Occasionally, many people in Pakistan have dinner outside at a restaurant with foreign influenced food, such as Western, Arab and Chinese dishes. Many westernized, Chinese restaurants and fast food outlets are dotted in all urban parts of Pakistan. The Punjab and Sindh provinces, where the majority of urban chains of many American, European and British restaurants have opened in many metropolitan cities, such as Karachi, Lahore, Faisalabad, Islamabad-Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Peshawar, Multan, Hyderabad, Quetta, Sargodha, Bahawalpur, Sialkot, Sukkur, Larkana and many others. Marketing and advertisements have made these a haven for social and modern spots for all Pakistanis to try out. Outside Pakistan, Pakistani cuisine is prevalent in countries, where they have large Pakistani communities. The Balti curry is a British dish that is claimed to have origins in the Kashmir region that borders Pakistan. Pakistani food makes use of fresh hand-pounded masalas. Ghee is used, but the main component of the meal or a dish is meat (beef, lamb, chicken, goat, or fish), and vegetables are sparingly used. Surprisingly, Pakistani food also makes extensive use of olive oil. Sparingly used vegetables does not mean there is no vegetarian food on the menu. Since the cuisine is very similar to Punjabi-style of cooking, tikka, simmered dals, tawa sabzi, and chaat feature here.

The destroyer, named after Osman Ali Khan, the last Nizam of Hyderabad, was commissioned into the RAN in 1940, although the ship remained the property of the Royal Navy for her entire career. Nizam spent the early part of her service in the Atlantic, then was reassigned to the Mediterranean, where she was involved in the Crete and Syria-Lebanon Campaigns, the Tobruk Ferry Service, and the Malta Convoys. During 1942, the destroyer was involved in Operation Vigorous and the Madagascar Campaign. The next year saw the ship involved in patrols of the Indian and South Atlantic oceans, searching for German ships and submarines, and rescuing the survivors of U-boat attacks. After returning to Australia for a refit at the end of 1944, ten sailors were washed overboard in February 1945, with none ever seen again. The rest of World War II was spent operating in the Philippines and New Guinea regions. After returning to Australia in late 1945, Nizam was decommissioned and returned to the Royal Navy. The ship was not returned to active service, and was broken up for scrap in 1956. Design and construction The N-class destroyer had a displacement of 1,773 tons at standard load, and 2,554 tons at full load.Cassells, The Destroyers, p. 65 Nizam was long overall and long between perpendiculars, had a beam of , and a maximum draught of . Propulsion was provided by Admiralty 3-drum boilers connected to Parsons geared steam turbines, which provided 40,000 shaft horsepower to the ship's two propellers.Cassells, The Destroyers, p. 66 Nizam was capable of reaching . The ship's company consisted of 226 officers and sailors. View looking down on Nizams bridge and the forward 4.7-inch gun turret The ship's armament consisted of six 4.7-inch QF Mark XII guns in three twin mounts, a single 4-inch QF Mark V gun, a 2-pounder 4-barrel Pom Pom, four 0.5-inch machine guns, four 20 mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft guns, four .303 Lewis machine guns, ten 21-inch torpedo tubes in two Pentad mounts, and a complement of depth charges.Cassells, The Destroyers, pp. 65‚Äì6 HMAS Nizam was laid down by John Brown and Company, Limited, at Clydebank in Scotland on 27 July 1939. She was launched by the wife of Sir Holberry Mensforth, a director of John Brown, on 4 July 1940. The ship was commissioned on 19 December 1940; an error in a file at Navy Office caused some sources to incorrectly record the commissioning date as 8 January 1941.Cassells, The Destroyers, pgs 66, 239 Although commissioned into the RAN, the destroyer was on loan from the Royal Navy. HMAS Nizam was named after Sir Osman Ali Khan, The Last Nizam of Hyderabad. Operational history After completing sea trials, Nizam was assigned to Scapa Flow, where she was assigned to fleet duties, then retasked as an escort for convoys crossing the Atlantic. In April 1941, the destroyer joined a convoy sailing to Gibraltar, then sailed around Africa to meet the troop transports Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth, which Nizam helped escort to Alexandria. Around the same time, all watchkeeping sailors staged a mutiny in response to alterations to watchkeeping and messing arrangements by locking themselves into their messdeck compartments.Frame & Baker, Mutiny, p. 154 Following mediation between the sailors and the officers, the captain agreed to restore the original arrangements and decided not to charge the sailors, after which the watchkeepers returned to duty. On 21 May, Nizam participated in the shelling of Scarpanto, then became involved in the Battle of Crete. The destroyer transported commandos from Alexandria to Suda Bay, and returned with wounded.Royal Australian Navy, HMAS Nizam When the campaign turned for the worse, Nizam and made two evacuation runs to ferry troops from the island to Alexandria. Following the unsuccessful campaign, Nizam was assigned to the Syria-Lebanon Campaign for three weeks, then retasked to the Tobruk Ferry Service, a force of British and Australian warships making supply runs to the Allied forces under siege in Tobruk. Nizam made fourteen runs before receiving damage on 14 September; a near-miss from a bomb cracked oil pumps, and the destroyer was towed away from the area by the destroyer , then was able to make temporary repairs and reach Alexandria. After repairs were completed, Nizam spent the rest of 1941 escorting Malta Convoys, on bombardment operations in north Africa, and transporting troops to Cyprus and Haifa. On 21 October 1941 Nizam was part of a convoy which came under Stuka dive bomber attack while evacuating Australian infantry Rats of Tobruk to Alexandria. Twenty fully kitted troops were swept overboard during evasion manoeuvres, six being lost at sea and never recovered. At the start of 1942, Nizam and her sister ship, sailed for Singapore to join as escort for the aircraft carrier . In June, the N class ships joined the escort of a large convoy to Malta, during which Nestor was sunk by aircraft. Nizam and her sisters were assigned to the Madagascar Campaign during September. On 22 September, Nizam was assigned to Durban to patrol for Vichy French merchant ships, capturing one and forcing another to scuttle during the week spent in this role. The destroyer then sailed to Simon's Town in South Africa for a refit, which lasted until the end of the year. Nizam in Port Phillip during late 1944, shortly before entering refit in Melbourne After refitting, Nizam was attached to the British Eastern Fleet, and participated in sweeps of the Indian Ocean for enemy ships. She was then reassigned to the South Atlantic for shipping protection. On 13 July 1943, the destroyer rescued survivors from an American liberty ship sunk by . On 31 July, Nizam rescued survivors from a British merchant ship sunk by . After delivering the British survivors ashore, Nizam made for Australia, and docked in Melbourne on 18 August for an eight-week refit. The ship returned to operations in the Indian Ocean, and on 17 October was unsuccessfully fired on by a German U-boat. Between late 1943 and early 1944, the destroyer was based in Kenya, then was transferred on 8 March to the Bay of Bengal.Cassells, The Destroyers, p. 67 During her time based here, Nizam participated in Operation Cockpit, a carrier air raid on Japanese assets in south-east Asia. In November, the destroyer sailed to Melbourne for another refit. In a tragedy which harked back to that of 21 October 1941, on 11 February 1945, while crossing the Great Australian Bight in poor weather after the refit, Nizam was hit by a freak wave which caused the ship to roll almost eighty degrees to port, and washed ten sailors overboard, none of whom were ever seen again. During 1945, Nizam was assigned to the Philippines and New Guinea theatres as part of the British Pacific Fleet, during which, her pennant number was changed from G38 to D15.Cassells, The Destroyers, pgs. 65, 67 On 15 August 1945, Nizam received orders to cease hostilities; shortly after this, the ship was attacked by a Japanese fighter, which was shot down. Nizam was present in Tokyo Bay for the Japanese surrender, and served as duty destroyer on 2 September, the day the Japanese Instrument of Surrender was signed. The destroyer left for Australia on 24 September. Nizam earned seven battle honours for her wartime service: \\"Malta Convoys 1941‚Äì42\\", \\"Crete 1941\\", \\"Libya 1941\\", \\"Mediterranean 1941\\", \\"Indian Ocean 1942‚Äì44\\", \\"Pacific 1943\\", and \\"Okinawa 1945\\".

She is the first ship of the RAN to be named Newcastle. Operational history Newcastle operating alongside in the Persian Gulf in 2005 Newcastle was deployed to East Timor as part of the Australian-led INTERFET peacekeeping taskforce from 19 December 1999 to 26 January 2000. During 2005, Newcastle was deployed to the Persian Gulf. Newcastle and were the first RAN ships to be fitted with two M2HB .50 calibre machine guns in Mini Typhoon mounts; now a standard theatre fit for all RAN frigates deployed to the Persian Gulf. At the start of November 2006, Newcastle was one of three Australian warships sent to Fiji during the leadup to the 2006 coup d'√©tat by Fijian military forces against Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase. Newcastle was the first vessel on station, and was later joined by and . The three vessels were to be used in the event of an evacuation of Australian citizens and nationals.Aussie warships heading for Fiji. The Daily Telegraph (Sydney), 2 November 2006. It did not prove necessary to conduct an evacuation and Newcastle returned to Australia in late December 2006. On the morning of 13 March 2009, Newcastle was one of seventeen warships involved in a ceremonial fleet entry and fleet review in Sydney Harbour, the largest collection of RAN ships since the Australian Bicentenary in 1988. The frigate was one of the thirteen ships involved in the ceremonial entry through Sydney Heads, and anchored in the harbour for the review. Following an overhaul of the RAN battle honours system, completed in March 2010, Newcastles service was recognised with two honours: \\"East Timor 1999‚Äì2000\\" and \\"Persian Gulf 2002‚Äì03\\". In April 2010, Newcastle was presented with the RAN Gloucester Cup, recognising her as the most efficient ship during 2009. During July and August 2010, Newcastle was one of three RAN ships to participate in the RIMPAC 2010 multinational exercise. In mid-2016 Newcastle conducted first-of-class flight trials with a ScanEagle unmanned air vehicle (UAV) as part of the development of Navy‚Äôs UAV capability. In November that year the frigate sortied from Sydney to intercept a merchant ship off the north coast of New South Wales which was believed to be involved in drug smuggling. In June 2017 it was reported that Newcastle had deployed to the Middle East as part of Operation Manitou on her sixth deployment to the region. She was decommissioned on 30 June 2019. On 27 December 2019, it was announced that Newcastle and Melbourne would be sold to Chile. Newcastle was renamed and commissioned into the Chilean navy on 15 April 2020 as Capit√°n Prat, pennant number FFG-11. Battle honours Up to 1989, battle honours awarded to ships of the Royal Navy could also be inherited by RAN ships carrying the same name. However, upon the announcement that the final Adelaide-class frigate would be named for Newcastle, a decision was taken that this policy would end and in future RAN ships would receive their own battle honours, ensuring that Newcastle, the first ship in the RAN so named, would not inherit the honours of .Cassells, p.207 *East Timor 1999‚Äì2000 *Persian Gulf 2002‚Äì2003 *Middle East Area 2005‚Äì14 CitationsReferences ;Books   ;Journal articles  ;Websites * External links *Australian Defence Force RIMPAC 2010 Images of ESSM / SM2 shoot Category:Adelaide-class frigates Category:Ships built in Victoria (Australia) Category:1992 ships ","title":"HMAS Newcastle"},{"id":"429287","text":"The article provides links to lists of military divisions arranged by ordinal number, name, country or conflict.

This duck is not migratory, but will wander in the dry season to find suitable waters. It is highly gregarious outside the breeding season and forms large flocks. These are mallard-sized mainly grey ducks with a darker head and bright yellow bill. The wings are whitish below, and from above show a white-bordered green speculum. Sexes are similar, and juveniles are slightly duller than adults. The north-eastern race is darker and has a brighter bill and blue speculum. It is a bird of freshwater habitats in fairly open country and feeds by dabbling for plant food mainly in the evening or at night. It nests on the ground in dense vegetation near water. Rarely found in suburban areas, in close proximity to golf courses, parks and lakes or dams. The clutch numbers between six and twelve eggs. The male has a teal-like whistle, whereas the female has a mallard-like quack. There are two subspecies of the yellow-billed duck: A. undulata rueppelli (northern yellow-billed duck) A. undulata undulata (southern yellow-billed duck) The yellow-billed duck is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies. The southern nominate subspecies is declining due to competition and hybridization with feral mallards (Rhymer 2006). References *Rhymer, Judith M.

It turns the set of non-empty compact subsets of a metric space into a metric space in its own right. It is named after Felix Hausdorff and Dimitrie Pompeiu. Informally, two sets are close in the Hausdorff distance if every point of either set is close to some point of the other set. The Hausdorff distance is the longest distance you can be forced to travel by an adversary who chooses a point in one of the two sets, from where you then must travel to the other set. In other words, it is the greatest of all the distances from a point in one set to the closest point in the other set. It seems that this distance was first introduced by Hausdorff in his book Grundz√ºge der Mengenlehre, first published in 1914, although a very close relative appeared in the doctoral thesis of Maurice Fr√©chet in 1906, in his study of the space of all continuous curves from [0,1] \\\\to \\\\R^3. Definition Components of the calculation of the Hausdorff distance between the green line X and the blue line Y. Let X and Y be two non-empty subsets of a metric space (M,d). We define their Hausdorff distance d_{\\\\mathrm H}(X,Y) by : d_{\\\\mathrm H}(X,Y) = \\\\max\\\\left{\\\\,\\\\sup_{x \\\\in X} \\\\inf_{y \\\\in Y} d(x,y),\\\\, \\\\sup_{y \\\\in Y} \\\\inf_{x \\\\in X} d(x,y)\\\\,\\\\right}, ! where sup represents the supremum and inf the infimum. Equivalently, :d_H(X,Y) = \\\\inf{\\\\varepsilon \\\\geq 0\\\\,;\\\\ X \\\\subseteq Y_\\\\varepsilon \\\\text{ and } Y \\\\subseteq X_\\\\varepsilon},\\\\quad where : X_\\\\varepsilon := \\\\bigcup_{x \\\\in X} {z \\\\in M\\\\,;\\\\ d(z,x) \\\\leq \\\\varepsilon}, that is, the set of all points within \\\\varepsilon of the set X (sometimes called the \\\\varepsilon-fattening of X or a generalized ball of radius \\\\varepsilon around X). Equivalently, : d_H(X, Y) = \\\\sup_{w \\\\in M} \\\\left \\\\inf_{x \\\\in X} d(w,x) - \\\\inf_{y \\\\in Y} d(w,y)\\\\right = \\\\sup_{w \\\\in X \\\\cup Y} \\\\left \\\\inf_{x \\\\in X} d(w,x) - \\\\inf_{y \\\\in Y} d(w,y)\\\\right, that is, d_{\\\\mathrm H}(X, Y) = \\\\sup_{w \\\\in M}  d(w, X) - d(w, Y), where d(w, X) is the distance from the point w to the set X. Remark It is not true for arbitrary subsets X, Y \\\\subset M that d_{\\\\mathrm H}(X,Y) = \\\\varepsilon implies : X\\\\subseteq Y_\\\\varepsilon \\\\ \\\\mbox{and} \\\\ Y\\\\subseteq X_\\\\varepsilon. For instance, consider the metric space of the real numbers \\\\mathbb{R} with the usual metric d induced by the absolute value, :d(x,y) := y - x, \\\\quad x,y \\\\in \\\\R. Take :X := (0, 1] \\\\quad \\\\mbox{and} \\\\quad Y := [-1,0). Then d_{\\\\mathrm H}(X,Y) = 1\\\\ . However X subseteq Y_1 because Y_1 = [-2,1)\\\\ , but 1 \\\\in X. But it is true that X\\\\subseteq \\\\overline{Y_\\\\varepsilon} and Y\\\\subseteq \\\\overline{X_\\\\varepsilon} ; in particular it is true if X, Y are closed. Properties *In general, d_{\\\\mathrm H}(X,Y) may be infinite. If both X and Y are bounded, then d_{\\\\mathrm H}(X,Y) is guaranteed to be finite. *d_{\\\\mathrm H}(X,Y)=0 if and only if X and Y have the same closure. *For every point x of M and any non- empty sets Y, Z of M: d(x,Y) ‚â§ d(x,Z) + dH(Y,Z), where d(x,Y) is the distance between the point x and the closest point in the set Y. *diameter(Y)-diameter(X) ‚â§ 2 dH(X,Y).Diameter and Hausdorff Distance, Math.SE *If the intersection X ‚à© Y has a non-empty interior, then there exists a constant r > 0, such that every set X‚Ä≤ whose Hausdorff distance from X is less than r also intersects Y.Hausdorff Distance and Intersection, Math.SE *On the set of all subsets of M, dH yields an extended pseudometric. *On the set F(M) of all non-empty compact subsets of M, dH is a metric. **If M is complete, then so is F(M). **If M is compact, then so is F(M). **The topology of F(M) depends only on the topology of M, not on the metric d. Motivation The definition of the Hausdorff distance can be derived by a series of natural extensions of the distance function d(x,y) in the underlying metric space M, as follows: *Define a distance function between any point x of M and any non- empty set Y of M by: ::d(x,Y)=\\\\inf { d(x,y) \\\\mid y \\\\in Y }.\\\\ :For example, d(1, {3,6}) = 2 and d(7, {3,6}) = 1. *Define a distance function between any two non-empty sets X and Y of M by: ::d(X,Y)=\\\\sup { d(x,Y) \\\\mid x \\\\in X }.\\\\ :For example, d({1,7},{3,6}) = \\\\sup{ d(1,{3,6}), d(7,{3,6})} = \\\\sup{ d(1,3),d(7,6) } = 2. *If X and Y are compact then d(X,Y) will be finite; d(X,X)=0; and d inherits the triangle inequality property from the distance function in M. As it stands, d(X,Y) is not a metric because d(X,Y) is not always symmetric, and does not imply that (It does imply that X \\\\subseteq Y). For example, , but . However, we can create a metric by defining the Hausdorff distance to be: ::d_{\\\\mathrm H}(X,Y) = \\\\max{d(X,Y),d(Y,X) } \\\\, . Applications In computer vision, the Hausdorff distance can be used to find a given template in an arbitrary target image. The template and image are often pre-processed via an edge detector giving a binary image. Next, each 1 (activated) point in the binary image of the template is treated as a point in a set, the \\"shape\\" of the template. Similarly, an area of the binary target image is treated as a set of points. The algorithm then tries to minimize the Hausdorff distance between the template and some area of the target image. The area in the target image with the minimal Hausdorff distance to the template, can be considered the best candidate for locating the template in the target.Hausdorff-Based Matching In computer graphics the Hausdorff distance is used to measure the difference between two different representations of the same 3D object particularly when generating level of detail for efficient display of complex 3D models. Related concepts A measure for the dissimilarity of two shapes is given by Hausdorff distance up to isometry, denoted DH. Namely, let X and Y be two compact figures in a metric space M (usually a Euclidean space); then DH(X,Y) is the infimum of dH(I(X),Y) along all isometries I of the metric space M to itself. This distance measures how far the shapes X and Y are from being isometric. The Gromov‚ÄìHausdorff convergence is a related idea: we measure the distance of two metric spaces M and N by taking the infimum of d_{\\\\mathrm H}(I(M),J(N)) along all isometric embeddings I\\\\colon M\\\\to L and J\\\\colon N\\\\to L into some common metric space L.

The ship was built during the early 1940s as one of the War Emergency Programme destroyers, and entered service in 1942. During World War II, Quadrant served as a convoy escort in the Arctic, South Atlantic, and Indian Oceans, and operated with the British Eastern and British Pacific Fleets. At the war's end, the ship was decommissioned and transferred to the RAN, which operated her for two years before placing her in reserve. In 1950, the ship was docked for conversion into an anti-submarine frigate. Quadrant was recommissioned in 1953, and operated with the RAN until 1957, when she was paid off. The ship was sold for breaking in 1963. Design and construction Quadrant was built to the wartime Q-class design; the third flotilla of War Emergency Programme destroyers. These ships had a displacement of 1,750 tons at standard load, and 2,388 tons at full load.Cassells, The Destroyers, p. 87 The destroyer was in length overall, long between perpendiculars, and had a beam of .

The ship was also fitted with four depth charge throwers, with up to 70 depth charges carried. Quadrant in 1944, while operating with the British Pacific Fleet The destroyer was laid down by R. and W. Hawthorn, Leslie and Company Limited at Hebburn-on- Tyne, England on 24 September 1940. She was launched on 28 February 1942 by the wife of one of the shipyard's directors. Quadrant was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 26 November 1942. Royal Navy service During World War II, Quadrant served with the British Eastern and British Pacific Fleets. Quadrant was engaged in convoy escort duties in the Arctic, South Atlantic, and Indian Oceans. She took part in the North African landings, aircraft carrier strikes against Surabaya and bombardment of the Nicobar Islands. She served with the British Pacific Fleet in 1945 where she took part in operations against Formosa (Taiwan), Okinawa, and the Japanese home islands. Transfer to RAN Quadrant was loaned to the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) in exchange for the return of one of the N-class destroyers. Quadrant commissioned into the RAN on 18 October 1945, and was used to transport soldiers from New Guinea home to Australia. On 16 August 1947, the destroyer was paid off into reserve.Cassells, The Destroyers, p. 89 Frigate conversion On 15 February 1950, the heavy cruiser departed Sydney for Melbourne with Quadrant in tow. The vessels arrived at Melbourne on 18 February. Conversion of Quadrant to a fast anti-submarine frigate began at the Williamstown Naval Dockyard in Melbourne during April 1950.

The conversion was completed in mid 1953, and the ship recommissioned into the RAN on 16 July. RAN service After recommissioning, Quadrants service was mainly in Australian waters. Quadrant escorted the Royal Yacht during the visit to Australia of Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh in February 1954. Quadrant visited New Guinea, Manus, and New Britain in October 1954, New Zealand in March 1955, and spent a period on exercises in Far East waters in June 1955. In March 1956, she took part in exercises in Malayan waters. During June 1956 she served for a period as a surveillance vessel with the Japanese pearling fleet in the Arafura Sea. In October 1956, Quadrant again proceeded to the Far East for further exercises, visiting Hong Kong, Singapore, and Manila. By 1957 the frigate was already worn out and the decision to decommission the vessel was made before sister ship s frigate conversion was complete and after the premature decommissioning due to hull failure. Decommissioning and fate Quadrant paid off at Sydney on 16 August 1957 and was sold for scrap to the Japanese firm of Kinoshita and Company Limited on 15 February 1963.

Although built for the Royal Navy and remaining British property until 1950, Quiberon was one of two Q-class destroyers commissioned into the RAN during World War II. She was passed into full RAN ownership in 1950, and converted into an anti-submarine frigate. Design and construction Quiberon was one of eight Q-class destroyers constructed as a flotilla under the War Emergency Programme.Cassells, The Destroyers, p. 95 These ships had a standard displacement of 1,705 tons, and a deep load displacement of 2,424 tons. Quiberon was long overall, and long between perpendiculars, with a beam of .

At , she had a range of only , but could travel at . The ship's company consisted of 8 officers and 181 sailors. The ship's main armament consisted of four QF 4.7 inch Mk IX guns in single turrets. This was supplemented by a quadruple 2-pounder pom-pom, and six 20 mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft guns. Four depth-charge throwers were fitted, with a payload of 70 charges carried, and two quadruple 21-inch torpedo tube sets were fitted, although a maximum of eight torpedoes were carried. Quiberon was laid down by J. Samuel White and Company at their shipyard in Cowes, on the Isle of Wight, on 14 October 1940. She was launched on 31 January 1942 by the wife of Rear Admiral S. D. Tillard, Flag Officer in Charge, Southampton. Quiberon was commissioned into the RAN on 6 July 1942. Although commissioned as an Australian ship, the destroyer initially remained the property of the Royal Navy. The ship was named after the Battle of Quiberon Bay, which occurred in 1759. Operational history=World War II Quiberon first served on North Atlantic convoy escort duty, operating out of Scapa Flow. She was assigned to support the Allied landings in North Africa in October 1942. On 28 November, Quiberon attacked and sank the Italian submarine off the Tunisian coast. After this, the destroyer was assigned to \\"Force Q\\", which was based at Bone and consisted of three cruisers and two other Q-class destroyers. =Battle of Skerki Bank= Around midnight on 1 December, Force Q located and attacked an Italian convoy of four merchant ships and escorting destroyers about to the north of Cape Bon.Gill, Royal Australian Navy, 1942‚Äì1945, pp. 201‚Äì202 All four supply ships, carrying mostly troops and munitions, were sunk, and at 01:35 on 2 December Quiberon fired the final shot into the Italian torpedo boat which was part of the escort of another convoy. While returning to port, sister ship was torpedoed by a German aircraft: Quiberon evacuated most of the other destroyer's personnel. On 21 December, Quiberon rescued survivors from the passenger vessel Strathallen. =Indian Ocean and Pacific service= Quiberon in 1945 In January 1943, the destroyer escorted a convoy from England to Cape Town, then made for Victoria, Australia for refit. After work was completed, Quiberon was assigned to the British Eastern Fleet, primarily as a convoy escort across the Indian Ocean. In July 1943, the ship rescued survivors from , that was sunk by U-boat U-177. In April 1944, the destroyer was part of the carrier escort screen during Operation Cockpit, then again in May for Operation Transom: air raids against Japanese forces occupying the Dutch East Indies. After a brief refit in Melbourne, Quiberon resumed operations with the Eastern Fleet in August. In October, she took part in a series of fleet bombardments of the Japanese-held Nicobar Islands. In mid December, Quiberon was reassigned to Australian waters as a convoy escort and anti-submarine patrol vessel. During early 1945, the destroyer was attached to the British Pacific Fleet. Operating from Manus Island, Quiberon took part in operations in support of the American seizure of Okinawa and attacks on the Japanese home islands. =Immediate post-war service= At the end of World War II, Quiberon was present at the Allied reoccupation of Singapore, and spent the period until February 1946 operating in the East Indies to help reestablish Dutch control, move troops, and repatriate prisoners-of-war.Cassells, The Destroyers, p. 97 The ship received eight battle honours for her wartime service: \\"Mediterranean 1942\\", \\"North Africa 1942‚Äì43\\", \\"Atlantic 1943\\", \\"Indian Ocean 1943‚Äì44\\", \\"East Indies 1944\\", \\"Pacific 1945\\", \\"Okinawa 1945\\", and \\"Japan 1945\\". Between 1946 and 1948, Quiberon was deployed with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force on three occasions. Frigate conversion Quiberons post-conversion configuration. In early 1950, the decision was made to convert all five Q-class destroyers in RAN service (three more had been acquired after World War II) to anti- submarine warfare frigates, similar to the Type 15 frigate conversions performed on several War Emergency Programme destroyers of the RN.Cooper, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 168 A proposal was made by the Australian government to pay for the upgrade to the five on-loan vessels, at the predicted cost of AU¬£400,000 each. Instead, the British Admiralty presented the ships to the RAN on 1 June as gifts.Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, p. 316 The conversions were part of an overall plan to improve the anti-submarine warfare capability of the RAN, although Quiberon and the other ships were only a 'stopgap' measure until purpose-built ASW frigates could be constructed.Donohue, From Empire Defence to the Long Haul, p. 67 Quiberon paid off on 15 May 1950 for conversion at Cockatoo Island Dockyard and Garden Island Dockyard in Sydney. She was recommissioned on 18 December 1957.Cassells, The Destroyers, pp. 97‚Äì8 Post-conversion service Quiberon served in the Far East with the Commonwealth Strategic Reserve and as a unit of the Australian Fleet on the Australia Station.Gillett & Graham, Warships of Australia, p. 182 The frigate made a port visit to Burma in 1959; the last RAN vessel to do so until in 2014. In October 1962 Quiberon together with HMAS Queenborough rescued 25 survivors from the Panamaian merchant steamer Kawi, which sank after being caught in a storm in the South China Sea. In December 1962, again with HMAS Queenborough, HMAS Quiberon rescued the crew of the SS Tuscany, which had run aground on a reef in the South China Sea. Decommissioning and fate Quiberon paid off to reserve on 26 June 1964. She was sold for scrap to the Fujita Salvage Company Limited of Osaka, Japan on 15 February 1972, and left Sydney under tow on 10 April 1972.Gillett & Graham, Warships of Australia, p. 183 NotesReferences    * External links Category:Q-class destroyers of the Royal Australian Navy Category:Type 15 frigates of the Royal Australian Navy Category:Ships built on the Isle of Wight Category:1942 ships Category:World War II destroyers of the United Kingdom Category:World War II destroyers of Australia ","title":"HMAS Quiberon (G81)"},{"id":"429320","text":"HMAS Quickmatch (G92/D21/D292/F04) was a Q-class destroyer operated by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Although commissioned into the RAN in 1942, the ship was initially the property of the Royal Navy. Quickmatch served with both the British Eastern Fleet and British Pacific Fleet during World War II. In the 1950s, the destroyer was converted into an anti-submarine frigate. In 1957, Quickmatch operated in support of Malaya during the Malayan Emergency. The ship remained in service until 1963, and after use as an accommodation ship, was sold for scrap in 1972. Design and construction Quickmatch was one of eight Q-class destroyers constructed as a flotilla under the War Emergency Programme.Cassells, The Destroyers, p. 100 She had a standard displacement of 1,750 tons, and a deep load displacement of 2,420 tons. Quickmatch was long overall, and long between perpendiculars, with a beam of . Propulsion was provided by two Admiralty 3-drum boilers connected to Parsons Impulse turbines, which generated for the propeller shafts.Cassells, The Destroyers, p. 101 Quickmatch had a maximum speed of . The ship's company consisted of 220 officers and sailors. The ship's main armament consisted of four QF 4.7 inch Mk IX guns in single turrets.Cassells, The Destroyers, p. 87 This was supplemented by a quadruple 2-pounder pom-pom, and six 20 mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft guns. Four depth-charge throwers were fitted, with a payload of 70 charges carried, and two quadruple 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tube sets were fitted, although a maximum of eight torpedoes were carried. The ship was laid down by J. Samuel White and Company Limited at their shipyard in Cowes, on the Isle of Wight, on 6 February 1941. She was launched on 11 April 1942 by the wife of the company's deputy chairman. Quickmatch was commissioned into the RAN on 14 September 1942. Despite being commissioned into the RAN, Quickmatch remained the property of the British government until the early 1950s, when she was gifted to the RAN. The ship's name came from the quick match, a fast burning match used for lighting cannon. Operational history=World War II From October 1942, Quickmatch operated as a convoy escort vessel; initially in British waters, then in the South Atlantic, then in the Indian Ocean. In July 1943, the ship rescued survivors from , that was sunk by U-boat U-177. While in the Indian Ocean, the ship was assigned to a force dedicated to covering convoys between the Gulf of Aden and India. In May 1944, the destroyer joined the British Eastern Fleet. Shortly after, the destroyer formed part of the carrier screen during Operation Transom, an air raid on Japanese-held Surabaya. This role was repeated in June during an air attack on the Andaman Islands. In October, Quickmatch arrived in Australia for a refit. After this, she remained in Australian waters until March 1945, when she was reassigned to the British Pacific Fleet. As part of this force, Quickmatch took part in operations in support of the American seizure of Okinawa and attacks on the Japanese home islands. The ship received six battle honours for her wartime service: \\"English Channel 1942\\", \\"Atlantic 1943\\", \\"Indian Ocean 1943‚Äì44\\", \\"Sabang 1944\\", \\"Pacific 1944‚Äì45\\", and \\"Okinawa 1945\\". Post-war and frigate conversion Over the following years, Quickmatch made several deployments to Japanese and Korean waters, with the rest of her time spent operating around Australia. On 15 May 1950, Quickmatch paid off for a major refit in which she was converted to an anti-submarine frigate at Williamstown Naval Dockyard in Victoria. She was recommissioned on 23 September 1955. Afterwards, she was deployed to Singapore as part of Australia's contribution to the Far East Strategic Reserve.Gillett & Graham, Warships of Australia, p. 182 In 1957, Quickmatch operated in support of British Commonwealth forces deployed during the Malayan Emergency, for which she was later awarded her seventh battle honour, \\"Malaya 1957\\". On 10 November 1960 Quickmatch rescued the crew of an Indonesian Proa with failed engines near Singapore. Decommissioning and fate Quickmatch performed routine duties until she paid off to reserve at Williamstown on 26 April 1963. After paying off she served as an accommodation ship until she was sold for scrap to the Fujita Salvage Company Limited of Osaka in Japan on 15 February 1972.

Selection is based on four criteria: scholarship (academic achievement), leadership, service, and character. The National Honor Society requires some sort of service to the community, school, or other organizations. The time spent working on these projects contributes towards the monthly service hour requirement. The National Honor Society was founded in 1921 by the National Association of Secondary School Principals. The Alpha chapter of NHS was founded at Fifth Avenue High School by Principal Edward S. Rynearson in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. National Honor Society groups are commonly active in community service activities both in the community and at the school. Many chapters maintain a requirement for participation in such service activities. In addition, NHS chapters typically elect officers, who, under the supervision of the chapter adviser, coordinate and manage the chapter as a student organization. Membership Over one million students are estimated to participate in the National Honor Society. NHS and NJHS chapters are found in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, many U.S. territories, and Canada. They can also be found in areas of Asia; Pakistan has three schools maintaining an active chapter. They further can be found in international and American schools throughout the globe.  Motto  The NHS motto is noblesse oblige (French: \\"nobility obligates\\"). The Dictionnaire de l'Acad√©mie fran√ßaise defines it thus: > # Whoever claims to be noble must conduct himself nobly. # (Figuratively) > One must act in a fashion that conforms to one's position, and with the > reputation that one has earned.

Probably born in South Wales, he primarily ministered to the Britons of Devon (Dewnans) and Cornwall (Kernow) then forming the kingdom of Dumnonia where he is associated with a monastery at Padstow, which is named after him (Pedroc-stowe, or 'Petrock's Place').Mills, A. D. A Dictionary of English Place-Names. Oxford University Press. 1991 Padstow appears to have been his earliest major cult centre, but Bodmin became the major centre for his veneration when his relics were moved to the monastery there in the later ninth century.Jankulak 2000, p. 66 Bodmin monastery became one of the wealthiest Cornish foundations by the eleventh century.Stacey 2002 There is a second ancient dedication to him nearby at Little Petherick or \\"Saint Petroc Minor\\". In Devon ancient dedications total a probable seventeen (plus Timberscombe just over the border in Somerset), mostly coastal and including one within the old Roman walls of Exeter as well as the villages of Petrockstowe and Newton St Petroc. In Wales his name is commemorated at St Petrox near Pembroke, Ferwig near Cardigan and Llanbedrog on the Ll≈∑n peninsula. He also became a popular saint in Brittany by the end of the tenth century. Life 125px The earliest Life of Petroc states that he was a younger son of an unnamed Welsh chieftain:Monks of Ramsgate. ‚ÄúPetrock‚Äù. Book of Saints, 1921. CatholicSaints.Info. 20 October 2016 the twelfth century version known as the Gotha Life, written at Bodmin, identifies that king as Glywys of Glywysing (Orme 2000, p. 215) and Petroc as a brother of Gwynllyw and uncle of Cadoc. He studied in Ireland,St Petroc's History‚ÄîThe Story of St Petroc where later he is said to have been the teacher of Kevin of Glendalough.Lapa, Dmitry. \\"Venerable Petroc of Cornwall\\", Orthodox Christianity He made a pilgrimage to Rome, and returning to Cornwall, the wind and tide brought him to Trebetherick. He founded a monastery and school at Lanwethinoc (the church of Wethinoc, an earlier holy man), at the mouth of the river Camel on the North Cornish Coast. It came to be called Petrocs-Stow (Petroc's Place), now Padstow. St Guron founded a hermitage at Bodmin, but left for the coast upon the arrival of Petroc. St Guron's Well is located a at the western entrance to the churchyard of St Petroc's Church, Bodmin. All accounts indicate that Petroc retired from Padstow to Bodmin.Butler, Alban. \\"The Lives of the Saints\\", Vol.VI, 1866 Petroc ministered throughout Dumnonia, which included Kernow (Cornwall), and parts of Dewnans (Devon) ,Somerset and Dorset. He also served in Brittany. Petroc founded churches in Little Petherick and in many parts of Britain, Wales and Brittany. He is said to have converted Constantine of Cornwall to Christianity by saving a deer Constantine was hunting. Constantine later established a hermitage at what is now called Constantine Bay. After thirty years, legend says that Petroc went on the pilgrimage to Rome by way of Brittany. The place of his death was reputedly at a house belonging to a family named Rovel, thought to be a farm now called Treravel near Little Petherick. Veneration The Bodmin casket which once contained the saint's relics With Saint Piran and Saint Michael, he is one of the patron saints of Cornwall.The cult of St Michael was largely due to the Norman Earls of Cornwall, while that of St Petroc was the most important in the Diocese of Cornwall since he was the founder of the monastery of Bodmin, the most important in the diocese and, with St Germans, the seat of the bishops. He was the patron of the diocese and of Bodmin: Caroline Brett, 'Petroc (fl. 6th cent.)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 16 Dec 2008 He was described by Thomas Fuller as \\"the captain of Cornish saints\\".Cross, F. L., ed. (1959) The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. London: Oxford University Press; p. 1058 Humility is a virtue strongly associated with Petroc. One of the pervasive stories about this describes his return from the pilgrimage to Rome and Jerusalem. As he set foot home in Britain under a heavy rain, he confidently told his companions that it would clear up by morning. Instead, the downpour lasted for many days and Petroc, ashamed of his presumptuousness, is said to have left on another pilgrimage, this one of penance. Legendarily he travelled as far as India where he is said to have tamed a wolf. In iconography, he is frequently depicted with this unlikely pet. Also, like several other British saints, Petroc is often shown with a stag. In 936, King Athelstan of England annexed Cornwall and granted privilege of sanctuary to Padstow, there only being two other churches in Cornwall with this privilege. His feast day is 4 June. His major shrine was always at St Petroc's Church, Bodmin. In 1177, a Breton stole his relics from Bodmin and gave them to the Abbey of St Meen. However, Henry II restored them and, though the relics were thrown out during the English Reformation, their ivory casket is still on public display at St. Petroc's in Bodmin. His remains were reputed to have ended up in the bay of Hailemouth near Padstow.Challoner, Richard. A Memorial of Ancient British Piety: or, a British martyrology.

In this context Dimotiki describes the specific non-standardized vernacular forms of Greek used by the vast majority of Greeks throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. During this long period of diglossia Katharevousa and Dimotiki complemented and influenced each other, as is typical of diglossic situations. Dimotiki became standardized over time and it was this standardized form of Dimotiki which in 1976 was made the official language of Greece. This standardized form of Dimotiki is today known formally as Standard Modern Greek. The term demotic Greek (with a lowercased d) is also a term used generally to refer to any variety of the Greek language which has evolved naturally from Ancient Greek and is popularly spoken. Basic features of Dimotiki Demotic Greek differs from varieties of Ancient Greek and learned forms inherited from the same in several important ways. Syntactically, it favors parataxis over subordination. It also heavily employs redundancy, such as (small little-girl) and (he-went-back-to-sleep again). Somewhat in connection with this, Demotic employs the diminutive with great frequency, to the point that many Demotic forms are in effect neuter diminutives of ancient words, especially irregular ones, e.g. from (island) from ancient (island). Greek noun declensions underwent considerable alteration, with irregular and less productive forms being gradually replaced by more regular forms based on the old one: (man) for ancient . Another feature was the merging of classical accusative and nominative forms, distinguishing them only by their definite articles, which continued to be declined as in Ancient Greek. This was especially common with nouns of the third declension, such as (hometown, fatherland) which became nominative , accusative in Demotic. Another feature of the evolution of Demotic was the near-extinction of the genitive plural, which was revived in Katharevousa and is now productive again in Demotic. A derivative feature of this regularization of noun forms in Demotic is that the words of most native vocabulary end in a vowel, or in a very restricted set of consonants: s and n (). Exceptions are foreign loans like (bar), and learned forms (from Ancient Greek , water), and exclamations like (ach!, oh!) Many dialects go so far as to append the vowel -e () to third-person verb forms: instead of (they write). Word-final consonant clusters are also rare, again mainly occurring in learned discourse and via foreign loans: (coal ‚Äì scientific) and (boxing ‚Äì sport). Indirect object is usually expressed by with the accusative where Ancient Greek had for accusative of motion toward; bare is used without the article to express indefiniteness duration of time, or contracted with the definite article for definiteness especially with regard to place where or motion toward; or with the genitive, especially with regard to means or instrument. Using one noun with an unmarked accusative article-noun phrase followed by contracted with the definite article of a second noun distinguishes between definite direct and indirect objects, whether real or figurative, e.g. ¬´¬ª or ¬´...¬ª (lit. I put my hand upon the Gospel or ...in the fire, i.e. I swear it's true, I'm sure of it). By contrast, Katharevousa continued to employ the ancestral form, , in place of . The verb system inherited from Ancient Greek gradually evolved, with the old future, perfect and pluperfect tenses gradually disappearing; they were replaced with conjugated forms of the verb (I have) to denote these tenses instead. The future tenses and the subjunctive and optative moods, and eventually the infinitive, were replaced by the modal/tense auxiliaries and used with new simplified and fused future/subjunctive forms. In contrast to this, Katharevousa employed older perfective forms and infinitives that had been for the most part lost in the spoken language, but in other cases it employed the same aorist or perfective forms as the spoken language, but preferred an archaizing form of the present indicative, e.g. for Demotic (I hide), which both have the same aorist form . Demotic Greek also borrowed a significant number of words from other languages such as Italian and Turkish, something which katharevousa avoided. Dimotiki and \\"Standard Modern Greek\\" Dimotiki is sometimes used interchangeably with \\"Standard Modern Greek\\" ('), but these two terms are not necessarily synonymous. While in Greek the term () can describe any naturally evolved colloquial language of the Greeks, today's Standard Modern Greek language can be thought of specifically as a fusion of Katharevousa and the specific Dimotiki spoken by in Greece in the 20th century. It is not wrong to call the Greek language of today \\"a demotic Greek\\", but such terminology may lead to confusion with the semi-standardized Dimotiki which was in use during the period of diglossia in Greece and is not identical to today's Standard Modern Greek. Referring to Standard Modern Greek as Dimotiki or Demotic Greek (with a capital \\"D\\") also ignores the fact that today's Greek contains‚Äîespecially in its written form and formal registers‚Äînumerous words, grammatical forms, and phonetical features that did not exist in the Dimotiki and which only entered the language through Dimotiki's merger with Katharevousa as part of the resolution of the Greek language question. Examples of Modern Greek features that did not exist in Dimotiki The following examples are intended to demonstrate Katharevousa's features in Modern Greek. They were not present in traditional Demotic and only entered the modern language through Katharevousa (sometimes as neologisms), where they are used mostly in writing (for instance, in newspapers), but also orally, especially words and fixed expressions are both understood and actively used also by non-educated speakers. In some cases, the Demotic form is used for literal or practical meanings, while the Katharevousa is used for figurative or specialized meanings: e.g. for the wing or feather of a bird, but for the wing of a building or airplane or arm of an organisation. Words and fixed expressions * (interesting) * (at least) * (he abducted her) * ... (it is a fact that ...) * (for now) * (figurative, I wash my hands [of him, her, it]); adapted from the Ancient Greek phrase describing Pontius Pilate washing his hands at Matthew 27:24; for actual hand-washing, the Demotic phrase is .Pring, J.T. The Pocket Oxford Greek Dictionary. (New York: 1965 & 1982; 2000 ed.) Special dative forms: * (thank God) * (in the name [of] ...) * (in cash) * (following) * (meanwhile) * (in ignorance [of]) * (moreover) * (working, literally on the deed) * (percent, literally in a hundred) * (with [one's] own hands) Grammatical (morphological) features * Adjectives ending in , , (e.g. interesting) or in , , (e.g. thoughtful) - mostly in written language. * Declinable aorist participle, e.g. (having delivered), ([having been] born) - mostly in written language. * Reduplication in the perfect. E.g. (invited), (obsolete) Phonological features Modern Greek features many letter combinations that were avoided in classical Demotic: * (e.g. \\"misdemeanor\\"); Demotic preferred (e.g. \\"to err; to be guilty\\") * (e.g. \\"building, structure\\"); Demotic preferred [e.g. \\"(stone)mason\\"] * (e.g. \\"falsity, lie\\"); Demotic preferred (e.g. \\"liar\\") * (e.g. / \\"I was sufficed / satisfied\\"); Demotic preferred (e.g. ) * (e.g. \\"yesterday\\"); Demotic preferred [e.g. ] * etc. Native Greek speakers often make mistakes in these \\"educated\\" aspects of their language; one can often see mistakes like instead of (I've been promoted), instead of ('), instead of (the interesting person), instead of (the interesting women), instead of (the vote). However, the educated ones do not make mistakes often. Radical demoticism One of the most radical proponents of a language that was to be cleansed of all \\"educated\\" elements was Giannis Psycharis, who lived in France and gained fame through his work My Voyage (', 1888). Not only did Psycharis propagate the exclusive use of the naturally grown colloquial language, but he actually opted for simplifying the morphology of Katharevousa forms prescription. For instance, Psycharis proposed changing the form of the neuter noun \\"light\\" ' (gen. ') into ' (gen. '). Such radical forms had occasional precedent in Renaissance attempts to write in Demotic, and reflected Psycharis' linguistic training as a Neogrammarian, mistrusting the possibility of exceptions in linguistic evolution. Moreover, Psycharis also advocated spelling reform, which would have meant abolishing most of the six different ways to write the vowel /i/ and all instances of double consonants. Therefore, he wrote his own name as , instead of . As written and spoken Dimotiki became standardized over the next few decades, many compromises were made with Katharevousa (as is reflected in contemporary standard Greek) despite the loud objections of Psycharis and the radical \\"psycharist\\" () camp within the proponents of Dimotiki's use. Eventually these ideas of radical demoticism were largely marginalized and when a standardized Dimotiki was made the official language of the Greek state in 1976, the legislation stated that Dimotiki would be used \\"without dialectal and extremist forms\\" ‚Äîan explicit rejection of Psycharis' ideals.

He started as an Olympic sportscaster in the 1960 Olympics held in Rome and continued during the following games: 1964 Tokyo, 1968 Mexico, 1972 Munich y 1976 Montreal. Due to this vast Olympic experience, he was nicknamed \\"El Olimpico\\" (The Olympian). He also was a narrator for the Pan-American Games and for the famous \\"Roller Derby\\" television show (Puerto Rico's Spanish version). Morales was also recognized for giving nicknames to some of Puerto Rico's basketball players. Jos√© Ortiz, for example, was nicknamed \\"El Concorde\\" by Rivera Morales. Mario Morales became \\"El Quijote\\" (was better known by his nickname than by his real name), Jos√© Sosa \\"El Galgo\\" (The Greyhound), Angel \\"Cachorro\\" Santiago \\"El Orgullo del Caserio\\" (The Pride of the Housing Projects), Hector \\"El Mago\\" Blondet (The Magician), Rolando Frazier \\"El Principe\\" (The Prince), Mario Butler \\"El Expreso Paname√±o\\" (The Panamanian Express), Ruben Rodriguez \\"Sharp Shooter\\", and Mart√≠n Ansa got the nickname \\"El Se√±or\\" from Morales. During the 1970s and 1980s, local laws established that boxing fights held in Puerto Rico could not be transmitted live on television; this to encourage fans to pay tickets to see the fights live. They were, however, transmitted live by radio, and Rivera Morales also became a well-known boxing commentator on the Puerto Rican radio stations. In the 1970s he also announced professional wrestling. Some phrases popularized by Manuel Rivera Morales include: \\\\- \\"¬°Apuntenlo!!\\" (score it!!) - His trademark phrase, and a reminder to the radio crew's scorer to write down the latest successful two-point basket. \\\\- \\"¬°Manos Arriba!! Manos Arriba!\\" (Hands up! Hands up!) After a three-point shot had been made, alluding to the gesture that basketball referees do after a three-point basket. \\\\- \\"¬°Que juego se√±ores... que juego!\\" (What a great game gentlemen... what a great game.) \\\\- \\"¬°Me va a poner a gozar... y me puso a gozar!\\" (He's going to make me enjoy... he made me enjoy.) Referring to a dunk. \\\\- \\"Yo lo conozco... va a tirar...\\" (I know him... he's going to shoot.) Anticipating a play. \\\\- \\"¬°Miralooooooooo!\\" (Look at him.) Anticipating a basket. \\\\- \\"¬°Ay√∫danos, divina Pastora, a salir de aqui con vida!\\" (Help us, \\"Divine Shepherdess\\", to get out of here alive!!) A religious imploration used by him in a playfull tone when a basketball game was close enough for the visiting team to steal a win during the closing minutes, he also used this phrase when the visiting team's lead was deemed as too large to overcome with a short time left in the game. \\\\- \\"Wonderful!!\\" \\\\- \\"¬°Sensacional!\\" (Sensational) He'd say this after an impressive play. \\\\- \\"Mi abuela dec√≠a: '¬°Son de goma, Manolo, son de goma!'\\" (My grandma used to say: \\"they're made out of rubber, Manolo, they're made out of rubber\\"!) - Said after a player fell dramatically and recuperated quickly. \\\\- \\"¬°Wes... Wes... Wes... WES!!\\" -Whenever local (and later international) player Wesley Correa charged to the basket. \\\\- \\"¬°Este juego es no apto para cardiacos!\\" (This game is not suitable for cardiac patients!) - Said during close games, particularly those that ended up in overtime (at a particular one that had five OT's he almost had a cardiac incident himself).http://www.lexjuris.com/lexlex/ley1998/LEX98228.htm See also *Ernesto Diaz Gonzalez *Junior Abrams *List of Puerto Ricans References Category:Sports commentators Category:Puerto Rican journalists Category:People from Trujillo Alto, Puerto Rico Category:Professional wrestling announcers Category:1923 births Category:2000 deaths Category:20th-century journalists ","title":"Manolo Rivera Morales"},{"id":"429331","text":"HMAS Shoalhaven (K535/M535/F535), named for the Shoalhaven River in New South Wales, was a laid down by Walkers Limited at Maryborough, Queensland, on 18 December 1943, launched on 14 December 1944 by Senator Dorothy Tangney and commissioned at Urangan Pier in Hervey Bay in Queensland on 2 May 1946.

Mount Bromo (), is an active volcano and part of the Tengger massif, in East Java, Indonesia. At it is not the highest peak of the massif, but is the best known. The massif area is one of the most visited tourist attractions in East Java, Indonesia. The volcano belongs to the Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park. The name of Bromo derived from Javanese pronunciation of Brahma, the Hindu creator god. Mount Bromo sits in the middle of a plain called the \\"Sea of Sand\\" ( or ), a protected nature reserve since 1919. The typical way to visit Mount Bromo is from the nearby mountain village of Cemoro Lawang. From there it is possible to walk to the volcano in about 45 minutes, but it is also possible to take an organised jeep tour, which includes a stop at the viewpoint on Mount Penanjakan () (). The viewpoint on Mount Penanjakan can also be reached on foot in about two hours. Depending on the degree of volcanic activity, the Indonesian Centre for Volcanology and Disaster Hazard Mitigation sometimes issues warnings against visiting Mount Bromo. Activity= 2004 eruptions  Mount Bromo erupted in 2004. That eruptive episode led to the death of two people who had been hit by rocks from the explosion.  2010 eruptions  On Tuesday, 23 November 2010, 16.30 WIB (Western Indonesian Time), the Indonesian Centre of Vulcanology and Geology Hazard Mitigation (CVGHM) confirmed the activity status of Mount Bromo at \\"alert\\" due to increasing tremor activity and shallow volcanic earthquakes at the mountain. Concerns were raised that a volcanic eruption might be likely to occur. As a precaution local residents and tourists were instructed to remain clear of an area within a radius of three kilometers from the caldera and refugee encampments were erected. The area surrounding the Teggera caldera of Bromo remained off-limits for visitors throughout the remainder of 2010. Bromo started to violently erupt ash on Friday 26 November 2010. On 29 November 2010 Transport Ministry spokesman Bambang Ervan announced that Malang's domestic airport would be closed until 4 December 2010. Malang is a city of about 800,000 people is about 25 km (16 mi) west of Mount Bromo. Abdul Rachman Saleh Airport normally handles 10 daily domestic flights from the capital Jakarta. Government volcanologist Surono reported that the volcano was spitting columns of ash some 700 meters (2,300 feet) into the sky.  2011 eruptions  thumbBromo eruption January 22, 2011 at 5:30 am (Bromo volcano crater itself is not visible) The Tengger Caldera was still active in late January 2011, the activity being characterised by fluctuating ongoing eruptions. On 23 January 2011 the Indonesian Centre for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation (CVGHM; Pusat Vulkanologi dan Mitigasi Bencana Geologi) reported that since 19 December 2010 volcanic ash and incandescent material had been thrown up by eruptive activity resulting in a heavy rain of material that fell around the crater. Continuous eruptions on 21 January caused a thin ash fall mainly in the village areas of Ngadirejo and Sukapura Wonokerto in Probolinggo district. The impact of a heavy rain of volcanic ash from eruptions since 19 December 2010 resulted in disruption of normal activities. By early 2011 concerns were being raised about the effect upon the local economy and the potential for long-term environmental and health problems amongst the residents in the locality surrounding Mount Bromo. Due to high seasonal rainfall in January 2011 the potential for lahar and lava flow was raised due to the deposits of volcanic ash, sand and other ejected material that had built up. Seismic activity was dominated by tremor vibration and reports of visual intensity and sounds of eruption continued to be reported from the mountain monitoring facility, Bromo Observation Post. People living on the banks of the Perahu Ravine, Nganten Ravine and Sukapura River were alerted to the possibility of lava flows, especially when it was raining heavily in the area around Cemorolawang, Ngadisari and Ngadirejo. Eruptions and volcanic tremors were reported on 21 January and 22 January with activity subsiding on 23 January 2011. On 23 January 2011 at 6:00 am the alert status at Mount Bromo remained at Level III. On 23 January 2011 an exclusion zone was recommended for communities living around Mount Bromo. Tourists and hikers were advised to not come within a radius of 2 km from the active crater. CVGHM stated that they expected warning signs to be installed stating the limit radius of 2 km from the crater. Operational caution was recommended for flights into and leaving Juanda International Airport IATA:SUB in Surabaya. CVGHM recommended the establishment of public areas for the provision of face masks and eye protection. CVGHM also issued a warning to residents to be cautious of ash buildup on roofs and other places that may give cause for collapse under the burden of ash. Further eruptions and the issuing of aviation ash advisories on 27 January and 28 January 2011 led to concerns being raised regarding a volcanic ash plume, reported to be drifting eastward toward the air corridors used to access the Ngurah Rai International Airport IATA:DPS in Bali. Airport official Sherly Yunita was reported at the time as stating that concerns about visibility had prompted Singapore Airlines, Jetstar-ValueAir, Air France-KLM, Virgin Blue and Cathay Pacific to cancel several flights to Bali, to the east. SilkAir also cancelled flights on the 27 January between Singapore and Lombok, an island to the east of Bali. The Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre in Darwin, Australia released several Code Red Aviation Ash Advisories pertaining to Mount Bromo (Tengger Caldera), on 27 January. They indicated that ash was observed at altitudes up to 18,000 ft (FL180) extending 200 nautical miles to the south east of the caldera. In other ash advisories of that day the cloud was reported as at times having a 10 km/h drift, both to the east and to the south east. Deformation-late November 2010-late January 2011 The Indonesian Centre for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation (CVGHM) reported on 13 January 2011, that deformation using tiltmeter measurements indicated an inflation at rate of 5 micro radians between 25 November 2010 and 14 December 2010 and a relatively stable since 15 December 2010 both on Radial Components and Tangential Components. Deformation measurement using electronic distance measurement equipment compared observations at designated measuring points; POS-BRO, POS-KUR and POS-BAT during the period 25 November 2010 ‚Äì 20 December 2010 with observations from the period 21 December 2010 ‚Äì 30 December 2010 indicated the shortening of the distance from the POS-BAT, or inflation. Observations between 30 December 2010 to 23 January 2011 were reported as relatively stable. 2015 eruption Mount Bromo showed signs of increasing activity beginning in 4th Dec 2015, when the amount of smoke coming out of the crater intensified. By late November Mount Bromo began to eject ashes into the air. Indonesian Volcano Monitoring Bureau (PVBMG) issued a warning that forbade people from climbing Mount Bromo. Later the warning was extended into a 1 km exclusion zone, before eventually extended into wider range which virtually barred visitors from coming down into the caldera floor, which is popularly known as Sandsea. Culture Pura Luhur Poten. On the fourteenth day of the Hindu festival of Yadnya Kasada, the Tenggerese people of Probolinggo, East Java, travel up the mountain in order to make offerings of fruit, rice, vegetables, flowers and sacrifices of livestock to the mountain gods by throwing them into the caldera of the volcano. The origin of the ritual lies in the 15th century legend. On the sand plain, locally called Segara Wedi (lit. sand ocean), sits a Hindu temple called Pura Luhur Poten. The temple holds a significant importance to the Tenggerese scattered across the mountain villages, such as Ngadisari, Wonokitri, Ngadas, Argosari, Ranu Prani, Ledok Ombo and Wonokerso. The temple organises the annual Yadnya Kasada ceremony which lasts for about one month. The major difference between this temple and Balinese ones are the type of stones and building materials. Pura Luhur Poten uses natural black stones from volcanoes nearby, while Balinese temples are mostly made from red bricks. Inside this pura, there are several buildings and enclosures aligned in a mandala zone composition.

Built by Cockatoo Docks & Engineering Company in Sydney, Australia, during the 1980s, she is the only ship of the class to be constructed outside France, and the only one to not originally serve in the Marine Nationale (French Navy). The ship was part of the Australian contribution to the 1991 Gulf War, and was deployed to East Timor in response to incidents in 1999 and 2006. The ship was fitted with a double hull during the first half of 2011, to meet International Maritime Organization standards. Success was decommissioned at Fleet Base East on 29 June 2019, after 33 years of service, and towed to Port Pirie for scrapping in August 2019. Construction Seeing a need to replace the ageing oiler HMAS Supply (AO 195), the RAN placed an order in 1971 for a combat support ship-a replenishment vessel capable of supplying ammunition and stores in addition to fuel-to be named HMAS Protector.Jones, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 221 However, concerns about the cost of construction prompted the order's cancellation in 1974. Instead, the Directions Techniques Des Constructions Navales was approached about constructing a Durance-class replenishment oiler for the RAN, and a design contract was awarded to the Government of France in 1977. The $68.4 million (in 1978 prices) construction contract was awarded to Vickers Cockatoo Dockyard in October 1979, with ship delivery by 31 July 1983.

Fuel and liquid stores can be transferred from four points (two on each side), allowing Success to replenish two ships simultaneously, while solid cargo can be moved via vertical replenishment (with a hangar and helipad for a single Sea King, Seahawk, or Squirrel helicopter), or by boat (the RAN LCVP T 7 is carried on a starboard FWD davit). The ship is armed with seven 12.7 mm machine guns, and is fitted for but not with a Mark 15 Phalanx CIWS. The sensor suite includes two Kelvin Hughes Type 100G navigation radars. Ship's company is made up of 25 officers and 212 sailors. Success was laid down by Cockatoo Docks & Engineering Company at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard in Sydney on 9 August 1980. She was launched on 3 March 1984, and commissioned into the RAN on 23 April 1986. Success is the largest ship to ever be built in Australia for the RAN, and is the largest ship to be built in Port Jackson (the port of Sydney).Royal Australian Navy, HMAS Success (II) She was also the last major vessel to be constructed at Cockatoo Island Dockyard. In June 1983 the contract were renegotiated while construction was underway, with the acceptance date being extended by three years and the project cost increased to $187.3 million. The cost and time overruns were primarily due to protracted dispute between the Commonwealth and the builder over the drawings and specifications received from France, with evidence that the Department of Defence underestimated the extent of the differences between the original Australian building specifications and those supplied. Additional factors in the time and cost increases were a lack of tradesmen skilled in naval construction, overly bureaucratic management, and low labour productivity. The final project cost was estimated at $197.41 million; the dramatic increase in cost prevented the construction of a planned second ship. Operational history In 1986, Success was part of the multi-national fleet that entered Sydney Harbour to mark the 75th anniversary of the RAN. Prior to the ceremonial entry, Success and two other replenishment ships (one United States Navy, one Royal Navy) were tasked with replenishing the assembled fleet: a competition between the three ships saw Success replenish more vessels than the other two. Port quarter view of Success, showing the ship's helicopter hangar and an embarked Sea King helicopter Success formed part of the Australian contribution to the 1991 Gulf War. The ship was deployed to East Timor as part of the Australian-led INTERFET peacekeeping taskforce from 19 September to 28 October 1999. Although not recognised at the time, an overhaul of the RAN battle honours system, completed in March 2010, saw Success granted the honours \\"Kuwait 1991\\" and \\"East Timor 1999\\" for these deployments. In 2005, Success was one of several Australian warships to participate in Exercise Talisman Sabre 2005, a series of joint RAN-USN war games. During 2006, Success was deployed to East Timor as part of the Australian response to the 2006 East Timorese crisis. In late November 2006, Success was one of three Australian warships sent to Fiji during the leadup to the 2006 coup d'√©tat by Fijian military forces against Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase. Success joined HMA Ships and ; the other two ships having sailed in the first week of November. The three vessels were to be used in the event of an evacuation of Australian citizens and nationals, but not as a military force. The task group was stood down in late December 2006, with all three ships returning to port. On 20 February 2007, Success intercepted a boat carrying 85 Sri Lankan asylum seekers. These were the last asylum seekers to be processed under the Pacific Solution policy before its cancellation. HMAS Success sailing alongside HMAS Tobruk during RIMPAC 08 Success was deployed as part of Operation Resolute for three months in 2008. While assigned to Resolute, the vessel was deployed with several other RAN vessels to take part in RIMPAC 08, a multi-national naval exercise. During RIMPAC, on the night of 23 July, Success completed her 3,000th Replenishment at Sea (RAS) during a dual-replenishment of (port side, 2,999th RAS) and (starboard side, 3,000th RAS). On the morning of 13 March 2009, Success was one of seventeen warships involved in a ceremonial fleet entry and fleet review in Sydney Harbour, the largest collection of RAN ships since the Australian Bicentenary in 1988. The replenishment ship was one of the thirteen vessels involved in the ceremonial entry through Sydney Heads, and anchored in the harbour for the review. In May 2009, while Success was on exercise in South-East Asia, the ship's commanding officer was alerted to an alleged sex gambling game aboard, which challenged male sailors to record their sexual activities with female sailors in a 'ledger', and awarded them prize money based on with whom or where they had sex. This was one of several incidents during the three-month deployment; two bars in Manila were damaged during shore leave, while at another bar in Qingdao, several sailors were involved in a public sex act. Three male sailors were removed from Success when the ship docked in Singapore, and were sent back to Australia to participate in a formal inquiry; this inquiry was found to be flawed because of bias and the denial of support to the three accused, and a second, independent inquiry was set up under former judge Roger Gyles in February 2010. The first part of Gyles' inquiry report was released in February 2011, which stated that there was an entrenched culture of sexual harassment, bullying, and predatory sexual behaviour towards female sailors, coupled with alcohol-fuelled misconduct, particularly amongst the male sailors of the ship's marine engineering department. Gyles found that although the harassment and misconduct had been occurring as early as 2004, failures to respond to earlier complaints led to a breakdown in discipline aboard Success. The former judge was unable to prove the existence of the claimed ledger, but found many of the other claims to be correct, including evidence that male sailors had placed bets around having sex with a particular female sailor. Success entering Sydney Harbour during the 2009 ceremonial fleet entry At the end of 2009, the Department of Defence released a request for tender for modification of Success into a double hull vessel, allowing her to meet International Maritime Organization standards for oil tankers. The tender was awarded to Singapore-based ST Marine (a subsidiary of ST Engineering), with the conversion to be made during 2011. The ship sailed to Singapore in November for a naval exercise, after which she was to enter dock for the 14-week conversion, but problems in the contract delayed the dockyard start date, and Success was ordered back to Sydney, via in Western Australia, so the ship's company could take leave with family while the contract was finalised. Work on the ship started in late December 2010, with the main conversion work completed by the end of April 2011. In May 2011, a civilian contractor working on the ship died after falling overboard. Success left Singapore in late May, and returned to Sydney. Success underwent a major refit for most of 2013. During this time, the Spanish oiler was deployed to Australian waters to operate in support of RAN assets, while providing the opportunity to train Australian personnel on systems similar to those in the Spanish-designed Hobart- and Canberra-class ships being acquired. In October 2013, Success participated in the International Fleet Review 2013 in Sydney. In late 2013, the ship was the testbed for flight trials of the MRH 90 helicopter. In March 2014, Success was deployed to assist in efforts to locate and retrieve possible wreckage from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 that had been detected on satellite images of the southern Indian Ocean. In late November 2014, Success deployed to the Middle East for a six-month period to provide logistic support to coalition naval units as part of Operation Manitou, replacing the Australian frigate usually deployed in the region. In February 2015, Success was awarded the Gloucester Cup for 2014, marking the ship as the most proficient in the RAN for that year. Fate Success in Sydney after being decommissioned and having her hull number painted over The Australian Department of Defence predicted in 2006 that Success would reach the end of her useful operational lifespan sometime between 2015 and 2017. Following her double-hull refit, this was extended to the early 2020s, with the decision on the replacement vessel (acquisition project SEA 1654 Phase 3) to be made between 2016 and 2018, and the new ship in service by 2023.Gillett, Australia's Navy, Part 2, p. 53 The 2013 Defence White Paper stated that the replacement of Success and would be brought forward. As well as building replacement vessels (either in Australia, overseas, or a combination), leasing existing vessels was also to be considered. In June 2014, the Minister for Defence announced that two companies had been invited to a restricted tender competition. Navantia from Spain offered the design, while Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering from Korea proposed a downsized Aegir variant of the Tide-class tanker. The 20,000+ tonne ships will be built overseas, as they will be too large to build in Australian shipyards. In March 2016, the Navantia design was selected. Success completed her final voyage into Sydney Harbour on 16 June 2019. She was decommissioned at Fleet Base East on 29 June 2019. Her scheduled replacement will be , a Supply-class replenishment oiler. This ship is scheduled to enter service in 2020. Success arrived in Port Pirie in early August 2019. The ship will be stripped to the hull by local engineering firm McMahon Services and the hull then moved to Whyalla, to a slipway that was once part of the former shipyards, where it will be broken up for scrap.

It is organized as a bicameral body composed of an upper chamber, the Senate, and a lower chamber, the House of Representatives. Article III, Section 1 of the Florida Constitution, adopted in 1968, defines the role of the legislature and how it is to be constituted. The legislature is composed of 160 state legislators (120 in the House and 40 in the Senate). The primary purpose of the legislature is to enact new laws and amend or repeal existing laws. It meets in the Florida State Capitol building in Tallahassee. Titles Members of the Senate are referred to as senators and members of the House of Representatives are referred to as representatives. Because this shadows the terminology used to describe members of Congress, constituents and the news media, using The Associated Press Stylebook, often refer to legislators as state senators or state representatives to avoid confusion with their federal counterparts. Florida Senate The Senate is the upper house of the state legislature. it consists of 40 members elected from single-member districts. Senators are elected on a partisan basis, typically to four-year staggered terms, with half of the Senate elected every two years. Senate districts are drawn based on population figures from the federal decennial census. In the first election after the redistricting, all seats are up for election. Senators' terms begin immediately upon their election. The Senate Chamber is located in the State Capitol building. As of 2020, Republicans hold the majority in the Senate with 23 seats; Democrats are in the minority with 17 seats. Florida House of Representatives The House of Representatives is the lower house of the state legislature. It consists of 120 members elected from single-member districts, on a partisan basis, to two-year terms. Districts are drawn based on population figures from the federal decennial census. House districts are drawn independently of Senate districts; some representatives have districts that include parts of multiple Senate districts. Representatives' terms begin immediately upon their election. The House of Representatives Chamber is located in the State Capitol building. As of 2020, Republicans hold the majority in the House of Representatives with 71 seats, and Democrats hold 46 seats. Three seats are vacant. Terms Article III, of the Florida Constitution, defines the terms for state legislators. Legislators take office immediately upon election. Senate The Constitution requires state senators from odd-numbered districts to be elected in the years that end in numbers which are multiples of four. Senators from even-numbered districts are required to be elected in even-numbered years the numbers of which are not multiples of four. To reflect the results of the U.S. Census and the redrawing of district boundaries, all seats are up for election in redistricting years, with some terms truncated as a result. Thus, senators in even-numbered districts were elected to two-year terms in 2012 (following the 2010 Census), and senators in odd-numbered districts will be elected to two-year terms in 2022 (following the 2020 Census). All terms were truncated again in 2016, with all 40 Senate seats up for election, due to court-ordered redistricting. House of Representatives Members of the House of Representatives are elected for terms of two years in each even-numbered year. Term limits On November 3, 1992, almost 77 percent of Florida voters backed Amendment 9, the Florida Term Limits Amendment, which amended the State Constitution, to enact eight-year term limits on federal and state officials. Under the amendment, former members can be elected again after a two-year break. In 1995, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states could not enact congressional term limits, but ruled that the state level term limits remain. Qualifications Florida legislators must be at least twenty-one years old, an elector and resident of their district, and must have resided in Florida for at least two years prior to election. Legislative Session Each year during which the Legislature meets constitutes a new Legislative Session. Committee weeks Legislators start Committee activity in September of the year prior to the Regular Legislative Session. Because Florida is a part-time legislature, this is necessary to allow legislators time to work their bills through the Committee process, prior to the Regular Legislative Session. Regular legislative session The Florida Legislature meets in a 60-day Regular Legislative Session each year. Regular Legislative Sessions in odd- numbered years must begin on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in March and on the second Tuesday after the first Monday in January of each even- numbered year. Prior to 1991, the Regular Legislative Session began in April. Senate Joint Resolution 380 (1989) proposed to the voters a Constitutional Amendment (approved November 1990) that shifted the starting date of Regular Legislative Session from April to February. Subsequently, Senate Joint Resolution 2606 (1994) proposed to the voters a Constitutional Amendment (approved November 1994) shifting the start date to March, where it remains. In recent years, the Legislature has opted to start in January in order to allow lawmakers to be home with their families during school spring breaks, and to give more time ahead of the legislative elections in the Fall. Organizational session On the fourteenth day following each General Election, the Legislature meets for an Organizational Session to organize and select officers. Special session Special Legislative Sessions may be called by the Governor, by a joint proclamation of the Senate President and House Speaker, or by a three-fifths vote of all Legislators. During any Special Session the Legislature may only address legislative business that is within the purview of the purpose or purposes stated in the Special Session Proclamation. Powers and process The Florida Legislature is authorized by the Florida Constitution to create and amend the laws of the U.S. state of Florida, subject to the Governor's power to veto legislation. To do so, Legislators propose legislation in the forms of bills drafted by a nonpartisan, professional staff. Successful legislation must undergo Committee review, three readings on the floor of each house, with appropriate voting majorities, as required, and either be signed into law by the Governor or enacted through a veto override approved by two-thirds of the membership of each legislative house. Its statutes, called \\"chapter laws\\" or generically as \\"slip laws\\" when printed separately, are compiled into the Laws of Florida and are called \\"session laws\\". The Florida Statutes are the codified statutory laws of the state. In 2009, legislators filed 2,138 bills for consideration. On average, the Legislature has passed about 300 bills into law annually. In 2013, the legislature filed about 2000 bills. About 1000 of these are \\"member bills.\\" The remainder are bills by committees responsible for certain functions, such as budget. In 2016, about 15% of the bills were passed. In 2017, 1,885 lobbyists registered to represent 3,724 entities. The Legislature also has the power to propose Amendments to the Florida Constitution. Leadership The House of Representatives is headed by the Speaker of the House, while the Senate is headed by the Senate President. The House Speaker and Senate President control the assignment of committees and leadership positions, along with control of the agenda in their chambers. The two leaders, along with the Governor of Florida, control most of the agenda of state business in Florida. *President of the Senate: Bill Galvano (R) *President Pro Tempore of the Florida Senate: David Simmons (R) *Majority Leader of the Florida Senate: Kathleen Passidomo (R) *Minority Leader of the Florida Senate: Audrey Gibson (D) *Speaker of the Florida House: Jos√© R.

It was a modification of the Pratt & Whitney J52 turbojet engine which powered the US Navy A-6 Intruder attack aircraft. The Volvo RM8 is an afterburning version that was license-built in Sweden for the Saab 37 Viggen fighter. Pratt & Whitney also sells static versions for powerplant and ship propulsion as the FT8. Design The JT8D is an axial-flow front turbofan engine incorporating dual-spool design. There are two coaxially- mounted independent rotating assemblies: one rotating assembly for the low pressure compressor (LPC) which consists of the first six stages (i.e. six pairs of rotating and stator blades, including the first two stages which are for the bypass turbofan), driven by the second (downstream) turbine (which consists of three stages); and a second rotating assembly for the high- pressure compressor (HPC) section, which has seven stages. The high-pressure compressor is driven by the first (upstream) turbine, which has a single stage. The front-mounted bypass fan has two stages. The annular discharge duct for the bypass fan runs along the full length of the engine, so that both the fan air and exhaust gases can exit through the same nozzle. This arrangement allows some noise attenuation, in that the still-hot fast-moving turbine exhaust is shrouded in much-cooler and slower-moving air (from the bypass fan) before interacting with ambient air. Thus the JT8D noise levels were significantly reduced from previous non-turbofan engines, although the low bypass ratio meant that, compared to subsequently developed turbofans, high noise levels were still produced. Eight models comprise the JT8D standard engine family, covering the thrust range from 12,250 to 17,400 pounds-force (62 to 77 kN) and power 727, 737-100/200, and DC-9 aircraft. More than 14,000 JT8D engines have been produced, totaling more than one-half billion hours of service with more than 350 operators making it the most popular of all low- bypass turbofan engines ever produced. Within the fan inlet case, there are anti-icing air bosses and probes to sense the inlet pressure and temperature. Similar units exist throughout the engine to check temperatures and pressures. At the 13th (i.e. the final) compressor stage, air is bled out and used for anti-icing. The amount is controlled by the Pressure Ratio Bleed Control sense signal (PRBC). The diffuser case at the aft end of the compressor houses the 13th stage. Its increasing cross-sectional area allows the compressed air to slow down before entering one of the engine's nine burner cans. Again, there are two bosses to extract 13th stage air for anti-icing, de-icing of fuel, and airframe (cabin pressurization) use. Not all the compressed air enters the burner cans at the fuel-ignition point; some bypasses the can completely and cools the first turbine stage, and some is gradually introduced into the burner can's perimeter in such a way that the burning fuel is held near the can's centerline. There are nine combustion chambers positioned in a can- annular arrangement. Each chamber has three air inlet hole sizes: the smallest is for cooling, the medium is for burning and the large for forming an air blanket. Update programs In response to environmental concerns that began in the 1970s, the company began developing a new version of the engine, the JT8D-200 series.Gunston 2006, p.169. Designed to be quieter, cleaner, more efficient, yet more powerful than earlier models, the -200 Series power-plant was re-engineered with a significantly higher bypass ratio (1.74 to 1) covering the 18,500 to 21,700 pound-force (82 to 97 kN) thrust range and powering the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 series. This increase was achieved by increasing bypass fan diameter from to and reducing fan pressure ratio (from 2.21 to 1.92). Overall engine pressure ratio was also increased from 15.4 to 21.0.Pratt & Whitney website, accessed 14 October 2007 Since entering service in 1980, more than 2,900 of the -200 series engines have been produced. JT8D-219 on the Omega Air Boeing 707RE flight test aircraft at the Mojave Airport The JT8D-217 and -219 engine(s) were tested in 2001 and were deemed suitable replacements for the old TF33 engines on military and commercial aircraft as part of the Super 27 re-engining program. The updated engines offer reduced (Stage-3) noise compliance standards without the need for hush kits, enhanced short field performance, steeper and faster climb rates with roughly a 10% reduction in fuel burn for extended range. Pratt & Whitney, in a joint venture with Seven Q Seven (SQS) and Omega Air, has developed the JT8D-219 as a re-engine powerplant for Boeing 707-based aircraft.Flug Revue, May 12, 2002 Northrop Grumman used the -219 to re-engine one of the United States Air Force's fleet of 19 Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (E-8 Joint STARS) aircraft, which would allow the JSTARS more time on station due to the engine's 17% Re-engining the E-8 JSTARS, May 14, 2008 greater fuel efficiency. NATO plans to re-engine their fleet of E-3 Sentry AWACS aircraft. The -219 is publicized as being half the cost of the competing 707 re-engine powerplant, the CFM International CFM56, for reasons of geometrical and balance similarity to the engine it is replacing and the associated relative up-front wing modification costs of the two choices. The proposed Aerion SBJ supersonic business jet, previously under development, was to use a pair of JT8D-219 engines for sustained supersonic flight.

Note CanadaTV's logo in the lower-right corner, covering up that of USTV. Simultaneous substitution (also known as simsubbing or signal substitution) is a practice mandated by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) requiring broadcast distribution undertakings (BDUs) in Canada to distribute the signal of a local or regional over-the-air station in place of the signal of a foreign or non-local television station (typically one that is affiliated with a U.S. commercial television network such as ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox), when the two stations are broadcasting identical programming simultaneously. The CRTC first introduced the policy in 1972, and it is sometimes erroneously called \\"simulcasting\\", the name of a practice different from simultaneous substitution in that there is no signal replacement. According to the CRTC, the practice of simultaneous substitution is necessary \\"to protect the rights of broadcasters, to enable television stations to draw enough advertising revenue and to keep advertising money in the Canadian market\\". Canadian broadcast networks, which must request each and every substitution on an individual basis, have been criticized for exploiting the regulation and not investing enough money into Canadian content. The most prominent public criticism of simsubs has been centered around the Super Bowl‚Äîthe championship game of the National Football League‚Äîwhich is well known for featuring high-profile commercials on its U.S. broadcast. In 2015, citing the ads as having become an \\"integral part\\" of the broadcast, the CRTC announced that it would implement a policy to prevent broadcasters from requesting simsubs for the game; it was officially implemented prior to Super Bowl LI in 2017. This has faced criticism over the change in policy from the game's rightsholder, CTV owner Bell Media; the company argued that it singled out a specific program for policy in violation of the Broadcasting Act, and devalued its rights to the league. Bell Media subsequently fought this policy in court, and it was overturned by the Supreme Court of Canada on December 19, 2019. History During the 1950s, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) had a monopoly on television broadcasting in Canada (its first television station, CBFT, began operating in Montreal in 1952). In 1960, the Board of Broadcast Governors, the predecessor of the CRTC, began granting licences for commercial stations in order to provide an alternative to the CBC. These broadcasters began operating in 1961, and through international distributors, acquired the domestic broadcast rights to many American television programs. Since about 30% of the Canadian population ‚Äì those who resided close enough to the Canada‚ÄìUS border ‚Äì had access to over-the-air broadcast signals from networks based in both Canada and the United States, they could choose to watch American programs on either a Canadian or an American network. Many of these Canadians chose to watch the American network (either CBS, ABC or NBC) rather than the Canadian networks' broadcasts. Consequently, many Canadian broadcasters began broadcasting programs purchased from American-based broadcast networks before they aired on the American networks to attract more viewers and to earn money from domestic advertising, and some Canadian businesses that advertised on the domestic stations also purchased broadcast time on the American stations that were receivable in the same areas, although federal legislation was eventually passed that limited the tax-deductibility of these purchases. Several of the stations in smaller border markets in the United States openly targeted the larger cities in Canada by getting as close to the border as possible. Examples include most of the stations in the Buffalo, New York television market, which targeted Toronto and the Golden Horseshoe region, and in the most extreme case, Pembina, North Dakota station KCND-TV (channel 12), which was based in a town with fewer than 1,000 residents but made its money by targeting the much larger city of Winnipeg across the border to its north. When cable television began to proliferate across Canada in the early-1970s, viewers far from the Canada‚ÄìUS border began to obtain access to American television services that were once unobtainable. In 1972, in response to pressure from Canadian broadcasters, the CRTC introduced the simultaneous substitution regulation as a method to circumvent diminution of the value of Canadian networks' exclusive broadcast rights to American programs (within three years, KCND was effectively moved to Winnipeg and relicensed as CKND- TV). Through the 1990s, as direct-broadcast satellite television services gained popularity and then were granted licences in Canada, simultaneous substitution became a requirement on these as well. By the late 1990s and early 2000s, the simultaneous substitution regulation had reached its full potential, with Canadian broadcast networks telecasting nearly all of their American programming at the same time as the U.S. network's broadcasts to ensure maximum eligibility to request substitution. Effects The high incidence of simultaneous substitution requests by privately owned Canadian television networks to draw advertising revenue has had profound effects on various spectrums, ranging from Canadian network schedules to portions of programming being lost due to mistimed substitutions. Network schedules Since private Canadian broadcast networks such as CTV, Global, CTV Two and City often rely heavily on American programs, their programming schedules are often effectively dictated by the schedules of corresponding United States network broadcasters. For example, if a U.S. broadcaster moves a series to a new time slot, the Canadian broadcaster that holds domestic rights to carry first-run episodes of that program would need to move its broadcast to correspond with the new time slot if it wished to retain simultaneous substitution rights. Many American networks telecast their most popular programming during prime time, meaning that in order to maximize simsubbing opportunities, Canadian private broadcasters are often unable or unwilling to broadcast their own original programming during these hours. As a result, Canadian content programming is commonly scheduled as a secondary concern, to fill holes where an American program cannot be placed for substitution. This issue has also extended beyond scripted entertainment programming ‚Äì all three major networks in Canada have faced criticism for at least one incident in which the network seemingly deemed a live Canadian news or cultural awards program to be less important than simsubbing an American reality television series: * In 2003, Global flagship station CIII (channel 41) in Toronto) transferred its coverage of the Ontario provincial election to its sister station CHCH (channel 11) in Hamilton, Ontario, to maintain simsubbing rights to an episode of Survivor: Pearl Islands; earlier the same year, the network's Winnipeg station CKND had opted not to produce any coverage of the Manitoba general election at all, instead airing its regularly scheduled prime time line-up. * In 2006, CBC Television received criticism after it announced plans to bump its primary network newscast, The National, to a later time slot one night a week to broadcast the short-lived singing competition series The One: Making a Music Star. * In 2007, CTV was forced to back down on a plan to tape- delay the 2007 Juno Awards to maintain its simsubbing rights to an episode of The Amazing Race. Since 2008, CTVglobemedia (now Bell Media) has held both the exclusive rights to the Canadian Football League and the rights to Sunday afternoon and playoff games of the American National Football League, broadcasting most NFL games on CTV, while relegating CFL games (including the Grey Cup) to cable channel TSN, making CFL games unavailable on broadcast television for the first time in Canadian history. The move was in part due to the desire to gain simsubbing rights over the NFL broadcasts, something that was not necessary for CFL games because, as of 2015, those games are only available on cable television in the United States. Portions of programming lost Due to the high number of simultaneous substitutions requested by Canadian broadcasters, portions of programs are sometimes lost. This may occur for a variety of reasons, including the cable provider erroneously timing the substitution or substituting over the incorrect distant signal, the Canadian broadcaster making a scheduling error when requesting a substitution, the American broadcaster making a last minute change to its schedule, or adverse weather conditions sometimes affecting a Canadian station's local signal. In addition, should a Canadian network interrupt its programming to provide information on a breaking news event while simsubbing an American show, the American program cannot be telecast. With the increasingly common practice of American networks extending programs by one to two minutes into the start of the next hour in order to avoid audience loss, such errors are sometimes unavoidable if the Canadian station is not able to match the altered start time. This slight differentiation in timing between the Canadian and American stations can lead to a short period during which the Canadian viewer is watching the original American station's signal before the Canadian network starts its simsubbing, resulting in the show's jumping back to the start again. This is not a problem for American viewers who choose to watch the same network across time slots, but Canadian viewers could miss critical content. High-definition television High-definition television signals must also be simultaneously substituted, although this only applies if a local over-the- air digital transmitter that broadcasts HD content is receivable in the market served by the local cable provider. Since many broadcasters were only required to convert their main, typically major-market transmitters during the 2011 digital television transition in Canada, this means that HD simsubbing is not currently enforceable in many rural areas. Although the CRTC's policy regarding simultaneous substitutions for high definition broadcasts do not require them to be applied if the quality of the Canadian feed is not equal or better than the American feed, there have been instances in which inferior Canadian feeds were substituted over higher-quality American feeds. In such cases, complaints can be filed to the CRTC, whereas the commission will confer with the applicable BDU and Canadian network about the issue. A partially transparent NBC logo is seen on the left. An opaque, grey CTV Two bug partially covering the NBC logo is seen on the right. On-screen graphics Implementation of simultaneous substitutions can also cause issues involving digital on-screen graphics applied by the originating broadcaster; if a clean feed of the program is not available (particularly for live programming), the Canadian broadcaster will often place their own bug in a different corner of the screen, or not add one at all. CTV and CTV Two occasionally used an opaque logo to cover the logo bugs of US-based networks on simsubbed broadcasts of The View on CTV and The Tonight Show on CTV Two, but have since discontinued this practice. Implementation and exceptions Enforcement, or lack thereof, of the regulations, as well as legal exceptions and simple circumstance, has led to instances where some Canadian cable and satellite subscribers are able to receive the original American channels in Canada without simultaneous substitution. Cable providers with less than 2000 subscribers are not legally required to have simultaneous substitution implemented.http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2014/2014-444.htm section 19 Many viewers in the Greater Toronto Area can pick up American stations from Buffalo, New York, over-the-air, as well as high-definition versions of the stations from both Buffalo and Seattle, Washington, on cable television. Similarly, cable television viewers in Greater Vancouver may receive unmatched HD stations from Detroit, Michigan, and Rochester, New York. However, high- definition feeds are also subject to simsub, and such substitutions began to increase as local broadcasters performed wider deployments of digital terrestrial television.  Rule changes and Super Bowl simsub ban  On January 29, 2015, the CRTC announced changes to the simsub rules as a result of Let's Talk TV, a series of hearings which mulled reforms for the Canadian television industry. While the CRTC did not completely eliminate the simsub rules, \\"despite certain reservations,\\" it did propose that its policies explicitly state that only over-the-air channels may invoke simsubs, and that broadcasters and television providers be accountable for programming lost from improperly implemented simsubs: providers will be required to provide rebates as compensation, and stations could temporarily lose their ability to simsub programming. The CRTC also proposed that, citing viewer complaints over their inability to see what they felt was a \\"integral part\\" of the event, and that many ads were often seen multiple times throughout the game, it would ban the use of simultaneous substitution for the Super Bowl beginning in 2017, thus allowing U.S. feeds of the event and its commercials to co-exist with Canadian simulcasts. However, Bell Media, the current Canadian rightsholder to the Super Bowl through CTV, filed an appeal, arguing that the move would devalue its exclusive broadcast rights to the game, and violates the Broadcasting Act, which forbids the CRTC from making regulations that single out specific programs. The NFL itself has backed Bell Media's complaints. The order implementing these new rules was issued on August 19, 2016. The prohibition only applies to the game itself; the typically extended pre-game and post-game coverage is not covered by the policy, and thus may still be simsubbed by CTV. On November 2, 2016, after being denied an appeal because the CRTC had not yet issued official policy when the suit was filed, Bell was granted the right to appeal the ruling in the Federal Court of Appeal. The telecast of Super Bowl LI was available directly from Fox affiliates carried on pay television in Canada. Michael Geist of the University of Ottawa believed that this decision was a test case for eventually phasing out the simsub rules entirely, arguing that the practice was becoming increasingly irrelevant due to changing viewing habits (such as the consumption of TV content via video-on-demand services rather than linear networks), and that dropping the rules could force domestic broadcasters to make greater investments into original, Canadian content, rather than scheduling it as an afterthought around fluctuating U.S. schedules. On May 18, 2017, the NFL testified to the United States Department of Commerce that the CRTC's August 2016 ruling was a violation of copyright protections under NAFTA. The NFL and BCE continued to fight to overturn this policy in the Federal Court of Appeal. On December 19, 2017, the Federal Court of Appeal dismissed Bell Media's case, ruling that the CRTC's policy was reasonable. Bell Media once again filed for an appeal in January 2018, this time in the Supreme Court of Canada. On May 10, 2018, the Supreme Court of Canada agreed to hear the NFL and Bell's appeal of the Federal Court of Appeal's decision. In an unprecedented step, the top court announced that it intended to use this appeal as an opportunity to revisit the law governing standard of review of administrative tribunals. The appeal was tentatively scheduled to be heard in December 2018. On October 1, 2018, Canada agreed to the United States‚ÄìMexico‚ÄìCanada Agreement. The trade deal, which replaces NAFTA, contains an annexe that would require the CRTC to apply its simsub policies equally across the programming that it covers, and as such, withdraw its policy forbidding simsubs of the Super Bowl. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell had lobbied for the condition, and praised U.S. president Donald Trump after the agreement was announced. Following the announcement of the trade deal, Bell requested that the CRTC withdraw the policy in time for Super Bowl LIII; Bell was denied due to the pending Supreme Court appeals hearing, as well as the fact that the agreement has not yet been ratified. On December 19, 2019, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in favour of Bell Media, arguing that the CRTC overstepped its power under the Broadcasting Act by attempting to \\"impose terms and conditions on the distribution of programming services generally\\". Therefore, Super Bowl LIV in 2020 was subject to simsub. Specific television providers In terms of television providers, the practice of simsubbing is implemented in different ways, depending on the company, especially in the case of satellite providers, which operate on a national basis and not regionally as cable providers do; * Shaw Direct invokes simsubs according to a subscriber's postal code, and is implemented by the receiver's firmware; this method enforces simsubs only in areas where they are legally needed. Beginning in February 2012, however, Shaw Direct began implementing simsubs for the Global network's HD feed (channel 256) for all of their high-definition subscribers, which affects ABC East HD (WXYZ-TV), CBS East HD (WWJ-TV), Fox East HD (WUHF) and NBC East HD (WDIV-TV). It is speculated that this is due to the 2010 purchase of the Global Television Network by Shaw Communications. At first, no other channels were simsubbed; Shaw Direct later began implementing simsubs for City, but it still does not do so for CTV, its main competitor. * Bell Satellite TV invokes simsubs to all subscribers nationwide, implemented by its uplink centre (which also provides services for other service providers); by doing so, simsubs for a particular channel are implemented nationwide, regardless of where the subscriber lives or which feed the subscriber watches. Notably, Bell's feeds also invoked simsubs on network programming being simulcast by specialty channels owned by Bell Media, such as TSN. This has since ceased due to CRTC rules that explicitly forbid this practice. * Similarly, Rogers Cable invoked simsubs on U.S. network affiliates for sports programming simulcast on its Sportsnet specialty channels (such as the 2013 World Series on Fox in lieu of the MLB International feed). Sportsnet has since reverted to using the MLB International feed, tying into the current involvement of Sportsnet personality Buck Martinez (who serves as play-by-play commentator for Sportsnet's regular-season broadcasts of the Toronto Blue Jays). Other uses Although simultaneous substitution was conceived to substitute the signal of a foreign station, the practice has been applied as well to substitute the signal of an out-of-market Canadian station in a given market. For example, in Montreal, the signal of Ottawa station CJOH-DT (channel 13) has frequently been substituted by the signal of locally based CFCF-DT (channel 12), even though both stations are part of the CTV network. Another example, Bell Aliant Fibe TV subscribers in Newfoundland and Labrador regularly have Global Television Network stations in Halifax and Toronto (and, very rarely, Vancouver) simsubbed with NTV; Maritime Fibe subscribers, however, often have NTV simsubbed with Global Halifax or New Brunswick, depending on where they live. Simultaneous substitution has also been implemented on French language television stations. From the 1970s to the mid-1990s, TVA's flagship Montreal station CFTM-TV (channel 10) had its signal substituting that of its Sherbrooke sister station CHLT-TV (channel 7) (which was receivable in the Montreal area through 1995).

Barnwell was born in Beaufort, South Carolina. His education was by a private tutor after he had exhausted the resources of the Beaufort common school. But he interrupted this and entered the revolutionary war at the age of 16 as a private in the militia. In the maneuvering after the Battle of Stono Ferry, his company was camped on Johns Island in late June 1779. A British surprise attack at night cut them up badly in an action known as the Battle of Mathews' Plantation. The sixteen-year-old Barnwell was wounded so badly that they stripped his gear and left him for dead. He was found in the field by a slave and taken to his aunt (Mrs. Sarah Gibbes) on her nearby plantation. She and her daughter nursed him back to health.  Revolutionary War  He returned to duty, rejoining the militia the next spring as a lieutenant. He was just in time to be included with the prisoners when General Benjamin Lincoln surrendered Charleston on May 12, 1780. He was imprisoned on the transport ship Pack Horse until his exchange in June 1781. He returned to militia service, and by the end of the war had risen to lieutenant colonel.  Political career  Back home in Beaufort, Barnwell was elected to the South Carolina house of representatives for 1787-1788. He was a delegate representing South Carolina in the Confederation Congress in 1788 and 1789. He was returned to the state house for terms in 1790-1791, and 1794‚Äì1801, and in 1795 he served as speaker of that house. In the spring of 1788 Robert was a delegate to South Carolina convention that ratified the United States Constitution. He was elected to one term in the U.S. House (1791‚Äì1793) for an at-large seat, but declined to run again. Beginning in 1795 he was the chair of the board of trustees for the new Beaufort College, and held that position for many years. He was elected to the state senate for 1805‚Äì1806, and was president of that body in 1805. He died in Beaufort and is buried there in the churchyard of the St. Helena Episcopal Church. His son, Robert Woodward Barnwell, was a Senator in both the United States Senate and the Confederate Senate. References *Marquis Who's Who, Inc. Who Was Who in American History, the Military.

He began his playing career in 1859, before the advent of organized leagues and paid professionalism, and continued to play regularly until 1886, when he was 43. Start's career spanned countless innovations that transformed the game in fundamental ways, but he adjusted and continued to play at a high level for almost three decades. Amateur era The New York City-born Start played first base for the Enterprise Club of Brooklyn in 1860, before the advent of salaried professionalism. The following year he joined the powerful Atlantic Club of Brooklyn, with whom he would remain through the 1870 season. The Atlantics were undefeated in 1864 and 1865. Start made a pivotal contribution to one of the most celebrated games of the Amateur Era (although by the late 1860s it was common knowledge that many top-tier players were being paid). The Cincinnati Red Stockings had 81 consecutive wins over two seasons when they faced off against the Atlantics on June 14, 1870, at the Capitoline Grounds in Brooklyn. After nine innings, the game was tied 5-5. The umpire ordered the teams to continue playing until the game was decided. In the top of the 11th, Cincinnati scored twice to take the lead, 7-5. In the bottom of the 11th, Atlantics third baseman Charlie Smith singled. Start then hit a booming triple, driving in Smith. Catcher Bob Ferguson drove in Start with a single to tie the game 7-7. Ferguson scored the winning run on a throwing error by Cincinnati shortstop George Wright on a hard-hit grounder by George Hall, ending the Red Stockings' legendary winning streak.Gilbert, Thomas W., How Baseball Happened (David R. Godine Publisher, 2020) Professional era In 1871, he joined the new National Association's New York Mutuals, hitting a career-high .360 in his first season with the team, when he was age 28. When the National League was formed in 1876, the Mutuals joined, bringing Start with them. After spending 1877 with the Hartford Dark Blues and 1878 with the Chicago White Stockings. 1878 was possibly Start's best season with the bat. He led the league with 100 hits and 125 total bases. He came close to the league lead with 12 doubles, 5 triples, and one home run. His 58 runs that year were second in the league. These statistics came in only 285 at bats, and at the age of 35, long after most players have begun to decline. From 1879 until 1885, when he was 42, Start held down first base for the Providence Grays and continued to hit well; he also served as team captain,Karmik, Thom, ‚ÄúSweeney Was Drunk, But I Didn‚Äôt Know It‚Äù, Baseball History Daily a role that provided field leadership before the establishment of team managers. Start's 1879 Providence team won the National League flag, and in 1884 they won what is considered the first inter- league championship, beating the New York Metropolitans of the American Association. Unfortunately, 1885 was Providence's last season in the NL, so in 1886, he moved to the Washington Nationals for what would be his final season. Start only played 31 games for the Nationals, did not hit well, and retired from professional play. After this final sub-par season, his lifetime Major League batting average dipped below .300, to .299. For the final nine seasons of Start's career, he was the oldest player on any major league roster. Over his full major league career Start amassed 1,418 hits, 854 runs, and 544 RBI in National League and National Association play. He logged a .299 batting average, a .322 on-base percentage, and a .367 slugging percentage. These totals do not include his first twelve pre-league years, during which cumulative player statistics were not recorded. In addition, since Start's lifetime totals were achieved in much shorter seasons than today's professionals play, they tend to under-represent his sustained quality as a ballplayer. In his final major league season, while playing for the Washington Nationals, one of Start's teammates was a 23-year-old rookie catcher named Connie Mack, who was at the beginning of a 64-year-career in the major leagues.Connie Mack lifetime player stats at Baseball-Reference.com Legacy In the SABR Nineteenth Century Committee's Nineteen Century Notes (Summer 2018), baseball historian Bill Ryczek wrote: \\"There have been a number of 20th-century players who had long careers, but the game that Tommy John played during his [1963] rookie year was very much like the game he played during his final season in 1989. When 16-year-old Joe Start began playing in 1859, pitchers threw underhand with a stiff wrist from behind a line 45 feet from home plate, a fly ball caught on one bounce was an out, and gloves were unheard of, as were professional ballplayers. During his final season, pitchers threw over-hand or sidearm with velocity that was unimaginable in 1859. The one-bounce out was 20 years in the grave, and most players wore fielding gloves. All of the top players were professionals, and baseball had become big business, far removed from the amateur affair of 1859. Despite the dramatic changes in the game of baseball, Joe Start remained a steady, productive player, adapting to the changes as quickly as they appeared. He was a regular until his final year.\\"Ryczek, William, \\"My Favorite Nineteenth Century Player: Joe Start,\\" Nineteenth Century Notes, Society of American Baseball Research 19th Century Committee, Summer 2018 Writing at 19cBaseball.com, early game historian Eric Miklich asserted that \\"Start was reported to be an excellent fielder and may have been the first first baseman to play off of the bag when not receiving a throw, enabling him to increase the area of the infield that he covered. At that time first basemen played close to or on top of the base, waiting to take throws from the infielders.\\" Although born in an era when baseball was a gentleman's leisure pursuit, had no press coverage, and was unknown outside of New York City, Start lived long enough to see the worldwide popularity of slugger Babe Ruth's exploits during the 1920s. Post-baseball life After his retirement from the game, Start returned to Rhode Island and operated the Lakewood Inn in Warwick. His wife, Angeline, died in February, 1927, and Start died one month later, in Providence, Rhode Island, at age 84.Miklich, Eric, \\"Joe Start, 1842-1927\\", 19cBaseball.com, 2016 External linksReferences Category:Major League Baseball first basemen Category:Brooklyn Enterprise players Category:Brooklyn Atlantics (NABBP) players Category:Hartford Dark Blues players Category:New York Mutuals players Category:Chicago White Stockings players Category:Providence Grays players Category:New York Mutuals managers Category:Baseball players from New York (state) Category:Baseball player- managers Category:19th-century baseball players Category:1842 births Category:1927 deaths ","title":"Joe Start"},{"id":"429370","text":"Thomas Simpson, or Sympson the Joiner (fl. 1660s) was a Master-Joiner at the Deptford Dockyard and the Royal Naval Dockyard at Woolwich in London. Samuel Pepys mentions his name several times in his diary. Pepys' job as a naval administrator brought him into daily contact with the naval dockyards and he was responsible for various aspects of their administration. Although the diary explicitly notes that Pepys was paying him handsomely, it is probable that Simpson was working for Pepys instead of working on the interiors of warships. In the 17th century, a \\"joiner\\" built furniture out of frame-and- panel construction, a refined version of the techniques that were also used to frame up doors and for the panelling of rooms, while a \\"cabinet-maker\\" built furniture with flush surfaces suitable for veneers or marquetry, assembled using dovetails. The two trades were quite distinct, and for the fitting out of Royal Navy ships the services of a joiner would have been much more appropriate. Pepys' diary records that he used Simpson's services on several occasions to work on improvements for his office and his home in Seething Lane, London. For example, on 14 August 1668 he wrote: \\"At home I find Simpson putting up my new chimney-piece in our great chamber which is very fine, but will cost a great deal of money, but it is not flung away\\". Of special interest is the fact that Pepys had Simpson build bookcases, or as Pepys called them 'book presses', for his growing collection of books. These are now preserved at the Pepys Library at Magdalene College in accordance with the stipulations of Pepys's will. Pepys wrote on 17 August 1667 : So took up my wife and home, there I to the office, and thence with Simpson, the joyner home to put together the press he hath brought me for my books this day, which pleases me exceedingly. and a few days later : and then comes Simpson to set up my other new presses for my books, and so he and I fell into the furnishing of my new closett ... so I think it will be as noble a closett as any man hath. The surviving book presses have paired glazed doors each in 21 small panes, over a low section, also with glazed panes, made to hold large folio volumes. The doors of the lower section slide up and down, and can be removed completely. The base moldings and cornices are finely and robustly carved with acanthus leaf. Such tall book presses with glazed-panel doors were a contemporary innovation. Pepys began with one book press and eventually reached twelve as his collection of books grew.

Since receiving his PhD degree on the foundations of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity at the University of Cologne in 1968, Barbour has supported himself and his family without an academic position, working part-time as a translator. He resides near Banbury, England. Timeless physics His 1999 book The End of Time advances timeless physics: the controversial view that time, as we perceive it, does not exist as anything other than an illusion, and that a number of problems in physical theory arise from assuming that it does exist. He argues that we have no evidence of the past other than our memory of it, and no evidence of the future other than our belief in it. \\"Change merely creates an illusion of time, with each individual moment existing in its own right, complete and whole.\\" He calls these moments \\"Nows\\". It is all an illusion: there is no motion and no change. He argues that the illusion of time is what we interpret through what he calls \\"time capsules\\", which are \\"any fixed pattern that creates or encodes the appearance of motion, change or history\\". Barbour's theory goes further in scepticism than the block universe theory, since it denies not only the passage of time, but the existence of an external dimension of time. Physics orders \\"Nows\\" by their inherent similarity to each other. That ordering is what we conventionally call a time ordering, but does not come about from \\"Nows\\" occurring at specific times, since they do not occur, nor does it come about from their existing unchangingly along the time axis of a block universe, but it is rather derived from their actual content. The philosopher J. M. E. McTaggart reached a similar conclusion in his 1908 \\"The Unreality of Time.\\" Machian dynamics Barbour also researches Machian physics, a related field. The Machian approach requires physics to be constructed from directly observable quantities. In standard analytical dynamics a system's future evolution can be determined from a state consisting of particle positions and momenta (or instantaneous velocities). Barbour believes that the Machian approach eschews the momenta/instantaneous velocities, which are not directly observable, and so needs more than one \\"snapshot\\" consisting of positions only.Nature of Time This relates to the idea of snapshots, or \\"Nows\\" in Barbour's thinking on time.It is utterly beyond our power to measure the changes of things by time ... time is an abstraction at which we arrive by means of the changes of things; made because we are not restricted to any one definite measure, all being interconnected. Mach himself was a sceptic about time: \\"It is utterly beyond our power to measure the changes of things by time ... time is an abstraction at which we arrive by means of the changes of things; made because we are not restricted to any one definite measure, all being interconnected.\\" Along with physicist Bruno Bertotti, Barbour developed a technique called \\"best matching\\" for deriving gravitational equations directly from astronomical measurements of objects' spatial relations with each other. Published in 1982, the method describes gravitational effects as accurately as Einstein's general relativity, but without the need for a \\"background\\" grid of spacetime. According to physicist David Wiltshire at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, such a truly Machian or relational approach could explain the appearance of an accelerated expansion of the universe without invoking a causative agent such as dark energy. Criticism of Barbour's ideas Theoretical physicist Lee Smolin repeatedly refers to Barbour's ideas in his books. However Smolin is usually highly critical of Barbour's ideas, since Smolin is a proponent of a realist theory of time, where time is real and not a mere illusion as Barbour suggests.Smolin L., (1997) Three Roads to Quantum Gravity (pp. 119‚Äì121, 131); (2006) The Trouble with Physics (pp. 321‚Äì22); (2013) Time Reborn (pp. 92‚Äì5) Smolin reasons that physicists have improperly rejected the reality of time because they confuse their mathematical models‚Äîwhich are timeless but deal in abstractions that do not exist‚Äîwith reality. Smolin hypothesizes instead that the very laws of physics are not fixed, but that they actually evolve over time. Theoretical physicist Sean Carroll has criticised Barbour and all physicists who adhere to a \\"timeless- view\\" of the universe: > The problem is not that I disagree with the timelessness crowd, it‚Äôs that I > don‚Äôt see the point. I am not motivated to make the effort to carefully read > what they are writing, because I am very unclear about what is to be gained > by doing so. If anyone could spell out straightforwardly what I might be > able to understand by thinking of the world in the language of timelessness, > I‚Äôd be very happy to re-orient my attitude and take these works seriously.

The name is derived from the red spot at the base of the bill that is found in the mainland Indian population. When in water it can be recognized from a long distance by the white tertials that form a stripe on the side, and in flight it is distinguished by the green speculum with a broad white band at the base. This species and the eastern spot-billed duck (A. zonorhyncha) were formerly considered conspecific, together called the spot- billed duck (A. poecilorhyncha). Taxonomy White tertials are distinctive at a distance The Indian spot-billed duck was described by the naturalist Johann Reinhold Forster in 1781 under its current binomial name Anas poecilorhyncha. The name of the genus Anas is the Latin word for a duck. The specific epithet poecilorhyncha combines the classical Greek words poikilos meaning \\"pied\\" or \\"spotted\\" and rhunkhos meaning a \\"bill\\". A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2009 that compared mitochondrial DNA sequences from ducks, geese and swans in the family Anatidae found that the Indian spot- billed duck was a sister species to a clade containing the Mexican duck, the American black duck, the mottled duck and the mallard. A 2014 study, however, shows that there is discordance between the phylogenies obtained using nuclear DNA sequences; the Indian spot-bill appears to be closer to the Laysan and Hawaiian ducks and forming a sister clade to the New World and Old World mallards and the Mexican, American black and mottled ducks. There is significant hybridization between Old World mallards and eastern spot-billed ducks, leading to a closeness in their mitochondrial DNA that alters the apparent phylogenies. Two subspecies are recognised although intergradation is possible (intermediates between haringtoni and eastern spot-billed duck have been recorded): * A. p. poecilorhyncha Forster, 1781 ‚Äì India and Sri Lanka * A. p. haringtoni (Oates, 1907) ‚Äì Myanmar to southern China and Laos (named after Herbert Hastings Harington (1868‚Äì1916)) The eastern spot-billed duck was formerly considered as a third subspecies. Fieldwork carried out at Hong Kong in southern China and published in 2006 found that although both the eastern spot-billed duck and the Indian spot-billed duck (subspecies A. p. haringtoni) bred in the region at the same time, mixed pairs were only very rarely observed. Based on this observation most taxonomists now treat the eastern spot-billed duck as a separate species. Description Characteristic green speculum with white base and white tertials This duck is around the same size as a mallard and has a scaly patterned body with a green speculum bordered by white. At rest the white stripe stands out and the long neck and the bill with yellow tip and orange red spots at the base are distinctive in the nominate subspecies. The red spots at the base of the bills are absent in haringtoni. It measures in length and across the wings, with a body mass of . These are mainly grey ducks with a paler head and neck and a black bill tipped bright yellow. The wings are whitish with black flight feathers below, and from above show a white-bordered green The male has a red spot on the base of the bill, which is absent or inconspicuous in the smaller but otherwise similar female. The male does not have an eclipse plumage. The legs and feet are bright orange to coral red. Juveniles are browner and duller than adults. The eastern spot- billed duck is darker and browner; its body plumage is more similar to the Pacific black duck. It lacks the red bill spot, and has a blue speculum. Both males and females undergo a complete post-breeding moult, dropping all their wing feathers simultaneously. Distribution  This duck is a resident throughout Pakistan and India in freshwater wetlands. They tend to avoid very large patches of open water and prefer medium-sized wetlands with vegetation cover. Some individuals may however migrate as a bird ringed at Bharatpur in Rajasthan on 5 December 1969 was recovered near Novosibirsk in August 1970. It is quite gregarious outside the breeding season and forms small flocks. The northernmost populations have expanded their range northwards by more than 500 km since the early 20th century, possibly in reaction to global warming. Biology left It is a bird of freshwater lakes and marshes in fairly open country and feeds by dabbling for plant food mainly in the evening or at night. The breeding season varies with rainfall and water condition but is July to September in northern India and November to December in southern India. Multiple broods may be raised. It nests on the ground hidden within in vegetation near water, and lays 8-14 eggs. Nests have sometimes been seen on tree branches covered by creepers. Incubation begins after the last egg is laid (allowing the chicks to hatch simultaneously) and the young hatch after about 24 days. The chicks are black with a yellow back and resemble those of mallards but with a wider eyestripe. With ducklings Both the male and female have calls similar to that of the mallard. Mallards and eastern spot-billed ducks have been known to hybridize in the wild in eastern Russia and their genetic closeness has been examined in many studies. Indian spot-billed ducks feed on plants, including crops such as rice, as well as invertebrates including snails. Through snails such as Lymnaea luteola, they also get infected by cercarian trematodes such as Echinoparyphium bagulai. Adult trematodes emerge from the duck after about 21 days. Other trematodes recorded in the species include Psilochasmus oxyurus while helminths include Opisthorchis obsequens, Notocotylus babai, N. linearis, Echinoparyphium clerci, Amidostomum skrjabini, and Hymenolepis wardlei. left They are seen isolated from other species and usually in pairs or small groups and when disturbed they can take off easily and nearly vertically from the water. They were hunted extensively in British India, noted for their excellent taste. When shot at, especially when in moult, they are known to dive and remain underwater to evade capture. A local name for it was \\"gheret-pai\\" or \\"garam- pai\\". In southern India, a method of hunting involved using floating bundles of rushes on which the hunters lay in wait. Natural predators of the ducks include birds of prey and terrestrial predators including pythons and otters.

On April 26, 2003, during a solo descent of Bluejohn Canyon in southeastern Utah, he dislodged a boulder, pinning his right wrist to the side of the canyon wall. After five days he was able to amputate his arm with a dull pocketknife, make his way through the rest of the canyon, rappel down a drop, and hike to safety. The incident is documented in Ralston's autobiography Between a Rock and a Hard Place and is the subject of the 2010 film 127 Hours where he is portrayed by James Franco. After the accident he continued mountaineering and became the first person to ascend all of Colorado's fourteeners solo in winter. Early life Aron Ralston was born on October 27, 1975 in Marion, Ohio. He and his family moved to Denver when he was 12, where he attended Cherry Creek High School and learned to ski and backpack. He received his college degree from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, finishing with degrees in mechanical engineering and French, with a minor in piano. At Carnegie Mellon, he served as a resident assistant, studied abroad, and was an active intramural sports participant. He also worked as a rafting guide during the summer. Ralston worked as a mechanical engineer with Intel in Ocotillo, Tacoma and Albuquerque for five years, but found himself burned out by working in a large corporation. During his time as an engineer he had built up skills in mountaineering, and in 2002 he quit in order to climb Denali. He moved to Aspen, Colorado in order to pursue a life of climbing mountains. Ralston began working towards his goal of climbing all of Colorado's \\"fourteeners\\" ‚Äî peaks over altitude, of which there are 59 ‚Äî solo and during winter (a feat that had never been recorded before). In 2003, he was caught in a Grade 5 avalanche on Resolution Peak, Colorado with his skiing partners Mark Beverly and Chadwick Spencer. No one was seriously injured, but his friends did not speak to him in the aftermath, causing him to reevaluate his approach to risk management. Canyoneering accident On April 26, 2003, Aron Ralston was canyoneering alone through Bluejohn Canyon, in eastern Wayne County, Utah, just south of the Horseshoe Canyon unit of Canyonlands National Park. While he was descending the lower stretches of the slot canyon, a suspended boulder became dislodged while he was climbing down from it. The boulder first smashed his left hand, and then crushed his right hand against the canyon wall. Ralston had not informed anyone of his hiking plans, nor did he have any way to call for help. Assuming that he would die without intervention, he spent five days slowly sipping his small amount of remaining water, approximately 350 ml (12 imp fl oz), and slowly eating his small amount of food, two burritos, while repeatedly trying to extricate his arm. His efforts were futile as he was unable to free his arm from the 800 lb (360 kg) chockstone. After three days of trying to lift and break the boulder, the dehydrated and delirious Ralston prepared to amputate his trapped arm at a point on the mid-forearm in order to escape. After having experimented with tourniquets and having made exploratory superficial cuts to his forearm, he realized, on the fourth day, that in order to free his arm he would have to cut through the bones in it, but the tools available were insufficient to do so. After running out of food and water on the fifth day, Ralston decided to drink his own urine. He carved his name, date of birth and presumed date of death into the sandstone canyon wall, and videotaped his last goodbyes to his family. He did not expect to survive the night, but as he attempted to stay warm he began hallucinating and had a vision of himself playing with a future child while missing part of his right arm. Ralston credited this as giving him the belief that he would live. After waking at dawn the following day he discovered that his arm had begun to decompose due to the lack of circulation, and became desperate to tear it off. Ralston then had an epiphany that he could break his radius and ulna bones using torque against his trapped arm. He did so, then amputated his forearm with his multi-tool, using the dull two-inch knife and pliers for the tougher tendons. The process took an hour, during which time he used tubing from a CamelBak as a tourniquet, taking care to leave major arteries until last. The manufacturer of the multi-tool was never named, but Ralston said \\"it was not a Leatherman but what you'd get if you bought a $15 flashlight and got a free multi-use tool.\\" After freeing himself, Ralston climbed out of the slot canyon in which he had been trapped, rappelled down a sheer wall, then hiked out of the canyon, all one-handed. He was from his vehicle, and had no phone. However, after of hiking, he encountered a family on vacation from the Netherlands; Eric and Monique Meijer and their son Andy, who gave him food and water and hurried to alert the authorities. Ralston had feared he would bleed to death; he had lost , including 25% of his blood volume. Rescuers searching for Ralston, alerted by his family that he was missing, had narrowed the search down to Canyonlands and he was picked up by a helicopter in a wide area of the canyon. He was rescued approximately four hours after amputating his arm. Ralston later said that if he had amputated his arm earlier, he would have bled to death before being found, while if he had not done it he would have been found dead in the slot canyon days later. His severed hand and forearm were retrieved from under the boulder by park authorities. According to television presenter Tom Brokaw, it took 13 men, a winch and a hydraulic jack to move the boulder so that Ralston's arm could be removed. His arm was then cremated and the ashes given to Ralston. He returned to the accident scene with Tom Brokaw and a camera crew six months later, on his 28th birthday, to film a Dateline NBC special about the accident in which he scattered the ashes of his arm there, where, he said, they belong. After the accident Aspen, in 2009300x300px After the accident occurred, Ralston made numerous appearances in the media. On July 21, 2003, Ralston appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman, and his story was featured by GQ's \\"Men of the Year\\" and Vanity Fair's \\"People of 2003\\". Ralston documented his experience in an autobiographical book titled Between a Rock and a Hard Place, published by Atria Books in September 2004. It reached #3 on The New York Times Hardcover Non-Fiction list. It hit #1 in New Zealand and Australia, and is the #7 best-selling memoir of all-time in the United Kingdom. Later that month, Ralston's story was featured on a two-hour edition of Dateline NBC called \\"Desperate Days in Blue John Canyon\\". Ralston has appeared twice on The Today Show, Good Morning America, and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. He has also appeared on \\"The Howard Stern Show\\", The Ellen DeGeneres Show, CNN's American Morning with Bill Hemmer, Minute to Win It, Anderson Cooper 360¬∞, CNN Saturday Morning, Enough Rope, and CNBC with Deborah Norville. On September 28, 2004, he appeared on the radio program The Bob Rivers Show and described his ordeal as \\"six days of terror and horror.\\" After his recovery he continued to climb mountains, including Aconcagua in 2005, and in 2008, Ojos del Salado in Chile and Monte Pissis in Argentina. In 2005, Ralston became the first person to climb all of the 59 ranked and/or named of Colorado's 'fourteeners' solo in winter, a project he started in 1997 and resumed after the amputation in Bluejohn Canyon. In 2006, Ralston was featured as a panelist in Miller Lite's \\"Man Laws\\" ad campaign. He later noted that surviving being trapped in the canyon had given him a sense of invincibility, at a time that it should have humbled him. He lost friends to suicide, and became depressed after his girlfriend broke up with him in 2006 - he has since tried to shift his focus away from adventure seeking for esteem purposes. In 2008, Ralston signed on to advise polar explorer Eric Larsen on his 2009/2010 \\"Save the Poles\\" expedition, of traveling to the north and south poles, and climbing Mount Everest (sometimes referred to as the third pole) within the same year. In August 2009, Ralston married Jessica Trusty. Their first child was born in February 2010. In 2011, Ralston was a contestant on the U.S. television show Minute To Win It, where he won $125,000 for Wilderness Workshop, made a cameo on The Simpsons in \\"Treehouse of Horror XXII\\",\\"Fox Details ‚ÄòThe Simpsons,‚Äô Oct. 30 Episode: ‚ÄòTreehouse of Horror XXII‚Äô\\" .

He has also appeared on the Comedy Central show Tosh.0 in a sketch with host Daniel Tosh and another climber in 2012. Assault charge In 2013, Ralston and his girlfriend, Vita Shannon, who have a daughter together, were both arrested after an altercation at their home. The circumstances of the altercation are unclear. Charges against Ralston were dropped shortly after, and charges against Shannon were dropped after Ralston did not show up to a court hearing. Public speaking As a corporate speaker, Ralston receives an honorarium of about $25,000 per domestic speaking appearance, and up to $37,000 for international speeches.Pushing the Limit NY Times, March 31, 2009 On May 4, 2007, Ralston appeared at the Swiss Economic Forum and gave a speech about \\"how he did not lose his hand, but gained his life back.\\" Ralston at the Toronto premiere of 127 Hours 127 Hours British film director Danny Boyle directed the film 127 Hours about Ralston's accident. Filming took place in March and April 2010, with a release in New York City and Los Angeles on November 5, 2010. Fox Searchlight Pictures funded the film. Actor James Franco played the role of Ralston. The movie received standing ovations at both the Telluride Film Festival and the Toronto International Film Festival. Some of the audience members in Toronto fainted during the final amputation scene. The film received widespread acclaim by critics and review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 93% of 226 professional critics have given the film a positive review, with an average rating of 8.3/10. At the 83rd Academy Awards in 2011 the film was nominated for six Oscars, including Best Picture (won by The King's Speech) and Best Actor for Franco (won by Colin Firth for his role in The King's Speech). 127 Hours was also nominated in the categories for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Original Score, Best Original Song, and Best Editing. Of the authenticity of 127 Hours, Ralston has said that the film is \\"so factually accurate it is as close to a documentary as you can get and still be a drama,\\" and he jokingly added that he thought it is \\"the best film ever made.\\" References External links  * *Adventure website *Redux: A Climber's Survival Tale *Aron Ralston: in his own words Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:American amputees Category:American autobiographers Category:American motivational speakers Category:American mountain climbers Category:Carnegie Mellon University College of Engineering alumni Category:American mechanical engineers Category:Intel people Category:People from Aspen, Colorado Category:People from Indianapolis ","title":"Aron Ralston"},{"id":"429400","text":"Wooden palace in Kolomenskoye. 18th century picture. A modern reconstruction of the Wooden palace (2011) Panorama of Kolomenskoye, 18th century. Watercolor from the original drawing of Giacomo Quarenghi View of Kolomenskoye by Fyodor Alexeyev (19th century) Kolomenskoye () is a former royal estate situated several kilometers to the southeast of the city center of Moscow, Russia, on the ancient road leading to the town of Kolomna (hence the name). The 390 hectare scenic area overlooks the steep banks of the Moskva River. It became a part of Moscow in the 1960s. The White Column of Kolomenskoye Kolomenskoye village was first mentioned in the testament of Ivan Kalita (1339). As time went by, the village was developed as a favourite country estate of grand princes of Muscovy. The earliest existing structure is the exceptional Ascension church (1532), built in white stone to commemorate the long-awaited birth of an heir to the throne, the future Ivan the Terrible. Being the first stone church of tent-like variety, the uncanonical \\"White Column\\" (as it is sometimes referred to) marked a stunning break from the Byzantine tradition. The church reaches toward the sky from a low cross-shaped podklet (ground floor), followed by a prolonged chetverik (octagonal body, and then an octagonal tent, crowned by a tiny dome. The narrow pilasters on the sides of the chetverik, the arrow-shaped window frames, the three tiers of the kokoshniks and the quiet rhythm of stair arcades and open galleries underline the dynamic tendency of this masterpiece of the Russian architecture. The whole vertical composition is believed to have been borrowed from hipped roof- style wooden churches of the Russian North. Recognizing its outstanding value for humanity, UNESCO decided to inscribe the church on the World Heritage List in 1994. The great palace and other structures Tsar Alexis I had all the previous wooden structures in Kolomenskoye demolished and replaced them with a new great wooden palace, famed for its fanciful, fairytale roofs. Foreigners referred to this huge maze of intricate corridors and 250 rooms, as 'an Eighth Wonder of the World'. Although basically only a summer palace, it was the favorite residence of Tsar Alexis I. The future Empress Elizabeth Petrovna was born in the palace in 1709, and Tsar Peter the Great spent part of his youth here. Upon the departure of the court for St. Petersburg, the palace fell into disrepair, so that Catherine II refused to make it her Moscow residence. On her orders the wooden palace was demolished in 1768, and replaced with a much more modest stone-and-brick structure. Detailed plans of the Alexis I palace survived. The Moscow Government has completed a full-scale reconstruction in 2010. The rebuilt palace stands approximately to the south of its original location near the White Column, in order to preserve the historic foundations. The palace erected by Catherine the Great in 1768 was demolished in 1872, and only a few gates and outside buildings remain. Kolomenskoe Museum-Reserve in Moscow. Wooden St. George Church.

It is known for its Great Books curriculum. St. John's has no religious affiliation. St. John's claims to be one of the oldest institutions of higher learning in the United States as the successor institution of King William's School, a preparatory school founded in 1696; the current institution received a collegiate charter in 1784. In 1937, St. John's adopted a Great Books curriculum based on discussion of works from the Western canon of philosophical, religious, historical, mathematical, scientific, and literary works. The college grants only one bachelor's degree, a degree in Liberal Arts. Two master's degrees are available through the college's graduate institute: one in Liberal Arts, which is a modified version of the undergraduate curriculum (differing mostly in that the graduate students are not restricted to a set sequence of courses), and one in Eastern Classics, which applies most of the features of the undergraduate curriculum (seminars, preceptorials, language study and a set sequence of courses) to a list of classic works from India, China and Japan. The Master of Arts in Eastern Classics is only available at the Santa Fe campus. History=Old program St. John's College traces its origins to King William's School, founded in 1696. In 1784, Maryland chartered St. John's College, which absorbed King William's School when it opened 1785. The college took up residence in a building known as Bladen's Folly (the current McDowell Hall), which was originally built to be the Maryland governor's mansion, but was not completed. There was some association with the Freemasons early in the college's history, leading to speculation that it was named after Saint John the Evangelist. The college's original charter, reflecting the Masonic value of religious tolerance as well as the religious diversity of the founders (which included Presbyterians, Episcopalians, and the Roman Catholic Charles Carroll of Carrollton) stated that \\"youth of all religious denominations shall be freely and liberally admitted\\". The college always maintained a small size, generally enrolling fewer than 500 men at a time. In its early years, the college was at least nominally public‚Äîthe college's founders had envisaged it as the Western Shore branch of a proposed ‚ÄúUniversity of Maryland‚Äù but a lack of enthusiasm from the Maryland General Assembly and its Eastern Shore counterpart, Washington College, made this largely a paper institution. After years of inconsistent funding and litigation, the college accepted a smaller annual grant in lieu of being funded through the state's annual appropriations process. During the Civil War, the college closed and its campus was used as a military hospital. In 1907 it became the undergraduate college of a loosely organized \\"University of Maryland\\" that included the professional schools located in Baltimore. By 1920, when Maryland State College (founded in 1857 as Maryland Agricultural College) became the University of Maryland at College Park, St. John's was a free-standing private institution. The college curriculum has taken various forms throughout its history. It began with a general program of study in the liberal arts, but St. John's was a military school for much of the late 19th century and early 20th century. It ended compulsory military training with Major Enoch Garey's accession as president in 1923. Garey and the Navy instituted a Naval Reserve unit in September 1924, creating the first-ever collegiate Department of Naval Science in the United States. But despite St. John's successfully pioneering the entire NROTC movement, student interest waned, the voluntary ROTC disappeared in 1926 with Garey's departure, and the Naval Reserve unit followed by 1929. New program In 1936, the college lost its accreditation. The Board of Visitors and Governors, faced with dire financial straits caused by the Great Depression, invited educational innovators Stringfellow Barr and Scott Buchanan to make a completely fresh start. They introduced a new program of study, which remains in effect today. Buchanan became dean of the college, while Barr assumed its presidency. In his guide Cool Colleges, Donald Asher writes that the New Program was implemented to save the college from closing: \\"Several benefactors convinced the college to reject a watered-down curriculum in favor of becoming a very distinctive academic community. Thus this great institution was reborn as a survival measure.\\" In 1938, Walter Lippman wrote a column praising liberal arts education as a bulwark against fascism, and said \\"in the future, men will point to St. John's College and say that there was the seed-bed of the American renaissance.\\"Charles A. Nelson (2001),Radical Visions: Stringfellow Barr, Scott Buchanan, and Their Efforts on behalf of Education and Politics in the Twentieth Century. Bergin and Garvey, Westport, CT; . In 1940, national attention was attracted to St. John's by a story in Life entitled \\"The Classics: At St. John's They Come into Their Own Once More\\". Classic works unavailable in English translation were translated by faculty members, typed, mimeographed, and bound. They were sold to the general public as well as to students, and by 1941 the St. John's College bookshop was famous as the only source for English translations of works such as Copernicus's De revolutionibus orbium coelestium, St. Augustine's De Musica, and Ptolemy's Almagest. The wartime years were difficult for the all-male St. John's. Enlistment and the draft all but emptied the college; 15 seniors graduated in 1943, eight in 1945, and three in 1946. From 1940 to 1946, St. John's was repeatedly confronted with threats of its land being seized by the Navy for expansion of the neighboring U.S. Naval Academy, and James Forrestal, Secretary of the Navy, formally announced plans to do so in 1945. At the time, The New York Times, which had expected a legal battle royale comparable to the 1819 Dartmouth case, commented that \\"although a small college of fewer than 200 students, St. John's has, because of its experimental liberal arts program, received more publicity and been the center of a greater academic controversy than most other colleges in the land. Its best-books program has been attacked and praised by leading educators of the day.\\"\\"St. John's and Navy Facing Fight In Courts Over College's Campus\\", June 29, 1945, p. 17. The constant threat of eviction discouraged Stringfellow Barr. In late 1946 Forrestal withdrew the plan to take over St. John's in the face of public opposition and the disapproval of the House Naval Affairs Committee, but Barr and Scott Buchanan were already committed to leaving St. John's and launching Liberal Arts, Inc., a new, similar college in Stockbridge, Massachusetts; that project eventually failed‚Äîbut thinking about other sites for the college eventually led to the opening of St. John's second campus in Santa Fe in 1964. St John's had been founded as an all-white institution and continued as such in the early years of the New Program, with Barr actively discouraging Black students from applying. However, by 1948 faculty and student sentiment had shifted and students, with the support of the faculty and administration, persuaded a reluctant Board of Visitors and Governors to integrate the college and St. John's became the one of the first previously all-white colleges south of the Mason-Dixon line to admit Black students voluntarily., accessed July 26, 2007 In 1949, Richard D. Weigle became president of St. John's. Following the chaotic and difficult period from 1940 to 1949, Weigle's presidency continued for 31 years,\\"Richard Weigle, 80, Served as President Of St. John's College\\" (Obituary), The New York Times, December 17, 1992, p. B22. during which time the New Program and the college itself became well established. In 1951, St. John's became coeducational, admitting women for the first time in its then-254-year history. There was some objection from students because they had not been involved in‚Äînor even aware of‚Äîthe decision before it was announced to the media, and from some who believed that the college could not remain a serious institution were it to admit women. Martin Dyer reported that women who were admitted quickly proved they were the academic and intellectual equals of their male counterparts. As enrollment grew during the 1950s, and facing the coming larger baby-boom generation, thoughts turned again towards opening another campus‚Äîbut this time in addition to, not instead of, the one in Annapolis. Serious talk of expansion began in 1959 when the father of a student from Monterey, California, suggested to President Weigle that he establish a new campus there. Time ran an article on the college's possible expansion plans,\\"College Spawns College\\", Time Magazine, December 26, 1960, accessed April 28, 2007 and in addition to California, 32 offers came in to the college from New Hampshire, Oregon, Georgia, Alaska, Florida, Connecticut, and other states. A group from the Monterey Peninsula told Weigle that they were definitely interested, though funding was a problem, and suitable land was a big question. There was also an offer of land in Claremont, California, but competition with the other colleges there for students and financial contributions was a negative. The Riverside Mission Inn (in Riverside, California) was another possibility, but with only of land and many renovations needed to the inn, funding was again a major issue. Nevertheless, all three locations were major contenders, when Robert McKinney (publisher of The Santa Fe New Mexican and a former SJC board member) called and told Weigle that a group of city leaders had long been looking for another college for Santa Fe. At a lunch Weigle attended at John Gaw Meem's house on the outskirts of Santa Fe in late January 1961, Meem volunteered that he had a little piece of land () that he would gladly donate to the college. Upon looking at it after lunch, Weigle instantly fell in love with it. A committee of four faculty members (Robert Bart, Barbara Leonard, Douglas Allanbrook, and William Darkey) then visited all four sites (the three in California, and Santa Fe) and, after much deliberation, recommended Santa Fe.\\"The Colonization of a College: The Beginnings and Early History of St. John's College in Santa Fe\\", by Richard D. Weigle, Fishergate Publishing Company (St. John's College Print Shop), Annapolis, 1985 Western mystery writer Tony Hillerman tells a slightly different story: The site selection committee, having originally expected to locate in Claremont, reluctantly accepted an invitation to inspect the site in Santa Fe. Hillerman says of the committeemen: In 1961, the governing board of St. John's thus approved plans to establish a second college at Santa Fe. Groundbreaking occurred on April 22, 1963, and the first classes began in 1964. As it turned out, shortly afterwards land was also donated to the college on the Monterey Peninsula, on condition that a campus be developed there by a certain date. Academics=Great Books program The Great Books program (often called simply \\"the Program\\" or \\"the New Program\\" at St. John's) was developed at the University of Chicago by Stringfellow Barr, Scott Buchanan, Robert Hutchins, and Mortimer Adler in the mid-1930s as an alternative form of education to the then rapidly changing undergraduate curriculum. St. John's adopted the Great Books program in 1937, when the college was facing the possibility of financial and academic ruin. The Great Books program in use today was also heavily influenced by Jacob Klein, who was dean of the college in the 1940s and 1950s. The four-year program of study, nearly all of which is mandatory, requires that students read and discuss the works of many of Western civilization's most prominent contributors to philosophy, theology, mathematics, science, music, poetry, and literature. Tutorials (mathematics, language, and music), as well as seminar and laboratory, are discussion-based. In the mathematics tutorial students often demonstrate propositions that mathematicians throughout various ages have laid out. In the language tutorial student translations are presented (ancient Greek is studied in the first two years and French for the last two). The tutorials, with seminar and laboratory, constitute the classes. All classes, and in particular the seminar, are considered formal exercises; consequently, students address one another, as well as their teachers, by their honorific and last name during class. St. John's avoids modern textbooks, lectures, and examinations, in favor of a series of manuals. While traditional (A to F) grades are given and provided on transcripts, the culture of the school de- emphasizes their importance and grades are released only at the request of the student. Grading is based largely on class participation and papers. Tutors, as faculty members are called at the college, play a non-directive role in the classroom, compared to mainstream colleges. However, at St. John's this varies by course and instructor. Class size is small on both campuses, with a student to tutor ratio of 7:1. Seminar is the largest class, with around 20 students, but led by two tutors. Daytime tutorials are smaller, typically ranging between 12 and 16 students and are led by one tutor. Preceptorials are the smallest class size, ranging between 3 and 9 students. The Program involves: * Four years of literature, philosophy, and political science in seminar * Four years of mathematics * Three years of laboratory science * Four years of language (Ancient Greek, Middle/Early English, and French) * Freshman year chorus followed by sophomore year music The Great Books are not the only texts used at St. John's. Greek and French classes make use of supplemental materials that are more like traditional textbooks. Science laboratory courses and mathematics courses use manuals prepared by faculty members that combine source materials with workbook exercises. For example, the mathematics tutorial combines a 1905 paper by Albert Einstein with exercises that require the student to work through the mathematics used in the paper.Harty, Rosemary (2005), Director of Communications, St. John's College, Annapolis, personal communication (Source details of non-Great-Books materials used at St. John's) Reading list Although it varies from year to year and differs slightly between campuses, the Great Books reading list is the basis of the school's curriculum. =Freshman year= * Homer: Iliad, Odyssey * Aeschylus: Agamemnon, Libation Bearers, The Eumenides, Prometheus Bound * Sophocles: Oedipus Rex, Oedipus at Colonus, Antigone, Philoctetes, Ajax * Thucydides: Peloponnesian War * Euripides: Hippolytus, The Bacchae * Herodotus: Histories * Aristophanes: Clouds, Frogs * Plato: Meno, Gorgias, Republic, Apology, Crito, Phaedo, Symposium, Parmenides, Theaetetus, Sophist, Timaeus, Phaedrus * Aristotle: Poetics, Physics, Metaphysics, Nicomachean Ethics, On Generation and Corruption, Politics, Parts of Animals, Generation of Animals * Euclid: Elements * Lucretius: On the Nature of Things * Plutarch: \\"Lycurgus\\" and \\"Solon\\" from the Parallel Lives * Ptolemy: Almagest * Blaise Pascal: Treatise on the Equilibrium of Liquids * Nicomachus: Arithmetic * Antoine Lavoisier: Elements of Chemistry * William Harvey: Motion of the Heart and Blood * Essays by: Archimedes, Gabriel Fahrenheit, Amedeo Avogadro, John Dalton, Stanislao Cannizzaro, Rudolf Virchow, Edme Mariotte, Hans Adolf Eduard Driesch, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, Hans Spemann, Guy Beckley Stearns, J.

Hardy Graduate Institute Liberal Arts program The Graduate Institute in Liberal Education was established at St. John's College in 1967 as a summer program on the Santa Fe campus. The size and scope of the Institute have expanded so that currently both the Annapolis and Santa Fe campuses offer year-round graduate-level study based on the principles of the St. John's undergraduate program. Students in the Liberal Arts program explore the persisting questions of human existence by studying classic works of the western tradition. This program is organized into five semester-long thematic segments: Philosophy and Theology, Politics and Society, Literature, Mathematics and Natural Science, and History. Students earn a Master of Arts in Liberal Arts (MALA) by completing four of these five segments. A common curriculum provides the basis for a shared intellectual community; discussion with fellow students and faculty is the mode of learning both inside and outside the classroom. Each semester, students attend a seminar, a tutorial and a preceptorial‚Äîall carried out as small-group discussions under the guidance of St. John's faculty members. These three types of classes are the framework of the distinctive St. John's educational experience. Eastern Classics program At the Santa Fe campus, there is a program offering a Master of Arts in Eastern Classics (MAEC). This program is three semesters long and is designed to be completed in one 12-month period. The impetus for the program came with the recognition that the undergraduate program simply could not do justice to the Great Books of the three main Asian traditions (India, China and Japan) by trying to squeeze in a few works among so many European masterworks. The EC program therefore provides a full set of readings in the philosophical, religious and literary traditions of the three cultures listed above. Thus, students learn Chinese culture by reading not only Confucius, Laozi and Zhuangzi, but also Mencius, Xun Zi, Han Feizi, and Mozi, as well as historical narratives by Sima Qian and the Zuo Zhuan, the later movement of Neo-Confucianism and Zhu Xi, narrative works such as Journey to the West or the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and the great Chinese poets, Li Bai, Wang Wei and Du Fu. This list represents only one-third of the required corpus, which also covers the major teachings and branches of Hinduism and the development of Theravada, Mahayana and Zen Buddhism, as well as such literary masterpieces as the Mahabharata, Shakuntala, The Tale of Genji, The Narrow Road to the Deep North and others. Students also take a language, either Sanskrit or Classical Chinese. Campuses=Annapolis campus Annapolis campus St. John's is located in the Historic Annapolis district, one block away from the Maryland State Capitol building. Its proximity to the United States Naval Academy (across King George Street) has inspired many a comparison to Athens and Sparta. The schools carry on a spirited rivalry seen in the annual croquet match between the two schools on the front lawn of St. John's, which has been called by GQ \\"the purest intercollegiate athletic event in America.\\" St. John's has won 29 of the 36 annual matches. About the Johnnies' commitment to the event, one midshipman commented, \\"They're out practicing croquet every afternoon! Alabama should take football this seriously.\\" Construction of McDowell Hall at the center of campus was begun in 1742 by Provincial Governor of Maryland Thomas Bladen, but was not completed until after the end of the Colonial period. The 23,000-square-foot historic building underwent some improvements in 2017‚Äì18. Its Great Hall has seen many college events, from balls feting Generals Lafayette and Washington to the unique St. John's institutions called waltz parties. Mellon Hall, constructed in 1958, was designed by noted architect Richard Neutra. St. John's College Observatory The observatory facility, located at the top of the Foucault pendulum tower in Mellon Hall, contains two permanently mounted telescopes, a 12\\" Schmidt‚ÄìCassegrain telescope model LX200 and a 16\\" Newtonian telescope, both made by Meade Instruments. The Foucault Pendulum is located at the top of the four-story tower. The pendulum drive magnet is housed within a cast iron cone in the Observatory facility. The magnet is keyed to turn on and off as the pendulum swings by using technology such as a photoresistor that determine the center of the pendulum's swing. Santa Fe campus Holi Celebration at Santa Fe Campus St. John's Santa Fe campus is located at the foot of Monte Sol, on the eastern edge of Santa Fe. It was opened in 1964 in response to the increase in qualified applicants at the Annapolis campus. The college chose to open a second campus rather than increase the size of the Annapolis campus. The second campus was part of a larger project, championed by then-college president Richard Weigle, which called for six campuses to be built across the country. St. John's abandoned the concept when it later sold a tract of land it owned in Monterey, California. The Santa Fe campus offers students a more secluded atmosphere than the Annapolis campus, with the vast Pecos Wilderness and Sangre de Cristo Mountains on its doorstep. The campus also boasts an expansive view of Santa Fe that extends to Los Alamos to the west. The college maintains gear to facilitate student use of the outdoors, such as kayaks, rafts, hiking equipment, and sports equipment. Additionally, the college partners with Atalaya Search and Rescue to offer students training in search and rescue. In recent years, the Santa Fe campus has begun initiatives to support programming related to writing and the visual arts. Ptolemy Stone Both campuses have a Ptolemy Stone, an astronomical instrument invented by the ancient Greek astronomer Ptolemy to measure the altitude of celestial bodies, in this case, the sun. The St. John's Ptolemy Stones are outdoor objects with a movable metal dial affixed (a prismical concrete column in Annapolis and a granite boulder in Santa Fe); this device was the precursor to the sextant. Freshman and sophomore math classes learn to use this stone to calculate the movement of the sun along the ecliptic. The students' use of the Ptolemy Stones underscores the mathematics and laboratory programs' connection to the practical experimentation and hands-on experience of the natural world. Student body Within the Class of 2022, 36 U.S. states and 15 countries are represented. Approximately 99% of students receive financial aid. First-year undergraduate students range in age from 15 to 65. The student body is relatively small compared to other liberal arts colleges, with a population historically below 500 students on each campus during a year. The college offers many community seminars and lectures that are available to the public. Reputation In 1975, a St. John's graduate gave this description of how a St. John's degree was received by other institutions: Medical school admissions requirements have become significantly more rigorous since 1975, however, and institutions are now unwilling to waive requirements. Motivational business speaker Zig Ziglar included a chapter entitled \\"St. John's: A College That Works\\" in a 1997 book.Zig Ziglar (1997), Something To Smile About: Encouragement And Inspiration For Life's Ups And Downs, Nelson Books, A9 online page images He said St. John's holds fast to the \\"medieval\\" notion that all knowledge is one and states that \\"the books they use are terribly hard.\\" He notes that the school \\"ranks fifth nationally in the number of graduates earning doctorates in the humanities\\" and is impressed by the 81% of graduates entering education, engineering, law, medicine, and other professions. He concludes \\"Sounds like St. John's is onto something. Maybe more schools should take that approach.\\" St. John's College is also listed in Loren Pope's Colleges That Change Lives. St. John's runs counter to the usual emphasis on rankings and selectivity. In the past, St. John's College chose not to participate in any collegiate rankings surveys and did not provide requested survey information. However, the school was still included in many ranking guides. In 2014, Annapolis President Christopher B. Nelson wrote a post to address the issue in his SignPosts for Liberal Education blog: > After many years of refusing to participate at all in the rankings generated > by U.S. News & World Report‚Äîone of the most prominent providers of college > rankings‚ÄîSt. John's this year submitted statistical information for its > survey.

St. John's experienced an unprecedented leap upward in the 2014 U.S. News rankings after submitting data (as opposed to not providing information and still being ranked), as reported in the Washington Post. An educational reporter wrote: In September 2018, the college announced that it would slash undergraduate tuition by $17,000, from $52,000 to $35,000 per year, starting in the 2019-20 school year. St. John's Santa Fe campus president Mark Roosevelt cited concern about the rising cost of education among U.S. Liberal Arts institutions, particularly the rise of \\"prestige pricing\\" among competitive private colleges and universities, as impetus for the substantial tuition reduction. In June 2019, St. John's rolled out a new visual identity featuring orange as a primary color in the palette and a modernized version of the classic seal in the college's logo.

It is one of two phyla of archaea, the other being crenarchaeota. Euryarchaeota are highly diverse and include methanogens, which produce methane and are often found in intestines, halobacteria, which survive extreme concentrations of salt, and some extremely thermophilic aerobes and anaerobes, which generally live at temperatures between 41 and 122 ¬∞C. They are separated from the other archaeans based mainly on rRNA sequences and their unique DNA polymerase. Description The Euryarchaeota are diverse in appearance and metabolic properties. The phylum contains organisms of a variety of shapes, including both rods and cocci. Euryarchaeota may appear either gram-positive or gram- negative depending on whether pseudomurein is present in the cell wall. Euryarchaeota also demonstrate diverse lifestyles, including methanogens, halophiles, sulfate-reducers, and extreme thermophiles in each. Others live in the ocean, suspended with plankton and bacteria. Although these marine euryarchaeota are difficult to culture and study in a lab, genomic sequencing suggests that they are motile heterotrophs. Though it was previously thought that euryarchaeota only lived in extreme environments (in terms of temperature, salt content and/or pH), a paper by Korzhenkov et al published in January 2019 showed that euryarchaeota also live in moderate environments, such as low-temperature acidic environments. In some cases, euryarchaeota outnumbered the bacteria present. Euryarchaeota have also been found in other moderate environments such as water springs, marshlands, soil and rhizospheres. Some euryarchaeota are highly adaptable; an order called Halobacteriales are usually found in extremely salty and sulfur-rich environments but can also grow in salt concentrations as low as that of seawater 2.5%. In rhizospheres, the presence of euryarchaeota seems to be dependent on that of mycorrhizal fungi; a higher fungal population was correlated with higher euryarchaeotal frequency and diversity, while absence of mycorrihizal fungi was correlated with absence of euryarchaeota.

Until 1997, the cathedral was dedicated only to Saint Vitus, and is still commonly named only as St. Vitus Cathedral. This cathedral is a prominent example of Gothic architecture and is the largest and most important church in the country. Located within Prague Castle and containing the tombs of many Bohemian kings and Holy Roman Emperors, the cathedral is under the ownership of the Czech government as part of the Prague Castle complex. Cathedral dimensions are , the main tower is high, front towers , arch height . Origins The current cathedral is the third of a series of religious buildings at the site, all dedicated to St. Vitus. The first church was an early Romanesque rotunda founded by Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia in 930. This patron saint was chosen because Wenceslaus had acquired a holy relic ‚Äì the arm of St. Vitus ‚Äì from Emperor Henry I. It is also possible that Wenceslaus, wanting to convert his subjects to Christianity more easily, chose a saint whose name (Svat√Ω V√≠t in Czech) sounds very much like the name of Slavic solar deity Svantevit. Two religious populations, the increasing Christian and decreasing pagan community, lived simultaneously in Prague castle at least until the 11th century. Ground plan of the cathedral with outlines of prior romanesque buildingsIn the year 1060, as the bishopric of Prague was founded, prince Spytihnƒõv II embarked on building a more spacious church, as it became clear the existing rotunda was too small to accommodate the faithful. A much larger and more representative Romanesque basilica was built in its spot. Though still not completely reconstructed, most experts agree it was a triple- aisled basilica with two choirs and a pair of towers connected to the western transept. The design of the cathedral nods to Romanesque architecture of the Holy Roman Empire, most notably to the abbey church in Hildesheim and the Speyer Cathedral. The southern apse of the rotunda was incorporated into the eastern transept of the new church because it housed the tomb of St. Wenceslaus, who had by now become the patron saint of the Czech princes. A bishop's mansion was also built south of the new church, and was considerably enlarged and extended in the mid 12th-century. The Gothic Cathedral Panorama of the transept Construction of the present-day Gothic Cathedral began on 21 November 1344, when the seat of Prague was elevated to an archbishopric. King John of Bohemia laid the foundation stone for the new building. The patrons were the chapter of cathedral (led by a Dean), the Archbishop Arnost of Pardubice, and, above all, Charles IV, King of Bohemia and a soon-to-be Holy Roman Emperor, who intended the new cathedral to be a coronation church, family crypt, treasury for the most precious relics of the kingdom, and the last resting place cum pilgrimage site of patron saint Wenceslaus. The first master builder was a Frenchman Matthias of Arras, summoned from the Papal Palace in Avignon. Matthias designed the overall layout of the building as, basically, an import of French Gothic: a triple- naved basilica with flying buttresses, short transept, five-bayed choir and decagon apse with ambulatory and radiating chapels. However, he lived to build only the easternmost parts of the choir: the arcades and the ambulatory. The slender verticality of Late French Gothic and clear, almost rigid respect of proportions distinguish his work today. After Matthias' death in 1352, 23-year-old Peter Parler assumed control of the cathedral workshop as master builder. He was son of the architect of the Heilig-Kreuz-M√ºnster in Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd. Initially, Parler only worked on plans left by his predecessor, building the sacristy on the north side of the choir and the chapel on the south. Once he finished all that Matthias left unfinished, he continued according to his own ideas. Parler's bold and innovative design brought in a unique new synthesis of Gothic elements in architecture. This is best exemplified in the vaults he designed for the choir. The so-called Parler's vaults or net-vaults have double (not single, as in classic High Gothic groin vaults) diagonal ribs that span the width of the choir-bay. The crossing pairs of ribs create a net-like construction (hence the name), which considerably strengthens the vault. They also give a lively ornamentation to the ceiling, as the interlocking vaulted bays create a dynamic zigzag pattern the length of the cathedral. Mosaic of the Last Judgment at the Golden Gate (annotated) While Matthias of Arras was schooled as a geometer, thus putting an emphasis on rigid systems of proportions and clear, mathematical compositions in his design, Parler was trained as a sculptor and woodcarver. He treated architecture as a sculpture, almost as if playing with structural forms in stone. Aside from his bold vaults, the peculiarities of his work can also be seen in the design of pillars (with classic, bell-shaped columns which were almost forgotten by High Gothic), the ingenious dome vault of new St Wenceslaus chapel, the undulating clerestory walls, the original window tracery (no two of his windows are the same, the ornamentation is always different) and the blind tracery panels of the buttresses. Architectural sculpture was given a considerable role while Parler was in charge of construction, as can be seen in the corbels, the passageway lintels, and, particularly, in the busts on the triforium, which depict faces of the royal family, saints, Prague bishops, and the two master builders, including Parler himself. Work on the cathedral, however, proceeded slowly, because the Emperor commissioned Parler with many other projects, such as the construction of the new Charles Bridge in Prague and many churches throughout the Czech realm. By 1397, when Peter Parler died, only the choir and parts of the transept were finished. View of the Cathedral and Prague Castle, above the river Vltava. After Peter Parler's death in 1399 his sons, Wenzel Parler and particularly Johannes Parler, continued his work; they in turn were succeeded by a certain Master Petrilk, who by all accounts was also a member of Parler's workshop. Under these three masters, the transept and the great tower on its south side were finished. So was the gable which connects the tower with the south transept. Nicknamed 'Golden Gate' (likely because of the golden mosaic of Last Judgment depicted on it), it is through this portal that the kings entered the cathedral for coronation ceremonies. The entire building process came to a halt with the beginning of Hussite War in the first half of 15th century. The war brought an end to the workshop that operated steadily over for almost a century, and the furnishings of cathedral, dozens of pictures and sculptures, suffered heavily from the ravages of Hussite iconoclasm. As if this was not enough, a great fire in 1541 heavily damaged the cathedral. St. Wenceslas Chapel St. Wenceslas Chapel Perhaps the most outstanding place in the cathedral is the Chapel of St. Wenceslas, which houses relics of the saint. Peter Parler constructed the room between 1356 (the year he took over) and 1364 with a ribbed vault. The lower portions of the walls are decorated with over 1300 semi-precious stones and paintings depicting the Passion of Christ dating from the original decoration of the chapel in 1372‚Äì1373. The upper area of the walls have paintings depicting the life of St. Wenceslas, by the Master of the Litomƒõ≈ôice Altarpiece between 1506 and 1509. Above the altar, is a Gothic statue of St. Wenceslas created by Jindrich Parler (Peter's nephew) in 1373. The Chapel is not open to the public, but it can be viewed from the doorways. A small door with seven locks, in the southwest corner of the chapel, leads to the Crown Chamber containing the Czech Crown Jewels, which are displayed to the public only once every (circa) eight years. Renaissance and Baroque Through most of the following centuries, the cathedral stood only half- finished. It was built to the great tower and a transept, which was closed by a provisional wall. In the place of a three-aisled nave-to-be-built, a timber- roofed construction stood, and services were held separately there from the interior of the choir. Several attempts to continue the work on cathedral were mostly unsuccessful. In the latter half of 15th century, king Vladislav Jagiellon commissioned the great Renaissance-Gothic architect Benedict Ried to continue the work on the cathedral, but almost as soon as the work began, it was cut short because of lack of funds. Later attempts to finish the cathedral only brought some Renaissance and Baroque elements into the Gothic building, most notably the obviously different Baroque spire of the south tower by Nikolaus Pacassi (1753 till 1775) and the great organ in the northern wing of transept. South door and tower including spire Completion in 19th and 20th century Coronation of King Ferdinand V of Bohemia in 1836 In 1844, V√°clav Pe≈°ina, an energetic St. Vitus canon, together with Neo-Gothic architect Josef Kranner presented a program for renovation and completion of the great cathedral at the gathering of German architects in Prague. The same year a society under the full name \\"Union for Completion of the Cathedral of St. Vitus in Prague\\" was formed, whose aim was to repair, complete and rid the structure of everything mutilated and stylistically inimical. Josef Kranner headed the work from 1861 to 1866 which consisted mostly of repairs, removing Baroque decorations deemed unnecessary and restoring the interior. In 1870 workers finally laid the foundations of the new nave, and in 1873, after Kramer's death, architect Josef Mocker assumed control of the reconstruction. He designed the west fa√ßade in a typical classic Gothic manner with two towers, and the same design was adopted, after his death, by the third and final architect of restoration, Kamil Hilbert. In the 1920s the sculptor Vojtƒõch Sucharda worked on the fa√ßade, and the famous Czech Art Nouveau painter Alfons Mucha decorated the new windows in the north part of nave. Frantisek Kysela designed the Rose Window 1925-7 which depicts scenes from the Biblical story of creation. By the time of St. Wenceslas jubilee in 1929, the St. Vitus cathedral was finally finished, nearly 600 years after it was begun. Despite the fact that entire western half of Cathedral is a Neo-Gothic addition, much of the design and elements developed by Peter Parler were used in the restoration, giving the Cathedral as a whole a harmonious, unified look. Organ Organ at the northern transept The St. Vitus Cathedral has two organ casings. The upper fa√ßade belonged to a baroque organ, which was built in 1765 by Anton Gartner. It had 40 stops on 3 manuals and pedals. This case is purely decorative. The associated work was transported around 1909 and was lost. The lower neoclassical casing contains today's main organ. It was built by Josef Melzel in the years 1929-31. A general overhaul was carried out by the organ builder Brachtl a K√°nsk√Ω (1999-2001).Praha - Katedr√°la sv. V√≠ta, V√°clava a Vojtƒõcha, see also Homepage The rather modest instrument in relation to the large church space has 58 stops on 3 manuals and pedals, 4,475 pipes in total. The action is purely pneumatic. With a large number of basic pipes (flutes and principals) and little reeds (trumpets), the instrument has a rather gentle tone - a typical feature of post-Romantic organs.More Organ informations Influence West view and main portal The eastern fa√ßade The Cathedral of St. Vitus had a tremendous influence on the development of Late Gothic style characteristic for Central Europe. Members of Parler workshop, and indeed, the Parler family (both of which were established at the building site of St. Vitus) designed numerous churches and buildings across Central Europe. More notable examples include Stephansdom cathedral in Vienna, Strasbourg Cathedral, Church of St. Marko in Zagreb and the Church of St. Barbara in Kutna Hora, also in Czech Republic. Regional Gothic styles of Slovenia, northern Croatia, Austria, Czech Republic, and southern Germany were all heavily influenced by Parler design. Of particular interest are Parler's net vaults. The Late Gothic of Central Europe is characterised by ornate and extraordinary vaulting, a practice which was started by Parler's development of his own vaulting system for the choir of St. Vitus cathedral. Another regional Gothic style also displays amazing ingenuity and ornamentation in the design of vaults, the Perpendicular Style of English Gothic. A question remains of what was influenced by what. Some British art and architecture historians suspected that Peter Parler might have travelled to England at some point in his life, studying the great English Gothic cathedrals, which then inspired his work on St Vitus. However, taking into account that the Perpendicular style and the use of truly extravagant vaults in English Gothic began at the very end of 14th century, it is also quite possible that it was St Vitus Cathedral of Prague that influenced the development of English Gothic.P. Zatloukal, \\"Architecture of the 19th Century\\", vol. 5 of \\"Ten centuries of architecture\\" series, Prague Castle Administration & DaDa, a.s., Prague 2001, (English version)  Recent history  In 1997, on 1000th anniversary of the death of Saint Adalbert (sv. Vojtƒõch in Czech), the patrocinium (dedication) of the church was re-dedicated to Saint Wenceslaus and Saint Adalbert. The previous Romanesque basilica had this triple patrocinium to the main Bohemian patrons since 1038 when relics of Saint Adalbert were placed here. The skull of Saint Adalbert is kept at the Hilbert TreasuryRelics of Bohemia's patron Saint adalbert find new resting place In 1954, a government decree entrusted the whole Prague Castle into ownership of \\"all Czechoslovak people\\" and into administration of the President's Office. Beginning in 1992, after the Velvet Revolution the church filed several petitions requesting a determination on the true owner of the structure. After 14 years, in June 2006, the City Court in Prague decided that the 1954 decree did not change the ownership of the cathedral and the owner is the Metropolitan Chapter at Saint Vitus. In September 2006, the President's Office ceded the administration to the Metropolitan Chapter. However, in February 2007, the Supreme Court of the Czech Republic reversed the decision of the City Court and returned the case to the common court. In September 2007, the District Court of Praha 7 decided that the cathedral is owned by the Czech Republic, this decision was confirmed by the City Court in Prague and the Constitutional Court rejected the appeal of the Metropolitan Chapter, however noted that the chapter unquestionably owns the interior furnishings of the cathedral. The Metropolitan Chapter considered continuing the case in the European Court for Human Rights however in May 2010, the new Prague Archbishop Dominik Duka and the state president V√°clav Klaus together declared that they did not wish to continue with court conflicts. They constituted that the seven persons who are traditionally holders of the keys of the Saint Wenceslaus Chamber with the Bohemian Crown Jewels become also a board to coordinate and organize administration and use of the cathedral. However, controversy about ownership of some related canonry houses continues. In July 2012, the Chamber of Deputies passed a bill to compensate the churches for property seized by the Communist government. The Senate approved the bill in November 2012 and the government implemented it the following June after clearing legal challenges.

He was the director of architecture at the 1951 Festival of Britain on London's South Bank. Life Casson was the nephew of actor, Sir Lewis Casson. Casson studied at Eastbourne College in East Sussex, then St John's College, Cambridge (1929‚Äì31), after which he spent time at the Bartlett School of Architecture in London. Work Before the Second World War, he divided his time between teaching at the Cambridge School of Architecture and working in the London office of his Cambridge tutor, architect Christopher (Kit) Nicholson. He wrote the book New Sights of London in 1938 for London Transport, championing modern architecture within reach of London, while remaining critical of the UK's track record in innovative building. \\"He does not mince his words,\\" commented the Architect and Building News on the cover. During the war, he worked in the Camouflage Service of the Air Ministry. Casson was appointed to his role as director of architecture of the Festival of Britain in 1948 at the age of 38, and set out to celebrate peace and modernity through the appointment of other young architects. For example, the Modernist design of the Royal Festival Hall was led by a 39-year- old, Leslie Martin. Casson's Festival achievements led to his being made a (Knight Bachelor) in 1952. After the war, and alongside his Festival work, Casson went into partnership with young architect Neville Conder. Their projects included corporate headquarters buildings, university campuses, the Elephant House at London Zoo, a building for the Royal College of Art (where Casson was Professor of Interior Design from 1955 to 1975, and later served as Provost), the Microbiology Building (Belfast), and the master planning and design of the Sidgwick Avenue arts faculty buildings for the University of Cambridge, including the Austin Robinson Building which houses the Faculty of Economics as well as the Marshall Library of Economics. This latter project lasted some 30 years. A close friend of the British royal family, Casson designed the interior of the royal yacht Britannia and is also credited with having taught Charles, Prince of Wales to paint in watercolours. He was elected to the Royal Academy in 1970, and was its President from 1976 to 1984. In 1978, he was elected to the National Academy of Design as an Honorary Corresponding member, and later that year became a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO). In the 1980s Casson became a television presenter, with his own series, Personal Pleasures with Sir Hugh Casson, about stately homes and places he enjoyed. Casson supplied watercolour illustrations for a new edition of Sir John Betjeman's verse autobiography Summoned by Bells (1960); The Illustrated \\"Summoned by Bells\\" was published by John Murray in 1989. Honours He was made a Knight Bachelor in the 1952 New Year Honours, becoming Sir Hugh Casson. In 1978, he was made a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order. In the 1985 New Years Honours List, Casson was appointed to the Order of the Companions of Honour.

The solid body shows the places where the electron's probability density is above a certain value (here 0.02 nm‚àí3): this is calculated from the probability amplitude. The hue on the colored surface shows the complex phase of the wave function. In quantum mechanics, a probability amplitude is a complex number used in describing the behaviour of systems. The modulus squared of this quantity represents a probability or probability density. Probability amplitudes provide a relationship between the wave function (or, more generally, of a quantum state vector) of a system and the results of observations of that system, a link first proposed by Max Born. Interpretation of values of a wave function as the probability amplitude is a pillar of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. In fact, the properties of the space of wave functions were being used to make physical predictions (such as emissions from atoms being at certain discrete energies) before any physical interpretation of a particular function was offered. Born was awarded half of the 1954 Nobel Prize in Physics for this understanding (see References), and the probability thus calculated is sometimes called the \\"Born probability\\". These probabilistic concepts, namely the probability density and quantum measurements, were vigorously contested at the time by the original physicists working on the theory, such as Schr√∂dinger and Einstein. It is the source of the mysterious consequences and philosophical difficulties in the interpretations of quantum mechanics‚Äîtopics that continue to be debated even today. Overview=Physical Neglecting some technical complexities, the problem of quantum measurement is the behaviour of a quantum state, for which the value of the observable to be measured is uncertain. Such a state is thought to be a coherent superposition of the observable's eigenstates, states on which the value of the observable is uniquely defined, for different possible values of the observable. When a measurement of is made, the system (under the Copenhagen interpretation) jumps to one of the eigenstates, returning the eigenvalue belonging to that eigenstate. The system may always be described by a linear combination or superposition of these eigenstates with unequal \\"weights\\". Intuitively it is clear that eigenstates with heavier \\"weights\\" are more \\"likely\\" to be produced. Indeed, which of the above eigenstates the system jumps to is given by a probabilistic law: the probability of the system jumping to the state is proportional to the absolute value of the corresponding numerical weight squared. These numerical weights are called probability amplitudes, and this relationship used to calculate probabilities from given pure quantum states (such as wave functions) is called the Born rule. Clearly, the sum of the probabilities, which equals the sum of the absolute squares of the probability amplitudes, must equal 1. This is the normalization (see below) requirement. If the system is known to be in some eigenstate of (e.g. after an observation of the corresponding eigenvalue of ) the probability of observing that eigenvalue becomes equal to 1 (certain) for all subsequent measurements of (so long as no other important forces act between the measurements). In other words the probability amplitudes are zero for all the other eigenstates, and remain zero for the future measurements. If the set of eigenstates to which the system can jump upon measurement of is the same as the set of eigenstates for measurement of , then subsequent measurements of either or always produce the same values with probability of 1, no matter the order in which they are applied. The probability amplitudes are unaffected by either measurement, and the observables are said to commute. By contrast, if the eigenstates of and are different, then measurement of produces a jump to a state that is not an eigenstate of . Therefore, if the system is known to be in some eigenstate of (all probability amplitudes zero except for one eigenstate), then when is observed the probability amplitudes are changed. A second, subsequent observation of no longer certainly produces the eigenvalue corresponding to the starting state. In other words, the probability amplitudes for the second measurement of depend on whether it comes before or after a measurement of , and the two observables do not commute. Mathematical In a formal setup, any system in quantum mechanics is described by a state, which is a vector , residing in an abstract complex vector space, called a Hilbert space. It may be either infinite- or finite-dimensional. A usual presentation of that Hilbert space is a special function space, called , on certain set , that is either some configuration space or a discrete set. For a measurable function \\\\psi, the condition \\\\psi \\\\in L^2(X) specifies that a finitely bounded integral must apply: : \\\\int\\\\limits_X \\\\psi(x)^2\\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mu(x) < \\\\infty ; this integral defines the square of the norm of . If that norm is equal to , then : \\\\int\\\\limits_X \\\\psi(x)^2 \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mu(x) = 1. It actually means that any element of of the norm 1 defines a probability measure on and a non-negative real expression defines its Radon‚ÄìNikodym derivative with respect to the standard measure . If the standard measure on is non-atomic, such as the Lebesgue measure on the real line, or on three-dimensional space, or similar measures on manifolds, then a real-valued function is called a probability density; see details below. If the standard measure on consists of atoms only (we shall call such sets discrete), and specifies the measure of any equal to ,The case of an atomic measure on with is not interesting, because such that are unused by and can be dropped, whereas for of positive measures the value of is virtually the question of rescaling of . Due to this trivial fix this case was hardly ever considered by physicists. then an integral over is simply a sumIf is countable, then an integral is the sum of an infinite series. and defines the value of the probability measure on the set }, in other words, the probability that the quantum system is in the state . How amplitudes and the vector are related can be understood with the standard basis of , elements of which will be denoted by or (see bra‚Äìket notation for the angle bracket notation). In this basis : \\\\psi (x) = \\\\langle x\\\\Psi \\\\rangle specifies the coordinate presentation of an abstract vector . Mathematically, many presentations of the system's Hilbert space can exist. We shall consider not an arbitrary one, but a one for the observable in question. A convenient configuration space is such that each point produces some unique value of . For discrete it means that all elements of the standard basis are eigenvectors of . In other words, shall be diagonal in that basis. Then \\\\psi (x) is the \\"probability amplitude\\" for the eigenstate . If it corresponds to a non-degenerate eigenvalue of , then \\\\psi (x)^2 gives the probability of the corresponding value of for the initial state . For non-discrete there may not be such states as in , but the decomposition is in some sense possible; see spectral theory and Spectral theorem for accurate explanation. Wave functions and probabilities If the configuration space is continuous (something like the real line or Euclidean space, see above), then there are no valid quantum states corresponding to particular , and the probability that the system is \\"in the state \\" will always be zero. An archetypical example of this is the space constructed with 1-dimensional Lebesgue measure; it is used to study a motion in one dimension. This presentation of the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space corresponds to the spectral decomposition of the coordinate operator: in this example. Although there are no such vectors as , strictly speaking, the expression can be made meaningful, for instance, with spectral theory. Generally, it is the case when the motion of a particle is described in the position space, where the corresponding probability amplitude function is the wave function. If the function represents the quantum state vector , then the real expression , that depends on , forms a probability density function of the given state. The difference of a density function from simply a numerical probability means that one should integrate this modulus-squared function over some (small) domains in to obtain probability values ‚Äì as was stated above, the system can't be in some state with a positive probability. It gives to both amplitude and density function a physical dimension, unlike a dimensionless probability. For example, for a 3-dimensional wave function, the amplitude has the dimension [L‚àí3/2], where L is length. Note that for both continuous and infinite discrete cases not every measurable, or even smooth function (i.e. a possible wave function) defines an element of ; see Normalization, below. Discrete amplitudes When the set is discrete (see above), vectors represented with the Hilbert space are just column vectors composed of \\"amplitudes\\" and indexed by . These are sometimes referred to as wave functions of a discrete variable . Discrete dynamical variables are used in such problems as a particle in an idealized reflective box and quantum harmonic oscillator. Components of the vector will be denoted by for uniformity with the previous case; there may be either finite of infinite number of components depending on the Hilbert space. In this case, if the vector has the norm 1, then is just the probability that the quantum system resides in the state . It defines a discrete probability distribution on . if and only if is the same quantum state as . if and only if and are orthogonal (see inner product space). Otherwise the modulus of is between 0 and 1. A discrete probability amplitude may be considered as a fundamental frequency in the Probability Frequency domain (spherical harmonics) for the purposes of simplifying M-theory transformation calculations.  Examples  Take the simplest meaningful example of the discrete case: a quantum system that can be in two possible states: for example, the polarization of a photon. When the polarization is measured, it could be the horizontal state H\\\\rangle or the vertical state V\\\\rangle. Until its polarization is measured the photon can be in a superposition of both these states, so its state \\\\psi\\\\rangle could be written as: :\\\\psi\\\\rangle = \\\\alpha H\\\\rangle + \\\\betaV\\\\rangle The probability amplitudes of \\\\psi\\\\rangle for the states H\\\\rangle and V\\\\rangle are \\\\alpha and \\\\beta respectively. When the photon's polarization is measured, the resulting state is either horizontal or vertical. But in a random experiment, the probability of being horizontally polarized is \\\\alpha^2, and the probability of being vertically polarized is \\\\beta^2. Therefore, for example, a photon in a state \\\\psi\\\\rangle = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1}{3}} H\\\\rangle - i \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{3}}V\\\\rangle would have a probability of \\\\frac{1}{3} to come out horizontally polarized, and a probability of \\\\frac{2}{3} to come out vertically polarized when an ensemble of measurements are made. The order of such results, is, however, completely random. Normalization In the example above, the measurement must give either or , so the total probability of measuring or must be 1. This leads to a constraint that ; more generally the sum of the squared moduli of the probability amplitudes of all the possible states is equal to one. If to understand \\"all the possible states\\" as an orthonormal basis, that makes sense in the discrete case, then this condition is the same as the norm-1 condition explained above. One can always divide any non-zero element of a Hilbert space by its norm and obtain a normalized state vector. Not every wave function belongs to the Hilbert space , though. Wave functions that fulfill this constraint are called normalizable. The Schr√∂dinger wave equation, describing states of quantum particles, has solutions that describe a system and determine precisely how the state changes with time. Suppose a wavefunction is a solution of the wave equation, giving a description of the particle (position , for time ). If the wavefunction is square integrable, i.e. :\\\\int_{\\\\mathbf R^n} \\\\psi_0(\\\\mathbf x, t_0)^2\\\\, \\\\mathrm{d\\\\mathbf x} = a^2 < \\\\infty for some , then is called the normalized wavefunction. Under the standard Copenhagen interpretation, the normalized wavefunction gives probability amplitudes for the position of the particle. Hence, at a given time , is the probability density function of the particle's position. Thus the probability that the particle is in the volume at is :\\\\mathbf{P}(V)=\\\\int_V \\\\rho(\\\\mathbf {x})\\\\, \\\\mathrm{d\\\\mathbf {x}} = \\\\int_V \\\\psi(\\\\mathbf {x}, t_0)^2\\\\, \\\\mathrm{d\\\\mathbf {x}}. Note that if any solution to the wave equation is normalisable at some time , then the defined above is always normalised, so that :\\\\rho_t(\\\\mathbf x)=\\\\left \\\\psi(\\\\mathbf x, t)\\\\right ^2 = \\\\left\\\\frac{\\\\psi_0(\\\\mathbf x, t)}{a}\\\\right^2 is always a probability density function for all . This is key to understanding the importance of this interpretation, because for a given the particle's constant mass, initial and the potential, the Schr√∂dinger equation fully determines subsequent wavefunction, and the above then gives probabilities of locations of the particle at all subsequent times. The laws of calculating probabilities of events A. Provided a system evolves naturally (which under the Copenhagen interpretation means that the system is not subjected to measurement), the following laws apply: #The probability (or the density of probability in position/momentum space) of an event to occur is the square of the absolute value of the probability amplitude for the event: P=\\\\phi^2. #If there are several mutually exclusive, indistinguishable alternatives in which an event might occur (or, in realistic interpretations of wavefunction, several wavefunctions exist for a space-time event), the probability amplitudes of all these possibilities add to give the probability amplitude for that event: \\\\phi=\\\\sum_i\\\\phi_i; P=\\\\phi^2=\\\\left\\\\sum_i\\\\phi_i\\\\right^2. #If, for any alternative, there is a succession of sub-events, then the probability amplitude for that alternative is the product of the probability amplitude for each sub-event: \\\\phi_{APB}=\\\\phi_{AP}\\\\phi_{PB}. #Non-entangled states of a composite quantum system have amplitudes equal to the product of the amplitudes of the states of constituent systems: \\\\phi_{\\\\rm{system}} (\\\\alpha,\\\\beta,\\\\gamma,\\\\delta,\\\\ldots)=\\\\phi_1(\\\\alpha)\\\\phi_2(\\\\beta)\\\\phi_3(\\\\gamma)\\\\phi_4(\\\\delta)\\\\ldots. See the #Composite systems section for more information. Law 2 is analogous to the addition law of probability, only the probability being substituted by the probability amplitude. Similarly, Law 4 is analogous to the multiplication law of probability for independent events; note that it fails for entangled states. B. When an experiment is performed to decide between the several alternatives, the same laws hold true for the corresponding probabilities: P=\\\\sum_i\\\\phi_i^2. Provided one knows the probability amplitudes for events associated with an experiment, the above laws provide a complete description of quantum systems in terms of probabilities. The above laws give way to the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, in the formalism developed by the celebrated theoretical physicist Richard Feynman. This approach to quantum mechanics forms the stepping-stone to the path integral approach to quantum field theory. In the context of the double-slit experiment Probability amplitudes have special significance because they act in quantum mechanics as the equivalent of conventional probabilities, with many analogous laws, as described above. For example, in the classic double-slit experiment, electrons are fired randomly at two slits, and the probability distribution of detecting electrons at all parts on a large screen placed behind the slits, is questioned. An intuitive answer is that , where is the probability of that event. This is obvious if one assumes that an electron passes through either slit. When nature does not have a way to distinguish which slit the electron has gone through (a much more stringent condition than simply \\"it is not observed\\"), the observed probability distribution on the screen reflects the interference pattern that is common with light waves. If one assumes the above law to be true, then this pattern cannot be explained. The particles cannot be said to go through either slit and the simple explanation does not work. The correct explanation is, however, by the association of probability amplitudes to each event. This is an example of the case A as described in the previous article. The complex amplitudes which represent the electron passing each slit ( and ) follow the law of precisely the form expected: . This is the principle of quantum superposition. The probability, which is the modulus squared of the probability amplitude, then, follows the interference pattern under the requirement that amplitudes are complex: :P = \\\\psi_{\\\\rm{first}} + \\\\psi_{\\\\rm{second}}^2 = \\\\psi_{\\\\rm{first}}^2 + \\\\psi_{\\\\rm{second}}^2 + 2 \\\\psi_{\\\\rm{first}} \\\\psi_{\\\\rm{second}} \\\\cos (\\\\varphi_1-\\\\varphi_2). Here, \\\\varphi_1 and \\\\varphi_2 are the arguments of and respectively. A purely real formulation has too few dimensions to describe the system's state when superposition is taken into account. That is, without the arguments of the amplitudes, we cannot describe the phase-dependent interference. The crucial term 2 \\\\psi_{\\\\rm{first}} \\\\psi_{\\\\rm{second}} \\\\cos (\\\\varphi_1-\\\\varphi_2) is called the \\"interference term\\", and this would be missing if we had added the probabilities. However, one may choose to devise an experiment in which the experimenter observes which slit each electron goes through. Then case B of the above article applies, and the interference pattern is not observed on the screen. One may go further in devising an experiment in which the experimenter gets rid of this \\"which-path information\\" by a \\"quantum eraser\\". Then, according to the Copenhagen interpretation, the case A applies again and the interference pattern is restored.A recent 2013 experiment gives insight regarding the correct physical interpretation of such phenomena. The information can actually be obtained, but then the electron seemingly went through all the possible paths simultaneously. (Certain ensemble-alike realistic interpretations of the wavefunction may presume such coexistence in all the points of an orbital.) Cf. Conservation of probabilities and the continuity equation Intuitively, since a normalised wave function stays normalised while evolving according to the wave equation, there will be a relationship between the change in the probability density of the particle's position and the change in the amplitude at these positions. Define the probability current (or flux) as : \\\\mathbf{j} = {\\\\hbar \\\\over m} {1 \\\\over {2 i}} \\\\left( \\\\psi ^{*} abla \\\\psi - \\\\psi abla \\\\psi^{*} \\\\right) = {\\\\hbar \\\\over m} \\\\operatorname{Im} \\\\left( \\\\psi ^{*} abla \\\\psi \\\\right), measured in units of (probability)/(area √ó time). Then the current satisfies the equation : abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{j} + { \\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial t} \\\\psi^2 = 0. The probability density is \\\\rho=\\\\psi^2, this equation is exactly the continuity equation, appearing in many situations in physics where we need to describe the local conservation of quantities. The best example is in classical electrodynamics, where corresponds to current density corresponding to electric charge, and the density is the charge-density. The corresponding continuity equation describes the local conservation of charges. Composite systems For two quantum systems with spaces and and given states and respectively, their combined state can be expressed as a function on , that gives the product of respective probability measures. In other words, amplitudes of a non-entangled composite state are products of original amplitudes, and respective observables on the systems 1 and 2 behave on these states as independent random variables. This strengthens the probabilistic interpretation explicated above. Amplitudes in operators The concept of amplitudes described above is relevant to quantum state vectors. It is also used in the context of unitary operators that are important in the scattering theory, notably in the form of S-matrices. Whereas moduli of vector components squared, for a given vector, give a fixed probability distribution, moduli of matrix elements squared are interpreted as transition probabilities just as in a random process. Like a finite-dimensional unit vector specifies a finite probability distribution, a finite-dimensional unitary matrix specifies transition probabilities between a finite number of states. Note that columns of a unitary matrix, as vectors, have the norm 1. The \\"transitional\\" interpretation may be applied to s on non-discrete spaces as well.

It is the only member of the genus Pooecetes.  Description  Measurements: * Length: 5.1-6.3 in (13-16 cm) * Weight: 0.7-1.0 oz (20-28 g) * Wingspan: 9.4 in (24 cm) Adults have light brown upperparts and light underparts, both with darker streaking. They have a white eye-ring and a long dark brown tail which shows white outer feathers in flight. Their breeding habitat is open grassy areas across most of North America. The nest is an open cup on the ground under a clump of grass. These birds migrate to the southern and central United States and Mexico. These birds forage on the ground, mainly eating insects and seeds. Outside the nesting season they often feed in small flocks. The male sings from a higher perch, such as a shrub or fencepost, which indicates his ownership of the nesting territory. The musical song begins with two pairs of repeated whistled notes and ends in a series of trills, somewhat similar to that of the song sparrow. This bird's numbers are declining in the eastern parts of its range due to habitat loss. ReferencesFurther reading=Book * Jones, S. L., and J. E. Cornely. 2002. Vesper Sparrow (Pooecetes gramineus).

Task Force Ranger under fire in Somalia - October 3, 1993 Battle of Mogadishu.  October 3, 1993 = Afternoon  13:50 ‚Äì Task Force Ranger analysts receive intelligence of Salad's location. 14:49 ‚Äì Habr Gidr clan leaders, two principal targets, and the United Nations Corporation are located at a residence in central Mogadishu, Somalia. 15:32 ‚Äì Official force launch, consisting of 19 aircraft , twelve vehicles, and 160 men. 15:42 ‚Äì Official assault begins. 1st SFOD-D soldiers hit the target house. Four-Ranger \\"chalk\\" \\"fast-rope\\" in. A Ranger, Private First Class Todd Blackburn, misses the rope and falls 70 feet to the street. 15:47 ‚Äì Large crowds of Somalis begin converging on the target area. 15:58 ‚Äì One of the vehicles, a five-ton truck, is hit and disabled by a rocket propelled grenade. 16:00 ‚Äì Groups of armed Somalis from the city of Mogadishu begin converging on the target area. 16:02 ‚Äì Raid targets captured: Assault force reports both clan leaders and about 21 others were in custody. As the force prepares to pull out, three vehicles are detached to rush the wounded Private Blackburn back to the base. SGT Dominick Pilla is killed as these vehicles return to base, becoming the first American fatality. 16:15 ‚Äì The convoy is delayed and does not move out due to confusion about who is signaling whom. It turned out that Delta was waiting for the convoy to originate the signal to them while the convoy was waiting for Delta to initiate the signal to them. The prisoners were eventually loaded after the Delta teams moved the prisoners to the trucks. 16:20 ‚Äì First helicopter crash: Black Hawk Super 6-1 is hit by a rocket-propelled grenade and crashed five blocks northeast of the target building. Delta Force snipers SSG Daniel Busch and SGT Jim Smith, survive the crash and begin to defend the crash site. 16:22 ‚Äì Crowds of armed Somalis start racing towards the Super 6-1 crash site. 16:26 ‚Äì A Humvee convoy starts moving. When the prisoners are loaded up, the convoy and ground forces all begin moving towards the crashed helicopter. Black Hawk Super 6-4, piloted by Chief Warrant Officer Michael Durant, takes the place of Black Hawk Super 6-1 circling over the city. 16:28 ‚Äì Search and rescue of Black Hawk Super 6-1: search and rescue team ropes in to assist the crew of the first crashed helicopter. Both pilot and co-pilot were dead. 16:35 ‚Äì The Convoy made a wrong turn and got lost among the city streets, sustaining heavy casualties by Somali snipers and armed militia. 16:40 ‚Äì Second helicopter crash: Mike Durant's Black Hawk, Super 6-4, is also hit by a Somali rocket propelled grenade, and crashed about a mile southwest of the target building. Hostile crowds of Somalians begin moving toward it as well. 16:42 ‚Äì Two Delta Force snipers, Sergeant First Class Randy Shughart and Master Sergeant Gary Gordon, who had been providing cover fire by air were inserted into the crash site by helicopter at their own request, to help protect the injured Durant and his crew. 16:54 ‚Äì HMMWV convoy abandons Black Hawk Super 6-1 search. The Lost Convoy, with more than half of its force either wounded or dead, abandons its search for the first downed Black Hawk and begins fighting its way back to the base. 17:03 ‚Äì Quick Reaction Force convoy (a smaller, emergency convoy) is dispatched from Command and Control in an attempt to rescue the men stranded at Durant's crash site. It encounters immediate obstacles. 17:34 ‚Äì QRF and the Lost Convoy decided to return to base. Both convoys, having sustained heavy casualties, linked up and abandon the efforts to break through to Durant. The remainder of the ground force of Rangers and commandos were converging around the first crash site, sustaining many casualties. Ranger Corporal Jamie Smith is among those shot. 17:40 ‚Äì Snipers Shughart and Gordon run out of ammunition and are killed when hostile Somalis overrun Durant's crash site. Every member of the crew are dead, except for Durant, who suffered a broken leg and injured back. Durant is carried off by militia (He was eventually released to the Red Cross, 11 days later.) During Operation Gothic Serpent in Somalia, Durant was the pilot of helicopter \\"Super Six Four.\\" It was the second MH-60L of two Black Hawk helicopters to crash during the Battle of Mogadishu on October 3, 1993. His helicopter was hit on the tail by a rocket-propelled grenade. That led to its crash about a mile southwest of the operation's target.\\"Encore Presentation: 1993 Interview With Michael Durant,\\" CNN: Larry King Weekend (January 27, 2002). (Both Gordon and Shughart received the Medal of Honor posthumously for their heroism in this action.) 17:45 ‚Äì Both convoys return to the base. Ninety-nine men remain trapped and surrounded in the city around the first downed Black Hawk. Corporal Smith is bleeding heavily, medic requests immediate evacuation. 19:08 ‚Äì Black Hawk Super 6-6 makes a daring re-supply run, dropping water, ammunition and medical supplies to the trapped force. It is badly damaged, cannot land to evacuate Corporal Smith, and limps back to base. 20:27 ‚Äì Ranger Corporal Jamie Smith dies. 21:00 ‚Äì Joint Task Force Command requests assistance from other commands. The Rescue Convoy, composed of two companies of 10th Mt. Division troops along with the remainder of Task Force Ranger, Pakistani tanks and Malaysian armored vehicles, is formed at Mogadishu's New Port, and begins planning the rescue. 23:23 ‚Äì The rescue convoy moves out, but as it approaches the crash site there is a large explosion which severely damages the convoy and makes the rescue almost impossible. However, a stockpile of rocket-propelled grenades in the city allows them to be used to great effect. A large proportion of the population is affected by power outages due to the Americans' destroying electrical substations in Mogadishu.  October 4, 1993  At Midnight 00:00 (24:00), the Rangers are still trapped inside Mogadishu without essential equipment, such as night vision devices. 01:55 -- Rescue convoy reaches the trapped Ranger force. A second half of the convoy reaches the site of Durant's downed Black Hawk. Durant and his crew are missing. 03:00 -- Forces are still struggling to remove the pinned body of Clifton \\"Elvis\\" Wolcott, pilot of downed Super Six One. 05:30 -- Rangers start moving from the city to the Pakistani Stadium, on foot. Wolcott's body is finally recovered. Vehicles roll out of the city. Elements of the Rangers are left to run to a rendez-vous point on National Street, covering the vehicles whilst enduring gunfire during the exfiltration. The road they take is known as the Mogadishu Mile. 06:30 -- The force returns to the Pakistani Stadium. 13 Americans are confirmed dead or mortally wounded, 73 injured, and 6 missing in action (5 are later confirmed dead, raising the death toll to 18, and 1 taken prisoner).

Waterbeds intended for medical therapies appear in various reports through the 19th century. The modern version, invented in San Francisco and patented in 1971, became a popular consumer item in the United States through the 1980s with up to 20% of the market in 1986 and 22% in 1987. Currently they account for less than 5% of new bed sales. Construction Waterbeds primarily consist of two types, hard-sided beds and soft-sided beds. A hard- sided waterbed consists of a water-containing mattress inside a rectangular frame of wood resting on a plywood deck that sits on a platform. A soft-sided waterbed consists of a water-containing mattress inside of a rectangular frame of sturdy foam, zippered inside a fabric casing, which sits on a platform. It looks like a conventional bed and is designed to fit existing bedroom furniture. The platform usually looks like a conventional foundation or box spring, and sits atop a reinforced metal frame. Early waterbed mattresses, and many inexpensive modern mattresses, have a single water chamber. When the water mass in these \\"free flow\\" mattresses is disturbed, significant wave action can be felt, and they need time to stabilize after a disturbance. Later types employed wave-reducing methods, including fiber batting. Some models only partially reduce wave motion, while more expensive models almost entirely eliminate wave motion. Water beds are normally heated. If no heater is used the water will equalize with the room air temperature typically about 70 F. In models with no heater, there are at least several inches of insulation above the water chamber. This partially eliminates the body-contouring benefit of a waterbed and the ability to control the bed temperature. For these reasons, most waterbeds have temperature control systems. Temperature is controlled via a thermostat and set to personal preference, but is most commonly average skin temperature, . A typical heating pad consumes 150‚Äì400 watts of power. Depending on insulation, bedding, temperature, use, and other factors, electricity usage may vary significantly. Waterbeds are usually constructed from soft polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or similar material. They can be repaired with practically any vinyl repair kit.  Types of waterbed mattresses  Source: * Free flow mattress: Also known as a full wave mattress. It contains only water but no baffles or inserts. * Semi-waveless mattress: Contains a few fiber inserts and/or baffles to control the water motion and increase support. * Waveless mattress: Contains many layers of fiber inserts and/or baffles to control the water motion and increase support. Frequently, the better mattresses contain additional layers in the center third of the mattress called special lumbar support. History in 1800s A form of waterbed was invented in 1833 by the Scottish physician Neil Arnott. Dr. Arnott's Hydrostatic Bed was devised to prevent bedsores in invalids, and comprised a bath of water with a covering of rubber-impregnated canvas, on which lighter bedding was placed. Arnott didn't patent it, permitting anyone to construct a bed to this design.An Encyclopaedia of Domestic Economy, Webster & Parkes, Harper & Brothers, NY, 1855 Google BooksDr. Arnott's Hydrostatic Bed, London Medical and Surgical Journal, Volume II, 1833 Google Books The use of a waterbed (for the ailing Mrs. Hale) is mentioned in Elizabeth Gaskell's 1855 novel North and South. The protagonist Graham is placed on a waterbed in a glass case during his coma of 203 years in the 1898 H. G. Wells novel \\"The Sleeper Awakes\\". In 1871, a waterbed was in use in Elmira, New York, for \\"invalids\\". It was briefly mentioned by Mark Twain in his article \\"A New Beecher Church\\", which was published in The New York Times on 23 July 1871. Twain wrote: \\"In the infirmary will be kept one or two water-beds (for invalids whose pains will not allow them to be on a less yielding substance) and half a dozen reclining invalid-chairs on wheels. The water-beds and invalid-chairs at present belonging to the church are always in demand, and never out of service\\". On May 18, 1863, a proposal for waterbed supplies was posted to newspapers by the USA Medical and Hospital Department, Medical Purveyor's Office, Washington D.C. The proposal requested a supplier for \\"water-beds, India Rubber Rubber Cushions, for air or water\\".https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86053570/1863-05-30/ed-1/seq-1/ A newspaper classified want ad in 1877 requested \\"AN INDIA RUBBER Water-bed. 3 feet by 2 feet, new or second hand. Call immediately at 1,222 Broadway.\\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030313/1877-09-14/ed-1/seq-18/ Heinlein descriptions Science fiction writer Robert A. Heinlein described therapeutic waterbeds in his novels Beyond This Horizon (1942), Double Star (1956), and Stranger in a Strange Land (1961). In 1980 Heinlein recalled in Expanded Universe: Heinlein made no attempt to build his invention, but its first builder, Charles Hall, was denied a patent claim based on Heinlein's \\"prior works\\". The Hall waterbed The modern waterbed was created by Charles Prior Hall in 1968, while he was a design student at San Francisco State University in California. Hall originally wanted to make an innovative chair. His first prototype was a vinyl bag with 300 pounds (136 kg) of cornstarch. Ultimately, he abandoned working on a chair, and settled on perfecting a bed. Hall was granted a patent on his waterbed, (#3,585,356) which he originally called \\"liquid support for human bodies.\\" The patent came to trial in 1991 in Intex v. Hall /wbx. The Patent was upheld in court and Hall received a $4.8 million judgment for infringement. In 1971, he founded Innerspace Environments, a manufacturing and sales company which became the leading retailer of waterbeds in the United States, with 30 owned-and-operated stores. Hall /wbx Received additional royalties from licensing. Some later lawsuits were dismissed because of laches. Sales peaked in 1987 at 22% of the domestic mattress industry. Although the waterbed was initially advertised for offering \\"undisturbed sleep\\", Hall admitted that customers \\"bought it for the sensual or the sexual part of it\\" and the sexual association advertising was highly effective in the 1970s and early 1980s. Henry Petroski of Duke University said of the waterbed: \\"Not only was it the cool new gadget, but it emerged during a time when the culture embraced anything different, especially a product that embodied sexual liberation\\". Advantages and disadvantages=Regarding usage The waterbed can be useful and comfortable for some and dangerous for others. The main feature of the waterbed found attractive is its form-fitting, pressure-minimizing nature. Not only is this a boon to those seeking mere comfort, but the removal of pressure from the spine can provide relief to those with back pain.\\"Mattresses and chronic lower back pain - Undergraduate research project at the Institute of Sports Science and Clinical Biomechanics\\". University of Southern Denmark, 2003 In addition, the distribution of weight can prevent bedsores among the paralytic and the comatose. However, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development warns that the form-fitting nature of the water-bed poses a danger to infants, providing a possibility of asphyxiation.http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/pubs_details.cfm?from=&pubs;_id=5794 Another advantage of a waterbed is its easy cleaning. It is impossible for dirt and dead skin particles to penetrate the water mattress, which can then be wiped periodically with a cloth and vinyl cleaner. The cover over the mattress can be regularly washed‚Äîthus virtually eliminating house dust mites in the bed. Dust mites can trigger asthma, eczema, and allergies in people sensitive to them. Other factors First, since some hard-sided waterbeds are of different sizes than other mattresses, bed sheets are harder to find and come in fewer varieties. Second, moving a waterbed is a more difficult process than moving a normal bed; the water must be drained and the frame disassembled, then the frame must be reassembled, the mattress refilled with water, and the water heated for a potentially long period to get the new water to the correct temperature. And heating the bed can be costly: a waterbed consumes between 300 and 1,500 kW¬∑h/year (36-180 USD at 12c/kW¬∑h, the US national average for residential energy), depending on the climate, bed size, and other factors. The energy usage can be decreased by about 60% with the use of a soft-sided waterbed.Waterbed Heating: Uncovering Energy Savings in the Bedroom Home Energy Magazine Online September/October 1994. Retrieved December 3, 2007. The ability to heat the bed is lost if there is a power outage. This can make the bed too cold to sleep on, particularly if the power outage occurs in midwinter, and the room cannot be heated. The water itself can pose challenges: occasionally, water mattresses may leak. Plastic liners will reduce damage, but emptying, patching, refilling, and reheating it (and sleeping elsewhere until all this is completed) is an inconvenience. Another factor is the weight of a waterbed. Waterbed mattresses, depending on the size, hold about 80 to 235 gallons of water, which could bring the weight of the entire bed to over 2,000lbs. This weight could pose a risk to the floor of the dwelling the bed is in. Some landlords may not allow a tenant to have a waterbed due to this, especially if it's on a higher floor.

The Great Revolt began in the year 66 CE, during the twelfth year of the reign of Nero, originating in Roman and Jewish religious tensions. The crisis escalated due to anti-taxation protests and attacks upon Roman citizens by the Jews.. The Roman governor, Gessius Florus, responded by plundering the Second Temple, claiming the money was for the Emperor, and the next day launching a raid on the city, arresting numerous senior Jewish figures. This prompted a wider, large-scale rebellion and the Roman military garrison of Judaea was quickly overrun by the rebels, while the pro-Roman king Herod Agrippa II, together with Roman officials, fled Jerusalem. As it became clear the rebellion was getting out of control, Cestius Gallus, the legate of Syria, brought in the Syrian army, based on Legion XII Fulminata and reinforced by auxiliary troops, to restore order and quell the revolt. Despite initial advances and the conquest of Jaffa, the Syrian Legion was ambushed and defeated by Jewish rebels at the Battle of Beth Horon with 6,000 Romans massacred and the Legion's aquila lost. During 66, the Judean provisional government was formed in Jerusalem including former High Priest Ananus ben Ananus, Joseph ben Gurion and Joshua ben Gamla elected as leaders. Yosef ben Matityahu (Josephus) was appointed the rebel commander in Galilee and Eleazar ben Hanania as the commander in Edom. Later, in Jerusalem, an attempt by Menahem ben Yehuda, leader of the Sicarii, to take control of the city failed. He was executed and the remaining Sicarii were ejected from the city. Simon bar Giora, a peasant leader, was also expelled by the new government. The experienced and unassuming general Vespasian was given the task, by Nero, of crushing the rebellion in Judaea province. Vespasian's son Titus was appointed as second-in-command. Given four legions and assisted by forces of King Agrippa II, Vespasian invaded Galilee in 67. Avoiding a direct attack on the reinforced city of Jerusalem, which was defended by the main rebel force, the Romans launched a persistent campaign to eradicate rebel strongholds and punish the population. Within several months Vespasian and Titus took over the major Jewish strongholds of Galilee and finally overran Jodapatha, which was under the command of Yosef ben Matityahu, as well as subdued Tarichaea, which brought an end to the war in Galilee.Josephus, De Bello Judaico (Wars of the Jews), book iv, chapter i, ¬ß 1 Driven from Galilee, Zealot rebels and thousands of refugees arrived in Jerusalem, creating political turmoil. Confrontation between the mainly Sadducee Jerusalemites and the mainly Zealot factions of the Northern Revolt under the command of John of Giscala and Eleazar ben Simon, erupted into bloody violence. With Idumeans entering the city and fighting by the side of the Zealots, the former high priest, Ananus ben Ananus, was killed and his faction suffered severe casualties. Simon bar Giora, commanding 15,000 militiamen, was then invited into Jerusalem by the Sadducee leaders to stand against the Zealots, and quickly took control over much of the city. Bitter infighting between factions of Simon, John and Eleazar followed through the year 69. After a lull in the military operations, owing to civil war and political turmoil in Rome, Vespasian was called to Rome and appointed as Emperor in 69. With Vespasian's departure, Titus moved to besiege the center of rebel resistance in Jerusalem in early 70. The first two walls of Jerusalem were breached within three weeks, but a stubborn rebel standoff prevented the Roman Army from breaking the third and thickest wall. Following a brutal seven-month siege, during which Zealot infighting resulted in the burning of the entire food supplies of the city, the Romans finally succeeded in breaching the defenses of the weakened Jewish forces in the summer of 70. Following the fall of Jerusalem, in the year 71 Titus left for Rome, leaving Legion X Fretensis to defeat the remaining Jewish strongholds including Herodium and Machaerus, finalizing the Roman campaign in Masada in 73‚Äì74. As the Second Temple in Jerusalem was destroyed, one of the events commemorated on Tisha B'Av, Judaism fell into crisis with the Sadducee movement falling into obscurity. However, one of the Pharisaic sages Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai was smuggled away from Jerusalem in a coffin by his students during the Titus siege. The rabbi obtained permission to establish a Judaic school at Yavne, which became a major center of Talmudic study. This became the crucial mark in the development of Rabbinic Judaism, which would allow Jews to continue their culture and religion without the Temple and essentially even in the diaspora. Despite the upheaval brought by the revolt, and the destruction of the Temple, Jewish life continued to thrive in Judea. Though dissatisfaction with Roman rule eventually led to the Bar Kokhba revolt in 132‚Äì136 CE. Background King Herod ruled Jerusalem from 37 BCE ‚Äì 4 BCE as a vassal king for the Roman Empire, having been appointed \\"King of the Jews\\" by the Roman Senate. Herod the Great was known as a tyrant, mostly because of his campaign to kill anyone who could claim the throne. Herod had all relatives of the previous dynasty, the Hasmonean dynasty, executed. This included his wife, the daughter of a Hasmonean King, and all of her family members.Cohen, Shaye. \\"Roman Domination: The Jewish Revolt and the Destruction of the Second Temple\\" in Ancient Israel: From Abraham to the Roman Destruction of the Temple, ed. Hershel Shanks (Prentice Hall, Biblical Archeology Society), 269. Herod also created a new line of nobility that would have loyalties to only him, known as the Herodians. He appointed new high priests from families that were not connected to the past dynasty. After Herod's death, several relatives made claims to the region, beginning with the Herodian Tetrarchy. Another aspect of Herod's legacy was economic hardship. Labor workers, which had been employed at Herod's large-scale construction sites, became impoverished.Cohen, Shaye. \\"Roman Domination: The Jewish Revolt and the Destruction of the Second Temple\\" in Ancient Israel: From Abraham to the Roman Destruction of the Temple, ed. Hershel Shanks (Prentice Hall, Biblical Archeology Society), 273 After Herod's death, the poor economy led to riots, and due to the lack of leadership in the region, the violence was not controlled. Herod's void of leadership made the region vulnerable to riots and can be considered an anticipatory cause of the Great Revolt. Following increasing Roman domination of the Eastern Mediterranean, the initially semi- independent Herodian dynasty was officially merged into the Roman Empire in the year 6 CE. The transition of the client kingdom into a Roman province brought a great deal of tension and a Jewish uprising by Judas of Galilee erupted as a response to the Census of Quirinius. This revolt was quickly put down by the Romans. After King Herod died, and after the deposition of Herod Archelaus, the Romans instituted procurators (technically Prefects before 41) to rule the Judeans.Cohen, Shaye. \\"Roman Domination: The Jewish Revolt and the Destruction of the Second Temple\\" in Ancient Israel: From Abraham to the Roman Destruction of the Temple, ed. Hershel Shanks (Prentice Hall, Biblical Archeology Society), 286. In the beginning, the Roman procurators respected the laws and customs of the Jewish people, allowing them to rest on the Sabbath, granting them exemption from pagan rituals, and even minting coins free of images despite the fact that elsewhere the coins bore images. When confronted with a procurator who disrespected their laws and customs, the Jews petitioned the governor of Syria to get the official removed, Roman Judea being essentially a \\"satellite of Syria\\".H.H. Ben-Sasson, A History of the Jewish Peoples, pp. 247‚Äì248: \\"Consequently, the province of Judea may be regarded as a satellite of Syria, though, in view of the measure of independence left to its governor in domestic affairs, it would be wrong to say that in the Julio-Claudian era Judea was legally part of the province of Syria.\\" The years 7‚Äì26 were relatively calm, but after 37 the province again began to be a source of trouble for Emperor Caligula. The cause of tensions in the east of the Empire was complicated, involving the spread of Greek culture, Roman Law and the rights of Jews in the empire. Caligula did not trust the prefect of Egypt, Aulus Avilius Flaccus. Flaccus had been loyal to Tiberius, had conspired against Caligula's mother and had connections with Egyptian separatists.Philo of Alexandria, Flaccus III.8, IV.21. In 38, Caligula sent Agrippa to Alexandria unannounced to check on Flaccus.Philo of Alexandria, Flaccus V.26‚Äì28. According to Philo, the visit was met with jeers from the Greek population, who saw Agrippa as the king of the Jews.Philo of Alexandria, Flaccus V.29. Flaccus tried to placate both the Greek population and Caligula by having statues of the emperor placed in Jewish synagogues.Philo of Alexandria, Flaccus VI.43. As a result, extensive religious riots broke out in the city.Philo of Alexandria, Flaccus VII.45. Caligula responded by removing Flaccus from his position and executing him.Philo of Alexandria, Flaccus XXI.185. In 39, Agrippa accused Herod Antipas, the tetrarch of Galilee and Perea, of planning a rebellion against Roman rule with the help of Parthia. Herod Antipas confessed and Caligula exiled him. Agrippa was rewarded with his territories.. Riots again erupted in Alexandria in 40 between Jews and Greeks.. Jews were accused of not honoring the emperor. Disputes occurred also in the city of Jamnia.Philo of Alexandria, On the Embassy to Gaius XXX.201. Jews were angered by the erection of a clay altar and destroyed it. In response, Caligula ordered the erection of a statue of himself in the Jewish Temple of Jerusalem.Philo of Alexandria, On the Embassy to Gaius XXX.203. The governor of Syria, Publius Petronius, fearing civil war if the order were carried out, delayed implementing it for nearly a year.Philo of Alexandria, On the Embassy to Gaius XXXI.213. Agrippa finally convinced Caligula to reverse the order. In the year 46, an insurrection by the Jews broke out in Judea province. The Jacob and Simon uprising was instigated by the two eponymous brothers, and lasted between 46‚Äì48. The revolt, which concentrated in the Galilee, began as sporadic insurgency and in 48 was put down by Roman authorities and both brothers executed. The relatively conciliatory Roman policy in Judaea changed with the institution of Gessius Florus as a procurator (64‚Äì66 CE). Florus helped set the revolt in motion by stealing from the temple treasury and murdering Jews who opposed the desecration. Faced with Florus as a procurator, the Jews attempted to garner support from the governor of Syria‚Äîat the time, Cestius Gallus. This plea for help failed to garner any support, however. The consequent riot which erupted was the first in a series of revolts, and led to the formation of several revolutionary factions. The revolt was further intensified when Florus attempted to stop the riots, which actually incited more revolutionary zeal. Timeline=Outbreak of the rebellion According to Josephus, the violence which began at Caesarea in 66 was provoked by Greeks of a certain merchant house sacrificing birds in front of a local synagogue. In reaction, one of the Jewish Temple clerks Eleazar ben Hanania ceased prayers and sacrifices for the Roman Emperor at the Temple. Protests over taxation joined the list of grievances and random attacks on Roman citizens and perceived 'traitors' occurred in Jerusalem.. The Jewish Temple was then breached by Roman troops at the order of the procurator Gessius Florus, who had seventeen talents removed from the treasury of the Temple, claiming the money was for the Emperor. In response to this action, the city fell into unrest and some of the Jewish population began to openly mock Florus by passing a basket around to collect money as if Florus was poor. Florus reacted to the unrest by sending soldiers into Jerusalem the next day to raid the city and arrest a number of the city leaders, who were later whipped and crucified, despite many of them being Roman citizens. Shortly, outraged Judean nationalist factions took up arms and the Roman military garrison of Jerusalem was quickly overrun by rebels. Fearing the worst, the pro-Roman king Herod Agrippa II and his sister Berenice fled Jerusalem to Galilee. Judean militias later moved upon Roman citizens of Judaea and pro- Roman officials, cleansing the country of any Roman symbols. Among other events, the Sicarii rebel faction surprised the Roman garrison of Masada and took over the fortress. Initially the outbreak of violence had been an internal factional conflict between the Jews; those who were in favour of rebellion and those who were opposed. Huge loss of life occurred, including that of the former High Priest Ananias. The Roman garrison on Jerusalem's western border became besieged and was unable to assist those who opposed rebellion. Eventually, led by their commander Metilius, the garrison surrendered in exchange for unhindered passage from the city, but, led by Eliezar, the Jewish rebels slaughtered all the surrendered soldiers, except for Metilius, who was forced to convert to Judaism. According to fourth- century church fathers Eusebius and Epiphanius, Jerusalem's Jewish Christians fled to Pella before the beginning of the war.Eusebius, Church History 3, 5, 3; Epiphanius, Panarion 29,7,7‚Äì8; 30, 2, 7; On Weights and Measures 15. See: Craig Koester, \\"The Origin and Significance of the Flight to Pella Tradition\\", Catholic Biblical Quarterly 51 (1989), pp. 90‚Äì106; P. H. R. van Houwelingen, \\"Fleeing forward: The departure of Christians from Jerusalem to Pella\\", Westminster Theological Journal 65 (2003); Jonathan Bourgel, \\"The Jewish Christians‚Äô Move from Jerusalem as a pragmatic choice\\", in: Dan Jaffe (ed), Studies in Rabbinic Judaism and Early Christianity, (Leyden: Brill, 2010), pp. 107‚Äì138 (https://www.academia.edu/4909339/THE_JEWISH_CHRISTIANS_MOVE_FROM_JERUSALEM_AS_A_PRAGMATIC_CHOICE). Gallus' campaign and Judean provisional government As a result of the unrest in Judaea, Cestius Gallus, the legate of Syria, assembled the Syrian legion XII Fulminata, reinforced with units of III Gallica, IIII Scythica, and VI Ferrata, plus auxiliaries and allies ‚Äì a total of approximately 30,000‚Äì36,000 troops, in order to restore order in the neighbouring province. The Syrian legion captured Narbata and also took Sepphoris, which surrendered without a fight. The Judean rebels, who withdrew from Sepphoris, took refuge at Atzmon hill, but were defeated following a short siege. Gallus later reached Acre in Western Galilee, and then marched on Caesarea and Jaffa, where he massacred some 8,400 people. Continuing his military campaign, Gallus took Lydda and Afek (Antipatris) and engaged Jerusalemite rebels in Geva, where he lost nearly 500 Roman troops to Judean rebels led by Simon bar Giora, reinforced by allied volunteers from Adiabene. The Syrian legion then invested Jerusalem, but for uncertain reasons and despite initial gains withdrew back towards the coast, where it was ambushed and defeated by Judean rebels at the Battle of Beth Horon, a result that shocked the Imperial leadership. The defeat of the Romans in Beth Horon is considered one of the worst military defeats of the Roman Empire by a rebel province throughout its history. Some 6,000 Roman troops were killed and many more wounded in the battle, with Legio XII Fulminata losing its aquila, as Gallus abandoned his troops in disarray, fleeing to Syria. Victorious Judean militias included Sadducee and Pharisee factions, with a major role also played by the peasantry led by Simon Bar Giora, Zealot faction led by Eleazar ben Simon, as well as elements of the Sicarii. Victorious Judean troops then took an initiative and attempted to expand their control to the Hellenistic city of Ashkelon, assembling an army commanded by Niger the Perean, Yohanan the Issean, and Shila the Babylonian and laying siege to the city. Despite the pillage of Ashkelon's countryside, the campaign was a disaster for the Judeans, who failed to take the city and lost some 8,000 militia men to the small defending Roman garrison. Many Jewish residents of Ashkelon were butchered by their Greco-Syrian and Roman neighbours as well in the aftermath. The failure to take Ashkelon changed the tactics of rebel Judean forces from open engagement to fortified warfare. Following the defeat of Gallus in Beth Horon, the People's Assembly was called under the spiritual guidance of Simeon ben Gamliel and thus the Judean provisional government was formed in Jerusalem. Former High Priest Ananus ben Ananus (Hanan ben Hanan) was appointed one of the government heads and began reinforcing the city, with other prominent figure of Joseph ben Gurion,Ben Zion, S. A Roadmap to the Heavens: An Anthropological Study of Hegemony Among Priests. p45. with Joshua ben Gamla taking a leading role. Josephus Matthias (Yosef ben Matityahu) was appointed the commander in Galilee and Golan, while Josephus Simon (Yosef ben Shimon) was appointed commander of Jericho, John the Issene (Yohanan Issean) commander of Jaffa, Lydda, Ammeus-Nikopolis and the whole Tamna area. Elazar Ananias (Eliezar ben Hananiya) the joint commander in Edom together with Jesus ben Sapphas (Joshua ben Zafia), with Niger the Perean the war hero during the Gallus campaign under their command. Menasseh was appointed for Perea and John Ananias (Yohanan ben Hananiya) to Gophna and Acrabetta. Later, in Jerusalem, an attempt by Menahem ben Yehuda, leader of the Sicarii, to take control of the city failed. He was executed and the remaining Sicarii were ejected from the city to their stronghold Masada, previously taken from a Roman garrison. Headquartered in Masada, the Sicarii notably terrorized nearby Judean villages such as Ein Gedi. Simon bar Giora, a charismatic and radical peasant leader, was also expelled from Jerusalem by the new government. The faction of the ousted Bar Giora took refuge in Masada as well and stayed there until the winter of 67‚Äì68. Vespasian's Galilee campaign Roman-era ballista (reconstructed at Gamla) Emperor Nero sent the general Vespasian to crush the rebellion. Vespasian, along with legions X Fretensis and V Macedonica, landed at Ptolemais in April 67. There he was joined by his son Titus, who arrived from Alexandria at the head of Legio XV Apollinaris, as well as by the armies of various local allies including that of king Agrippa II. Fielding more than 60,000 soldiers, Vespasian began operations by subjugating Galilee.Rocca S. 2008. The Forts of Judea 168 BCE ‚Äì CE 73. Osprey, Wellingborough, pp. 37‚Äì39, 47‚Äì48. Judean rebels in Galilee were divided into two camps, with forces loyal to the central government in Jerusalem commanded by Josephus and representing the wealthy and priesthood classes, whereas local Zealot militias were largely packed with the poor fishermen, farmers and refugees from Roman Syria. Many towns associated with the Jewish elite gave up without a fight ‚Äì including Sepphoris and Tiberias, although others had to be taken by force. Of these, Josephus provides detailed accounts of the sieges of Tarichaea, Yodfat (Jotapata) and Gamla; Gischala, the stronghold of Zealots, was also taken by force, as Zealot leaders abandoned it in the midst of the siege, heading with the bulk of their force for Jerusalem. By the year 68, Jewish resistance in the north had been crushed, and Vespasian made Caesarea Maritima his headquarters and methodically proceeded to cleanse the coastline of the country, avoiding direct confrontation with the rebels at Jerusalem. Based on questionable numbers from Josephus, it has been estimated that the Roman vanquishing of Galilee resulted in 100,000 Jews killed or sold into slavery. Judean regrouping and civil war A coin issued by the rebels in 68, note Paleo- Hebrew alphabet. Obverse: \\"Shekel, Israel. Year 3.\\" Reverse: \\"Jerusalem the Holy\\" Vespasian remained camped at Caesarea Maritima until spring 68, preparing for another campaign in the Judean and Samarian highlands. The Jews, who were driven out of Galilee, rebuilt Joppa (Jaffa), which had been destroyed earlier by Cestius Gallus. Surrounded by the Romans, they rebuilt the city walls, and used a light flotilla to demoralize commerce and interrupt the grain supply to Rome from Alexandria. In his The Jewish War Josephus wrote: Zealot leaders of the collapsed Northern revolt, headed by John of Giscala, managed to escape from Galilee to Jerusalem with the bulk of their forces. Packed with militants of many factions, including remains of forces loyal to the Judean provisional government and significant Zealot militia headed by Eleazar ben Simon, and largely cut off by Roman forces, Jerusalem quickly descended into anarchy, with the radical Zealots taking control of large parts of the fortified city. A brutal civil war then erupted, with the Zealots and the fanatical Sicarii executing anyone advocating surrender. Following a false message that the Judean provisional government had come to terms with the Roman Army, delivered by the Zealots to the Idumeans, a major force of some 20,000 armed Idumeans arrived to Jerusalem. It was allowed in by the Zealots and thus, with Idumeans entering Jerusalem and fighting by the side of the Zealots, the heads of the Judean provisional government, Ananus ben Ananus and Joseph ben Gurion, were killed with severe civilian casualties in the notorious Zealot Temple Siege, where Josephus reported 12,000 dead. Receiving the news of the carnage in Jerusalem, Simon bar Giora left Masada and began pillaging Idumea with his loyal troops, setting his headquarters in Na'an; he met little resistance and joined forces with Idumean leaders, including Jacob ben Susa. Judea campaign and New Emperor Roman milestone mentioning the destruction of highways during the revolt In the spring of 68, Vespasian began a systematic campaign to subdue various rebel-held strongholds in Judea proper, recapturing Afeq, Lydda, Javneh, and Jaffa that spring. He later continued into Idumea and Perea, and eventually to the Judean and Samarian highlands where Bar Giora's faction was causing major concern to the Romans. The Roman Army took Gophna, Akrabta, Bet-El, Ephraim and Hebron by July 69. While the war in Judea was in progress, great events were occurring in Rome. In the middle of 68, the emperor Nero's increasingly erratic behavior finally lost him all support for his position. The Roman Senate, the Praetorian Guard and several prominent army commanders conspired for his removal. When the senate declared Nero an enemy of the people, he fled Rome and committed suicide with the help of a secretary. The newly installed emperor, the former Governor of Spain Galba, was murdered after just a few months by his rival, Otho, triggering a civil war that came to be known as the Year of the Four Emperors. In 69, though previously uninvolved, the popular Vespasian was also hailed emperor by the legions under his command. He decided, upon gaining further widespread support, to leave his son Titus to finish the war in Judea, while he returned to Rome to claim the throne from the usurper Vitellius, who had already deposed Otho. With the departure of Vespasian, who had opposed an open siege upon Jerusalem, fearing to lose many troops against the fortified city, Titus advanced his legions upon the capital of the rebellious province. Conquering town after town, Titus quickly advanced through the hill country, while the brutal suppression created an immense wave of Judean refugees, seeking shelter in fortified Jerusalem. The Judean rebels avoided direct confrontation with the Roman troops, as multiple factions were mostly interested in their own control and survival, rather than Roman defeat. Though weakened by the brutal civil war within the city, the Zealot factions could still field a significant number of troops to oppose an immediate Roman conquest of the capital. John tricked and assassinated Eleazar and began a despotic rule over the city. Simon bar Giora, commanding a major force of 15,000 troops, was then invited into Jerusalem by the remaining provisional government leaders to stand against the Zealot faction of John, and quickly took control over much of the city. Bitter infighting between the factions of Bar-Giora and John followed through the year 69. Capture of Jerusalem The siege of Jerusalem, the fortified capital city of the province, quickly turned into a stalemate. Unable to breach the city's defenses, the Roman armies established a permanent camp just outside the city, digging a trench around the circumference of its walls and building a wall as high as the city walls themselves around Jerusalem. Anyone caught in the trench attempting to flee the city would be captured and crucified in lines on top of the dirt wall facing into Jerusalem, with as many as five hundred crucifixions occurring in a day. The two Zealot leaders, John of Gischala and Simon Bar Giora, only ceased hostilities and joined forces to defend the city when the Romans began to construct ramparts for the siege. During the infighting inside the city walls, a stockpiled supply of dry food was intentionally burned by the Zealots to induce the defenders to fight against the siege, instead of negotiating peace; as a result many city dwellers and soldiers died of starvation during the siege. Tacitus, a contemporary historian, notes that those who were besieged in Jerusalem amounted to no fewer than six hundred thousand, that men and women alike and every age engaged in armed resistance, that everyone who could pick up a weapon did, and that both sexes showed equal determination, preferring death to a life that involved expulsion from their country. Josephus puts the number of the besieged at near 1 million. The treasures of Jerusalem taken by the Romans (detail from the Arch of Titus). In the summer of 70, following a seven-month siege, Titus eventually used the collapse of several of the city walls to breach Jerusalem, ransacking and burning nearly the entire city. The Romans began by attacking the weakest spot: the third wall. It was built shortly before the siege so it did not have as much time invested in its protection. They succeeded towards the end of May and shortly afterwards broke through the more important second wall. During the final stages of the Roman attack, Zealots under John of Giscala still held the Temple, while the Sicarii, led by Simon Bar Giora, held the upper city. The Second Temple (the renovated Herod's Temple), one of the last fortified bastions of the rebellion, was destroyed on Tisha B'Av (29 or 30 July 70). All three walls of Jerusalem were eventually destroyed as well as the Temple and the citadels; the city was then put to the torch, with most survivors taken into slavery; some of those overturned stones and their place of impact can still be seen. John of Giscala surrendered at Agrippa II's fortress of Jotapata and was sentenced to life imprisonment. The famous Arch of Titus in Rome depicts Roman legionaries carrying the Temple of Jerusalem's treasuries, including the Menorah, during Titus' triumphal procession in Rome.Titus' Triumphal Arch With the fall of Jerusalem, some insurrection still continued in isolated locations in Judea, lasting as long as 73. Last strongholds Remnants of one of several legionary camps at Masada in Israel, just outside the circumvallation wall at the bottom of the image. During the spring of 71, Titus set sail for Rome. A new military governor was then appointed from Rome, Sextus Lucilius Bassus, whose assigned task was to undertake the \\"mopping-up\\" operations in Judea. He used X Fretensis to besiege and capture the few remaining fortresses that still resisted. Bassus took Herodium, and then crossed the Jordan to capture the fortress of Machaerus on the shore of the Dead Sea and then continued into the Forest of Jardus on the northern shore of the Dead Sea to pursue some 3,000 Judean rebels under the leadership of Judah ben Ari, whom he swiftly defeated.Tropper, A. Rewriting ancient Jewish history: the history of the Jews in Roman times and the new historical method: p92. Because of illness, Bassus did not live to complete his mission. Lucius Flavius Silva replaced him, and moved against the last Judean stronghold, Masada, in the autumn of 72. He used Legio X, auxiliary troops, and thousands of Jewish prisoners, for a total of 10,000 soldiers. After his orders for surrender were rejected, Silva established several base camps and circumvallated the fortress. According to Josephus, when the Romans finally broke through the walls of this citadel in 73, they discovered that 960 of the 967 defenders had committed suicide.

Though dissatisfaction with Roman rule eventually led to the Bar Kokhba revolt in 132‚Äì136 CE. The religious reaction to the destruction was evident through changes in halakhah (Jewish law), midrashim, and book of 2 Baruch, all of which mention the agony of the temple‚Äôs destruction. Many of the Jewish rebels were scattered or sold into slavery. Josephus claimed that 1,100,000 people were killed during the siege, 97,000 were captured and enslaved and many others fled to areas around the Mediterranean. A significant portion of the deaths was due to illnesses and hunger brought about by the Romans. \\"A pestilential destruction upon them, and soon afterward such a famine, as destroyed them more suddenly.\\" The Jewish Encyclopedia article on the Hebrew Alphabet states: \\"Not until the revolts against Nero and against Hadrian did the Jews return to the use of the old Hebrew script on their coins, which they did from motives similar to those which had governed them two or three centuries previously; both times, it is true, only for a brief period.\\"Alphabet, the Hebrew. Coins, and Bibliography 6 According to Philostratus' Life of Apollonius, Titus refused to accept a wreath of victory offered by the groups neighboring Judaea, on the grounds that he had only been the instrument of divine wrath.Philostratus, Vita Apollonii, 6.2.9.1 Before Vespasian's departure, the Pharisaic sage and Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai obtained his permission to establish a Judaic school at Yavne. Zakkai was smuggled away from Jerusalem in a coffin by his students. Later, this school became a major center of Talmudic study (see Mishnah). This became the crucial mark in the development of the Rabbinic Judaism, which would allow Jews to continue their culture and religion without the Temple and essentially even in diaspora. Further wars The Great Revolt of Judea marked the beginning of the Jewish‚ÄìRoman wars, which radically changed the Eastern Mediterranean and had a crucial impact on the development of the Roman Empire and the Jews. Despite the defeat of the Great Revolt, tensions continued to build in the region. With the Parthian threat from the East, major Jewish communities throughout the Eastern Mediterranean revolted in 117 CE. The revolt, known as the Kitos War in 115‚Äì117, which took place mainly in the diaspora (in Cyprus, Egypt, Mesopotamia and only marginally in Judea), while poorly-organized, was extremely violent and took two years for the Roman armies to subdue. Although only the final chapter of the Kitos War was fought in Judea, the revolt is considered part of the Jewish‚ÄìRoman Wars. The immense number of casualties during the Kitos War depopulated Cyrenaica and Cyprus and also reduced Jewish and Greco-Roman populations in the region. The third and final conflict in the Jewish‚ÄìRoman Wars erupted in Judea, known as the Bar Kokhba revolt of 132‚Äì136 CE, concentrating in Judea province and led by Simon bar Kokhba. Although Bar Kokhba was initially successful against Roman forces and established a short- lived state, the eventual Roman effort defeated Bar Kokhba's rebels. The result was an almost complete genocide of the Jews, a ban on Judaism, and the renaming of the province from Judea to Syria Palaestina. Although Hadrian's death (in 137 CE) eased restrictions and persecution of the Jews, the survivors of his campaign were not many. Only a small Jewish community of several thousand survived in Galilee, with smaller communities in other parts of the Mediterranean. Rise of the rabbis The vocation of rabbi was founded by Rabban Gamaliel, a Pharisee, but the vocation's relationship to the Pharisees is debated. In any case, scholars agree that the rabbis replaced the High Priest's role in Jewish society after 70 CE.Cohen, Shaye. \\"Roman Domination: The Jewish Revolt and the Destruction of the Second Temple\\" in Ancient Israel: From Abraham to the Roman Destruction of the Temple, ed. Hershel Shanks (Prentice Hall, Biblical Archeology Society), 297. The destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE marked a turning point in Jewish history. In the absence of the Temple, the synagogue became the center of Jewish life. When the Temple was destroyed, Judaism responded by more devoted observance to the commandments of the Torah. Synagogues replaced the temple as a central meeting place, and the rabbis replaced high priests as Jewish community leaders. Because of the rabbis' dominance after 70 CE, the era is called the rabbinic period. The rabbis filled the void of Jewish leadership in the aftermath of the Great Revolt, and they created a new kind of Judaism through their literature and teachings.Cohen, Shaye. \\"Roman Domination: The Jewish Revolt and the Destruction of the Second Temple\\" in Ancient Israel: From Abraham to the Roman Destruction of the Temple, ed. Hershel Shanks (Prentice Hall, Biblical Archeology Society), 298. Sources The main account of the revolt comes from Josephus, the former Jewish commander of Galilee, who, after capture by the Romans after the Siege of Yodfat, attempted to end the rebellion by negotiating with the Judeans on Titus's behalf. Josephus and Titus became close friends, and later Josephus was granted Roman citizenship and a pension. He never returned to his homeland after the fall of Jerusalem, living in Rome as a historian under the patronage of Vespasian and Titus.

Previously, before the communist regime, Romanian secret police was called Siguran»õa Statului. It was founded on 30 August 1948, with help from the Soviet NKVD, while Romania was practically under the Red Army's occupation. Following the overthrow of Nicolae Ceau»ôescu in 1989, the DSS lived on until 1991, when Parliament approved a law reorganizing the DSS into various subdivisions. The Securitate was, in proportion to Romania's population, one of the largest secret police forces in the Eastern bloc.Craig S. Smith, \\"Eastern Europe Struggles to Purge Security Services\\", The New York Times, December 12, 2006 The first budget of the Securitate in 1948 stipulated a number of 4,641 positions, of which 3,549 were filled by February 1949: 64% were workers, 4% peasants, 28% clerks, 2% persons of unspecified origin, and 2% intellectuals. By 1951, the Securitate's staff had increased fivefold, while in January 1956, the Securitate had 25,468 employees.Cristian Troncota, \\"Securitatea: √énceputurile\\" , Magazin Istoric, 1998 At its height, the Securitate employed some 11,000 agents and had a half- million informers for a country with a population of 22 million by 1985. Under Ceau»ôescu, the Securitate was one of the most brutal secret police forces in the world, responsible for the arrests, torture and deaths of thousands of people. History=Founding The General Directorate for the Security of the People (Romanian initials: DGSP, but more commonly just called the Securitate) was officially founded on 30 August 1948, by Decree 221/30 of the Presidium of the Great National Assembly. However, it had precursors going back to August 1944, following King Michael's Coup. Its stated purpose was to \\"defend democratic conquests and guarantee the safety of the Romanian People's Republic against both internal and external enemies.\\" The Securitate was created with the help of SMERSH, the NKVD counter-intelligence unit. The SMERSH operation in Romania, called Brigada MobilƒÉ (\\"The Mobile Brigade\\"), was led until 1948 by NKVD colonel Alexandru Nicolschi. The first Director of the Securitate was NKVD general Gheorghe Pintilie (born Panteleymon Bondarenko, nicknamed \\"Pantiu»ôa\\"). Alexandru Nicolschi (by then a general) and another Soviet officer, Major General Vladimir Mazuru, held the deputy directorships. Wilhelm Einhorn was the first Securitate secretary. As Vladimir TismƒÉneanu says, \\"If one does not grasp the role of political thugs such as the Soviet spies Pintilie Bondarenko (Pantiu»ôa) and Alexandru Nikolski in the exercise of terror in Romania during the most horrible Stalinist period, and their personal connections with Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej and members of his entourage, it is difficult to understand the origins and the role of the Securitate\\".Stalinism for All Seasons: A Political History of Romanian Communism (University of California Press, Berkeley, 2003). p. 20 Initially, many of the agents of the Securitate were former Royal Security Police (named General Directorate of Safety Police--Direc»õia GeneralƒÉ a Poli»õiei de Siguran»õƒÉ in Romanian) members. However, before long, Pantiu»ôa ordered anyone who had served the monarchy's police in any capacity arrested, and in the places of the Royal Security Policemen, he hired ardent members of the Romanian Communist Party (PCR), to ensure total loyalty within the organization. Method The Securitate surveillance took place in different ways: general intelligence surveillance (supraveghere informativƒÉ generalƒÉ, abbreviated \\"S.I.G.\\"); priority intelligence surveillance (supraveghere informativƒÉ prioritarƒÉ, abbreviated \\"S.I.P.\\"); clearance file (mapƒÉ de verificare, abbreviated \\"M.V.\\"); individual surveillance dossier (dosar de urmƒÉrire individualƒÉ, abbreviated \\"D.U.I.\\"); target dossier (dosar de obiectiv), the target being, for example, an institute, a hospital, a school or a company; case dossier (dosar de problemƒÉ), the targets being former political prisoners, former Iron Guard members, religious organizations, etc.; and element dossier (dosar de mediu), targeting writers, priests, etc. In the 1980s, the Securitate launched a massive campaign to stamp out dissent in Romania, manipulating the country's population with vicious rumors (such as supposed contacts with Western intelligence agencies), machinations, frameups, public denunciations, encouraging conflict between segments of the population, public humiliation of dissidents, toughened censorship and the repression of even the smallest gestures of independence by intellectuals. Often the term \\"intellectual\\" was used by the Securitate to describe dissidents with higher education, such as college and university students, writers, directors and scientists who opposed the philosophy of the Romanian Communist Party. Assassinations were also used to silence dissent, such as the attempt to kill high-ranking defector Ion Mihai Pacepa, who received two death sentences from Romania in 1978, and on whose head Ceau»ôescu decreed a bounty of two million US dollars. Yasser Arafat and Muammar al-Gaddafi each added one more million dollars to the reward.\\"Book Inspired Counter-Revolution\\" by Alfred S. Regnery, published in Human Events, October 22, 2002 In the 1980s, Securitate officials allegedly hired Carlos the Jackal to assassinate Pacepa.\\"The Securitate Arsenal for Carlos,\\" Ziua, Bucharest, 2004 Forced entry into homes and offices and the planting of microphones was another tactic the Securitate used to extract information from the general population. Telephone conversations were routinely monitored, and all internal and international fax and telex communications were intercepted. In August 1977, when the Jiu Valley coal miners' unions went on strike, several leaders died prematurely, and it was later discovered that Securitate doctors had subjected them to five-minute chest X-rays in an attempt to have them develop cancer. After birth rates fell, Securitate agents were placed in gynecological wards while regular pregnancy tests were made mandatory for women of child-bearing age, with severe penalties for anyone who was found to have terminated a pregnancy. The Securitate's presence was so ubiquitous that it was believed one out of four Romanians was an informer. In truth, the Securitate deployed one agent or informer for every 43 Romanians, which was still large enough to make it practically impossible for dissidents to organize. The regime deliberately fostered this sense of ubiquity, believing that the fear of being watched was sufficient to bend the people to Ceau»ôescu's will. For example, one shadow group of dissidents limited itself to only three families; any more than that would have attracted Securitate attention. In truth, the East German Stasi was even more ubiquitous than the Securitate; counting informers, the Stasi had one spy for every 6.5 East Germans. Downfall After Ceau»ôescu was ousted, Securitate lived on until 1991, when Parliament approved a law reorganizing the Securitate into a few special and secret services like the SRI (Romanian Intelligence Service) (with internal tasks such as counterespionage), the SIE (Foreign Intelligence Service), the SPP (Protection and Guard Service) (the former Directorate V), the STS (Special Telecommunications Service) (the former General Directorate for Technical Operations), etc. Nonetheless, in early 1991, large numbers of protesters converged on Securitate offices throughout the country to demand access to the agency's files. Today, the National Council for the Study of the Securitate Archives (abbreviated CNSAS, for Consiliul Na≈£ional pentru Studierea Arhivelor SecuritƒÉ≈£ii) \\"is the authority that administrates the archives of the former communist secret services in Romania and develops educational programs and exhibitions with the aim of preserving the memories of victims of the communist regime.\\"http://www.cnsas.ro/documente/evenimente/prezentare%20proiect%20engl.pdf Subdivisions=General Directorate for Technical Operations The General Directorate for Technical Operations was a key part of the Securitate. Created with Soviet assistance in 1954, it monitored all voice and electronic communications in and out of Romania. They bugged telephones and intercepted all telegraphs and telex messages, as well as placing microphones in both public and private buildings. Directorate for Counterespionage The Directorate for Counterespionage surveyed all foreigners in Romania, and did their utmost to impede contact between foreigners and Romanians. Contact that was impossible to stop was instead monitored. It enforced a variety of measures to prevent Romanians living with foreign nationals, one of these being the requirement to report any known foreigners to the Securitate within 24 hours. One of the tasks of this Directorate was to stop Romanians from seeking asylum in foreign embassies. Directorate for Foreign Intelligence The Directorate for Foreign Intelligence conducted Romania's espionage operations in other countries, such as those of Western Europe. Among those operations sanctioned by the Communist government were industrial espionage to obtain nuclear technology, and plots to assassinate dissidents, such as Matei Pavel Haiducu was tasked with, though he informed French authorities, faking the assassinations before defecting to France. Directorate for Penitentiaries The Directorate for Penitentiaries operated Romania's prisons, which were notorious for their horrendous conditions. Prisoners were routinely beaten, denied medical attention, had their mail taken away from them, and sometimes even administered lethal doses of poison. Directorate for Internal Security The Directorate for Internal Security was originally given the task of monitoring the activities going on in the PCR. But after Ion Mihai Pacepa's defection in 1978 and his exposing details of the Ceau»ôescu regime, such as the collaboration with Arab radical groups, massive espionage on American industry targets and elaborate efforts to rally Western political support, international infiltration and espionage in the Securitate only increased, much to Ceau»ôescu's anger. In order to solve this problem the entire Division was reorganized and was charged with rooting out dissent in the PCR. A top secret division of this Directorate was formed from forces loyal personally to Ceau»ôescu and charged with monitoring the Securitate itself. It acted almost as a Securitate for the Securitate, and was responsible for bugging the phones of other Securitate officers and PCR officials to ensure total loyalty. National Commission for Visas and Passports The National Commission for Visas and Passports controlled all travel and immigration in and out of Romania. In effect, traveling abroad was all but impossible for anyone but highly placed Party officials, and any ordinary Romanian who applied for a passport was immediately placed under surveillance. Many Jews and ethnic Germans were given passports and exit visas through tacit agreements with the Israeli and West German governments.June 29th 1973 Agreement between the Socialist Romania and German Federation Directorate for Security Troops The Directorate for Security Troops acted as a 20,000-strong paramilitary force for the government, equipped with artillery and armoured personnel carriers. The security troops selected new recruits from the same annual pool of conscripts that the armed services used. The police performed routine law enforcement functions including traffic control and issuance of internal identification cards to citizens. Organized in the late 1940s to defend the new regime, in 1989 the security troops had 20,000 soldiers. They were an elite, specially trained paramilitary force organized like motorized rifle (infantry) units equipped with small arms, artillery, and armored personnel carriers, but their mission was considerably different. The security troops were directly responsible through the Minister of the Interior to Ceau»ôescu. They guarded important installations including PCR judet and central office buildings and radio and television stations. The Ceau»ôescu regime presumably could call the security troops into action as a private army to defend itself against a military coup d'√©tat or other domestic challenges and to suppress antiregime riots, demonstrations, or strikes. To ensure total loyalty amongst these crack troops, there were five times as many political officers in the Directorate for Security Troops than there were in the regular army. They adhered to stricter discipline than in the regular military, but they were rewarded with special treatment and enjoyed far superior living conditions compared to their countrymen. They guarded television and radio stations, and PCR buildings and in the event of a coup, would have been called in to protect the regime. After the Revolution, the Directorate for Security Troops was disbanded and replaced first by the Guard and Order Troops (Trupele de PazƒÉ »ôi Ordine), and in July 1990 by the Gendarmerie. Directorate for Militia The Directorate for Militia controlled Romania's Mili»õia, the standard police force, which carried out regular policing tasks such as traffic control, public order, etc. In 1990 it was replaced by the Romanian Police. Directorate V Directorate V were bodyguards for important governmental officials.

History=18th century During the eighteenth century, British justice used a wide variety of measures to punish crime, including fines, the pillory and whipping. Transportation to the Thirteen American Colonies was often offered, until 1776, as an alternative to the death penalty, which could be imposed for many offenses including pilfering. When they ran out of prisons in 1776 they used old sailing vessels which came to be called hulks as places of temporary confinement.DouglasHay, \\"Crime and justice in eighteenth-and nineteenth- century England.\\" Crime and Justice 2 (1980): 45‚Äì84.Phillip Thurmond Smith, Policing Victorian London: political policing, public order, and the London Metropolitan Police (1985). The most notable reformer was John Howard who, having visited several hundred prisons across England and Europe, beginning when he was high sheriff of Bedfordshire, published The State of the Prisons in 1777. He was particularly appalled to discover prisoners who had been acquitted but were still confined because they couldn't pay the jailer's fees. He proposed that each prisoner should be in a separate cell with separate sections for women felons, men felons, young offenders and debtors. The prison reform charity, the Howard League for Penal Reform, takes its name from John Howard. The Penitentiary Act which passed in 1779 following his agitation introduced solitary confinement, religious instruction and a labor regime and proposed two state penitentiaries, one for men and one for women. These were never built due to disagreements in the committee and pressures from wars with France and jails remained a local responsibility. But other measures passed in the next few years provided magistrates with the powers to implement many of these reforms and eventually in 1815 jail fees were abolished.Simon Devereaux, \\"The making of the Penitentiary Act, 1775‚Äì1779.\\" Historical Journal 42.2 (1999): 405‚Äì433. Early 19th century Quakers such as Elizabeth Fry continued to publicize the dire state of prisons as did Charles Dickens in his novels David Copperfield and Little Dorrit about the Marshalsea.Robert Alan Cooper, \\"Jeremy Bentham, Elizabeth Fry, and English Prison Reform.\\" Journal of the History of Ideas 42.4 (1981): 675‚Äì690. Samuel Romilly managed to repeal the death penalty for theft in 1806, but repealing it for other similar offences brought in a political element that had previously been absent. The Society for the Improvement of Prison Discipline, founded in 1816, supported both the Panopticon for the design of prisons and the use of the treadwheel as a means of hard labor. By 1824, 54 prisons had adopted this means of discipline. Robert Peel's Gaols Act 1823 attempted to impose uniformity in the country but local prisons remained under the control of magistrates until the Prison Act 1877. The American separate system attracted the attention of some reformers and led to the creation of Millbank Prison in 1816 and Pentonville prison in 1842. By now the end of transportation to Australia and the use of hulks was in sight and Joshua Jebb set an ambitious program of prison building with one large prison opening per year.Eric Stockdale, \\"The Rise of Joshua Jebb, 1837-1850.\\" British Journal of Criminology 16 (1976): 164+. 1860-1914  The main principles were separation and hard labour for serious crimes, using treadwheels and cranks. However, by the 1860s public opinion was calling for harsher measures in reaction to an increase in crime which was perceived to come from the 'flood of criminals' released under the penal servitude system. The reaction from the committee set up under the commissioner of prisons, Colonel Edmund Frederick du Cane, was to increase minimum sentences for many offences with deterrent principles of 'hard labour, hard fare, and a hard bed'. In 1877 he encouraged Disraeli's government to remove all prisons from local government and held a firm grip on the prison system till his forced retirement in 1895. He also established a tradition of secrecy which lasted till the 1970s so that even magistrates and investigators were unable to see the insides of prisons. By the 1890s the prison population was over 20,000. The British penal system underwent a transition from harsh punishment to reform, education, and training for post-prison livelihoods. The reforms were controversial and contested. In 1877-1914 era a series of major legislative reforms enabled significant improvement in the penal system. In 1877, the previously localized prisons were nationalized in the Home Office under a Prison Commission. The Prison Act 1898 enabled the Home Secretary to and multiple reforms on his own initiative, without going through the politicized process of Parliament. The Probation of Offenders Act 1907 introduced a new probation system that drastically cut down the prison population, while providing a mechanism for the transition back to normal life. The Criminal Justice Administration Act of 1914 required courts to allow a reasonable time before imprisonment was ordered for people who did not pay their fines. Previously tens of thousands of prisoners had been sentenced solely for that reason. The Borstal system after 1908 was organized to reclaim young offenders, and the Children Act of 1908 prohibited imprisonment under age 14, and strictly limited that of ages 14 to 16. The principal reformer was Sir Evelyn Ruggles-Brise. the chair of the Prison Commission.R.C.K. Ensor. England 1870-1914 (1937) pp 520-21.J. W. Fox, ‚Äò'The Modern English Prison ‚Äò‚Äô (1934). =Winston Churchill= Major reforms were championed by the Liberal Party government in 1906-14. The key player was Winston Churchill when he was the Liberal Home Secretary, 1910-11.Jamie Bennett, \\"The Man, the Machine and the Myths: Reconsidering Winston Churchill‚Äôs Prison Reforms.\\" in Helen Johnston, ed., Punishment and Control in Historical Perspective (2008) pp. 95-114. online He first achieved fame as a prisoner in the Boer war in 1899. He escaped after 28 days and the media, and his own book, made him a national hero overnight.Candice Millard, Hero of the Empire: The Boer War, a Daring Escape, and the Making of Winston Churchill (2016) He later wrote, \\"I certainly hated my captivity more than I have ever hated any other in my whole life....Looking back on those days I've always felt the keenest pity for prisoners and captives.\\" As Home Secretary he was in charge of the nation's penal system. Biographer Paul Addison says. \\"More than any other Home Secretary of the 20th century, Churchill was the prisoner's friend. He arrived at the Home Office with the firm conviction that the penal system was excessively harsh\\". He worked to reduce the number sent to prison in the first place, especially those imprisoned for their delay in paying fines, or for debts. He shortened their terms, and made life in prison more tolerable, and rehabilitation more likely.Addison, p. 51. His reforms were not politically popular, but they had a major long-term impact on the British penal system.Edward Moritz, Jr., \\"Winston Churchill - Prison Reformer,\\" The Historian 20#4 (1958), pp. 428-440 Victor Bailey, \\"Churchill As Home-Secretary --Prison Reform.\\" History Today vol 35 (March 1985): 10‚Äì13. Borstal system In 1894-5 Herbert Gladstone's Committee on Prisons showed that criminal propensity peaked from the mid-teens to the mid-twenties. He took the view that central government should break the cycle of offending and imprisonment by establishing a new type of reformatory, that was called Borstal after the village in Kent which housed the first one. The movement reached its peak after the first world war when Alexander Paterson became commissioner, delegating authority and encouraging personal responsibility in the fashion of the English Public school: cellblocks were designated as 'houses' by name and had a housemaster. Cross-country walks were encouraged, and no one ran away. Prison populations remained at a low level until after the Second World War when Paterson died and the movement was unable to update itself. Some aspects of Borstal found their way into the main prison system, including open prisons and housemasters, renamed assistant governors and many Borstal-trained prison officers used their experience in the wider service. But in general the prison system in the twentieth century remained in Victorian buildings which steadily became more and more overcrowded with inevitable results. Recent Early in 2004, it was announced that the Prison Service would be integrated into a new National Offender Management Service later in the year. , rationalisation of the prison management system is underway with the advent of the Titan Prison concept. Six new reform prisons are to be built with prison governors in charge of operation and budget. Penal charities claimed reforms would fail if prisoners were \\"crammed into filthy institutions with no staff\\". In 2017 the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) became Her Majesty's Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS). Current issues The imprisonment rate for England and Wales is the highest in western Europe, England and Wales have highest imprisonment rate in western Europe The Guardian and at roughly the \\"midpoint\\" worldwide. The prison population numbered 83,165 in August 2018. The Ministry of Justice has projected that this will rise to 86,400 by March 2023.Prison population set to rise despite overcrowding crisis The Guardian The government plans to increase the time some prisoners spend in prison.'Lynch mob politics': experts denounce plans for longer jail terms The Guardian Recent issues affecting the prison system include overcrowding, lower levels of staffing and the increased availability of synthetic cannabinoids and drones for smuggling. Despite a fall in crime rates between 2010 and 2016, the prison population continued to rise, while staff numbers were reduced, Surge in jail population adds to strain on overstretched prison service The Guardian with the number of prison officers being reduced from 25,000 in 2010 to about 18,000 in 2015. There has been a particularly sharp rise in the number of prisoners above the age of 60.Ageing prison population 'sees officers working as carers' BBC The head of the Prison Governors' Association suggested in 2017 that prison sentences of less than a year should be replaced with alternative punishments.Release short-term inmates from 'bursting' jails, say governors BBC Another issue is the age of several prisons. A 2015 announcement from the government agreed that old prisons are more expensive to run and often unsuitable in design, such as having \\"dark corners which too often facilitate violence and drug- taking.\\" In July 2018, the Government announced \\"a ¬£30 million investment including ¬£16 million to improve conditions for prisoners and staff and ¬£7 million on new security measures, including airport-security style scanners, improved searching techniques and phone-blocking technology\\".https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prison-officer-safety- equipment-rolled-out In The Lammy Review, a report commissioned by the Conservative government and led by David Lammy MP, it was found that whilst adult prison populations are 24% BAME individuals, only 6% of prison staff were from Black and Minority Ethnic communities. This was one of the significant factors listed as the cause for mis-trust between BAME prisoners and prison staff which then impacts the percentage of black and minority ethnic prisoners that have access to rehabilitation programmes in prison and therefore, increase their chances of re-offending after leaving prison. Prison officers=Recent development Historically, uniformed prison staff were under the supervision of a small number of very senior and experienced officers who held one of three chief officer ranks. Below these were the ranks of principal officer (rank badgetwo Bath stars) and senior officer (rank badgesingle Bath star). However, as a reorganisation in the 1980s, termed \\"A Fresh Start\\", saw these chief officer ranks abolished, and their role taken by junior grade prison governors. From 2000 onwards, as part of a process to increase accountability within the prison service, all operational officers have been assigned a 3-digit unique identification number, worn on all items of uniform (typically as an embroidered epaulette) along with the 2-digit LIDS identification code of the specific prison or institution. From 2010 onwards, attempts were made to replace the principal officer rank with non-uniformed junior managers (developing prison service managers - DPSM), although this process was neither entirely successful nor fully implemented. Further restructuring in 2013, known as \\"Fair & Sustainable\\", saw the remaining historic ranks and rank insignia phased out in favour of a new structure, and simple stripes on uniform epaulettes to indicate grades. Uniforms Prison officers wear a white shirt and black tie, black trousers, black boots, black 'woolly-pully' jumper or black soft shell fleece-jacket.https://prisonandprobationjobs.gov.uk/prison-officer/life- as-a-prison-officer/ Stab vests may be worn for certain occasions, such as prisoner transports.https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs- public/thumbnails/image/2013/05/31/07/april.jpg Prison Officers working in the Juvenile or Immigration Detention estate wear a 'soft uniform' consisting of a polo shirt opposed to white shirt with black tie.reference needed For formal occasions, a dark tunic with whistle on a chain is worn with a tie and peaked cap for men and bowler cap and open collar for women. Black gloves and shoes are worn, as are any medals/ribbons that have been awarded.https://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/dimension=420x1024:format=jpg/path/s19c3ceecf7274a06/image/i63c68878f1358346/version/1444918502/image.jpghttps://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/dimension=460x1024:format=jpg/path/s19c3ceecf7274a06/image/i4c81f4fb5022e987/version/1448211233/image.jpg Rank is worn on epaulettes and on the shoulders of uniforms. Powers and structure Public sector prison officers (historically known as warders) have \\"all the powers, authority, protection and privileges of a constable\\" whilst acting as such. Under the Assaults on Emergency Workers (Offences) Act 2018 it is an offence to assault (amongst others) a prison officer and is punishable by up to twelve months in prison, as well as a fine. Although the system is flexible in operation, most prison officers work in small teams, either assigned to a specific duty, or providing one shift of staff for the supervision of a particular wing within a prison. Each such team is, in many instances, led by a supervising officer. There will be an overall manager of the wing with the title of custodial manager. Custodial managers will have direct management of the wing and the line management of the officers and supervising officers. Equipment Most prison officers, when working on the landings, will carry: *baton - usually an expandable ASP type, for self- defencehttps://quarterly.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2018/03/Day- in-life-of-prison-officer-Stylist.png *radio - for communication between officers and the comms suitehttps://quarterly.blog.gov.uk/wp- content/uploads/sites/5/2018/03/Day-in-life-of-prison-officer-Stylist.png *keys - worn on a long key-chain *body cameras - worn on the chest *PAVA spray - see below. In 2018, it was reported by the GOV UK website that prison officers would start to be equipped with PAVA incapacitating spray:https://prisonjobs.blog.gov.uk/2018/10/09/introducing-the-use-of-pava- spray-in-prisons/ The Government said that it would be \\"fully rolled put by April 2019\\"https://prisonjobs.blog.gov.uk/2018/10/09/introducing-the-use-of- pava-spray-in-prisons/ and that \\"the decision follows a successful trial by HM Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) at 4 prisons\\".https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prison-officer-safety-equipment- rolled-out.

Some are assigned to uniformed specialist officers, while others are carried out by non-uniformed support staff. Before the \\"Fresh Start\\" initiative there were more uniformed specialist officer roles, including dog handlers, works officers, hospital officers, catering officers, physical education officers, and officer instructors. Today the uniformed Specialist Officer roles include dog handlers (DH), works officers (W), and healthcare officers (H) and Physical Exercise Instructors (PEI) who are the successors of the former hospital officers. The roles of the former catering officers, PE officers, and officer instructors are today taken by non-uniformed caterers, PE instructors, and educational/vocational instructors. Other key non-uniformed roles within the staff of a prison include chaplains, psychologists, and administrators. Private prisons The Prison Service does not manage all prisons within England and Wales. Currently there are eleven prisons that have been designed, constructed, managed and financed (so-called DCMF prisons) privately. In addition, three prisons that were built with public money are managed by private companies under contract. During 2012 one further prison opened under private sector management: HMP Oakwood (Featherstone 2), built by the public sector. Private prisons are subject to scrutiny by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons in a similar manner to prisons run by the public Prison Service. Ban on industrial action Questions were raised about the POA's status in the 1990s. In 1994, a legal decision determined that it was illegal to induce prison officers to take industrial action - a law which had applied to police officers since 1919 - meaning that the POA could not call strike action amongst its members. New labour legislation introduced by the Conservative government in 1992 laid down that the POA could no longer be a trade union. This was reversed in the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act of 1994, but prison officers were still denied the right to take industrial action. This right was restored in 2004 to prison officers in the public sector in England, Wales and Scotland, but not in Northern Ireland or to prison custody officers in the private sector. On 29 August 2007, the POA started a 24-hour walkout of prisons, picketing establishments asking prison officers not to attend work for their shift. This was the first ever national strike action taken by the POA. The POA reported that 90% of its members (27,000) went on strike that day. In January 2008, the Home Secretary announced that the government was to introduce legislation to remove the right for Prison Officers in England and Wales to take strike action. In November 2016, the High Court approved a Government request to stop industrial action taking place. In July 2017 the Government won a High Court bid to obtain a permanent ban on industrial action by prison officers. Independent Monitoring Board Every prison and immigration removal centre has an Independent Monitoring Board (IMB), formerly known as a Board of Visitors. Members of the IMB, who are volunteers, are appointed by the Home Secretary and act as 'watchdogs' for both the Minister of Prisons and the general public, to ensure that proper standards of care and decency are maintained. An analysis of the reporting of IMBs found that while there may be some problems with their training and undertaking of duties, their monitoring and surveillance of the detention estate can be more than symbolic and may further the humane and just treatment of the state‚Äôs most vulnerable citizens. HMPS in the National Offender Management Service On 6 January 2004, then Home Secretary David Blunkett announced that the Prison Service, together with the National Probation Service, is to be integrated into a new National Offender Management Service. The Service, Blunkett said, will be \\"a new body to provide end-to-end management of all offenders\\". On 1 April 2008, NOMS was reorganised as part of a shake-up in the Ministry of Justice. The headquarters and regional structures of NOMS and HMPS were merged into a single HQ structure with Phil Wheatly as Director General of NOMS. This brings HMPS and the National Probation Service under a single headquarters structure for the first time ever. On 1 June 2011, NOMS was merged with the wider MoJ (HMCTS etc.) to form one organisation. Although HMCTS and NOMS are working under different terms and conditions, they are now managed together and HR is dealt with by one Shared Service centre. A review of terms and conditions for all MoJ staff, including NOMS, is currently in progress with view to bringing all staff terms and conditions across NOMS and HMCTS in line.

Background Founded in 1989 by Jaba Ioseliani, the Mkhedrioni presented itself as the heir to historic Georgian guerrilla groups who fought Persia and Ottoman occupiers. The group's name means \\"horsemen\\", translated literally, but in Georgian it has a meaning closer to \\"knights\\" (this alternative translation has occasionally been used). Each member of the organization would take an oath to defend Georgia's people, the Georgian Orthodox and Apostolic Church and Georgia's land, and wore a medallion with a scene of Saint George slaying the dragon on one side and the bearer's name and blood type on the other. The establishment of the Mkhedrioni took place as Georgia moved towards independence in the final years of the Soviet Union. Relations between Georgian nationalists and the country's national minorities, especially the Abkhaz and Ossetians, were difficult at best even during Soviet rule and grew more tense during the rise to power of the nationalist dissident Zviad Gamsakhurdia. The Mkhedrioni was one of a number of nationalist paramilitary groups established during this period as a counterbalance to similar paramilitary organisations set up by rival nationalists elsewhere in Georgia. The Mkhedrioni's members gained an unpleasant reputation as heavily armed thugs who engaged in violent intimidation of their rivals. They were highly visible, wearing what amounted to a uniform of jeans, sweaters and jackets, topped off by sunglasses (even worn indoors). Leaders wore Armani suits bulging with guns, according to one author. Mkhedrioni relied on illegal sources of income (targeting gasoline supplies) and exploited connections with Moscow's Georgian underworld. Mkhedrioni members were often accused of criminal activity, extorting \\"protection money\\" from businesses in areas which they effectively controlled, operating roadblocks where drivers would be \\"fined\\", smuggling drugs and committing robberies.Conflict, Cleavage, and Change in Central Asia and the Caucasus, ed. Karen Dawisha, Bruce Parrott, p. 165. Cambridge University Press, 1997 By 1991, the Mkhedrioni was claimed to have had about 1,000 fighters and 10,000 associate members ‚Äì considerably more than the official state National Guard. Despite Gamsakhurdia and Ioseliani sharing a broadly similar nationalist outlook, the two men fell out badly shortly after Gamsakhurdia came to power in November 1990. In February 1991, Ioseliani was imprisoned without trial, along with many of his supporters, and the Mkhedrioni was banned. In August 1991, just after the Soviet coup attempt, Gamsakhurdia sacked Tengiz Kitovani, the commander of Georgia's National Guard, and his Prime Minister Tengiz Sigua resigned around the same time. Kitovani soon formed an anti-Gamsakhurdia alliance with Sigua and the imprisoned Ioseliani. In December 1991, Kitovani's supporters released Ioseliani from jail and launched a violent coup d'√©tat against the Gamsakhurdia government in alliance with the Mkhedrioni. Intense gun battles took place in the streets of Tbilisi between the rebels and \\"Zviadists\\" holed up in the state parliament building during December 1991 ‚Äì January 1992, which ended with Gamsakhurdia fleeing to the breakaway Russian republic of Chechnya. At least 100 people were killed in the fighting. The Mkhedrioni after Gamsakhurdia The Mkhedrioni played a crucial role in suppressing the remaining \\"Zviadists\\" after the downfall of Gamsakhurdia. Eduard Shevardnadze, a former Soviet foreign minister, was brought in to provide a respectable face for the new government, but it remained dependent on the Mkhedrioni: even inside the parliament building, Mkhedrioni gunmen had a constant presence as \\"bodyguards\\" for Jaba Ioseliani, who was now a member of parliament. Mkhedrioni were given the role of the interior forces under the new government. In 1993, worsening civil strife in Abkhazia prompted the Mkhedrioni and National Guard to launch a joint operation in the region to root out separatists and Gamsakhurdia supporters. This resulted in a disastrous defeat for the pro-government forces, who were driven out of Abkhazia along with virtually the entire ethnic Georgian population of the region: over 10,000 people were killed in the fighting. In September 1993, Gamsakhurdia took the opportunity to launch an armed uprising in western Georgia in an attempt to return to power. The Mkhedrioni played an important role in suppressing the uprising and were for a while given semi-official status as the \\"Georgian Rescue Corps\\". Russian intervention ensured Gamsakhurdia's defeat and on December 31 he reportedly committed suicide, though it has also been stated, and widely believed within Georgia, that he was murdered. Mkhedrioni forces were alleged in press reports to be responsible for his death, but they denied this. The Mkhedrioni were subsequently given responsibility for rooting out \\"Zviadists\\" in western Georgia, which they did with a brutal efficiency that was widely criticised by foreign governments and international human rights organisations. Shevardnadze responded by gradually limiting the organisation's power. Although Ioseliani remained head of the supposedly civilianised organisation, it continued to function as a private army. In early 1995, Shevardnadze ordered it to disarm, accusing it of deep involvement in organised crime. He narrowly escaped assassination in a bomb attack on August 29, 1995, which he blamed on a shadowy coalition of \\"mafia forces\\" including Ioseliani and others. Other acts of political violence were also blamed on the Mkhedrioni. The organisation was outlawed and Ioseliani imprisoned, although many regarded the claim that it had been involved in the bombing as being inconclusively proven. In spite of its banning, the Mkhedrioni continues to have a somewhat shadowy existence in Georgian politics. A number of members, led by Tornike Berishvili, recreated it in 1999 as an ostensibly political rather than paramilitary organisation. It has been claimed that the Mkhedrioni has had relations with Chechen separatists and continues to be involved in criminal and paramilitary activities, including continued guerrilla attacks in Abkhazia. Jaba Ioseliani was released from prison in an amnesty in April 2000 and resumed his post as head of the Mkhedrioni, declaring his intention to run for president and participate in the November 2003 parliamentary elections. However, Ioseliani died of a heart attack in March 2003. When the Mkhedrioni failed to secure registration to stand in elections under its own name, it reconstituted itself in November 2002 as a political party called the Union of Patriots in alliance with former Gamsakhurdia supporters. It was again refused registration by the government. Its leader Badri Zarandia was assassinated on January 8, 2003.

Members of the SFA include clubs in Scotland, affiliated national associations as well as local associations. It was formed in 1873, making it the second oldest national football association in the world. It is not to be confused with the Scottish Football Union, which is the name that the SRU was known by until the 1920s. The Scottish Football Association sits on the International Football Association Board which is responsible for the laws of the game. The SFA is also a member of FIFA and founder member of UEFA. It is based at Hampden Park in Glasgow. In addition, the Scottish Football Museum is located there. The Scottish Football Association is responsible for the operation of the Scotland national football team, the annual Scottish Cup and several other duties important to the functioning of the game in Scotland.  History  Logo used until 30 November 2012 Following the formation of Scotland's earliest football clubs in the 1860s, football experienced a rapid growth but there was no formal structure, and matches were often arranged in a haphazard and irregular fashion. Queen's Park, a Glasgow club founded in 1867, took the lead, and following an advertisement in a Glasgow newspaper in 1873, representatives from seven clubs ‚Äì Queen's Park, Clydesdale, Vale of Leven, Dumbreck, Third Lanark, Eastern and Granville ‚Äì attended a meeting on 13 March 1873. Furthermore, Kilmarnock sent a letter stating their willingness to join. That day, these eight clubs formed the Scottish Football Association, and resolved that:  Chief executive  The chief executive of the Scottish Football Association oversees the development of football in Scotland and the administration of disciplinary matters, and is also responsible for the general organisation of the national side. One of the most prominent roles of the chief executive is to hire and dismiss Scotland national football team managers. There have been nine chief executives since 1882: * John McDowall (1882‚Äì1928) * Sir George Graham (1928‚Äì1957) * Willie Allan (1957‚Äì1977) * Ernie Walker CBE (1977‚Äì1990) * Jim Farry (1990‚Äì1999) * David Taylor (1999‚Äì2007) * Gordon Smith (2007‚Äì2010) * Stewart Regan (2010‚Äì2018) * Ian Maxwell (2018-present)  National teams  As well as the Scotland national football team, the Scottish Football Association is also currently responsible for organising the Scotland B national football team, as well as men's national teams at under-21, under-19, under-18 and under-17 levels. There was also a semi-professional team, but this was disbanded in 2008. In women's football, there is the full Scotland women's national football team, under-19 and under-17 teams. In Futsal there is a full national side. The sides are overseen by the SFA Performance Director Malky Mackay.  Club competitions  The Scottish Football Association organises the Scottish Cup and the Scottish Youth Cup. Although the SFA are not involved in the day-to-day operation of the Scottish Professional Football League or other league competitions, they do appoint referees to officiate the games in these leagues, as well as dealing with player registrations and disciplinary issues.  Club licensing  The Scottish Football Association encourages quality of governance in football clubs through a system of club licence awards. All SFA member clubs are assessed annually in four areas (ground, first team, youth team, and governance) and, if appropriate, awarded a licence at platinum, gold, silver, bronze or entry level. As of July 2019, only Celtic have been awarded a platinum-level licence, while three clubs have been awarded gold-level licences: Hibernian, St Johnstone and St Mirren. All clubs in the Scottish Professional Football League, Highland Football League, and Lowland Football League are required to be licensed at entry level or above.  Member clubs  As of June 2020, 104 clubs are full members of the Scottish Football Association, comprising: * All 42 clubs in the Scottish Professional Football League * All 17 clubs in the Highland Football League * All 17 clubs in the Lowland Football League * 20 clubs in the East of Scotland Football League: **Blackburn United, Broxburn Athletic, Burntisland Shipyard, Camelon Juniors, Coldstream, Dundonald Bluebell, Dunipace, Easthouses Lily Miners Welfare, Haddington Athletic, Hawick Royal Albert, Hill of Beath Hawthorn, Jeanfield Swifts, Linlithgow Rose, Lothian Thistle Hutchison Vale, Newtongrange Star, Penicuik Athletic, Preston Athletic, Tranent Juniors, Tynecastle, and Whitehill Welfare * 4 clubs in the South of Scotland Football League: **Newton Stewart, St Cuthbert Wanderers, Threave Rovers, and Wigtown & Bladnoch * 2 clubs in the West of Scotland Football League: **Girvan and Glasgow University * 1 club in the North Caledonian League: Golspie Sutherland * 1 club in SJFA North Region: Banks O' Dee  Affiliated associations = National associations  The Scottish Football Association has affiliated to it the following six national associations: * Scottish Amateur Football Association * Scottish Junior Football Association * Scottish Schools Football Association * Scottish Youth Football Association * Scottish Welfare Football Association * Scottish Women's Football  Local associations  The following nine local associations are affiliated: * Aberdeenshire and District Football Association * East of Scotland Football Association * Fife Football Association * Forfarshire Football Association * Glasgow Football Association * North of Scotland Football Association * Southern Counties Football Association * Stirlingshire Football Association * West of Scotland Football Association * Scottish Futsal League  References External links * * Scotland at FIFA site * Scotland at UEFA site 1 Scotland Category:Sports organizations established in 1873 Category:1873 establishments in Scotland Category:Organisations based in Glasgow ","title":"Scottish Football Association"},{"id":"429475","text":"In linguistics, Aeolic Greek (), also known as Aeolian (), Lesbian or Lesbic dialect, is the set of dialects of Ancient Greek spoken mainly in Boeotia; in Thessaly; in the Aegean island of Lesbos; and in the Greek colonies of Aeolis in Anatolia and adjoining islands. The Aeolic dialect shows many archaisms in comparison to the other Ancient Greek dialects (Arcadocypriot, Attic, Ionic, and Doric varieties), as well as many innovations. Aeolic Greek is widely known as the language of Sappho and of Alcaeus of Mytilene. Aeolic poetry, which is exemplified in the works of Sappho, mostly uses four classical meters known as the Aeolics: Glyconic (the most basic form of Aeolic line), hendecasyllabic verse, Sapphic stanza, and Alcaic stanza (the latter two are respectively named for Sappho and Alcaeus). In Plato's Protagoras, Prodicus labelled the Aeolic dialect of Pittacus of Mytilene as \\"barbarian\\" (barbaros),Protagoras by Plato - Greek text because of its difference from the Attic literary style:James A. Towle, Commentary on Plato: Protagoras 341c \\"He didn't know to distinguish the words correctly, being from Lesbos, and having been raised with a barbarian dialect\\". Phonology=ConsonantsLabiovelars= Proto-Indo-European and Proto-Greek * changed to Aeolic p everywhere. By contrast, PIE * changed to Attic/Ionic, Arcadocypriot, and Doric t before e and i. * PIE * ‚Üí Lesbian p√≠sures, Boeotian p√©ttares ~ Attic t√©ttares, Ionic t√©sseres, Doric t√©tores \\"four\\" Similarly PIE/PGk * always became b and PIE * > PGk * always became ph (whereas in other dialects they became alternating b/d and ph/th before back/front vowels). Labiovelars were treated the same way in the P-Celtic languages and the Sabellic languages. =Sonorant clusters= A Proto-Greek consonant cluster with h (from Indo- European ) and a sonorant (r, l, n, m, w, y) changed to a double sonorant in Aeolic (rr, ll, nn, mm, ww, yy) by assimilation. In Attic/Ionic and Doric, the h assimilated to the vowel before the consonant cluster, causing the vowel to lengthen by compensatory lengthening. : PIE VsR or VRs ‚Üí Attic/Ionic-Doric VVR. : VsR or VRs ‚Üí Aeolic VRR.V = vowel, R = sonorant, s is itself. VV = long vowel, RR = doubled or long sonorant. * PIE * ‚Üí Proto-Greek *ehmi ‚Üí Aeolic emmi ~ Attic/Ionic ƒìmi (= ) \\"I am\\" =Loss of h= Lesbian Aeolic lost in initial h- (psilosis \\"stripping\\") from Proto-Indo-European s- or y-.

The revival was a modernist-inspired reaction to the Movement's more conservative approach to British poetry. The poets included an older generation - Bob Cobbing, Paula Claire, Tom Raworth, Eric Mottram, Jeff Nuttall, Andrew Crozier, Lee Harwood, Allen Fisher, Iain Sinclair‚Äîand a younger generation: Paul Buck, Bill Griffiths, John Hall, John James, Gilbert Adair, Lawrence Upton, Peter Finch, Ulli Freer, Ken Edwards, Robert Gavin Hampson, Gavin Selerie, Frances Presley, Elaine Randell, Robert Sheppard, Adrian Clarke, Clive Fencott, Maggie O'Sullivan, Cris Cheek, Tony Lopez and Denise Riley.Eric Mottram, 'The British Poetry Revival', Robert Hampson & Peter Barry (eds), New British poetries: The scope of the possible (Manchester University Press, 1993). Beginnings If the Movement poets looked to Thomas Hardy as a poetic model, the poets associated with the British Poetry Revival were more likely to look to modernist models, such as the American poets Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams and Charles Olson and British figures such as David Jones, Basil Bunting and Hugh MacDiarmid. Although these major British poets had effectively been written out of official histories of 20th century British poetry, by the beginning of the 1960s a number of younger poets were starting to explore poetic possibilities that the older writers had opened up. These poets included Roy Fisher, Gael Turnbull, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Bob Cobbing, Jeff Nuttall, Tom Raworth, Michael Horovitz, Eric Mottram, Peter Finch, Edwin Morgan, Jim Burns, Elaine Feinstein, Lee Harwood, and Christopher Logue. Many of these poets joined Allen Ginsberg and an audience of 7,000 people at the Albert Hall International Poetry Incarnation on 11 June 1965 to create what has often been claimed as the first British happening. Earlier British happenings included John Latham's event-based art and Skoob Tower ceremonies; Gustav Metzger's 1964 auto-destructive art; Adrian Henri's 1962 collage-events in Liverpool's The Cavern Club; and Jeff Nuttall's events in Better Books. They had their roots in Dada events at the Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich) at the start of the century.Jeff Nuttall, Bomb Culture These poets provided a wide range of modes and models of how modernism could be integrated into British poetry. Fisher, also a professional jazz pianist, applied the lessons of William Carlos Williams' Paterson to his native Birmingham in his long poem City. Turnbull, who spent some time in the U. S., was also influenced by Williams. His fellow Scots Morgan and Finlay both worked with found, sound and visual poetry. Mottram, Nuttall, Horovitz and Burns were all close to the Beat generation writers. Mottram and Raworth were also influenced by the Black Mountain poets while Raworth and Harwood shared an interest in the poets of the New York School. A number of publishing outlets for this new experimental poetry also began to spring up, including Turnbull's Migrant Press, Raworth's Matrix Press and Goliard Press, Horovitz's New Departures, Stuart Montgomery's Fulcrum Press, Tim Longville's Grosseteste Review, Galloping Dog Press and its Poetry Information magazine, Pig Press, Andrew Crozier and Peter Riley's The English Intelligencer, Crozier's Ferry Press, and Cobbing's Writers Forum. In addition to the poets of the revival, many of these presses and magazines also published avant-garde American and European poetry. The first anthology to present a wide-ranging selection of the new movement was Horovitz's Children of Albion: Poetry of the Underground in Britain (1969). A better sample of the work of the first and second generations of the Revival is provided by the sections edited by Eric Mottram and Ken Edwards in The New British Poetry (1988). Robert Sheppard also provides a useful account of some of this activity in his chapter on 'The British Poetry Revival' in his book, The Poetry of Saying (Liverpool University Press, 2005)' while Juha Virtanen addresses an important aspect of the British Poetry Revival in his monograph, Poetry and Performance During the British Poetry Revival 1960-1980 (Palgrave Macmillan, 2017). London Thanks in no small part to Cobbing's Writers Forum and its associated writers' workshop, London was a hub for many young poets, including Bill Griffiths, Paula Claire, Allen Fisher, Iain Sinclair, Gilbert Adair, Lawrence Upton, Peter Finch, Ulli Freer, Gavin Selerie, Frances Presley, Elaine Randell, Robert Sheppard, Adrian Clarke, Clive Fencott, Maggie O'Sullivan, cris cheek, Tony Lopez and Denise Riley. Some sense of the atmosphere of this period is provided by the series of reminiscences included in CLASP: late modernist poetry in London (Shearsman, 2016), edited by Robert Hampson and Ken Edwards,Robert Hampson & Ken Edwards (eds), CLASP: late modernist poetry in London (Shearsman, 2016) and in Ken Edwards's memoir, Wild Metrics.Ken Edwards, Wild Metrics (Grand Iota, 2019). Griffiths writes a poetry of dazzling surface and deep political commitment that incorporates such matter as his professional knowledge of Anglo-Saxon and his years as a Hells Angel. Both Sinclair and Fisher share a taste for William Blake and an interest in exploring the meaning of place, particularly London, which can be seen in Sinclair's Suicide Bridge and Lud Heat and Fisher's Place sequence of books. O'Sullivan explores a view of the poet as shaman in her work, while Randell and Riley were among the first British women poets to combine feminist concerns with experimental poetic practice. For more on Griffiths's poetry, see William Rowe (ed.), Bill Griffiths (Salt, 2007). For more on Sinclair, see Robert Sheppard, Iain Sinclair (Northcote House, 2007) or Brian Baker, Iain Sinclair (Manchester UP, 2007). For Fisher, see Robert Hampson and cris cheek (eds), The Allen Fisher Companion (Shearsman, 2020). Griffiths started Pirate Press to publish work by himself and others. Allen Fisher set up Spanner for similar reasons, and Sinclair's early books were published by his own Albion Village Press, which also published work by Chris Torrance and Brian Catling. Book production has always been an important part of Revival practice. Many of these writers also participated enthusiastically in performance poetry events, both individually or in groups like Cobbing's Bird Yak and Konkrete Canticle. Eric Mottram was a central figure on the London scene, both for his personal and professional knowledge of the Beat generation writers and the US poets linked with the New American Poetry more generally, and his abilities as a promoter and poet. In large part through Mottram's presence there, King's College London was another important site for the British Poetry Revival. Poets who attended there (a number of them also students taught by Mottram) included Gilbert Adair, Peter Barry, Sean Bonney, Hannah Bramness, Clive Bush, Ken Edwards, Bill Griffiths, Robert Gavin Hampson, Jeff Hilson, Will Rowe, and Lawrence Upton. Northumbria and Northern England By the early 1950s, Basil Bunting had returned to live in Newcastle and, in 1966, Fulcrum Press published Briggflatts, which is widely considered to be his masterpiece.Carroll F. Terrell, 'Introduction', Basil Bunting: Man and Poet (Maine: National Poetry Foundation, 1980), 1. A number of younger poets began to gather around Bunting. In 1963, Connie and Tom Pickard started a reading series and bookshop in the Morden Tower Book Room.Geraldine Monk (ed.), CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition (Bristol: Shearsman, 2012). The first reading was by Bunting, and Ginsberg, Robert Creeley, Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Gregory Corso all read there. They were soon joined by Richard Caddel, brought up in Kent but an honorary Northumbrian, Barry MacSweeney and Colin Simms. For some reminiscences of this scene, see the essays by Connie Pickard, Tony Baker, and Tom Pickard in Geraldine Monk (ed.) CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition (Shearsman, 2012). Through Bunting, these younger writers became familiar with the work of the Objectivist poets. Specifically, Louis Zukofsky and Lorine Niedecker were to become important models for Caddel and Simms in their writing about the Northumbrian environment, while John Seed picked up on George Oppen.John Seed, 'Living the Storm: George Oppen's \\"Songs of Experience\\"' in John Freeman (ed.) Not Comforts / But Vision: Essays on the poetry of George Oppen (Interim Press, 1985), 10-25 Pickard and MacSweeney shared Bunting's interest in reviving Northumbrian vowel patterns and verbal music in poetry and all of these poets were influenced by the older poet's insistence on poetry as sounded speech rather than purely written text. At Easter, 1967 MacSweeney organised the Sparty Lea Poetry Festival. This was a ten-day session of reading, writing and discussion. The participants, including the Pickards, MacSweeney, Andrew Crozier, John James, John Temple, Pete Armstrong, Tim Longville, Peter Riley, John Hall, J. H. Prynne and Nick Waite, stayed in a group of four cottages in the village of Sparty Lea.Luke Roberts, Barry MacSweeney and the Politics of Post-War British Poetry (Palgrave Macmillan, 2017), 4-6. This has often been presented as a pivotal event in the British Poetry Revival, bringing together poets who were separated geographically and in terms of poetic influences and encouraging them to support and publish each other's work. Although published by Writers Forum and Pirate Press, Geraldine Monk is very much a poet of the North of England. Like Maggie O'Sullivan, she writes for performance as much as for the page and there is an undercurrent of feminist concerns in her work. Other poets associated with the North of England included Paul Buck, Glenda George, and John Seed. Paul Buck and Glenda George for many years edited Curtains, a magazine instrumental in disseminating contemporary French poetry and philosophical/theoretical writing. John Seed had picked up on Objectivism while still in the North-East. Geraldine Monk's edited collection of reminiscences by various Northern poets (including Jim Burns, Paul Buck, Glenda George, and John Seed, CUSP, mentioned above, provides a rich account of innovative poetry outside the metropolis.Geraldine Monk, CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition (Shearsman, 2012). Cambridge The Cambridge poets were a group centred around J. H. Prynne and included Andrew Crozier, John James, Douglas Oliver, Veronica Forrest-Thomson, Peter Riley, Tim Longville and John Riley. Prynne was influenced by Charles Olson and Crozier was partly responsible for Carl Rakosi's return to poetry in the 1960s. The New York school were also an important influence for many of the Cambridge poets - most obviously in the work of John James. The Grosseteste Review, which published these poets, was originally thought of as a kind of magazine of British Objectivism. The early formation of this group is evidenced in the pages of The English Intelligencer, a privately-circulated worksheet published between January 1966 and April 1968. It was founded by Andrew Crozier, who edited the first and third series; the second series was edited by Peter Riley. Contributors and recipients included Peter Armstrong, Jim Burns, Elaine Feinstein, John Hall, John James, Tim Longville, Barry MacSweeney, J. H. Prynne, Tom Raworth, John Temple, Chris Torrance and Nick Wayte'Neil Pattison, Reitha Pattison, Luke Roberts (eds), Certain Prose of 'The English Intelligencer' (Cambridge: Mountain Press, 2012) The Cambridge poets in general wrote in a cooler, more measured style than many of their London or Northumbrian peers (although Barry MacSweeney, for example, felt an affinity with them) and many taught at Cambridge University or at Anglia Polytechnic. There was also less emphasis on performance than there was among the London poets. Wales and Scotland In the 60s and early 70s Peter Finch, an associate of Bob Cobbing, ran the No Walls Poetry readings and the ground breaking inclusive magazine, second aeon. He began Oriel Books in Cardiff in 1974 and the shop served as a focal point for young Welsh poets. However, some of the more experimental poets in Wales were not of Welsh origins. Two of the most important expatriate poets operating in Wales were John Freeman and Chris Torrance. Freeman is another British poet influenced by the Objectivists, and he has written on both George Oppen and Niedecker.In 1985, he edited Not Comforts / but Visions, essays on the poetry of George Oppen, which included work by John Seed, Jeremy Hooker, Freeman, Hampson and others.John Freeman (ed.), Not Comforts / But Vision: essays on the Poetry of George Oppen (Interim Press, 1985). Torrance has expressed his debt to David Jones. His ongoing Magic Door sequence is widely regarded as one of the major long poems to come out of the Revival. For some account of this period, see the reminiscences of Chris Torrance and Peter Finch in Geraldine Monk's CUSP: recollections of poetry in transition (Shearsman, 2012). In Scotland, Edwin Morgan, Ian Hamilton Finlay and Tom Leonard emerged as key individual poets during this time, each interested in, among other forms, sound and visual poetry. The viability of a wider, deeper experimental infrastructure in poetry was helped by the gallery, performance space and bookshop at the Third Eye Centre in Glasgow (later renamed the Centre for Contemporary Arts). Magazines such as Scottish International, \\"Chapman\\", and Duncan Glen's magazine Akros maintained links with the modernist legacy of the inter-war and post-war years while publishing contemporary poets; often, however, by mixing the avant-garde with aesthetically conservative texts. In the same vein, in 1972-4 John Schofield, then a post-graduate student, organised three annual poetry festivals in various halls at Edinburgh University, called POEM 72, POEM73 and POEM74. Poets reading their work at the first included Edwin Morgan, Norman MacCaig, Tom Buchan, Robert Garioch and Liz Lochhead. About 700 people attended. For POEM73, the attendance was over 1300 people, hearing Hugh MacDiarmid, George Macbeth, Adrian Mitchell, Jon Silkin and Iain Crichton Smith. The final festival, POEM74, included readings by Adrian Henri, Libby Houston, Jeff Nuttall, Rose McGuire, Frances Horovitz, Ruth Fainlight and Sorley Maclean. \\"A treacherous assault on British poetry\\" In 1971, a large number of the poets associated with the British Poetry Revival joined the dormant, if not moribund Poetry Society and in the elections became the Poetry Society's new council. The Society had been traditionally hostile to modernist poetry, but under the new council this position was reversed. Eric Mottram was made editor of the society's magazine Poetry Review. Over the next six years, he edited twenty issues that featured most, if not all, of the key Revival poets and carried reviews of books and magazines from the wide range of small presses that had sprung up to publish them. Nuttall and MacSweeney both served as chairperson of the society during this period and Bob Cobbing used the photocopying facilities in the basement of the society's building to produce Writers Forum books. Around this time, Cobbing, Finch and others established the Association of Little Presses (ALP) to promote and support small press publishers and organise book fairs at which they could sell their productions. In the late 1970s, in response to the number of foreign poets being featured in Poetry Review, Mottram was removed as editor of the magazine; his editorial practices being seen by the Arts Council as \\"a treacherous assault on British poetry\\", according to Mottram's preface to his section of the anthology, the new british poetry. At the same time, the Arts Council set up an inquiry that overturned the result of the Society's elections that had once more brought in a council dominated by those sympathetic to the Poetry Revival.For a detailed account of these events, see Peter Barry, The Battle of Earl's Court (Manchester University Press, 2007). The 1980s and after A number of younger poets, many of whom who first found an outlet in Poetry Review under Mottram, began to emerge around the end of the 1970s. In London, Bill Griffiths, Ulli Freer, cris cheek, Lawrence Upton, Robert Gavin Hampson, Robert Sheppard, and Ken Edwards were among those who were to the fore. These, and others, met regularly at Gilbert Adair's Subvoicive reading series, which also regularly featured poets from North America, as well as visiting poets such as Caroline Bergvall, Paul Buck, Andrew Duncan, D. S. Marriott, Maggie O'Sullivan and Denise Riley. Edwards ran Reality Studios, a magazine that grew out of Alembic (UK poetry magazine), the magazine he had co-edited through the 1970s with Peter Barry and Robert Hampson. Through Reality Studios, he helped introduce the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets to a British readership. He also ran Reality Street Editions with Cambridge-based Wendy Mulford, which continued to be a major publisher of contemporary poetry until 2018 and an important bridge between US and UK poetries. The London-based Angel Exhaust magazine brought many of the younger poets together - in particular, Adrian Clarke, Robert Sheppard and Andrew Duncan. In the Midlands, Tony Baker's Figs magazine focused more on the Objectivist and Bunting-inspired poetry of the Northumbrian school while introducing a number of new poets. In 1988 an anthology called The New British Poetry was published. It featured a section on the Revival poets edited by Mottram and another on the younger poets edited by Edwards. In 1987, Crozier and Longville published their anthology A Various Art, which focused mainly on the Cambridge poets, and Iain Sinclair edited yet another anthology of Revival-related work Conductors of Chaos (1996). For an account of some of the work produced by these poets, see Robert Hampson and Peter Barry (eds.), The New British poetries: the scope of the possible (Manchester University Press, 1993). In 1994 W. N. Herbert and Richard Price co-edited the anthology of Scottish Informationist poetry Contraflow on the SuperHighway (Gairfish and Southfields Press). The anthology Conductors of Chaos featured another aspect of the Revival; the recovery of neglected British modernists of the generation after Bunting. Poets David Gascoyne, selected by Jeremy Reed; W. S. Graham, selected by Tony Lopez; David Jones, selected by Drew Milne; J.F. Hendry, selected by Andrew Crozier and Nicholas Moore, selected by Peter Riley were reappraised and returned to their rightful place in the history of 20th century British poetry. Another interesting development was the establishment of the British and Irish poetry discussion list by Richard Caddel. This continued, for some decades, to provide an international forum for discussion and the exchange of news on experimental British and Irish poetry. Much wider publication for Revival poetry was arranged via the USA. Caddel, together with Peter Middleton, edited a selection of new UK poetry for US readers in a special issue of Talisman (1996).Talisman: a Journal of Contemporary Poetry and Poetics 16 (1996): 110-173. With Peter Quartermain Caddel also edited Other: British and Irish Poetry since 1970 (USA, 1999); while Keith Tuma's Anthology of Twentieth-Century British and Irish Poetry (Oxford University Press, USA, 2001) incorporates this poetry into a wider retrospective of the whole century. Into the 1990s and beyond poets such as Johan de Wit (poet), Sean Bonney, Jeff Hilson, and Piers Hugill have surfaced after direct involvement in the Cobbing-led Writers Forum workshop. An interesting sub- development of the workshop was the instigation of the Foro De Escritores workshop, in Santiago Chile, run on similar aesthetic principles. This workshop has contributed to the development of Martin Gubbins, Andreas Aandwandter, and Martin Bakero, to name but few. Those associated with the Barque Press (most obviously Andrea Brady and Keston Sutherland), and more recently Bad Press (in particular, Marianne Morris and Jow Lindsay), have made a similar impact via the Cambridge scene. Perdika Press in North London has been instrumental in bringing to wider attention contemporary Modernist writers such as Nicholas Potamitis, Mario Petrucci, Robert Vas Dias and Peter Brennan; the press was also responsible for the first publication in Britain of Bill Berkson. From Scotland, Peter Manson, who had co-edited the magazine Object Permanence in the mid-1990s, Drew Milne, editor of Parataxis, David Kinloch and Richard Price (previously editors of Verse and Southfields) also emerged more fully as poets in their own right. New writings have arisen from the involvement of cris cheek, Bridgid Mcleer, and Alaric Sumner, under the direction of Caroline Bergvall and John Hall through the Performance Writing programme at Dartington College of Arts including Kirsten Lavers, Andy Smith, and Chris Paul; from the involvement of Redell Olsen in the MA in Poetic Practice at Royal Holloway, University of London, including Becky Cremin, Frances Kruk, Ryan Ormond, Sophie Robinson, John Sparrow and Stephen Willey; and through Keith Jebb at University of Bedfordshire's Creative Writing programme, including Alyson Torns and Allison Boast.

Tatami are made in standard sizes, twice as long as wide, about 0.9 m by 1.8 m depending on the region. In martial arts, tatami are the floor used for training in a dojo and for competition. Tatami are covered with woven straw. The core is traditionally made from rice straw, but contemporary tatami sometimes have compressed wood chip boards or polystyrene foam cores. The long sides are usually with brocade or plain cloth, although some tatami have no edging. History Men making tatami mats, late 19th century. The term tatami is derived from the verb , meaning 'to fold' or 'to pile'. This indicates that the early tatami were thin and could be folded up when not used or piled in layers.Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan, entry for \\"tatami.\\" Tatami were originally a luxury item for the nobility. The lower classes had mat-covered earth floors. During the Heian period, when the shinden-zukuri architectural style of aristocratic residences was consummated, the flooring of shinden-zukuri palatial rooms were mainly wooden, and tatami were only used as seating for the highest aristocrats. In the Kamakura period, there arose the shoin-zukuri architectural style of residence for the samurai and priests who had gained power. This architectural style reached its peak of development in the Muromachi period, when tatami gradually came to be spread over whole rooms, beginning with small rooms. Rooms completely spread with tatami came to be known as , and rules concerning seating and etiquette determined the arrangement of the tatami in the rooms. It is said that prior to the mid-16th century, the ruling nobility and samurai slept on tatami or woven mats called , while commoners used straw mats or loose straw for bedding.Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan, entry for \\"bedding\\" Tatami were gradually popularized and reached the homes of commoners toward the end of the 17th century. Houses built in Japan today often have very few tatami-floored rooms, if any. Having just one is not uncommon. The rooms having tatami flooring and other such traditional architectural features are referred to as nihonma or washitsu, \\"Japanese-style rooms\\". Size The size of tatami traditionally differs between regions in Japan: * Kyoto: 0.955 m by 1.91 m, called tatami * Nagoya: 0.91 m by 1.82 m, called tatami * Tokyo: 0.88 m by 1.76 m, called or tatami In terms of thickness, 5.5 cm is average for a Ky≈çma tatami, while 6.0 cm is the norm for a Kant≈çma tatami.Sato Osamu, \\"A History of Tatami,\\" in Chanoyu Quarterly no. 77 (1994). A half mat is called a , and a mat of three-quarter length, which is used in tea-ceremony rooms (chashitsu), is called daimedatami ( or ). In terms of traditional Japanese length units, a tatami is (allowing for regional variation) 1 ken by 0.5 ken, or equivalently 6 shaku by 3 shaku ‚Äì formally this is , the size of Nagoya tatami. Note that a shaku is almost the same length as one foot in the traditional English-American measurement system. One possible auspicious layout of a mat room In Japan, the size of a room is often measured by the number of , about 1.653 square meters (for a standard Nagoya size tatami). Alternatively, in terms of traditional Japanese area units, room area (and especially house floor area) is measured in terms of tsubo, where one tsubo is the area of two tatami mats (a square); formally 1 ken by 1 ken or a 1.81818 meter square, about 3.306 square meters. Some common room sizes in the Nagoya region are: * mats = 9 shaku √ó 9 shaku ‚âà 2.73 m √ó 2.73 m *6 mats = 9 shaku √ó 12 shaku ‚âà 2.73 m √ó 3.64 m *8 mats = 12 shaku √ó 12 shaku ‚âà 3.64 m √ó 3.64 m Shops were traditionally designed to be mats, and tea rooms are frequently mats. Layout There are rules concerning the number of tatami mats and the layout of the tatami mats in a room. In the Edo period, tatami arrangements and tatami arrangements were distinctly differentiated, and the tatami accordingly would be rearranged depending on the occasion. In modern practice, the \\"auspicious\\" layout is ordinarily used. In this arrangement, the junctions of the tatami form a \\"T\\" shape; in the \\"inauspicious\\" arrangement, the tatami are in a grid pattern wherein the junctions form a \\"+\\" shape. An auspicious tiling often requires the use of mats to tile a room. An inauspicious layout is said to bring bad fortune.

After 1991, the party abandoned Trotskyism and publicly took a libertarian humanist position. It was disbanded in 1997, although a number of former members maintain a loose political network to promote its ideas.  Beginnings  The \\"Workers March for Irish Freedom\\", taking the cause of Irish hunger strikers to the Trades Union Congress conference in 1981, was a turning point for the party The party originated as a tendency in the Revolutionary Communist Group which had split from the International Socialists in the 1970s.

The Revolutionary Communist Tendency hoped to draw together those militant working class leaders who were disappointed by the limitations of reformism to help to build a new working class leadership and develop an independent working class programme.  Stance  Taking a strong line which it considered to be inspired by Vladimir Lenin's work on the relationship between imperialism and reformism, the party originally held that the \\"only hope of securing any decent sort of life - or even guaranteeing survival - lies in the working class taking control over society\\".Revolutionary Communist Party, The Red Front: A platform for working class unity, London: Junius, 1987: 7 It further argued that traditional Stalinist and social-democratic appeals to the bourgeois state had undermined working-class independence and that as a result an independent vanguard party should be organized to campaign for a distinctly working-class politics. In 1978, for example, when the left was strong within the Labour Party, the RCP argued that \\"Labour is the party which attempts to resolve the crisis by integrating militant working class resistance into the capitalist system\\".Mike Freeman and Kate Marshall Who Needs the Labour Party? London: Junius, September 1978 This position included a rejection of support for the Labour Party and one that questioned the allegiances of the trade union movement. A consequence of this belief was a growing distrust of traditional statist left-wing struggles as reformist. According to some, the RCP took a view that reformism consolidated bourgeois ideology in the potential leadership layers of the working class. The RCP took a number of positions coined to distinguish independent working-class politics from statist reformism which included: * The rejection of all controls on immigration.The Red Front, A Platform for Working Class Unity, London, Junius, 1987, p.37 * Opposition to any national economic recovery strategies, such as import controls, which aimed to pit British workers against those overseas.Under a National Flag, London: Junius, 1978, p.17 * Free abortion and contraception on demand.Joan Phillips, Policing the Family, 1988, p.104 * Decriminalisation of homosexualityJames Heartfield, 'The Tyranny of Identity Politics' Spiked-online, January 2008 and complete equality under the law.Joan Phillips, Policing the Family, 1988, p. 104 * Unconditional support for the struggle against British imperialism in Northern Ireland on the grounds that \\"British workers cannot ignore the cause of Irish liberation without renouncing their own class interests\\".Mary Masters Workers against Imperialism, 1979, p. 35 * A claim that the police occupied Brixton: \\"We have to organise on the streets and housing estates to keep the police out\\".Pat Roberts and Christine Drury Police out of Brixton, London: Junius, 1981, p. 13 * The party's campaign Workers Against Racism aimed to organise physical defence against racist attacks.East London Workers Against Racism, Our Flag Stays Red, London: Junius, April 1981 The party's programme can be traced through the publications \\"Our Tasks and Methods\\" (a reprint of the Revolutionary Communist Group's founding document), the 1983 general election manifesto Preparing for Power and the article \\"The Road to Power\\" in the theoretical journal Confrontation (1986).  Workers Against Racism  Beginning as East London Workers Against Racism (ELWAR) before it was launched as a national campaign, Workers Against Racism campaigned against state racism. Protests were organised against deportations and passport checks at hospitals and unemployment benefit offices. ELWAR also organised patrols and vigils to defend immigrants against racist attacks.S.

Roucou was a shop steward in the building workers' union UCATT in Manchester. Workers Against Racism helped to organise a campaign culminating in a one-day strike and demonstration by his fellow council workers on 6 February 1987.

Workers Against Racism campaigners raised the case, disrupting a test match at the Edgbaston cricket ground in July 1985 with a Metso Must Stay banner and helping to build a 1,000-strong march for him in December 1986. In September 1987, Moncrieffe's deportation order was overturned.Under Siege: Racial Violence in Britain Today, Keith Teare, Penguin, 1988, page 150  Supporting Irish republicanism  Supporting Irish republicanism was central to the work of the party. In 1978, it organised the Smash the Prevention of Terrorism Act Campaign and held protests outside police stations where suspects were held. The party organised a conference of trade unionists opposed to Northern Ireland being part of the United Kingdom in Coventry in 1981 and later that year held a march to the TUC conference, the Workers March for Irish Freedom. On Saturday 6 February 1982, the Irish Freedom Movement (IFM) was founded at a meeting in Caxton House, Archway and TUC general secretary Len Murray wrote to the thirteen trades councils that sponsored the conference threatening them with disaffiliation if they attended.David Pallister, 'Ulster Conference Ban', Guardian, 4 February 1982 Mick Hume, who edited The Next Step, recalls that the IFM were accused of complicity in the 1984 bombing of the Conservative Party conference.Mick Hume, Brighton bomb memories Spiked, 13 October 2009 The IFM published a quarterly bulletin Irish Freedom and organised an annual march on the anniversary of internment. When the voices of Sinn F√©in supporters were banned from the British broadcast media, Living Marxism carried a front page interview with its leader Gerry Adams and the IFM picketed Broadcasting House.  Campaign Against Militarism  Campaign Against Militarism protest in 1994 In 1993, the party helped launch the Campaign Against Militarism (CAM) to fight against western military intervention. CAM organised protests against the military interventions in Somalia, Bosnia and Iraq. On 10 September 1993, seventy Somalis and CAM supporters occupied the United States embassy after an alleged massacre of civilians in Mogadishu,The Guardian, 11 September 1993, p. 14; Daily Telegraph, 11 September 1993, p 9 the only time it has happened. After they were evicted by armed marines, eleven were convicted under the as yet untested criminal trespass laws, but charges were dropped after lawyer Mike Fisher sought to have the case tried in the United States, arguing that the offence, if any, was committed on American soil. CAM was the only left-wing group that joined British Serbs in their demonstrations over the military strikes on Yugoslavia in 1994.  Controversial positions  The party took a number of positions that were strongly criticised by others on the left: * In The Truth About the AIDS Panic, Michael Fitzpatrick and Don Milligan wrote that there is \\"no good evidence that Aids is likely to spread rapidly among heterosexuals in the West\\".London, Junius, 1988, p. 8 The pamphlet argued that the government campaign warning of a heterosexual aids epidemic was a moral panic that would worsen prejudice against gay people. * When British miners struck against redundancies in 1984, the party argued that the union's refusal to hold a national ballot was a major problem: \\"The only way to win the passive majority for the strike was to launch an aggressive campaign around a national ballot\\".Mike Freeman, Our Day Will Come: The Miners' Fight for Jobs, London, Junius, 1985, p. 36 * In the struggle against Apartheid in South Africa, the party argued that \\"sanctions don't make sense\\" because it was wrong to call on the governments that had supported Apartheid to overthrow it. Rather, workers ought to \\"take direct action\\", like blocking South African imports at docks.Charles Longford, Black Blood on British Hands, London, Junius, 1985, p. 59, p. 67 When the organisation re-thought its outlook in 1991, it adopted a number of positions that put it at odds with the New Labour milieu: * In The Empire Strikes Back, Mike Freeman identified \\"the metamorphosis of what had long regarded itself as a peace movement into a war movement\\" after Labour rallied to support the First Iraq War.Mike Freeman, The Empire Strikes Back: Why we need a new Anti-War Movement, London, Junius, 1993, p 46 Later, this trend was called \\"humanitarian imperialism\\" in Living Marxism. The party opposed Western military intervention in Bosnia, Somalia, Kosovo, Iraq and East Timor.Linda Ryan, 'Narcissus' Empire,' LM, December 1999, issue 126 * Living Marxism argued against what it called the \\"new authoritarianism\\", the greater official interference and surveillance of ordinary people by the state. The growth in \\"at-risk\\" registers and CCTV were examples.James Heartfield, 'The Victim Support State', Living Marxism, December 1993, issue 62 * The party opposed the increase in judicial'James Heartfield, 'Judges Rule,' Living Marxism, April 1996, issue 89 and other kinds of non-majoritarian overriding of parliament as well as the subordination of parliament to the European Convention on Human Rights.James Heartfield, 'Getting it Wrong on Human Rights,' Living Marxism, December 1997, issue 106  Criticism  In 1981, Alex Callinicos of the British Socialist Workers Party (SWP) took issue with the party's argument that \\"such issues as racism and Ireland form [...] a vital component of revolutionary propaganda\\". Callinicos claimed instead that \\"if most of the workers involved have reactionary views on questions such as race, the position of women, and so on\\", then that was less important than that they were fighting over pay and conditions. Callinicos also called into question the party's stress on \\"the connection between reformism and nationalism\\", saying they were \\"paleo- marxists\\".'Politics or Abstract Propagandism', International Socialism no.11, 1981, pp.121-2 In 1984, the SWP denounced the party for calling for a national ballot in the miners' strike. On 30 June 1990, Simon Watney and Edward King of the group OutRage! kicked over the party's stall at the Gay Pride march.Ian Lucas Outrage! an oral history, London: Cassell, 1998, p.26 Watney criticised Michael Fitzpatrick and Don Milligan for giving credence to the idea that AIDS was a \\"gay plague\\" by their insistence that there would be no epidemic amongst heterosexuals in the west. However, OutRage! was divided over the attack.Ian Lucas Outrage! an oral history, London: Cassell, 1998, pp.43-5 In the 1990s, along with Edward King, Watney back-tracked on the point at issue, arguing instead that the \\"everyone is at risk\\" approach misdirected public attention away from gay victims of the disease, which they said should be \\"re- gayed\\".Simon Watney Imagine Hope: Aids and Gay Identity, London: Routledge, 2000, p.235 Agreeing with Fitzpatrick and Milligan on the epidemiology, King in particular was much more critical on the political approach, which he said amounted to \\"hostility to any form of autonomous lesbian and gay self- organizing\\".Edward King Safety in Numbers: Safer Sex and Gay Men, London: Routledge, 1994, p.247 Nick Cohen,What's Left?, London: Harper, 2007 Marko Attila HoareThe Left Revisionist November 2003 and Oliver Kamm'\\"LM was probably correct\\" - Chomsky', 31 October 2005 strongly criticised the party and its former members after the dissolution for opposing the humanitarian interventions in Bosnia, Kosovo and Iraq. Hoare, Cohen and Kamm also rejected Noam Chomsky's defence of Living Marxism and its coverage of the Bosnian war.Marko Attila Hoare \\"The Guardian, Noam Chomsky and the Milosevic Lobby\\" , Henry Jackson Society, 4 February 2006 In 1997, environmental journalist George Monbiot argued that the party had undue influence at Channel 4 in an article titled \\"Marxists found alive in C4\\" after two of its members contributed to the Against Nature television programme, whose director Martin Durkin is also connected to the group.George Monbiot, \\"Marxists found alive in C4\\", The Guardian, 18 December 1997. Monbiot's online version of the article has had its headline changed from the print version, to \\"The Revolution has been Televised\\" Elsewhere, Monbiot took issue with Living Marxism for putting too much stress on freedom as if \\"there should be no limits to human action, least of all those imposed by 'official and semi-official agencies [...] from the police and the courts to social services, counsellors and censors'\\".Far Left or Far Right? Prospect, November 1998 Andy Rowell and Jonathan Matthews of the Norfolk Genetic Information Network criticised the party for championing genetic engineering. Rowell and Matthews, 'Strange Bedfellows,' The Ecologist, 19 March 2003 Andy Rowell and Bob BurtonRising Rhetoric on Genetically Modified Crops, PRWatch, First Quarter 2003, Volume 10, No. 1 along with Jonathan Matthews of the Norfolk Genetic Information Network charged Living Marxism with a history of attacking the environmental movement.  Disbandment  At the end of the 1980s, the party had moved away from its roots as a Trotskyist organisation, leading some critics to argue that they had abandoned the notion of the class struggle. In 1988, its weekly tabloid newspaper The Next Step carried an article arguing that \\"the disintegration of the official labour movement, and the apparent lack of a left-wing alternative, has consolidated an overwhelmingly defensive mood in the working class\\".'The Problem of Political Leadership', the next step, 3 June 1988, pp. 8-9 In the 1987 general election, party members stood as part of the Red Front, arguing that working people needed to break with the Labour Party, but no Red Front candidate retained their election deposit. In 1988, the party made The Next Step into a bulletin for its supporters. Later that year, a monthly magazine called Living Marxism was set up for a wider readership. Despite its beginnings as a far-left outlet, the politics espoused by the magazine developed a pronounced libertarianism. In December 1990, Living Marxism ran an article which argued that the corrosive effect of the collapse of both Stalinism and reformism on the working class meant that \\"for the time being at least, the working class has no political existence\\".Frank Furedi \\"Midnight in the Century\\", Living Marxism, December 1990 In 1997, the point was put more forcefully: > In today's circumstances class politics cannot be reinvented, rebuilt, > reinvigorated or rescued. Why? Because any dynamic political outlook needs > to exist in an interaction with existing individual consciousness. And > contemporary forms of consciousness in our atomised societies cannot be used > as the foundation for a more developed politics of solidarity.Frank Furedi > \\"Class politics cannot be rebuilt or regenerated today\\", LM, May 1997 Between 1990 and 1997, the party developed the view that more than capitalism itself the danger facing humanity was the absence of a force for social change (in philosophical language, a \\"subject\\" of history) and the culture of low expectations that suppressed it.James Heartfield, The 'Death of the Subject' Explained, Sheffield, 2002 Prefacing a 1996 Living Marxism manifesto, Mick Hume argued: > Of course [...] we could have produced a familiar list of left-wing slogans > complaining about problems like unemployment, exploitation and poverty which > continue to scar our society. But that would be to ignore the transformation > which has taken place in the political climate [...]. At different times, > different issues matter most. Each era has thrown up its own great questions > which define which side you are on [...]. [A]t Living Marxism, we see our > job today as doing much more than criticising capitalism. That is the easy > bit. There is a more pressing need to criticise the fatalistic critics, to > counter the doom-mongers and put a positive case for human action in pursuit > of social liberation. [...] [D]ealing with [...] unconventional questions, > and puncturing the anti-human prejudices which surround them, is the > precondition for making political action possible in our time.The Point is > to Change It: A Manifesto for a World Fit for People, London: Junius (1996), > p.x-xiii. In February 1997, shortly after the party disbanded, Living Marxism re-branded as LM, possibly to further distance itself from its leftist origins. Articles in LM argued: * Against support for Tony Blair's New Labour project in 1997.'Nightmare on Downing Street,' LM, May 1997, issue 100 * Against \\"humanitarian interventions\\" in the Balkans, East Timor and Iraq.Linda Ryan \\"Narcissus' Empire\\", LM, December 1999, issue 126 * For freedom of speech and the \\"right to be offensive\\".James Heartfield 'Why hate speech?' LM, February 1998, issue 107 * Against the \\"new authoritarianism\\" of CCTV cameras, anti- social behaviour orders and anti-harassment laws.Charlotte Reynolds 'Hard Labour', LM,, May 1997, issue 100 * Against the demonisation of the white working class.Michael Fitzpatrick 'Yob culture clash', Living Marxism, November 1994, issue 73 This magazine ran at least two articles in which the authors argued that the mass murder carried out in Rwanda in 1994 should not be described as genocide. In December 1995, LM carried a report from an aid worker in Rwanda which argued: > The lesson I would draw from my visit is that we must reject the term > 'genocide' in Rwanda. It has been used inside and outside Rwanda to > criminalise the majority of ordinary Rwandan people, to justify outside > interference in the country's affairs, and to lend legitimacy to a minority > military government imposed on Rwanda by Western powers.\\"Massacring the > truth in Rwanda\\", LM, December 1995, issue 85 LM continued to create controversy on a variety of issues, most notably on the British Independent Television News (ITN) coverage of the Balkan conflict in the 1990s. The controversy centred on LM featuring an article by Thomas Deichmann in which he alleged that the ITN coverage of a refugee detention centre in Trnopolje during the conflict gave the false impression that the Bosnian Muslims were being held against their will in Serbian concentration camps. The ensuing libel award and costs arising from legal action by the ITN against LM were estimated to total around ¬£1 million. The action bankrupted the magazine and its publishers.  Later organisations  Many former members of the party and some of the people who contributed to LM magazine continue to be politically active, most notably in the Academy of Ideas, a think tank led by Claire Fox; the online magazine Spiked, initially edited by Mick Hume and later by Brendan O'Neill; and the Manifesto Club in which a leading figure is Munira Mirza, appointed by Boris Johnson as London's Director of Policy for culture, the arts and creative industries, and subsequently as his head of Number 10 policy unit. These organisations continue in their different ways the adversarial politics of LM magazine and the party. Some commentators, such as George Monbiot, have pointed to apparent entryist tactics used by former RCP members designed to influence mainstream public opinion.George Monbiot Invasion of the entryists, The Guardian, 9 December 2003 One party member from the 1990s explained in an article in Spiked: > I never left the RCP: the organisation folded in the mid-Nineties, but few > of us actually 'recanted' our ideas. Instead we resolved to support one > another more informally as we pursued our political tradition as > individuals, or launched new projects with more general aims that have also > engaged people from different traditions, or none. These include Spiked and > the Institute of Ideas, where I now work. It must be said that this > development annoyed our political opponents immensely, and a cursory Google > search (try 'LM network' if you have time to kill) will return a plethora of > expos√©s purporting to show that former members of the RCP are involved in > various sinister conspiracies.

In April 2019, three former members of the Revolutionary Communist Party, Claire Fox, James Heartfield and Dr Alka Sehgal Cuthbert were selected as candidates for Nigel Farage's Brexit Party in the 2019 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom.

He is well known for his work on sociology of fear, education, therapy culture, paranoid parenting and sociology of knowledge. Political history A former student radical, he became involved in left- wing politics in Britain in the 1970s; in particular, as a member of the International Socialists (IS), under the pseudonym Frank Richards; and subsequently, as founder and leader of the Revolutionary Communist Party. In the 1990s he was actively involved in humanist-focused issues, especially campaigns for free speech. Furedi's academic work was initially devoted to a study of imperialism and race relations. His books on the subject include The Mau-Mau War in Perspective, The New Ideology of Imperialism and The Silent War: Imperialism and the Changing Perception of Race. In recent years his work has been oriented towards exploring the sociology of risk and low expectations. Furedi is author of several books on this topic, most recently Wasted: Why Education Isn't Educating (Continuum 2009) and Invitation to Terror: The Expanding Empire of the Unknown (Continuum 2007), an analysis of the impact of terrorism post 9/11. His more recent publications, On Tolerance: A Defence of Moral Independence (Continuum 2011) and Authority: A Sociological Introduction (Cambridge University Press) deal with the inter-related problem of freedom and authority. He is, according to research from 2005, the most widely cited sociologist in the UK press. He lives in Faversham and is the husband of Ann Furedi, the Chief Executive of British Pregnancy Advisory Service, the UK's largest independent abortion provider. He is a supporter of Humanists UK. Biography Furedi's family emigrated from Hungary to Canada after the failed 1956 uprising, and he did his bachelor's degree in international relations at McGill University in Montreal. He has lived in Britain since 1969, and completed his M.A. (on African politics) and his Ph.D. (on the Mau Mau Uprising in Kenya) at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London University.Curriculum Vitae , University of Kent website RCP and offshoots In the 1970s, Furedi co-founded the Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP). The RCP was distinguished by its commitment to theoretical elaboration and hostility to state intervention in social life. Furedi is associated with the web journal Spiked Online. Furedi maintains that society and universities are undergoing a politically driven 'dumbing down' process which is manifest in society's growing inability to understand and assess the meaning of risk. The rise of the environmental and green movements parallels society's growing obsession with risk. Furedi also attacks the scientific consensus on global warming, and has criticised the prominent role played by science in policy formation. As a humanist educator, he is critical of the attempt to subject schooling to technocratic and instrumentalist policy making. Media appearances Furedi frequently appears in the media, expressing his view that Western societies have become obsessed with risk. He writes regularly for Spiked Online. He has also written several books on the subject of risk, offering a counterpoint to the analyses of Anthony Giddens and Ulrich Beck, including Paranoid Parenting, Therapy Culture, and Culture of Fear. In 2008 he criticised opponents of American vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin on the Spiked website.Frank Furedi \\"Turning Sarah Palin into a twenty-first century witch\\", Spiked-Online, 8 September 2008. He claims: \\"It seems that even fervent advocates of women‚Äôs rights will adopt outdated and chauvinistic moral rhetoric when targeting a woman they do not like.\\" Collaboration with Jennie Bristow In 2008 he co-authored a book with Jennie Bristow published by the think tank Civitas titled Licensed to Hug: How Child Protection Policies Are Poisoning the Relationship Between the Generations and Damaging the Voluntary Sector, arguing that the growth of police vetting (see Criminal Records Bureau) has created a sense of mistrust and advocating a more common-sense approach to adult/child relations, based on the assumption that the vast majority of adults can be relied on to help and support children, and that the healthy interaction between generations enriches children's lives. Critical responses Critics of Furedi are drawn from a wide spectrum of left and progressive opinion and have consistently focused on what they claim to be the cultish, self-serving and anti-democratic nature of the organizations with which he has been associated. George Monbiot has accused him of overseeing crypto-Trotskyist entryism designed to insert ex-RCPers into positions of cultural and media influence, where they pursue an extreme pro-technology right-wing libertarian agenda.Invasion of the entryists, The Guardian, 9 December 2003 The journalist, atheist blogger and pro-social equality campaigner Nick Cohen has described the RCP as a \\"weird cult\\"Nick Cohen vs the Institute of Ideas, New Humanist, November/December 2006 whose Leninist discipline, disruptive behaviour and selfish publicity- seeking have remained unaltered during the various tactical shifts in the face it presents to the wider world.Wireless: Long March to the Microphone, Standpoint, July/August 2010 Furedi and his admirers in the former RCP have dismissed these accusations as dishonest, cowardly and McCarthyite and characterize their critics as jealous, small-minded and unable to engage politically or intellectually with the ideas he and they devise and promulgate on a cooperative, non-coercive basis.'Humanising politics ‚Äì that is my only agenda', Spiked Online, 25 April 2007 Moreover, some liberal thinkers are strong admirers of Furedi and the philosopher Mary Warnock has argued that he is \\"to be respected in the strongest sense, indeed greatly admired\\" for his exposure of hypocrisy and intolerance in contemporary culture.On Tolerance: A War of Moral Independence, Times Higher Education, 29 September 2011 Bibliography *The Soviet Union Demystified: A Materialist Analysis, Junius Publications, 1986, *The Mau Mau War in Perspective, James Currey Publishers, 1989 *Mythical Past, Elusive Future: History and Society in an Anxious Age, Pluto Press, 1991 *The New Ideology of Imperialism: Renewing the Moral Imperative, Pluto Press, 1994 *Colonial Wars and the Politics of Third World Nationalism, IB Tauris, 1994 *Culture of Fear: Risk Taking and the Morality of Low Expectation, Continuum International Publishing Group, 1997, . 2nd edition: 2002, *Population and Development: A Critical Introduction, Palgrave Macmillan, 1997 *The Silent War: Imperialism and the Changing Perception of Race, Pluto Press, 1998 *Courting Mistrust: The Hidden Growth of a Culture of Litigation in Britain, Centre for Policy Studies, 1999 *Paranoid Parenting: Abandon Your Anxieties and Be a Good Parent, Allen Lane, 2001 *Therapy Culture: Cultivating Vulnerability in an Uncertain Age, Routledge, 2003 *Where Have All the Intellectuals Gone?: Confronting Twenty-First Century Philistinism, Continuum International Publishing Group, 2004 *The Politics of Fear.

They are the descendants of mostly Tosk Albanian refugees, who fled from Albania between the fourteenth and eighteenth centuries in consequence of the Ottoman invasion of the Balkans. During the Middle Ages, the Arb√´resh√´ settled in Southern Italy in several waves of migration, following the establishment of the Kingdom of Albania, the death of the Albanian national hero Gjergj Kastrioti Sk√´nderbeu and the gradual conquest of Albania and the Byzantine Empire by the Ottomans. Their culture is determined by the main features that are found in language, religion, traditions, customs, art and gastronomy, still zealously preserved, with the awareness of belonging to a specific ethnic group. Over the centuries, the Arb√´resh√´ have managed to maintain and develop their identities, thanks to their cultural value exercised mainly by the two religious communities of the Byzantine Rite based in Calabria, the Corsini College in 1732 then Corsini Adriano College of San Benedetto Ullano in 1794 and the Arb√´resh√´ Seminary of Palermo in 1735, which was then transferred to Piana degli Albanesi in 1945. Nowadays, most of the fifty Arb√´resh√´ communities are adherents to the Italo- Albanian Church, an Eastern Catholic Church. They belong to two eparchies, the Lungro, for the Arb√´resh√´ of Continental Italy, the Piana degli Albanesi, for the Arb√´resh√´ of Sicily, and the Monastery of Grottaferrata, whose Basilian monks come largely from the Albanian settlements of Italy. The church is the most important organization for maintaining the characteristic religious, ethnic, linguistic and traditional identity of the Arb√´resh√´ community. The Arb√´resh√´ speak Arb√´resh, a variant of Albanian that descends from Tosk Albanian. This Albanian dialect is of particular interest to students of the modern Albanian language as it retains speech sounds, morphosyntactic and vocabulary elements of the language spoken in pre-Ottoman Albania. In Italy, Arb√´resh√´ is protected by law number 482/99, concerning the protection of the historic linguistic minorities. The Arb√´resh√´ are scattered throughout southern Italy and Sicily and in small numbers also in other parts of Italy. They are in great numbers in North and South America, especially in the US, Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Mexico, Venezuela, Uruguay and Canada. It is estimated that there are about 100,000 Italo-Albanians (400,000 if including those outside of Italy); they constitute one of the oldest and largest minorities in Italy. Being Italian and Arb√´resh√´ are both central to Italo- Albanians' identity.Essays on Politics and Society Author Hasan Jashari Publisher lulu.com, 2015 , p. 64 When speaking about their \\"nation\\", Arb√´resh use the term Arb√´ria, a loose geographical term for the scattered villages in southern Italy which use Arb√´resh language. They are proud of their Albanian ethnicity, identity and culture, but also identify themselves as Italian nationals, since they have lived in Italy for hundreds of years. In the light of historical events, the secular continuity of the Albanian presence in Italy is exceptional. In 2017, with the Republic of Albania and Kosovo, an official application for inclusion of the Arb√´resh people has been submitted to the UNESCO as a living human and social immaterial patrimony of humanity.Arb√´resh√´t k√´rkojn√´ t√´ an√´tar√´sohen n√´ UNESCO  History = Ethnonym  In the Middle Ages, the native Albanians in the area of Albania called their country Arb√´ri or Arb√´ni and referred to themselves as Arb√´resh√´ or Arb√´nesh√´.Kristo Frasheri. History of Albania (A Brief Overview). Tirana, 1964. In the sixteenth century, the toponym Shqip√´ria and the demonym Shqiptar√´ gradually replaced Arb√´ria and Arb√´resh respectively. Nowadays, only the Albanians in Italy, whose ancestors immigrated from the Middle Ages, are called Arb√´resh and the language Arb√´risht. The term Arb√´resh√´ is also used as an endonym by the Arvanites in Greece.  Early migrations  Skanderbeg led 2,500 Albanian soldiers into the Kingdom of Naples in 1458 The Battle of Torvioll in 1444 was the first confrontation between Skanderbeg's Albanians and the Ottoman Turks The Arb√´resh√´, between the 11th and 14th centuries, moved in small groups towards central and southern Albania and the north and south of Greece (Thessaly, Corinth, Peloponnesus, Attica) where they founded colonies. Their military skill made them favorite mercenaries of the Franks, Catalans, Italians and Byzantines. The invasion of the Balkans by the Ottoman Turks in the 15th century forced many Arb√´resh√´ to emigrate from Albania and Epirus to the south of Italy. There were several waves of migrations. Indeed, in 1448, the King of Naples Alfonso V of Aragon appealed to Skanderbeg in suppressing a revolt at Naples. Skanderbeg sent a force under the leadership of Demetrio Reres, and his two sons. Following a request of Albanian soldiers, King Alfonso granted land to them and they were settled in twelve villages in the mountainous area called Catanzaro in 1448. A year later the sons of Demetrio, George and Basil along with other Albanians were settled in four villages in the region of Sicily.The Italo-Albanian villages of southern Italy Issue 25 of Foreign field research program, report, National Research Council (U.S.) Division of Earth Sciences Volume 1149 of Publication (National Research Council (U.S.)) Foreign field research program, sponsored by Office of Naval research, report ; no.25 Issue 25 of Report, National Research Council (U.S.).

This time, the legendary leader himself came to Italy with his troops ruled by one of his general Luca Baffa, to end a French-supported insurrection. Skanderbeg was appointed as the leader of the combined Neapolitan-Albanian army and, after victories in two decisive battles, the Albanian soldiers effectively defended Naples. This time they were rewarded with land east of Taranto in Apulia, populating 15 other villages.The Italo-Albanian villages of southern Italy Issue 25 of Foreign field research program, report, National Research Council (U.S.).

Like much of the Balkans, Albania became subject to the invading Turks. Many of its people under the rule of Luca Baffa and Marco Becci fled to the neighboring countries and settled in a few villages in Calabria. From the time of Skanderbeg's death until 1480 there were constant migrations of Albanians to the Italian coast. Throughout the 16th century, these migrations continued and other Albanian villages were formed on Italian soil.The Italo-Albanian villages of southern Italy Issue 25 of Foreign field research program, report, National Research Council (U.S.).

Another wave of emigration, between 1500 and 1534, relates to Arb√´resh√´ from central Greece. Employed as mercenaries by Venice, they had to evacuate the colonies of the Peloponnese with the assistance of the troops of Charles V, as the Turks had invaded that region. Charles V established these troops in Italy of the South to reinforce defense against the threat of Turkish invasion. Established in insular villages (which enabled them to maintain their culture until the 20th century), Arb√´resh√´ were, traditionally, soldiers for the Kingdom of Naples and the Republic of Venice, from the Wars of Religion to the Napoleonic invasion.  Later migrations  The wave of migration from southern Italy to the Americas in 1900‚Äì1910 and 1920‚Äì1940 depopulated approximately half of the Arb√´resh√´ villages, and subjected the population to the risk of cultural disappearance, despite the beginning of a cultural and artistic revival in the 19th century. Since the end of communism in Albania in 1990, there has been a wave of immigration into Arb√´resh√´ villages by Albanians.

The Arb√´resh√´ communities are divided into numerous ethnic islands corresponding to different areas of southern Italy. However, some places have already lost their original characteristics and the language, and others have totally disappeared. Today, Italy has 50 communities of Arb√´resh√´ origin and culture, 41 municipalities and 9 villages, spread across seven regions of southern Italy, forming a population of about 100,000. Some cultural islands survive in the metropolitan areas of Milan, Chieri, Turin, Rome, Naples, Bari, Cosenza, Crotone and Palermo. In the rest of the world, following the migrations of the twentieth century to countries such as Germany, Canada, Chile, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Venezuela, Uruguay and the United States, there are strong communities that keep Arb√´resh√´ traditions alive. The full list of the Arb√´resh Communities in Italy is: * Abruzzo ** Province of Pescara *** Villa Badessa (frazione of Rosciano): Badhesa * Molise ** Province of Campobasso *** Campomarino: K√´marini *** Montecilfone: Munxhufuni *** Portocannone: Portkanuni *** Ururi: R√πri * Campania ** Province of Avellino *** Greci: Katundi * Apulia ** Province of Foggia *** Casalvecchio di Puglia: Kazallveqi *** Chieuti: Qefti ** Provincia di Taranto *** San Marzano di San Giuseppe: Sh√´n Marcani * Basilicata ** Province of Potenza *** Barile: Barilli *** Ginestra: Zhura *** Maschito: Mashqiti *** Rionero in Vulture: A-Rionero *** San Costantino Albanese: Sh√´n Kostandini Arb√´resh *** San Paolo Albanese: Sh√´n Pali Arb√´resh * Calabria ** Province of Catanzaro *** Andali: Andalli *** Caraffa di Catanzaro: Garafa *** Marcedusa: Mar√ß√´dhuza *** Vena di Maida (frazione of Maida): Vina ** Province of Cosenza *** Acquaformosa: Firmoza *** Cantinella (frazione of Corigliano-Rossano): Kantinela *** Cerzeto (in the commune of Cerzeto): Qana *** Castroregio: Kast√´rnexhi *** Cavallerizzo (frazione of Cerzeto): Kajverici *** Civita: √áifti *** Eianina (frazione of Frascineto): Pur√ß√¨ll *** Falconara Albanese: Fullkunara *** Farneta (frazione of Castroregio): Farneta *** Firmo: Ferma *** Frascineto: Frasnita *** Lungro: Ungra *** Macchia Albanese (frazione of San Demetrio Corone): Maqi *** Malito *** Marri (frazione of San Benedetto Ulolano): Allimarri ***Mongrassano: Mungrasana *** Plataci: Pllat√´ni *** San Basile: Sh√´n Vasili *** San Benedetto Ullano: Sh√´n Benedhiti *** Santa Caterina Albanese: Picilia *** San Cosmo Albanese Strih√†ri *** San Demetrio Corone: Sh√´n Mitri *** San Giorgio Albanese: Mbuzati *** San Giacomo di Cerzeto (frazione of Cerzeto): Sh√´n Japku *** San Martino di Finita: Sh√´n M√´rtiri *** Santa Sofia d'Epiro: Sh√´n Sofia *** Spezzano Albanese: Spixana *** Vaccarizzo Albanese: Vakarici ** Province of Crotone *** Carfizzi: Karfici *** Pallagorio: Puh√´riu *** San Nicola dell'Alto Sh√´n Kolli * Sicilia ** Province of Palermo *** Contessa Entellina: Kundisa *** Piana degli Albanesi: Hora e Arb√´resh√´vet *** Santa Cristina Gela: S√´ndahstina  Language  Arb√´risht language classification Arb√´resh derives from the Tosk dialect spoken in southern Albania, and is spoken in Southern Italy in the regions of Calabria, Molise, Apulia, Basilicata, Campania, Abruzzi, and Sicily. All dialects of Arb√´resh are closely related to each other but are not entirely mutually intelligible. Bilingual signs in Piana degli Albanesi, Sicily Road signs bilingual, in Italian and Albanian in Piana degli Albanesi The Arb√´resh language retains many archaisms of medieval Albanian from pre-Ottoman Albania in the 15th century. It also retains some Greek language elements, including vocabulary and pronunciation. It has also preserved some conservative features that were lost in mainstream Albanian Tosk. For example, it has preserved certain syllable-initial consonant clusters which have been simplified in Standard Albanian (cf. Arb√´risht gluh√´ ('language/tongue'), vs. Standard Albanian gjuh√´ ). It sounds more archaic than Standard Albanian, but is close enough that it is written using the same Albanian alphabet as Standard Albanian. A Shqiptar (Albanian) listening to or reading Arb√´risht is similar to a modern English speaker listening to or reading Shakespearean English. The Arb√´resh language is of particular interest to students of the modern Albanian language as it represents the sounds, grammar, and vocabulary of pre-Ottoman Albania. Arb√´risht was commonly called (\\"Albanian\\" in Italian) in Italy until the 1990s. Until recently, Arb√´risht speakers had only very imprecise notions about how related or unrelated their language was to Albanian. Until the 1980s Arb√´risht was exclusively a spoken language, except for its written form used in the Italo-Albanian Church, and Arb√´resh√´ people had no practical affiliation with the Standard Albanian language used in Albania, as they did not use this form in writing or in media. When a large number of immigrants from Albania began to enter Italy in the 1990s and came into contact with local Arb√´resh√´ communities. Since the 1980s, some efforts have been organized to preserve the cultural and linguistic heritage of the language. Arb√´risht has been under a slow decline in recent decades, but is currently experiencing a revival in many villages in Italy. Figures such as Giuseppe Schir√≤ Di Maggio have done much work on school books and other language learning tools in the language, producing two books Udha e Mbar√´ and Udh√´timi, both used in schools in the village of Piana degli Albanesi. There is no official political, administrative or cultural structure which represents the Arb√´resh community. Arb√´r√´sh is not one of the group of minority languages that enjoy the special protection of the State under Article 6 of the Italian Constitution. At the regional level, however, Arb√´risht is accorded some degree of official recognition in the autonomy statutes of Calabria, Basilicata and Molise. * In the case of Calabria, the region is to provide for recognition of the historical culture and artistic heritage of the populations of Arb√´resh origin and to promote the teaching of the two languages in the places where they are spoken. * Article 5 of the autonomy statute of Basilicata lays down that the regional authorities \\"shall promote renewed appreciation of the originality of the linguistic and cultural heritage of the local communities\\". * Finally, the autonomy statute of the Molise region stipulates that the region \\"shall be the guardian of the linguistic and historical heritage and of the popular traditions of the ethnic communities existing in its territory and, by agreement with the interested municipalities, shall promote renewed appreciation of them\\". In certain communes the local authorities support cultural and linguistic activities promoted by the Arb√´resh communities and have agreed to the erection of bilingual road signs.Euromosaic. Albanian in Italy. There are associations that try to protect the culture, particularly in the Province of Cosenza. The Arb√´resh language is used in some private radios and publications. The fundamental laws of the areas of Molise, Basilicata and Calabria make reference to the Arb√´resh language and culture. Nevertheless, the increase in training in the use of the written language has given some hope for the continuity of this culture.  Literature  Early Arb√´resh√´ literature = The first work of Italo-Albanian literature was that of Sicilian archpriest Luca Matranga (1567‚Äì1619). The book was titled E mbsuama e kr√´shter√´ (Christian Doctrine) and it was a simple religious translation in Arb√´resh language, aiming at bringing Christianity closer to his people is Southern Italy. While during the 17th century there were no Arb√´resh writers, in the 18th century there was Giulio Variboba (1724‚Äì1788, ), regarded by many Albanians as the first genuine poet in all of Albanian literature.Albanian literature: a short history Authors Robert Elsie, Centre for Albanian Studies (London, England) Publisher I.B. Tauris, 2005 , p. 45 Born in San Giorgio Albanese (Mbuzati) and educated in Corsini Seminary in San Benedetto Ullano, after many polemics with local priest he went to exile in Rome in 1761 and there he published in 1762 his long lyric poem Ghiella e Sh√´n M√´riis Virghi√´r (The life of Virgin Mary). The poem has been written entirely in dialect of San Giorgio and has about 4717 lines. Variboba is considered unique in Albanian literature for his poetic sensitivities and the variety of rhythmic expression. Another known artistic figure of that time was Nicola Chetta (1740‚Äì1803) known in Albanian as Nikoll√´ Keta. As a poet he wrote verses both in Albanian and Greek language and he has also composed the first Albanian sonnet in 1777. Being a poet, lexicographer, linguist, historian, theologian and rector of Greek seminary, his variety and universality of work distinguish him from other writers of the period.Albanian literature: a short history Authors Robert Elsie, Centre for Albanian Studies (London, England) Publisher I.B.Tauris, 2005 , p. 46-47 The most prominent figure among Arb√´resh writers and the foremost figure of the Albanian nationalist movement in 19th-century Italy was that of Girolamo de Rada (). Born the son of a parish priest of Italo-Albanian Catholic Church in Macchia Albanese () in the mountains of Cosenza, De Rada attended the college of Saint Adrian in San Demetrio Corone. In October 1834, in accordance with his father's wishes, he registered at the Faculty of Law of the University of Naples, but the main focus of his interests remained folklore and literature. It was in Naples in 1836 that De Rada published the first edition of his best-known Albanian-language poem, the \\"Songs of Milosao\\", under the Italian title Poesie albanesi del secolo XV. Canti di Milosao, figlio del despota di Scutari (Albanian poetry from the 15th century. Songs of Milosao, son of the despot of Shkodra). His second work, Canti storici albanesi di Serafina Thopia, moglie del principe Nicola Ducagino, Naples 1839 (Albanian historical songs of Serafina Thopia, wife of prince Nicholas Dukagjini), was seized by the Bourbon authorities because of De Rada's alleged affiliation with conspiratorial groups during the Italian Risorgimento. The work was republished under the title Canti di Serafina Thopia, principessa di Zadrina nel secolo XV, Naples 1843 (Songs of Serafina Thopia, princess of Zadrina in the 15th century) and in later years in a third version as Specchio di umano transito, vita di Serafina Thopia, Principessa di Ducagino, Naples 1897 (Mirror of human transience, life of Serafina Thopia, princess of Dukagjin). His Italian-language historical tragedy I Numidi, Naples 1846 (The Numidians), elaborated half a century later as Sofonisba, dramma storico, Naples 1892 (Sofonisba, historical drama), enjoyed only modest public response. In the revolutionary year 1848, De Rada founded the newspaper L'Albanese d'Italia (The Albanian of Italy) which included articles in Albanian. This bilingual \\"political, moral and literary journal\\" with a final circulation of 3,200 copies was the first Albanian-language periodical anywhere. De Rada was the harbinger and first audible voice of the Romantic movement in Albanian literature, a movement which, inspired by his unfailing energy on behalf of national awakening among Albanians in Italy and in the Balkans, was to evolve into the romantic nationalism characteristic of the Rilindja period in Albania. His journalistic, literary and political activities were instrumental not only in fostering an awareness for the Arb√´resh minority in Italy but also in laying the foundations for an Albanian national literature. The most popular of his literary works is the above- mentioned Canti di Milosao (Songs of Milosao), known in Albanian as K√´ng√´t e Milosaos, a long romantic ballad portraying the love of Milosao, a fictitious young nobleman in fifteenth-century Shkodra (Scutari), who has returned home from Thessalonica. Here, at the village fountain, he encounters and falls in love with Rina, the daughter of the shepherd Kollogre. The difference in social standing between the lovers long impedes their union until an earthquake destroys both the city and all semblance of class distinction. After their marriage abroad, a child is born. But the period of marital bliss does not last long. Milosao's son and wife soon die, and he himself, wounded in battle, perishes on a riverbank within sight of Shkodra. =19th-century Romantic poets =Contemporary literatureProtection of language= Culture = Traditions and Folklore  Among the Arb√´resh√´ the memory of Skanderbeg and his exploits was maintained and survived through songs, in the form of a Skanderbeg cycle. \\"The memory of the Albanian national hero was maintained vividly among the Albanians of Italy, those who emigrated to Calabria and Sicily, following his death.... Living compactly in Christian territory, though in separate communities, the Italo-Albanians have preserved the songs about Skenderbeg and his exploits which their ancestors had brought from the mother country. Today one may even speak of the existence of a Skenderbeg cycle among them, if one takes into account also the songs on other Albanian heroes who surrounded him.\\"  Gjiton√≠a  \\"Gjitonia\\" is a form of neighbourhood typical of Arb√´resh communities and widespread throughout the Arb√´resh people. It comes from the Greek Œ≥ŒµŒπœÑŒøŒΩŒπŒ¨ (geiton√≠a). The Gjiton√≠a functions as a microsystem around which the life of the hor√´ (village) revolves; the Gjiton√≠a is a smaller-scale version of the layout of the village often consisting of a small square towards which the alleys are oriented, surrounded by buildings that have openings towards a larger square (shesh) on diagonal angles. The name is usually taken from the families that live there. The social aspect of the Gjiton√≠a is an ancient and historical structure where values of hospitality and solidarity between the families of the neighbourhood coexisted and where there was no difference of social class. Mainly for the Italian-Albanian communities, it is a world where relationships were so strong that they created real family relationships so much so that the Arb√´reshe phrase Gjitoni gjir√¨ (\\"neighbourhood relatives\\") is typical.MASCI, L.F.

Sofia D'Epiro 2004  Costume Cuisine Tumac√´ me tul√´, Arb√´resh√´ dish from Barile (Potenza, Basilicata) The Arb√´resh√´ cuisine is composed of the cuisines of Albania and Italy. The style of cooking and the food associated with it have evolved over many centuries from their Albanian origins to a mixed cuisine of Sicilian, Calabrian and Lucanian influences. These traditional dishes are Piana degli Albanesi (Palermo, Sicily): * Stranguj√´t ‚Äì A form of Gnocchi called Strangujt√´ made with flour by hand, flavoured with tomato sauce (l√´nk) and basil. Traditionally this dish was consumed by families seated around a floor level table of wood (zbrilla) on 14 September, the Festa e Kryqit Shejt (Exaltation of the Cross). * Grur√´t ‚Äì Boiled wheat dish flavored with olive oil, known as cucc√¨a in the Sicilian language. The tradition is to eat it on Festa e S√´nda Llu√ßis√´. Variations are the use of sweetened milk or ricotta with flakes of chocolate, orange peel and almonds. * Kanoj√´t ‚Äì Cannoli, the universally famous Pianotto sweet pastry. Its culinary secret is waffle (shkor√ßa) of flour, wine, lard and salt and filled with sweetened ricotta, and lastly sprinkled with sieved chocolate. * Buk√´ ‚Äì Arb√´resh bread (buk√´) is prepared with local hard grain flour and manufactured to a round and mostly leavened shape with natural methods. It is cooked in antique firewood furnaces (Tandoor). It is eaten warm flavored with olive oil (vaj i ullirit) and dusted with cheese or with fresh ricotta. * Panaret ‚Äì Arb√´resh Easter bread shaped either into a circle or into two large braids and sprinkled with sesame seeds. It is adorned with red Easter eggs. The Easter eggs are dyed deep red to represent the blood of Christ, the eggs also represent new life and springtime. It is traditionally eaten during the Resurrection Meal. After 40 days of fasting, as per the Byzantine Catholic tradition, the Easter feast has to begin slowly, with a light meal after the midnight liturgy on Saturday night. The fast is generally broken with panaret. * Loshkat and Petullat ‚Äì Sweetened spherical or crushed shaped fried leavened dough. Eaten on the eve of E Mart e Madh Carnival. * T√´ plotit ‚Äì A sweet cake in various shaped with fig marmalade filling, one of the oldest Arb√´resh dishes. * Milanis√´ ‚Äì Traditionally eaten on the Saint Joseph's Day (Festa e Sh√´n Zefit) and Good Friday, is a pasta dish made with a sauce (l√´nk) of wild fennel paste, sardines and pine nuts. * Udhose and Gjiz√´ ‚Äì Homemade cheese and ricotta normally dried outdoors. * Lik√´ng√´ ‚Äì Pork sausages flavored with salt, pepper and seed of Fennel (far√´ mbrai). * Llapsana ‚Äì Forest Brussel sprout (llapsana) fried with garlic and oil. * Dor√´z√´t ‚Äì Very thin home-made semolina spaghetti, cooked in milk and eaten on Ascension Day. * Grosh√´t ‚Äì Soup made of fava beans, chickpeas and haricot beans. * Verdh√´t ‚Äì During Easter a kind of pie is prepared with eggs, lamb, ricotta, sheep cheese and (previously boiled) leaf stalks of golden thistle; in some villages, the young aerial parts of wild fennel are used instead.  Religion  The Italo-Albanian Catholic Church, particular church sui iuris, includes three ecclesiastical jurisdictions: the Eparchy of Lungro degli Italo-Albanesi for the Albanians of Southern Italy based in Lungro (CS); the Eparchy of Piana degli Albanesi for Albanians of Insular Italy based in Piana degli Albanesi (PA); the Territorial Abbacy of Santa Maria of Grottaferrata, with Basilian monks (O.S.B.I.) come from the Italo-Albanian communities, located in the only abbey and abbey church in Grottaferrata (RM). The Italo-Albanian Catholic Church being a Byzantine enclave in the Latin West, is secularly inclined to ecumenism between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church. It was the only reality, the end of the Middle Ages until the twentieth century, of Eastern spirituality in Italy. There are institutions and religious congregations of the Byzantine rite in the territory of the Italo-Albanian Church: the Basilian Order of Grottaferrata, the Collegine Sisters of Sacra Famiglia, Piccole operaie dei Sacri Cuori and the congregation of the Basilian Sisters Daughters of Saint Macrina.

He was the foremost Victorian architect in the Roman revival, Greek revival, Georgian neoclassical and Regency styles. He was accomplished also in the cottage orn√©, picturesque and neogothic styles. He was a founding fellow and, later, vice- president, of the Royal Institute of British Architects, and architect to the Royal Botanic Society from 1840 and an early member of the Athenaeum Club, London, whose club premises he designed and which the company of father, James Burton, the pre-eminent property developer of Georgian London, built. Modern architectural historians Guy Williams (1990) and Dana Arnold (2004) contend that Burton's contribution to architecture has been underestimated: as a consequence of the misattribution to John Nash of many of his works; of his vituperation by his neo-gothic rival, Augustus Pugin; and of the consequent retention of his archives by his family. Burton's projects include Hyde Park, London (including the gate or screen at Hyde Park Corner, Wellington Arch, Cumberland Gate, Stanhope Gate, Grosvenor Gate, and the Prince of Wales's Gate, Knightsbridge); Green Park and St James's Park; Regent's Park, London (including Cornwall Terrace, York Terrace, Clarence Terrace, Chester Terrace, and the villas of the Inner Circle (which included his own mansion, The Holme, and the original Winfield House); the enclosure of the forecourt of Buckingham Palace, from which he had Nash's Marble Arch facing the Palace moved to its present site; the clubhouse of the Athenaeum Club; Carlton House Terrace; Spring Gardens in St. James's; and the Palm House and the Temperate House at Kew Gardens. Outside London, Burton planned, and designed the architecture of, the seaside towns of St Leonards-on-Sea and Fleetwood, and the spa town Tunbridge Wells. His development of the Calverley Estate, of which only a small proportion survives, that contained elements of the neoclassical, the Old English and the neogothic styles, was highly commended: it has been described as \\"a landmark in English domestic architecture\\". For two decades he was engaged on a vast landscaping project to renovate Phoenix Park in Dublin. He was the architect of Dublin Zoo, and of the renewal of the sea-side resort of Queenstown. Decimus was the tenth child of James Burton. He was taught by his father, Sir John Soane and John Nash. Decimus's siblings included James Burton, the Egyptologist, and Henry Burton, the physician, and he was a cousin of the Canadian author, Thomas Chandler Haliburton, and of the British civil servant Lord Haliburton. Burton was a leading member of London society during the late Georgian and Regency eras. He has been described by Williams as \\"rich, cool, well-dressed, apparently celibate, the designer and prime member of the Athenaeum, one of London's grandest gentlemens' clubs\\", and as one who was treated by the aristocracy \\"more as a friend than as a professional advisor\\". He had close friendships with Princess Victoria (the future Queen Victoria); the Duchess of Kent; William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire, John Wilson Croker, Sir John Soane, John Nash and Sir Humphry Davy. Family Decimus was the tenth child of James Burton, a pre-eminent London property developer (1761‚Äì1837), and Elizabeth Westley (12 December 1761 ‚Äì 14 January 1837), of Loughton, Essex, the daughter of John and Mary Westley. His father was born James Haliburton, and shortened his surname to Burton in 1794, between the births of his fourth and fifth children. The paternal grandfather was William Haliburton (1731‚Äì1785), a London property developer of Scottish descent. On his father's side, Decimus's great-great grandparents were Rev. James Haliburton (1681‚Äì1756) and Margaret Eliott, daughter of Sir William Eliott, 2nd Baronet and aunt of George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield. Decimus was descended from John Haliburton (1573‚Äì1627), from whom Sir Walter Scott was descended on the maternal side. Burton was a cousin of the Canadian author and barrister Thomas Chandler Haliburton and of the British civil servant Lord Haliburton, who was the first native Canadian to be raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Education and architectural style Decimus was born at the 'very comfortable and well staffed' North House in the newly built Southampton Terrace, Bloomsbury, London. From 1805, Decimus was raised in his father's mansion, Mabledon House, in Kent. Subsequent to the birth of his twelfth child, Jessy, in 1804, Decimus's father James Burton had purchased a site on a hill about one mile to the south of Tonbridge in Kent, where he constructed, to the designs of the architect Joseph T. Parkinson, in 1805, the large country mansion which he named Mabledon House, which was described in 1810 by the local authority as 'an elegant imitation of an ancient castellated mansion'. The majority of the stone that James Burton required for Mabledon was quarried from the hill on which it was to be built, but Burton also purchased the stone that had been released by the recent demolition of a nearby mansion, Penhurst Place. Decimus Burton was coincidentally commissioned to expand Mabledon, his childhood home, on several occasions after it had been sold by his father. Tuition by his father and George Maddox Decimus first trained with his father and received drawing lessons from George Maddox. Decimus's father James was a talented architect, in addition to the foremost contemporaneous property developer. Williams says of James Burton, \\"[He] was no ordinary builder. He could have put up an imposing and beautifully proportioned building, correct in every constructional detail, from the roughest of sketches tossed patronizingly at him by a 'gentleman architect'\\", and \\"James Burton became adept at relieving the monotony of long residential terraces by allowing their central blocks to project slightly from the surfaces to each side, and by bringing forward, too, the houses at each end\\", and that \\"the ironwork in a classical style in James Burton's Bloomsbury terraces was, and often still is, particularly fine, though mass produced\\". Samuel Pepys Cockerell, advisor to the Governors of the Foundling Hospital, a contemporary of James Burton, commended James Burton's architectural excellence: > Without such a man, possessed of very considerable talents, unwearied > industry, and a capital of his own, the extraordinary success of the > improvement of the Foundling Estate could not have taken place... By his own > peculiar resources of mind, he has succeeded in disposing of his buildings > and rents, under all disadvantages of war, and of an unjust clamour which > has repeatedly been raised against him. Mr Burton was ready to come forward > with money and personal assistance to relieve and help forward those > builders who were unable to proceed in their contracts; and in some > instances he has been obliged to resume the undertaking and complete himself > what has been weakly and imperfectly proceeded with.... In 1815, James Burton took Decimus to Hastings, where the two would later design and build St Leonards-on-Sea and, in 1816, Decimus commenced work in James Burton's office. Whilst working for his father, Decimus was present in the design and construction of Regent Street St. James. Simultaneously, Maddox taught Decimus architectural draughtsmanship, including the details of the five orders. After his first year of tuition by his father and Maddox, Decimus submitted to the Royal Academy a design for a bridge, which was commended by the Academy. Tuition at Royal Academy Schools by John Soane Burton has been described by Williams as \\"an exceptionally clever child\\" who demonstrated a dispassionate lack of emotion characteristic of his family. Decimus left Tonbridge School in 1816 and entered directly the Royal Academy Schools, in 1817. His contemporaries at the Royal Academy included Sidney Smirke, with whom he would restore Temple Church, London between 1841 and 1843, and William Tite. As a consequence of his father's social position, Burton was able to enter the Schools at an unprecedentedly young age, without having been previously articled to an architect. There he was taught by Sir John Soane, for whom his brother, James, had also worked. Soane was an advocate of the Neo-Palladian style, but had repudiated, including to his students, Robert Smirke's new Opera House, which had not been built in proportion: Soane used special diagrams to demonstrate to his students, including Burton, the failings of Smirke's design, as a consequence of which he was ostracized within the Royal Academy and compelled to suspend his lectures. Soane commended, in contradistinction, in 1815, as an archetype of neoclassical excellence, Robert Adam's [Kedleston Hall]: \\"In this superb structure he [Adam] has united... the taste and magnificence of a Roman villa with all the comforts and conveniences of an English Nobleman's residence\\". Tuition by John Nash Whereas Decimus's father James Burton was vigorously industrious, and had become 'most gratifyingly rich', John Nash's early years in private practice, and his first speculative developments, which failed either to sell or let, were unsuccessful, and his consequent financial shortage was exacerbated by the 'crazily extravagant' wife whom he had married before he had completed his training, until he was declared bankrupt in 1783. To resolve his financial shortage, Nash cultivated the acquaintance of James Burton, who consented to patronize him. James Burton was responsible for the social and financial patronage of the majority of Nash's London designs, in addition to for their construction, and Decimus became acquainted with Nash through his father. Architectural scholar Guy Williams has written, 'John Nash relied on James Burton for moral and financial support in his great enterprises. Decimus had showed precocious talent as a draughtsman and as an exponent of the classical style... John Nash needed the son's aid, as well as the father's'. Subsequent to the Crown Estate's refusal to finance them, James Burton agreed to personally finance the construction projects of John Nash at Regent's Park, which he had already been commissioned to construct. In return, Nash agreed to promote the career of Decimus Burton. Nash was a vehement advocate of the neoclassical revival endorsed by Soane, although he had lost interest in the plain stone edifices typical of the Georgian style, and instead advocated the use of stucco. Decimus Burton entered the office of Nash in 1815, where he worked alongside Augustus Charles Pugin, who detested the neoclassical style. Decimus established his own architectural practice in 1821. In 1821, Nash invited Decimus to design Cornwall Terrace in Regent's Park, and Decimus was also invited by George Bellas Greenough, a close friend of the Prince Regent, Humphrey Davy, and Nash, to design Grove House in Regent's Park. Greenough's invitation to Decimus Burton was 'virtually a family affair', for Greenhough had dined frequently with Decimus's parents and Decimus's brothers, including the physician Henry Burton. Greenough and Decimus finalized their designs during numerous meetings at the opera. Decimus's design, when the villa had been completed, was described in The Proceedings of the Royal Society as, 'One of the most elegant and successful adaptations of the Grecian style to purposes of modern domestic architecture to be found in this or any country'. Subsequently, Nash invited Burton to design Clarence Terrace, Regent's Park. Nash was appointed architectural 'overseer' for Decimus's Regent's Park projects: Cornwall Terrace, York Terrace, Chester Terrace, Clarence Terrace, the villas along the Inner Circle, including The Holme and the London Colosseum attraction, to Thomas Hornor's specifications. However, to Nash's great annoyance, Decimus disregarded the latter's advice and developed the terraces according to his own style. As a result, Nash sought, unsuccessfully, to demolish and completely rebuild Chester Terrace. Decimus subsequently eclipsed his master and emerged as the dominant force in the design of Carlton House Terrace, where he exclusively designed No. 3 and No.4. Decimus also designed some of the villas of the Inner Circle: his villa for the Marquess of Hertford has been described as, 'decorated simplicity, such as the hand of taste, aided by the purse of wealth can alone execute'. Other influences Carlton Gardens, to the design of which Burton made extensive contributions Decimus was a polymath and a philomath and extremely erudite in both arts and sciences, as was demonstrated by the diversity of his library ‚Äì a part of which was auctioned off by his nieces after his death. The sale catalogue listed 347 separate lots, some of which ran into many volumes. The collection bore witness to the range of his intellectual interests. It contained the Proceedings of the Camden Society complete in 135 volumes and transactions of many of the learned societies of which Burton was a member, as well as a complete set of the Histoire Naturelle (70 vols.) of G. L. L. Buffon and Bernard Germain de Lac√©p√®de. The architectural texts comprised mostly standard works on classical architecture, such as the five volumes of Colen Campbell, Vitruvius Britannicus by John Woolfe and James Gandon, James Gibbs's Book of Architecture, and William Kent's The Designs of Inigo Jones. Alongside these, there were numerous topographical views and surveys of cities and counties in the collection. There were also some foreign-language texts, including volumes by Charles Percier and Jean-Baptiste Rondelet, a complete set of Giovanni Battista Piranesi's works, and several dictionaries. The absence of an educative Grand Tour early in his career meant that his books and casts were the sources for his early designs, which are technically formal and academic in style. However, later on he did travel extensively in Europe and North America. His first tours were of France and Spain, in 1826. He toured Holland in 1846 and Germany in 1850. He toured Italy, including Venice. He toured Canada and the United States, after departing Liverpool for Halifax, Nova Scotia, with his cousin Thomas Chandler Haliburton, a Tory MP and author. Burton collected an extensive collection of casts, which informed his work, over 200 of which he donated to the Victoria and Albert Museum, which displayed 18 of the same in its British Galleries. Amongst Burton's possession on his death were an oil painting of St. John, copied by Sir Joshua Reynolds from a work by Raphael; a model of the Temple on the Ilissus at Athens; a statuette of an Angel copied from an original by Thorwaldsen; framed drawings of 'A Royal Palace' by Joseph Gandy ARA (b. 1771), who had been described as 'an English Piranesi'; and a bronze lamp suspended from a snake's mouth. Although he was the leading exponent of Greek revival architecture, Burton was uniquely and significantly influenced by Ancient Roman architecture. It was in his Georgian neoclassical work that he attained the acme of his excellence. Dana Arnold (2002) described his Neoclassical work thus: \\"His use of the orders is always correct, but he showed a lack of pedantry in their application that sets him apart from some of his more doctrinaire contemporaries, such as Hamilton and Smirke. From Nash he had learned to combine the classical and the picturesque, and it is the picturesque that is predominant in much of his later work\\". In his later career, Decimus designed buildings in the Gothic revival style, the old English style and in the cottage orn√© style. His Gothic revival designs are unoriginal as he had little sympathy for the style. Life The Burton family mansion, The Holme in Regent's Park, which was built by the company of James Burton to a design by Decimus Burton. It has been described as \\"one of the most desirable private homes in London\\" by architectural scholar Guy Williams, and \\"a definition of Western civilization in a single view\\" by architectural critic Ian Nairn. Burton has been described, by architectural scholar Guy Williams, as \\"rich, cool, well-dressed, apparently celibate, the designer and prime member of the Athenaeum, one of London's grandest gentlemens' clubs\\" where Burton \\"mixed with many of the greatest in the land, meeting the most creative as well as those with enormous hereditary wealth\\". By 1826, the name of Decimus Burton \\"was on the lips of everyone who cared at all about the arts and architecture\\": he was \\"very well liked [and] his modesty, politeness, and upright bearing were endearing\\" and \\"his integrity and professional competence were worthy of the greatest respect\\". Burton was treated by the aristocracy 'more as a friend than as a professional advisor' and his close friendships with, and patronage by, the aristocracy were undamaged by the vituperation of both his person and his neoclassical architecture by Augustus Pugin and his disciples. The Proceedings of the Royal Society commended Burton's \\"extreme amiability of character\\". The Burtons' social circle included Princess Victoria; the Duchess of Kent; William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire; John Wilson Croker; John Nash; Sir Humphry Davy; George Bellas Greenough; Sir Peter Hesketh-Fleetwood; and their Canadian cousin, Thomas Chandler Haliburton. Decimus and his siblings, Jane, James (born 1786), Septimus, the solicitor, Octavia, and Jessy, would host Thomas on his visits to London. Burton was \\"on excellent terms\\" with Princess Victoria, and with the Duchess of Kent. The Princess and the Duchess, with several courtiers, had laid the foundation stone of a Decimus Burton School in Tunbridge Wells, and, five weeks later, in autumn 1834, they had stayed, by Burton's invitation, at James Burton's private villa at St Leonards-on-Sea, until several weeks into 1835. From 1818, Burton resided, with his father, at The Holme, Regent's Park, which has been described as \\"one of the most desirable private homes in London\\", which was designed as the Burton family mansion by Decimus, and built by James Burton's own company. The Holme was the second villa to be built in Regent's Park, and the first of those to be designed or constructed by the Burton family. The hallmark of the Burton design is the large semi-circular bay that divided the principal elevation, and which extended for two storeys. The original villa also had a conservatory of polygonal form, which used wrought iron glazing bars, then only recently patented, instead of the then customary wooden bars. The first villa to be constructed in the park was St. John's Lodge by John Raffield. Burton bought from the Crown a plot at Spring Gardens, St. James's Park, at the east end of The Mall, where he constructed, in the Georgian neoclassical townhouse style, No. 10, 12, and 14 Spring Gardens, as both his townhouse and his principal office. The buildings no longer exist, but elevations of them appear in the former LCC's Survey of London Vol. XX, and views of their interiors have been preserved in Hastings Museum. At the end of 1834, Burton had two \\"comfortable well-staffed homes\\", one in Spring Gardens and one at Tunbridge Wells, where he had another office at No. 10 Calverley Parade, where the Tunbridge Wells Civic Centre now stands. Williams records that, for Burton, \\"Money was rolling in. Income tax was of no concern. [Decimus] had a brother who could look after his business affairs and see to his investments\\". Burton retired in 1869, and subsequently resided at his homes at Gloucester Gardens, Kensington, and St. Leonards Lodge, St. Leonards- on-Sea, which adjoined 'The Uplands' and 'The Lawn' developments which he had designed. He never married nor had issue. He died in December 1881, at 1 Gloucester Road, Kensington, and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery, alongside his brother Henry Burton, and his sister Jessy Burton. Decimus was the last of his siblings to die. Over his grave is a tapering sarcophagus of grey Cornish granite, on a stepped base, with a shallow pyramidal cover. His tomb was Grade II listed building in 2001. On his death, his property, including his extensive library and all of his architectural drafts and notes passed to surviving members of his family, mostly to his nephew Alfred Henry Burton (d.1917) or his two unmarried nieces, Helen and Emily Jane Wood, who subsequently sold their share, despite that he had left his library to the Royal Institute of British Architects, of which he had served as President. However, Burton donated 200 of his extensive collection of casts, which informed his work, to the Victoria and Albert Museum, which displayed 18 of the same in its British Galleries. Amongst Burton's possession on his death were an oil painting of St. John, copied by Sir Joshua Reynolds from a work by Raphael; a model of the Temple on the Ilissus at Athens; a statuette of an Angel copied from an original by Thorwaldsen; framed drawings of 'A Royal Palace' by Joseph Gandy ARA (b. 1771), who had been described as 'an English Piranesi'; and a bronze lamp suspended from a snake's mouth. An obituary notice said \\"No architect was better known, and none was better respected, for he was amiable, considerable, and gentle to all\\". Career=Central London Parks During the second half of the 1820s, the Commissioners of Woods and Forests and the King resolved that Hyde Park, and the area around it, must be renovated to the extent of the splendor of rival European capital cities, and that the essence of the new arrangement would be a triumphal approach to Buckingham Palace, which had been recently completed. The committee of the project, led by the Prime Minister, Lord Liverpool, and advised by Charles Arbuthnot, President of the Board of Commissioners of Woods and Forests, selected Decimus Burton as the project's architect: in 1828, when giving evidence to a Parliamentary select committee on the Government's spending on public works, Arbuthnot explained that he had nominated Burton 'having seen in the Regent's Park, and elsewhere, works which pleased my eye, from their architectural beauty and correctness'. Burton intended to create an urban space dedicated to the celebration of the House of Hanover, national pride, and the nation's heroes. The renovation of Hyde Park, Green Park, and St James's Park, began, in 1825, with the demarcation of new drives and pathways, subsequent to which Burton designed new lodges and gates, viz. Cumberland Gate, Stanhope Gate, Grosvenor Gate, the Hyde Park Gate/Screen at Hyde Park Corner, and, later, the Prince of Wales's Gate, Knightsbridge, in the classical style. There were no authoritative precedents for such buildings, which required windows and chimney stacks, in the classical style, and, in the words of Guy Williams, 'Burton's reticent treatment of the supernumerary features' and of the cast iron gates and railings, was 'greatly admired'. At Hyde Park Corner, the King required that 'some great ceremonial outwork that would be worthy of the new palace that lay to its rear', and accepted Burton's consequent proposal for a sequence comprising a gateway and a classical screen, and a triumphal arch, which would enable those approaching Buckingham Palace from the north to ride or drive first through the screen and then through the arch, before turning left to descend Constitution Hill and enter the forecourt of Buckingham Palace through Nash's Marble Arch. The screen became the Roman revival Hyde Park Gate/Screen at Hyde Park Corner, which delighted the King and his Committee, and which architectural historian Guy Williams describes as 'one of the most pleasing architectural works that have survived from the neo-classical age'. The triumphal arch became the Wellington Arch at Constitution Hill into Green Park, London, which has been described as 'one of London's best loved landmarks'. Burton designed the arch's iron gates, which were constructed by Bramah and Co. of Pimlico. Burton's original design for the triumphal arch, which was modelled on the Arch of Titus at Rome, on which the central and side blocks of the Screen had been modelled, was more technically perfect, and coherent with the Screen, than that of the arch that was subsequently built: this original design, however, was rejected by the Committee ‚Äì who had envisaged a design based on the Arch of Constantine (on which Nash's Marble Arch had been modelled) ‚Äì because it was not sufficiently ostentatious. Burton created a new design, 'to pander to the majestic ego', which was much larger and modelled on a fragment found in the Ancient Roman forum, which was accepted on 14 January 1826, and subsequently built as the present Wellington Arch. =Sculpture of the Triumphal Arch= The arch at Constitution Hill was left devoid of decorative sculpture as a result of the moratorium in 1828 on public building work, and, instead, despite the absolute objection of Burton, was mounted with an ungainly equestrian statue of the Duke of Wellington by Matthew Cotes Wyatt, the son of the then recently deceased James Wyatt, who had been selected by statue's commissioner, and one of its few subsequent advocates, Sir Frederick Trench. Matthew Cotes Wyatt was not competent: Guy Williams contends that he was 'not noticeably talented', and the Dictionary of National Biography that 'thanks to royal and other influential patronage, Wyatt enjoyed a reputation and practice to which his mediocre abilities hardly entitled him'. Trench, and his patrons the Duke and Duchess of Rutland, had told the public subscribers to the statue that the statue would be place on top of Burton's triumphal arch at Hyde Park Corner: Burton expressed his opposition to this proposal 'as plainly and as vehemently as his nature allowed' consistently over successive years, because the ungainly statue would 'disfigure' his arch, for which it was much too large, and the surrounding neighbourhood, because it would have to be placed, contrary to all classical precedent, across, instead of parallel with, the roadway under the arch. Burton had envisaged that his arch would be topped with only a small quadriga whose horses would have been parallel with the road under the arch. Burton's objections were extensively endorsed by most of the aristocratic residents of London. A writer in The Builder asked Lord Canning, the First Commissioner for Woods and Forests, to ban the project: \\"We have learnt, and can state positively, that Mr. Burton has the strongest objection possible against placing the group in question on the archway... and that he is taking no part whatever in the alteration proposed to be made in the upper part of the structure to prepare it to receive the pedestal... Mr. Burton, through the mildness which characterizes him, has not expressed this opinion so loudly and so publicly as he ought to have done.... an opinion prevails very generally, that he is a party to the proceedings, and this has induced many to be silent who would otherwise have spoken...\\". The Prime Minister, Sir Robert Peel, contended that another site would be preferable, and proposed, on behalf of the Crown, to offer any other site, but the statue's subscribers rejected all alternative proposals. Every single MP except Sir Frederick Trench wanted the statue to be placed elsewhere. Canning wrote that 'the remonstrances which reach Her Majesty's Government against the proposed appropriation of the arch are so many and so strong, the representations of its architect, Mr. Burton, in the same sense, are so earnest, and the opinion of every other eminent architect, artist, or other competent authority who has been consulted on the subject is so decided [against the placing of the Wellington statue on the arch]\\". Decimus Burton himself wrote, \\"The arch would, I consider, suffer greatly in importance if the colossal statue in question be placed there, because it would become a mere pedestal. The want of proportion in the proposed surmount, compared with the columns and other details of the architecture, would show that they had been designed by different hands, and without reference for each other. ...I have desired to witness the completion of this building, as originally designed by me, and as approved by the Lords of the Treasury, yet I would prefer that the building should remain for the present in its forlorn and bare state, rather than a colossal equestrian statue should be placed upon it... I fear that if this appropriation of the building should be decided upon, a proposition would soon be made for removing altogether the facades of columns, the slender proportions of which would appear so incongruous and out of proportion compared with the prodigious dimensions of the statue\\". Burton had realized that the disciples of Pugin and advocates of Pugin's anti-classicism would remove all classical elements from his arch if permitted the opportunity to do so. The Government placed the Wellington statue on the arch in autumn 1846: Williams contends that the product was 'ridiculous'. The Builder contended, down, unquestionably, it must come. As the network of timber is removed, spar by spar, from before it, so do the folly of the experiment, the absurdity of the conjunction, and the greatness of the sacrifice become apparent. Its effect is even worse than we anticipated ‚Äì the destruction of the arch by the statue, and of the statue by its elevation on the arch, more complete. Every post brings us letters urging renewed efforts to remove te figure to another site. The contestation about the prospective removal of the statue became national. However, the Government failed to remove the statue, despite that they had professed, when it had been placed, that they would do so if it provoked the aversion which it had provoked. Foreign intellectuals who visited London identified the incongruous fusion of the statue and the arch as 'spectacular confirmation' of the 'artistic ignorance of the English'. Architectural historian Guy Williams writes that \\"[the] arch at Hyde Park Corner is a visible reminder of one of the fiercest attacks that have ever been launched in the worlds of art and architecture. The face of London might have been very different now ‚Äì freer, perhaps, of the 'monstrous carbuncles' so disliked by the present Prince of Wales ‚Äì if the attacked party [Decimus Burton] had been a little more pugnacious, and so better equipped to stand his ground\\". Marble Arch before its relocation at the entrance to the newly rebuilt Buckingham Palace Aerial view of Marble Arch In 1847 the problem of accommodating Queen Victoria's expanding family was becoming acute. It was \\"solved\\" in two steps by Decimus Burton and W.A. Nesfield. With his eye for landscape, Burton had John Nash's triumphal monument, originally intended as the entrance to the palace, relocated to the north eastern corner of Hyde Park. He consulted on filling in the Buckingham Palace forecourt, creating new interiors and the palace Facade we know today. The Royal Family were able to move in to more spacious premises. Moving the arch, stone by stone, was left to the engineering skills of Thomas Cubitt and took four years. The siting at the Cumberland Gate entrance to the park was eventually completed in 1851. During 1882, traffic congestion at Hyde Park Corner motivated advocacy for Burton's triumphal arch to be moved to the top of Constitution Hill to create space for traffic. In response to this advocacy, Burton's great-nephew Francis Fearon compiled and published a pamphlet that advocated the removal of the Wellington statue from the arch in the event of the removal of the arch to another location: Fearon contended that the arch should be 'relieved once and for all of its unsightly load'. The campaign led by Fearon was successful: Wyatt's incongruous statue was removed to Aldershot, and its place on Burton's arch, which was moved to Constitution Hill in 1883, was occupied by a Quadriga by Captain Adrian Jones. Jones' statue is not nearly as elegant as Burton's designed statue intended for the arch, but it is more coherent with the arch than Wyatt's statue, and its figures, unlike those of Wyatt's statue, are aligned with the roadway under the arch. =London Zoo= By the end of 1829, Burton had completed London Zoo, which had opened in April 1828, to fervent commendation. Guy Williams records, \\"From all sides, Decimus Burton's Zoo buildings received the highest praise. They were playful - witty, even - while being architecturally beyond reproach. They made a visit to the Zoo an aesthetic, as well as an educational, pleasure. They brought a suggestion of foreign lands to the flattish expanses at the foot of Primrose Hill\\". Burton laid out the Zoo in the picturesque style, and designed the early animal houses in the cottage orn√© style. As a consequence of the success of his London Zoo designs, Burton received more commissions than he were able to complete himself, and, consequently, employed assistants, began to train pupils, and bought a plot at Spring Gardens, St. James's Park, at the east end of The Mall, where he constructed No. 10, 11, and 12 Spring Gardens as both his townhouse and his own office. =Architecture as environment= Burton was one of the first architects to consider the implications of architecture on the creation of distinct urban environments. The evidence given by Burton to two Parliamentary select committees demonstrates the breadth of his knowledge, and the esteem in which his opinion was held by his contemporaries. Burton's evidence to the 1840 Select Committee, which discussed plans to develop Trafalgar Square, popularised his views on urban development. This is one of the first examples of public discourse about an urban space that acknowledged the potential for its national and political significance. Athenaeum Club The Athenaeum was founded in 1824 at the instigation of John Wilson Croker, then Secretary to the Admiralty, who was primarily responsible for the organisation and early development of the Club. In 1823, Croker wrote to Sir Humphry Davy, \\"I will take the opportunity of repeating the proposition I have made to you about a Club for Literary and Scientific men and followers of the Fine Arts. The fashionable and Military Clubs... have spoiled all the Coffee Houses and Taverns so that the artist, or mere literary man... are in a much worse position\\". Croker suggested 30 names for the Club's organizing Committee, including the Earl of Aberdeen, the Earl of Ashburnham, Earl Spencer, Lord Palmerston, Sir Thomas Lawrence, Francis Chantrey, and Robert Smirke the Younger: all of those invited, except Richard Payne Knight, accepted. The first meeting of the Athenaeum, with 14 men present, was held at the rooms of the Royal Society on 16 February 1824, where a committee was formed that resolved: first, that temporary premises would be rented at 12 Waterloo Place, which had been constructed by the company of Club member James Burton, the pre-eminent London property developer; and, second, that Decimus Burton, then 24 years old, would be commissioned to design a permanent clubhouse. The Trustees of the Club who employed Burton were the Earl of Aberdeen, former Prime Minister and President of the Society of Antiquaries; Sir Thomas Lawrence, President of the Royal Academy; and Sir Humphry Davy, President of the Royal Society. Decimus continued to work for the Club until 1864, and designed Croker's villa at Stokes Bay, near Gosport, in around 1840. Burton's Athenaeum clubhouse is in the Neoclassical style, with both Ancient Greek, Ancient Roman, and Renaissance Italian elements: it has a Doric portico with paired columns, and has been described by architectural scholar Guy Williams as 'a building of remarkable grace and astonishing novelty' with a central staircase that is 'distinctly Egyptian in flavour'. The Corinthian- columns of the entrance hall, informed by those of the Athenian Tower of the Winds, are Greek: the barrel-vaulted ceiling Roman. John Summerson contends design were informed by that of Peruzzi's 17th century Palazzo Pietro Massimi in Rome. Burton made himself responsible for the design of as many of the decorative features of the Club as possible, including the clock-cases and the pendant light-fittings. When the Clubhouse was completed in April 1830, the members of the Club Committee stated, \\"[They] are bound to express their entire satisfaction at the manner in which the work has been carried out by Mr. Burton. They can testify, and indeed the foregoing Accounts evince, the general accuracy of his estimates and they trust that the Club at large, as well as the public, must be satisfied of his professional skill, and the beauty of his architectural designs\\". Decimus Burton subsequently became the 'prime member of the Athenaeum, one of London's grandest gentlemens' clubs', of which his father James was also a member. The cast of the Apollo Belvedere positioned in the recess at the top of the principal staircase at the Athenaeum was a gift to the Club from Decimus. There is a photographic portrait of Decimus, taken in 1873, preserved at the Club, and the Club retains some furniture designed by Decimus. Another early member was Sir Peter Hesketh-Fleetwood, a close friend of the Burtons. Calverley Estate Burton was commissioned to develop the Calverley Estate by John Ward, an MP for whom he had designed his first neoclassical country residence. Great Mount Pleasant, a mansion owned by the Duke of Leeds, had been used by the Princess Victoria and the Duchess of Kent. The villas constructed by Burton on the Calverley Estate were intended for the gentry, and each would be able to accommodate several servants. Burton's design is predominantly Georgian neoclassical in style, but includes elements of the Italianate-, Old English or Tudor-, neogothic-, and cottage orne styles. Burton designed 24 villas, the first of which was completed in autumn 1828: nearly twenty years would pass until the last villa of the series were complete. Burton also constructed a series of Tudor-style servants' cottages, and three grand entrances to the estate: the Victoria Gate, and the less ornate Keston Lodge and Farnborough Lodge. In 1832, Calverley Park Crescent, designed by Burton, modelled partially on those at Bath and Buxton, was constructed at Calverley. The Crescent contained 17 shops, and covered areas for spectators. Burton's development of the Calverley Estate contained elements of the neoclassical-, the Old English-, and the neogothic styles, and was highly commended: it has been described as 'a landmark in English domestic architecture' and the 'prototype garden suburb'. M. Wilson contends that 'Decimus Burton's laying out of the Calverley Estate is the best surviving embodiment of Early Victorian seriousness and refinement'. Christopher Hussey, of Country Life, commended Burton's 'restrained eclectism' in the Calverley developments. Williams contends that the Calverley Estate be 'one of the great architectural successes of the nineteenth century' and that 'Decimus Burton's reputation could be assured by his work here alone', and describes Burton's villas at the estate as 'domestic masterpiece[s]'. Henry Russell Hitchcock described Burton's Calverley Estate as 'the finest extant example' of its kind. Sir John Soane's friend John Britton described Burton's Calverley as a 'beautiful pleasure garden'. Dr. Philip Whitbourn OBE FSA FRIBA contends that Burton has been inaccurately 'sometimes sterotyped as [one] feeling no enthusiasm for the Gothic Revival' and that 'it is as a master not only of the neoclassical but also of the picturesque that Decimus Burton should be remembered'. William Willicombe's subsequent designs on the Calverley Estate, including Lansdowne Road and Calverley Park Gardens, were informed by Burton, with whom he had worked on Burton's earlier parts of the town. Constructions in the neo- gothic style Burton was commissioned to design Holy Trinity Church at Tunbridge Wells in the neo-gothic style: he unwisely accepted the commission despite that he was 'neither by temperament nor training' qualified to design a work in this style, of which he knew little, and his design was censured, in addition to commended as a 'beautiful structure' and a 'handsome structure' which 'reflects great credit on the architect'. A more unanimously successful attempt to design in the neogothic style was St Mary's Church, Goring-by-Sea, which he redesigned, for the Tory MP David Lyon, between 1836 and 1838. Neoclassical Houses of Parliament and vituperation by Augustus W. N. Pugin Burton created a design for a new neoclassical Houses of Parliament. Decimus Burton and his pupils commended the purchase of the Elgin Marbles for the nation, and the erection of a neoclassical gallery in which they could be displayed to the same, and subsequently contended that the destruction of the Houses of Parliament by the fire of 1834 were an opportunity for the creation of a splendid neoclassical replacement of the Houses of Parliament, in which the Elgin Marbles could be displayed: they expressed their aversion that the new seat of the British Empire would ‚Äòbe doomed to crouch and wither in the groinings [sic], vaultings, tracery, pointed roof, and flying buttresses of a Gothic building‚Ä¶‚Äô: a building of a style that they contended to be improper ‚Äòto the prevailing sentiment of an age so enlightened‚Äô. In contradistinction to the neo-gothic style, they commended those who had ‚Äòbuilt St. Paul's Cathedral, to the satisfaction of an applauding posterity, in the more beautiful and universal style of Roman architecture‚Äô. However, the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Peel, wanted, now that he were premier, to disassociate himself from the controversial John Wilson Croker, who was a founding member of the Athenaeum, close associate of the Burtons, an advocate of neoclassicism, and repudiator of the neo-gothic style: consequently, Peel appointed a committee chaired by Edward Cust, a detestor of the style of Nash and William Wilkins, which resolved that the new Houses of Parliament would have to be in either the ‚Äògothic‚Äô or the ‚ÄòElizabethan‚Äô style. Augustus W. N. Pugin, the foremost expert on the Gothic, had to submit each of his designs through, and thus in the name of, other architects, Gillespie-Graham and Charles Barry, because he had recently openly and fervently converted to Roman Catholicism, as a consequence of which any design submitted in his own name would certainly have been automatically rejected; the design he submitted for improvements to Balliol College, Oxford, in 1843 were rejected for this reason. The design for Parliament that Pugin submitted through Barry won the competition. Subsequent to the announcement of the design ascribed to Barry, William Richard Hamilton, who had been secretary to Elgin during the acquisition and transportation of the Elgin Marbles, published a pamphlet in which he censured the fact that ‚Äògothic barbarism‚Äô had been preferred to the masterful designs of Ancient Greece and Rome: but the judgement was not altered, and was ratified by the Commons and the Lords. The commissioners subsequently appointed Pugin to assist in the construction of the interior of the new Palace, to the design of which Pugin himself had been the foremost determiner. The first stone of the new Pugin-Barry design was laid on 27 April 1840. =Vituperation of Burton by Pugin= During the competition for the design of the new Houses of Parliament, Burton, \\"the land's leading classicist\\", was vituperated with continuous invective, which Guy Williams has described as an \\"anti-Burton campaign\\", by the foremost advocate of the neo- gothic style, Augustus Pugin, who was made enviously reproachful that Burton \\"had done much more that Pugin's father (Augustus Charles Pugin) to alter the appearance of London\\". Pugin attempted to popularize advocacy of the neo- gothic, and repudiation of the neoclassical, by composing and illustrating books that contended the supremacy of the former and the degeneracy of the latter, which were published from 1835. In 1845, Pugin, in his Contrasts: or a Parallel Between the Noble Edifices of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries and Similar Buildings of the Present Day, which the author had to publish himself as a consequence of the extent of the defamation of society architects therein, satirized John Nash as \\"Mr Wash, Plasterer, who jobs out Day Work on Moderate Terms\\", and Burton as \\"Talent of No Consequence, Premium Required\\", and included satirical sketches of Nash's Buckingham Palace and Burton's triumphal arch at Hyde Park. Consequently, the amount of commissions received by Burton declined, although he retained a close friendship with the aristocrats amongst his patrons, who continued to commission him. Burton completed a new portico, hall, and staircase for the William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire's residence near Piccadilly; additions to 10 Belgrave Square for the 2nd Earl of Burlington (later the 7th Duke of Devonshire); the enlargement of Grimston Park, Yorkshire, for John Hobart Caradoc, 2nd Baron Howden and the Russian Princess Bagration; additions to Syon House for Lord Prudhoe (later the 4th Duke of Northumberland); and a new town, Fleetwood, in Lancashire, for Sir Peter Hesketh-Fleetwood. Glasshouses Decimus was primarily responsible for the 'Great Stove' [conservatory] at Chatsworth for the 6th Duke of Devonshire, for which Joseph Paxton has been erroneously attributed primary responsibility and credit. Architectural historian Guy Williams is unequivocal: Decimus Burton was '[the] designer of the Great Stove at Chatsworth'. Burton, who was advisor to the Royal Botanical Society, also designed the 'Winter Garden' glasshouse of the Royal Botanic Society in Regent's Park, and the Palm House, originally named 'the Stove', and Temperate House at Kew Gardens. The constructed Palm House is the consequence of the collaboration of Burton and Richard Turner: 'Decimus Burton contributed his considerable flair for creating refined and elegant structures and Richard Turner a singular talent for metal fabrication'. Burton's Palm House has been described as 'one of the boldest pieces of 19th century functionalism in existence - much bolder indeed, and hence aesthetically much more satisfying than Crystal Palace ever was'. Dr. Philip Whitbourn OBE FSA FRIBA contends that Burton's Palm House 'could have a just claim as the world's most important surviving Victorian glass and iron structure'. Joseph Paxton's Crystal Palace was derived almost entirely from the glasshouse work of Decimus Burton and Richard Turner. Subsequent to his retirement there, Decimus designed and constructed several buildings at St Leonards-on-Sea. Burton's Temperate House at Kew, which is double the size of his Palm House and the world's largest surviving Victorian glass structure, was only completed after his death, in 1898, and has become one of his most popularly acclaimed works: Williams writes of the Temperate House, \\"It makes one wonder how much the appearance of London might not have been improved if Augustus W. N. Pugin had never started his anti-Burton campaign\\". Burton's other works at Kew include the Museum No.1, the Campanile, and the Main Entrance Gates to Kew Green. Burton's Glasshouses at Kew constituted the UK's case for Kew to be made an UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2002. Further studies and elections From 1830 to 1834, Burton studied at Clifford's Inn. The architectural historian, Sir Nikolaus Pevsner, believes that Decimus was the designer of the Gatehouse and the Inn buildings. In 1832 Decimus Burton was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts; a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London; a founding Fellow, and later Vice- President, of the Royal Institute of British Architects; and was architect to the Royal Botanic Society from 1840. An 1828 testimonial for his election to Fellowship of the Society of Antiquaries described him as 'Architect and Gentleman, well versed in the History and Antiquaries of this Kingdom': he was elected FSA on 8 January 1829, during the tenure of W. R. Hamilton, Chief Commissioner of Woods and Forests, as Vice-President. Decimus was an early member of the Athenaeum Club, London, whose mansion he designed and his father, James Burton, built. James was also an early member of the Club. The cast of the Apollo Belvedere positioned in the recess at the top of the principal staircase at the Athenaeum was a gift to the Club from Burton. There is a photographic portrait of Decimus Burton, taken in 1873, preserved at the Club, which retains some furniture designed by him. Burton had over 30 years of correspondence with John Wilson Croker, a co-founder of the Club, and was a close friend of Sir Peter Hesketh-Fleetwood, who was another early member. Prot√©g√©s Burton trained his nephew, Henry Marley Burton FRIBA (1821‚Äì1880) the son of his eldest brother, William Ford Burton. Henry Marley Burton succeeded to Decimus's architectural practice subsequent to Decimus's retirement. In 1866, Henry Marley was commissioned by John George Dodson, 1st Baron Monk Bretton to design a mansion at Coneyborough. Decimus had previously designed Bineham in Chailey for Dodson's brother-in-law, John George Blencowe. Burton also taught the architects Henry Currey FRIBA, George Mair, John Crake, Arthur William Hakewill, and Edward John May FRIBA, who was his last pupil. Legacy Despite the fact that he had left his library to the Royal Institute of British Architects, of which he had served as President, most of it was deposited instead with his two unmarried nieces, Helen and Emily Jane Wood, who subsequently sold it, and the remainder was distributed among other family members. As a consequence, according to Dana Arnold, there is a gross imbalance between the ‚Äòscale and significance‚Äô of Decimus Burton's work and the amount of documentary evidence about it that has come into the public domain. Given the fragmentary nature of written sources concerning his work, he has tended to be relegated, quite undeservedly, 'to the margins of architectural histories‚Äô. However, Burton's works in London, especially those around Hyde Park, Green Park, Regent's Park, remains a lasting and resplendent memorial. His reputation has increased since the commencement of the 20th century, during which a Burtons' St Leonards Society has been founded in St Leonards-on-Sea to 'encourage the preservation of the work of James and Decimus Burton and to prevent development unsympathetic to its character', which has successfully thwarted several attempts to create new developments that would have violated the beauty of the Burtons' project. Architectural historian Guy Williams writes that \\"[the] arch at Hyde Park Corner is a visible reminder of one of the fiercest attacks [on Decimus Burton and neoclassicism, by Augustus Pugin] that have ever been launched in the worlds of art and architecture. The face of London might have been very different now ‚Äì freer, perhaps, of the 'monstrous carbuncles' so disliked by the present Prince of Wales ‚Äì if the attacked party [Decimus Burton] had been a little more pugnacious, and so better equipped to stand his ground\\". The recently completed restoration (2018) of the Temperate House at London's Kew Gardens has prompted a re-evaluation of Burton's horticultural designs. Douglas Murphy contends that Burton's use of \\"Iron and glass, through shedding ornament and aiming for efficient performance over capricious pomp, was retroactively understood as the historic forerunner of Modernism, meaning that what had been thought of as mere engineering was allowed to enter the pantheon of true architecture. Burton's name was now fortunately attached to some of the most significant works of that type\\". Burton's legacy on either side of the Irish Sea endures. In April 2017 the Hearsum Collection, in collaboration with The Royal Parks and Ireland's Office of Public Works, mounted an exhibition at Dublin's Phoenix Park entitled Parks, Our Shared Heritage: The Phoenix Park, Dublin & The Royal Parks, London, demonstrating the historical links between Richmond Park (and other Royal Parks in London) and Phoenix Park. This exhibition was also displayed at the Mall Galleries in London in July and August 2017. List of architectural projects The projects are listed by county in alphabetical order.

From 1818, Burton resided, with his father, at The Holme, Regent's Park, which has been described as 'one of the most desirable private homes in London', which was designed as the Burton family mansion by Decimus, and built by James Burton's own company. The Holme was the second villa to be built in Regent's Park, and the first of those to be designed or constructed by the Burton family. The hallmark of the Burton design is the large semi-circular bay that divided the principal elevation, and which extended for two storeys. The original villa also had a conservatory of polygonal form, which used wrought iron glazing bars, then only recently patented, instead of the then customary wooden bars. The first villa to be constructed in the park was St. John's Lodge by John Raffield. * Clarence Terrace, Regent's Park (1823) * The original Winfield House (1825) for the 3rd Marquess of Hertford, which became known as 'St. Dunstan's Villa'. Burton's creation was described as, 'decorated simplicity, such as the hand of taste, aided by the purse of wealth can alone execute'. Burton's creation was subsequently reconstructed as a building with a modern exterior. In 1819, Burton had also designed for the same commissioner a South Villa, the designs of which were exhibited at Royal Academy in 1822 and in 1825, the manuscript drawings of which are now in the Library of the Architectural Association, London. * Cornwall Terrace, Regent's Park, London (1821) * Chester Terrace, Regent's Park * York Terrace, Regent's Park *Hyde Park Screen (1824) *Hyde Park, London: Stanhope, Grosvenor, and Cumberland Gates and their lodges.

Burton landscaped the grounds and designed the buildings for the entrepreneur, John Davidson Smith. It became a popular society venue attracting large crowds to its f√™tes. Burton's buildings were in a \\" rustic\\" style, with the ticket office in the form of a thatched cottage. The Spa closed in 1856 soon after the opening of the nearby Crystal Palace. Burton also drew up designs for a grand crescent of terraced houses on hill above the spa, which was, however, never built. * Holwood House, Keston (1823‚Äì1826) This has been described as 'splendidly Grecian... the best thing of its kind in Kent'. *House at Harrow School for Rev.

The insanity makes Suibhne leave the Battle of Mag Rath, enter a life of wandering (which earns him the nickname Suibne Geilt or \\"Suibhne the Madman\\"), until he dies under the refuge of St. Moling. The tale is sometimes seen as the installment of a three-text cycle, continuing on from Fled D√∫in na nG√©d (The Feast of D√∫n na nG√©d) and Cath Maige R√°tha (The Battle of Mag Rath). Suibhne's name appears as early as the ninth century in a law tract (Book of Aicill), but Buile Shuibhne did not take its current form until the twelfth century. includes a detailed analysis of the language and date of the text. He contends that the text in its final form is not as old as generally presumed but should be dated to the early thirteenth century. Suibhne's identity The identity of Suibhne is a very convoluted matter as several texts mention different Suibhnes in regards with the Battle of Mag Rath. Buile Shuibhne specifies Suibhne as the son of Colman Cuar and as the pagan king of D√°l nAraidi in Ulster in Ireland (in particular in the areas of present-day county Down and county Antrim). This particular Suibhne son of Colman's name can also be found in the Annals of Tigernach and the Book of Lismore. The Annals of Tigernach state Suibhne, son of Colm√°n, died in the Battle of Mag Rath, making Buile seem a fanciful imagining of a dead warrior. Historical records of D√°l nAraidi do exist. It was a historical kingdom inhabited by the Cruthin.MacNeill, Eoin. Phases of Irish History. Port Washington, N.Y.: Kennikat Press, 1919. However the king lists of D√°l nAraidi in the Book of Leinster fail to mention any Suibhne son of Colm√°n Cuar as king, and identifies Congal Claen as king of D√°l nAraidi during this time. James G. O‚ÄôKeeffe has hypothesized a possible scenario where Suibhne might have been elected by the Cruithin to act as regent in the midst of King Congal's exile. Text There are three manuscripts, B (Royal Irish Academy, B iv i), 1671‚Äì4; K (Royal Irish Academy, 23 K 44), 1721‚Äì2; and L (Brussels, 3410), 1629, a condensed version in the hand of Mich√©al √ì Cl√©irigh. The text can be dated to broadly from 1200‚Äì1500 on linguistic grounds, but John O'Donovan asserted the writer must have lived before 1197 when the last chieftain of Tir Connail died who was descended from Domnall mac √Åedo, since the work is intended to flatter this monarchic dynasty.  Plot =The saint's curse In the legend, while Saint R√≥n√°n Finn was marking boundaries for a new church, the sound of his bell reached Suibhne's ear. Suibhne, upon learning that this was church-making activity on his grounds, rushed out to expel St. Ronan from his territory. His wife Eorann tried to detain him by grabbing his cloak, which unraveled, leaving Suibhne to exit the house stark naked. Suibhne grabbed Ronan's Psalter and threw it into the lake, and seized the Saint by the hand and started to drag him away. But Suibhne was interrupted by a messenger from Congal Claen requesting aid in the Battle of Mag Rath (near modern Moira, 637 A.D.). The next day, the Psalter was returned unharmed by an otter that fetched it from the lake. The saint laid a curse upon Suibhne, condemning him to wander and fly around the world naked, and to meet his death by spear-point. In the ongoing war, St. Ronan had mediated a truce to last from each evening until morning, but Suibhne habitually broke this by killing during the hours when combat was not permitted. One day, Bishop Ronan and his psalmists were on their round blessing the troops. Suibhne too received the sprinkling of holy water, but taking this as a taunt, he killed one of the bishop's psalmists with a spear, and cast another at Ronan himself. The weapon pierced a hole in Ronan's bell (hanging on his breast), and the broken-off shaft hurled in the air. At this, Ronan repeated the same curse: that Suibhne will wander like a bird, much as the spear-shaft, perch on tree branches at the sound of the bell, and die by the spear just as he had killed the monk. When battle resumed, the tremendous noise of the armies clashing drove Suibhne insane. His hands were numbed, his weapons fell, and he began to tread ever so lightly as a bird levitating in the air. (It is revealed much later on that like a bird, feathers had grown on him.) The madness and wandering The deranged Suibhne then left the battlefield behind, reaching a forest called Ros Bearaigh, in Glenn Earcain and perched on a yew tree. He was discovered by his kinsman Aongus the Fat, who was making his retreat from battle. Suibhne fled to Cell Riagain in Tir Conaill, alighting on another tree. There he was surrounded by the forces of Domnall mac √Åedo, which was the side Suibhne and his D√°l nAraidi kinsmen were warring against. The victorious Domnall nevertheless praised and pitied Suibhne and offered him gifts, but the madman would not comply. Suibhne went to his home territory of Glenn Bolc√°in, wandered seven years throughout Ireland, and returned to Glenn Bolcain, which was where his fortress and dwelling stood, and a celebrated valley of madmen. Suibhne's movement was now being tracked by his kinsman Loingsechan, who had successfully taken the madman into custody thrice before. Loingsechan in his millhouse had a chance to capture Suibhne, but the attempt failed, and he must await another chance. Suibhne then paid visit to his wife, who was living with another man, a contender for Suibhne's kingship. Eorann maintained she would rather be with Suibhne, but he told her to remain with her new husband. An army stormed in, but Suibhne eluded capture. Suibhne then returned to the yew tree at Ros Bearaigh, the same tree he went to when he first developed his madness, but when Eorann came to deceive and capture him, he moved away to another tree in Ros Ercain. But his whereabouts was discovered, and Loingsechan coaxed him out of the tree, tricking him with the false news that his entire family had perished. Loingsechan brought Suibhne back to normal life and restored his sanity, but while recuperating, the mill hag taunted him into a contest of leaping. As they leapt, the noise of a hunting party returned Suibhne to madness. The mill hag eventually fell from her leap and was dashed to pieces. And since she was Loingsechan's mother-in-law, it meant Suibhne's could not return to D√°l nAraidi without facing vengeance. Suibhne subsequently wandered various parts of Ireland, into Scotland and Western England. He went from Roscommon to Slieve Aughty, Slieve Mis, Slieve Bloom mountain ranges; Inismurray island; the Cave of St. Donnan of Eigg, an island in the Scottish Inner Hebrides; then tarried for a month and a half in \\"Carrick Alastair\\" (Ailsa Craig off Scotland. He reached Britain and befriended a Fer Caille (Man of the Wood), who was another madman, spending an entire year together. The Briton giant met his predestined death by drowning in a waterfall. Death according to prophecy \\"Fly through the air like the shaft of his spear and that he might die of a spear cast like the cleric whom he had slain.\\" Suibhne then returned to Ireland, to his home dominion of Glen Bocain. He visited his wife Eorann again but refused to go in the house for fear of confinement. Eorann then told him to leave, never to return, because the sight of him was an embarrassment to all. But after a while, Suibhne regained his lucidity and made his resolve to go back to D√°l nAraidi, whatever judgment may befall him. St. Ronan learned of this and prayed to God to hinder Suibhne. Suibhne is haunted by headless cadavers and detached heads at Sliabh Fuaid. Eventually, Suibhne arrived at \\"The House of St. Moling\\", i.e. Teach Moling (St Mullin's in Co. Carlow), and Moling harbored him after hearing the madman's story. It might be noted that earlier, Suibhne had sung a stave predicting this place to be the place where he would meet his demise, and likewise, the Saint also knew this to be the madman's resting place. As Suibhne attended Moling's vespers, the priest instructed a parish woman employed as his cook to provide the madman with a meal (collation), in the form of daily milk. She did so by emptying milk into a hole she made with her foot in the cow dung. However, her husband (Moling's herder) believed malicious hearsay about the two having a tryst, and in a fit of jealousy, thrust a spear into Suibhne while he was drinking from the hole. Thus Suibhne died in the manner prescribed by Ronan, but received his sacrament from Moling, \\"as eric\\". Literary style The poetry in the story of Suibhne is rich and accomplished, and the story itself of the mad and exiled king who composes verse as he travels has held the imagination of poets through to the twentieth century. At every stop in his flight, Suibhne pauses to give a poem on the location and his plight, and his descriptions of the countryside and nature, as well as his pathos, are central to the development of the text. √ì B√©arra (2014) includes a detailed analysis of some of the poetry.https://vanhamel.nl/codecs/%C3%93_B%C3%A9arra_2014a Translations and adaptions Many poets have invoked Sweeney ‚Äì most notably T. S. Eliot and Seamus Heaney. Heaney published a translation of the work into English, which he entitled Sweeney Astray. Eliot made Sweeney the central figure in his verse drama Sweeney Agonistes. The author Flann O'Brien incorporated much of the story of Buile Shuibhne into his comic novel At Swim-Two-Birds, whose title is the English translation of the place name \\"Snamh da en\\" in the tale. Another version from the Irish text, titled The Poems of Sweeny, Peregrine, was published by the Irish poet Trevor Joyce. A modern Irish version of Buile Shuibhne was published in 2010 by Se√°n √ì S√©. This was the first time that the full original text was made available in modern Irish. Sweeney also appears as a character in Neil Gaiman's novel American Gods and is portrayed by Pablo Schreiber in its TV adaptation. In TV adaptation, it is revealed that Sweeney was actually Lugh. A contemporary version of the legend by poet Patricia Monaghan explores Sweeney as an archetype of the warrior suffering from \\"Soldier's Heart\\".Mad Sweeney W. D. Snodgrass introduces his poem Heart's NeedleHeart's Needle with a reference to The Madness of Suibhne. Irish poet and playwright Paula Meehan loosely based her 1997 drama Mrs. Sweeney on the Sweeney legend. Set in an inner-city Dublin flat complex called The Maria Goretti Mansions (a metaphor for the notorious Fatima Mansions Flats in Dublin), the play examines what life must have been like for Sweeney's wife; as Meehan states, \\"I wondered what it must have been like to be his woman.\\"Meehan, Paula, Author's Note for 'Mrs Sweeny', in \\"Rough Magic: First Plays\\" (Dublin: New Island Books, 1998), p. 463. The play charts the trials and tribulations of Lil Sweeney's life in the Maria Goretti flats as she deals with crime, poverty, unemployment, drug abuse, and tries to come to terms with the premature death of her daughter Chrisse, a heroin addict who died a year before the action starts from an AIDS related illness. Lil's husband, Sweeney, is a pigeon fancier who, upon discovering that all his pigeons have been killed, retreats into a bird-like state. Irish composer Frank Corcoran wrote a series of works between 1996 and 2003 around the tale. This includes the choral work Buile Suibhne / Mad Sweeney (1996, after Heaney), the electro- acoustic composition Sweeney's Vision (1997), and the chamber work Sweeney's Smithereens (2000). Noah Mosley composed the opera Mad King Suibhne in 2017 produced by Bury Court Opera with a libretto by Ivo Mosley and it was also performed at Messum's barn, Wiltshire.

It is an antihypertensive vasodilator. It is available as a generic medication by prescription in oral tablet form and over the counter as a topical liquid or foam. Medical uses Minoxidil, applied topically, is widely used for the treatment of hair loss. It is effective in helping promote hair growth in people with androgenic alopecia regardless of sex. Minoxidil must be used indefinitely for continued support of existing hair follicles and the maintenance of any experienced hair regrowth. Its effect in people with alopecia areata is unclear. Side effects Minoxidil is generally well tolerated, but common side effects include burning or irritation of the eye, itching, redness or irritation at the treated area, and unwanted hair growth elsewhere on the body. Exacerbation of hair loss/alopecia has been reported. Severe allergic reactions may include rash, hives, itching, difficulty breathing, tightness in the chest, swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue, chest pain, dizziness, fainting, tachycardia, headache, sudden and unexplained weight gain, or swelling of the hands and feet. Temporary hair loss is a common side effect of minoxidil treatment. Manufacturers note that minoxidil-induced hair loss is a common side effect and describe the process as \\"shedding\\". Alcohol and propylene glycol present in some topical preparations may dry the scalp, resulting in dandruff and contact dermatitis. Side effects of oral minoxidil may include swelling of the face and extremities, rapid and irregular heartbeat, lightheadedness, cardiac lesions, and focal necrosis of the papillary muscle and subendocardial areas of the left ventricle. Cases of allergic reactions to minoxidil or the non- active ingredient propylene glycol, which is found in some topical minoxidil formulations, have been reported. Pseudoacromegaly is an extremely rare side effect reported with large doses of oral minoxidil. Minoxidil may cause hirsutism, although it is exceedingly rare and reversible by discontinuation of the drug. Minoxidil is suspected to be highly toxic to cats, as there are reported cases of cats dying shortly after coming in contact with minimal amounts of the substance. Mechanism of action The mechanism by which minoxidil promotes hair growth is not fully understood. Minoxidil is a potassium channel opener, causing hyperpolarization of cell membranes. Theoretically, by widening blood vessels and opening potassium channels, it allows more oxygen, blood, and nutrients to the follicles. This may cause follicles in the telogen phase to shed, which are then replaced by thicker hairs in a new anagen phase. Minoxidil is a prodrug that is converted by sulfation via the sulfotransferase enzyme SULT1A1 to its active form, minoxidil sulfate. Minoxidil is less effective when the area of hair loss is large. In addition, its effectiveness has largely been demonstrated in younger men who have experienced hair loss for less than 5 years. Minoxidil use is indicated for central (vertex) hair loss only. Two clinical studies are being conducted in the US for a medical device that may allow patients to determine if they are likely to benefit from minoxidil therapy. History= Initial application  Minoxidil was developed in the late 1950s by the Upjohn Company (later became part of Pfizer) to treat ulcers. In trials using dogs, the compound did not cure ulcers, but proved to be a powerful vasodilator. Upjohn synthesized over 200 variations of the compound, including the one it developed in 1963 and named minoxidil. These studies resulted in FDA approving minoxidil (with the trade name 'Loniten') in the form of oral tablets to treat high blood pressure in 1979. (Google Books)  Hair growth  When Upjohn received permission from the FDA to test the new drug as medicine for hypertension they approached Charles A. Chidsey MD, Associate Professor of Medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. He conducted two studies, the second study showing unexpected hair growth. Puzzled by this side-effect, Chidsey consulted Guinter Kahn (who while a dermatology resident at the University of Miami had been the first to observe and report hair development on patients using the minoxidil patch) and discussed the possibility of using minoxidil for treating hair loss. Kahn along with his colleague Paul J. Grant MD had obtained a certain amount of the drug and conducted their own research, since they were first to make the side effect observation. Neither Upjohn or Chidsey at the time were aware of the side effect of hair growth. The two doctors had been experimenting with a 1% solution of minoxidil mixed with several alcohol-based liquids. Both parties filed patents to use the drug for hair loss prevention, which resulted in a decade-long trial between Kahn and Upjohn, which ended with Kahn's name included in a consolidated patent (U.S. #4,596,812 Charles A Chidsey, III and Guinter Kahn) in 1986 and royalties from the company to both Kahn and Grant. Meanwhile the effect of minoxidil on hair loss prevention was so clear that in the 1980s physicians were prescribing Loniten off-label to their balding patients. In August 1988, the FDA finally approved the drug for treating baldness in men under the trade name \\"Rogaine\\" (FDA rejected Upjohn's first choice, Regain, as misleading (Google Books)). The agency concluded that although \\"the product will not work for everyone\\", 39% of the men studied had \\"moderate to dense hair growth on the crown of the head\\". In 1991, Upjohn made the product available for women. On February 12, 1996, the FDA approved both the over-the-counter sale of the drug and the production of generic formulations of minoxidil. Upjohn replied to that by lowering prices to half the price of the prescription drug and by releasing a prescription 5% formula of Rogaine in 1997. In 1998, a 5% formulation of minoxidil was approved for nonprescription sale by the FDA. (Google Books) , it was the only topical product that is FDA-approved for androgenic hair loss. The drug is available over the counter in many countries, including United Kingdom (topical only), United States (topical only), Spain (topical only), Sweden, and Germany (available from registered pharmacies only).

They are sometimes known as meadow mice or field mice in North America and Australia. Vole species form the subfamily Arvicolinae with the lemmings and the muskrats. There are approximately 155 different vole species. Description Voles are small rodents that grow to , depending on the species. Females can have five to ten litters per year. Gestation lasts for three weeks and the young voles reach sexual maturity in a month. As a result of this biological exponential growth, vole populations can grow very large within a short time. A mating pair can birth a hundred more voles in a year. Voles outwardly resemble several other small animals. Moles, gophers, mice, rats and even shrews have similar characteristics and behavioral tendencies. Voles thrive on small plants yet, like shrews, they will eat dead animals and, like mice or rats, they can live on almost any nut or fruit. In addition, voles target plants more than most other small animals, making their presence evident. Voles readily girdle small trees and ground cover much like a porcupine. This girdling can easily kill young plants and is not healthy for trees or other shrubs. Voles often eat succulent root systems and burrow under plants or ground cover and eat away until the plant is dead. Bulbs in the ground are another favorite target for voles; their excellent burrowing and tunnelling skills give them access to sensitive areas without clear or early warning. The presence of large numbers of voles is often only identifiable after they have destroyed a number of plants. However, like other burrowing rodents, they also play beneficial roles, including dispersing nutrients throughout the upper soil layers.Dickman, Chris R. \\"Rodent‚ÄìEcosystem Relationships: a Review\\" in Singleton G, Hinds L, Leirs H, Zhang Z. ed. 1999. \\"Ecologically-based management of rodent pests\\". ACIAR Monograph No. 59, 494p Retrieved on 2018-03-28 Predators Many predators eat voles, including martens, owls, hawks, falcons, coyotes, bobcats, foxes, raccoons, snakes, weasels, domestic cats and lynxes. Vole bones are often found in the pellets of the short-eared owl, the northern spotted owl, the saw-whet owl, the barn owl, the great gray owl, and the northern pygmy owl. Lifespan Releasing water voles in the Vale of Glamorgan, Wales The average life of the smaller vole species is three to six months. These voles rarely live longer than 12 months. Larger species, such as the European water vole, live longer and usually die during their second, or rarely their third, winter. As many as 88% of voles are estimated to die within the first month of life. Genetics and sexual behavior The prairie vole is a notable animal model for its monogamous social fidelity, since the male is usually socially faithful to the female, and shares in the raising of pups. The woodland vole is also usually monogamous. Another species from the same genus, the meadow vole, has promiscuously mating males, and scientists have changed adult male meadow voles' behavior to resemble that of prairie voles in experiments in which a single gene was introduced into the brain by a virus. Referenced in The behavior is influenced by the number of repetitions of a particular string of microsatellite DNA. Male prairie voles with the longest DNA strings spend more time with their mates and pups than male prairie voles with shorter strings. Summarized in However, other scientists have disputed the gene's relationship to monogamy, and cast doubt on whether the human version plays an analogous role. Physiologically, pair- bonding behavior has been shown to be connected to vasopressin, dopamine, and oxytocin levels, with the genetic influence apparently arising via the number of receptors for these substances in the brain; the pair-bonding behavior has also been shown in experiments to be strongly modifiable by administering some of these substances directly. Voles have a number of unusual chromosomal traits. Species have been found with 17 to 64 chromosomes. In some species, males and females have different chromosome numbers, a trait unusual in mammals, though it is seen in other organisms. Additionally, genetic material typically found on the Y chromosome has been found in both males and females in at least one species. In another species, the X chromosome contains 20% of the genome. All of these variations result in very little physical aberration; most vole species are virtually indistinguishable. Mating system Voles may be either monogamous or polygamous, which leads to differing patterns of mate choice and parental care. Environmental conditions play a large part in dictating which system is active in a given population. Voles live in colonies due to the young remaining in the family group for relatively long periods.Potapov. M. Zadubrovskaya, I. Zabudrovskii, P. Potapova, O. Eviskov, V. 2011. Mating Systems in the Steppe Lemming (Lagurus lagurus) and Narrow- Skulled Vole (Microtus gregalis) From the Northern Kulunda Steppe. Russian Journal of Ecology. 43(1): 40-44. In the genus Microtus, monogamy is preferred when resources are spatially homogenous and population densities are low and where the opposite of both conditions are realized polygamous tendencies arise.Streatfeild, C. Mabry, K. Keane, B. Crist, T. Solomon, N. 2011. Intraspecific Variabilityin the Social and Gentetic Mating System of Prairie Voles, Microtus ochrogaster. Animal Behaviour. 82(6): 1387-1398. Vole mating systems are also sensitive to the operational sex ratio and tend toward monogamy when males and females are present in equal numbers. Where one sex is more numerous than the other, polygamy is more likely.Zhang, J. Zhang, Z. 2003. Influence of Operational Sex Ratio and Density on the Copulatory Behaviour and Mating System of Brandt‚Äôs Vole Microtus brandt. Acta Theriologica. 48(3): 335-346. However the most marked effect on mating system is population density and these effects can take place both inter and intra- specifically Male voles are territorial and tend to include territories of several female voles when possible. Under these conditions polyandry exists and males offer little parental care.Ostfeld, R. 1986. Territoriality and Mating System of California Voles. Journal of Animal Ecology. 55: 691-706. Males mark and aggressively defend their territories since females prefer males with the most recent marking in a given area.Parker, K. Phillips, K. Lee, T. 2001. Development of Selective Partner Preferences in Captive Male and Female Meadow Voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus. Animal Behavior. 61: 1217-1226. Voles prefer familiar mates through olfactory sensory exploitation. Monogamous voles prefer males who have yet to mate, while non-monogamous voles do not.Salo, A. Dewsbury, D. 1995. Three Experiments on Mate Choice in Meadow Voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus). Journal of Comparative Psychology. 109(1): 42-46. Mate preference in voles develops through cohabitation in as little as 24 hours. This drives young male voles to show non-limiting preference toward female siblings. This is not inclusive to females' preference for males which may help to explain the absence of interbreeding indicators. Although females show little territoriality, under pair bonding conditions they tend to show aggression toward other female voles. This behavior is flexible as some Microtus females share dens during the winter months, perhaps to conserve heat and energy.Lambin, X. Krebs, C. Scott, B. 1992. Spacing Systems of the Tundra Vole (Microtus oeconomus) During the Breeding Season in Canada‚Äôs Western Arctic. Canadian Journal of Zoology. 70: 2068-2072. Populations which are monogamous show relatively minor size differences between genders compared with those using polygamous systems.Lee, C. Chui, C. Lin, L. Lin, Y. 2014. Partner Preference and Mating System of the Taiwan Field Vole (Microtus kikuchii). Taiwania, 59(2): 127-138. The grey-sided vole (Myodes rufocanus) exhibits male-biased dispersal as a means of avoiding incestuous matings. Among those matings that involve inbreeding, the number of weaned juveniles in litters is significantly fewer than that from noninbred litters, due to inbreeding depression. Brandt‚Äôs vole (Lasiopodomys brandtii) lives in groups that mainly consist of close relatives. However, they show no sign of inbreeding. The mating system of these voles involves a type of polygyny for males and extra-group polyandry for females. This system increases the frequency of mating among distantly related individuals, and is achieved mainly by dispersal during the mating season. Such a strategy is likely an adaptation to avoid the inbreeding depression that would be caused by expression of deleterious recessive alleles if close relatives mated.  Empathy and consolation  A 2016 study into the behavior of voles, Microtus ochrogaster specifically, found that voles comfort each other when mistreated, spending more time grooming a mistreated vole. Voles that were not mistreated had levels of stress-hormones that were similar to the voles that had been mistreated, suggesting that the voles were capable of empathizing with each other. This was further proven by blocking the vole's receptors for oxytocin, a hormone involved in empathy. When the oxytocin receptors were blocked this behavior stopped. This type of empathetic behavior has previously been thought to only occur in animals with advanced cognition, such as humans, apes, and elephants.

He was best known for his number- one country hit \\"The Devil Went Down to Georgia\\". Much of his output, including all but one of his eight Billboard Hot 100 charting singles, was credited to the Charlie Daniels Band. Daniels was active as a singer and musician from the 1950s until his death. He was inducted into the Cheyenne Frontier Days Hall of Fame in 2002, the Grand Ole Opry in 2008, the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2009, and the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2016.  Early life  Daniels was born October 28, 1936, in Wilmington, North Carolina, and raised on a musical diet that included Pentecostal gospel, local bluegrass bands, and the rhythm & blues and country music from Nashville's 50,000-watt AM radio stations WLAC and WSM. In 2016, he shared memories of his youth and baseball in Wilmington when he wrote the foreword for a book on the Tobacco State League. As a teenager, Daniels moved to the small town of Gulf, Chatham County, North Carolina. He graduated from high school in 1955. Already skilled on guitar, fiddle, banjo, and mandolin, he formed a rock 'n' roll band and hit the road. Career In 1964, Daniels co-wrote \\"It Hurts Me\\" (a song which Elvis Presley recorded) with his friend, producer Bob Johnston, under Bob's wife's name, Joy Byers. He worked as a Nashville session musician, often for Johnston, including playing guitar and electric bass on three Bob Dylan albums during 1969 and 1970, and on recordings by Leonard Cohen. Daniels recorded his first solo album, Charlie Daniels, in 1971 (see 1971 in country music). He also produced the 1969 album by the Youngbloods, Elephant Mountain. His first hit, the novelty song \\"Uneasy Rider\\", was from his 1973 third album, Honey in the Rock, and reached 9 on the Billboard Hot 100. Daniels in concert at the Chumash Casino Resort in Santa Ynez, California During this period, Daniels played fiddle on many of the Marshall Tucker Band's early albums: A New Life, Where We All Belong, Searchin' for a Rainbow, Long Hard Ride, and Carolina Dreams. Daniels can be heard on the live portion of the album Where We All Belong, recorded in Milwaukee on July 31, 1974. The same year, he organized the first in a series of Volunteer Jam concerts based in or around Nashville, Tennessee, often playing with members of Barefoot Jerry. Except for a three-year gap in the late 1980s, the Jams continued until 1996. In 1999, the first of several Volunteer Jam Tours began, and in 2015, a Jam celebrating the 40th anniversary of the first Volunteer Jam was held at Bridgestone Arena, and another followed in 2016, celebrating his 80th birthday. In 1975, he had a top 30 hit as leader of the Charlie Daniels Band with the Southern rock self- identification anthem \\"The South's Gonna Do It Again.\\" \\"Long Haired Country Boy\\" was a minor hit in that year. Daniels plays fiddle on Hank Williams, Jr.'s 1975 album Hank Williams, Jr. and Friends. Daniels won the Grammy Award for Best Country Vocal Performance in 1979 for \\"The Devil Went Down to Georgia\\", which reached No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 in September 1979. The following year, the song became a major crossover success on rock radio stations after its inclusion on the soundtrack for the hit movie Urban Cowboy, in which he makes an onscreen appearance. The song still receives regular airplay on U.S. classic rock and country stations. A hard rock/heavy metal cover version of the song is included in the video game Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock as the final guitar battle against the last boss (Lou, the devil). Daniels openly stated his opposition to the metal cover and the devil winning occasionally in the game. In 1993, Daniels teamed up with fiddler Mark O'Connor to record a sequel to Daniels' 1979 single \\"The Devil Went Down to Georgia\\" titled \\"The Devil Came Back to Georgia\\". Daniels plays the fiddle alongside O'Connor, while Johnny Cash, Marty Stuart, and Travis Tritt sing the lyrics. The song is on O'Connor's album Heroes. Subsequent Daniels' pop hits include \\"In America\\" (number 11 in 1980), \\"The Legend of Wooley Swamp\\" (number 31 in 1980), and \\"Still in Saigon\\" (number 22 in 1982). In 1980, Daniels participated in the country music concept album The Legend of Jesse James. In the late 1980s and 1990s, several of Daniels' albums and singles were hits on the country charts, and the music continues to receive airplay on country stations. Daniels released several gospel and Christian records. In 1999, he made a guest vocal appearance on his song \\"All Night Long\\" with Montgomery Gentry (Eddie Montgomery and Troy Gentry) for their debut album Tattoos and Scars, which was a commercial success. Daniels' distinctive speaking voice is used in the 1999 musical The Civil War. He is featured in the prologue and \\"In Great Deeds\\". Daniels was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame in 1999. Daniels at Louisville Waterfront Park, Kentucky, April 29, 2009 In 2000, he composed and performed the score for the feature film Across the Line. He guest stars as himself on two episodes of King of the Hill: \\"Peggy's Fan Fair\\", which aired on May 21, 2000, and \\"The Bluegrass is Always Greener\\", which aired on February 24, 2002. In 2005, he makes a cameo appearance in Gretchen Wilson's music video for \\"All Jacked Up\\", as well as making a musical guest appearance in the VeggieTales episode \\"Minnesota Cuke and the Search for Samson's Hairbrush\\", by writing, producing, and performing the Minnesota Cuke theme song. In 2006, he played in the backup band for Hank Williams Jr.'s opening sequence to Monday Night Football. On October 18, 2005, Daniels was honored as a BMI Icon at the 53rd annual BMI Country Awards. Daniels' songwriting garnered six BMI Country Awards during his music career; the first award coming in 1976 for \\"The South's Gonna Do It Again\\". In November 2007, Daniels was invited to become a member of the Grand Ole Opry. He was inducted during the January 19, 2008, edition of the Opry. Daniels lived in Mount Juliet, Tennessee, where the city named a park after him. He continued to tour regularly. He appeared in commercials for UPS in 2002 convincing NASCAR driver Dale Jarrett to race the UPS Truck. In 2009, Daniels was featured playing fiddle in a commercial for GEICO. In October 2016, Daniels became a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame. In March 2017, HarperCollins announced that Daniels' memoir, Never Look at the Empty Seats, would be released on October 24, 2017. On October 26, 2018, Daniels released a new album with a side project called Beau Weevils, along with CDB (Charlie Daniels Band) bass player Charlie Hayward, producer James Stroud on drums, and Billy Crain on guitar. The album is titled Songs in the Key of E. On November 6, 2018, Daniels released a book of daily inspirational quotes and stories titled Let's All Make the Day Count: The Everyday Wisdom of Charlie Daniels through HarperCollins' Thomas Nelson imprint. Music Daniels' music encompasses bluegrass, country, rock, Southern rock, outlaw country, country rock, blues rock, rock and roll, blues, and gospel. Politics Daniels performing at U.S. Naval Station Great Lakes, September 11, 2003 Daniels' public politics were varied and idiosyncratic, in his late career tending in a general rightward progression. His earliest hit, \\"Uneasy Rider\\", portrayed him as a country boy in the counterculture movement, caught in an argument with right- wingers at a \\"redneck\\" bar. \\"The South's Gonna Do It Again\\" had a mild message of Southern cultural identity within the Southern rock movement. Daniels was an early supporter of Jimmy Carter's presidential bid and performed at his January 1977 inauguration. \\"In America\\" was a reaction to the 1979‚Äì1981 Iran Hostage Crisis and the troubled American economy of the later 1970s; despite the turmoil the song described a patriotic, united America where \\"we'll all stick together and you can take that to the bank/That's the cowboys and the hippies and the rebels and the yanks.\\" The song experienced a revival following the September 11 attacks, when it appeared on the internet as \\"F*** Bin Laden\\". In 1989, Daniels' country hit \\"Simple Man\\" was interpreted by some as advocating vigilantism. Lyrics such as \\"Just take them rascals [rapists, killers, child abusers] out in the swamp/Put 'em on their knees and tie 'em to a stump/Let the rattlers and the bugs and the alligators do the rest\\" garnered Daniels considerable media attention and talk show visits. In 2003, Daniels published an Open Letter to the Hollywood Bunch in defense of President George W. Bush's Iraq policy. His 2003 book Ain't No Rag: Freedom, Family, and the Flag contains this letter as well as many other personal statements. During the 2004 presidential campaign, Daniels said that having never served in the military himself, he did not have the right to criticize John Kerry's service record but that Kerry should allow the release of his official military record to establish the truth or falsehood of allegations from the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. His band's official website contains a \\"soapbox\\" page where Daniels made statements such as the following: \\"In the future Darwinism will be looked upon as we now look upon the flat earth theory\\" and \\"I am more afraid of you and your ilk than I am of the terrorists\\" regarding U.S. Senator Harry Reid. On March 27, 2009, Daniels criticized the Obama Administration for \\"changing the name of the War on Terror to the \\"Overseas Contingency Operation\\" and referring to terrorism as \\"man-caused disasters.\\" In 2019, Daniels lambasted New York Governor Andrew Cuomo for signing the Reproductive Health Act, which legalized abortion until birth under some circumstances, tweeting \\"Watch the wrinkles on Cuomo's face lengthen as the ramifications of the thousands of murders he has sanctioned come to bear on him. The NY legislature has created a new Auschwitz dedicated to the execution of a whole segment of defenseless citizens. Satan is smiling.\\"Music legend Charlie Daniels blasts NY's Dem governor over new abortion law: 'Satan is smiling' (Fox News) Personal life and death Daniels married Hazel Juanita Alexander on September 20, 1964. They had one child, a son, Charles Edward Daniels Jr. An avid University of Tennessee sports fan, Daniels enjoyed hunting, fishing, snowmobiling, and other outdoor activities. He was a member of the National Rifle Association (NRA) and performed on their videos. Daniels suffered a major arm injury on January 30, 1980, while digging fence post holes on his farm near Mount Juliet. He suffered three complete breaks in his right arm and two broken fingers when his shirtsleeve caught on a spinning auger. The injury required surgery and sidelined him for four months. Daniels was successfully treated for prostate cancer in 2001. On January 15, 2010, Daniels was rushed to the hospital after suffering a stroke while snowmobiling in Colorado. He was released two days later. During a doctor visit on March 25, 2013, Daniels was diagnosed with a mild case of pneumonia and admitted to a Nashville hospital for a series of routine tests. The tests revealed that a pacemaker was needed to regulate his heart rate. One was put in on March 28, and Daniels was released from hospital within days. Daniels died on July 6, 2020, at the age of 83 of a hemorrhagic stroke at Summit Medical Center in Nashville.;  Filmography  * Heartworn Highways (1976) ...

The lines are not ideal, but the teacher (all red writing) gave the best grade (5) anyway. Geography in Montessori Early Childhood at QAIS Early childhood education (ECE; also nursery education) is a branch of education theory that relates to the teaching of children (formally and informally) from birth up to the age of eight. Traditionally, this is up to the equivalent of third grade. ECE emerged as a field of study during the Enlightenment, particularly in European countries with high literacy rates. It continued to grow through the nineteenth century as universal primary education became a norm in the Western world. In recent years, early childhood education has become a prevalent public policy issue, as municipal, state, and federal lawmakers consider funding for preschool and pre-K. The global priority placed on early childhood education is underscored with targets of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 4. It is described as an important period in a child's development. It refers to the development of a child's personality. ECE is also a professional designation earned through a post-secondary education program. For example, in Ontario, Canada, the designations ECE (Early Childhood Educator) and RECE (Registered Early Childhood Educator) may only be used by registered members of the College of Early Childhood Educators, which is made up of accredited child care professionals who are held accountable to the College's standards of practice.  History  The history of early childhood care and education (ECCE) refers to the development of care and education of children from birth through eight years old throughout history. ECCE has a global scope, and caring for and educating young children has always been an integral part of human societies. Arrangements for fulfilling these societal roles have evolved over time and remain varied across cultures, often reflecting family and community structures as well as the social and economic roles of women and men. Historically, such arrangements have largely been informal, involving family, household and community members. After a 20th-century characterized by constant change, including a monumental campaign urging for greater women's rights, women were motivated to pursue a college education and join the workforce. Nevertheless, mothers still face the same challenges as the generations that preceded them on how to care for young children while away at work. The formalization of these arrangements emerged in the nineteenth century with the establishment of kindergartens for educational purposes and day nurseries for care in much of Europe and North America, Brazil, China, India, Jamaica and Mexico.Kamerman, S. B. 2006. A global history of early childhood education and care. Background paper for EFA Global Monitoring Report 2007. Context remember and repeat actions they observe. While the first two years of a child's life are spent in the creation of a child's first \\"sense of self\\", most children are able to differentiate between themselves and others by their second year. This differentiation is crucial to the child's ability to determine how they should function in relation to other people. Parents can be seen as a child's first teacher and therefore an integral part of the early learning process.Footnote Anning, A and Cullen, J. and Fleer, M. (2004) Early childhood education. London: SAGE. Early childhood attachment processes that occur during early childhood years 0‚Äì2 years of age, can be influential to future education. With proper guidance and exploration children begin to become more comfortable with their environment, if they have that steady relationship to guide them. Parents who are consistent with response times, and emotions will properly make this attachment early on. If this attachment is not made, there can be detrimental effects on the child in their future relationships and independence. There are proper techniques that parents and caregivers can use to establish these relationships, which will in turn allow children to be more comfortable exploring their environment.Academic Journal This provides experimental research on the emphasis on caregiving effecting attachment. Education for young students can help them excel academically and socially. With exposure and organized lesson plans children can learn anything they want to. The tools they learn to use during these beginning years will provide lifelong benefits to their success. Developmentally, having structure and freedom, children are able to reach their full potential.  Teaching certification  Teachers seeking to be early childhood educators must obtain certification, among other requirements. \\"An early childhood education certification denotes that a teacher has met a set of standards that shows they understand the best ways to educate young students aged 3 to 8.\\" There are early childhood education programs across the United States that have a certification that is pre-K to grade 3. There are also programs now that have a duel certification in pre-K to grade 3 and special education from pre-K to grade 8. Other certifications are urban tracks in pre-k to grade 3 that have an emphasis on urban schools and preparing teachers to teach in those school environments. These tracks typically take four years to complete and in the end, provide students with their certifications to teach in schools. These tracks give students in the field experience in multiple different types of classrooms as they learn how to become teachers. An example of a school that has these tracks is Indiana University of Pennsylvania. Early childhood educators must have knowledge in the developmental changes during early childhood and the subjects being taught in an early childhood classroom. These subjects include language arts and reading, mathematics, and some social studies and science. Early childhood educators must also be able to manage classroom behavior. Positive reinforcement is one popular method for managing behavior in young children. Teacher certification laws vary by state in the United States. In Connecticut, for example, these requirements include a bachelor's degree, 36 hours of special education courses, passing scores on the Praxis II Examination and Connecticut Foundations of Reading Test and a criminal history background check. For State of Early Childhood Education Bornfreund, 2011; Kauerz, 2010 says that the teacher education and certification requirements do not manifest the research about how to best support development and learning for children in kindergarten through third grade. States are requiring educators who work in open pre-kindergarten to have specific preparation in early childhood education. As per the State of Pre-School Yearbook (Barnett et al., 2015), 45 states require their educators to have a specialization in early childhood education, and 30 states require no less than a bachelor's qualification. As indicated by NAEYC state profiles (NAEYC, 2014), just 14 states require kindergarten instructors to be confirmed in early youth; in the rest of the states, kindergarten educators might be authorized in basic training. Fewer states require ECE affirmation for first- grade educators (Fields and Mitchell, 2007). Learning through play A child exploring comfortably due to having a secure attachment with caregiver Early childhood education often focuses on learning through play, based on the research and philosophy of Jean Piaget, which posits that play meets the physical, intellectual, language, emotional, and social needs (PILES) of children. Children's curiosity and imagination naturally evoke learning when unfettered. Learning through play will allow a child to develop cognitively. This is the earliest form of collaboration among children. In this, children learn through their interactions with others. Thus, children learn more efficiently and gain more knowledge through activities such as dramatic play, art, and social games. Tassoni suggests that \\"some play opportunities will develop specific individual areas of development, but many will develop several areas.\\"Tassoni, P. (2000) S/NVQ 3 play work. London: Heinemann Educational. Thus, it is important that practitioners promote children's development through play by using various types of play on a daily basis. Allowing children to help get snacks ready helps develop math skills (one-to- one ratio, patterns, etc.), leadership, and communication.McGee, M. (2005). Hidden Mathematics in the Preschool Classroom. Teaching Children Mathematics, 11(6), 345-347. Key guidelines for creating a play-based learning environment include providing a safe space, correct supervision, and culturally aware, trained teachers who are knowledgeable about the Early Years Foundation. Davy states that the British Children's Act of 1989 links to play-work as the act works with play workers and sets the standards for the setting such as security, quality and staff ratios. Learning through play has been seen regularly in practice as the most versatile way a child can learn. Margaret McMillan (1860-1931) suggested that children should be given free school meals, fruit and milk, and plenty of exercise to keep them physically and emotionally healthy. Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) believed that play time allows children to talk, socially interact, use their imagination and intellectual skills. Maria Montessori (1870-1952) believed that children learn through movement and their senses and after doing an activity using their senses. The benefits of being active for young children include physical benefits (healthy weight, bone strength, cardiovascular fitness), stress relief, improved social skills and improved sleep. When young students have group play time it also helps them to be more empathetic towards each other. In a more contemporary approach, organizations such as the National Association of the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) promote child-guided learning experiences, individualized learning, and developmentally appropriate learning as tenets of early childhood education. A study by the Ohio State University also analyzed the effects of implementing board games in elementary classrooms. This study found that implementing board games in the classroom \\"helped students develop social skills that transferred to other areas.\\"Bendixen-Noe, Mary. \\"Bringing Play Back to the Classroom: How Teachers Implement Board and Card Games Based on Academic Learning Standards\\" (PDF) ‚Äì via The Ohio State University. Specific outcomes included students being more helpful, cooperative and thoughtful with other students. Negative outcomes included children feeling excluded and showing frustration with game rules. Piaget provides an explanation for why learning through play is such a crucial aspect of learning as a child. However, due to the advancement of technology, the art of play has started to dissolve and has transformed into \\"playing\\" through technology. Greenfield, quoted by the author, Stuart Wolpert, in the article \\"Is Technology Producing a Decline in Critical Thinking and Analysis?\\", states, \\"No media is good for everything. If we want to develop a variety of skills, we need a balanced media diet. Each medium has costs and benefits in terms of what skills each develops.\\" Technology is beginning to invade the art of play and a balance needs to be found.Wolpert, Stuart. \\"Is Technology Producing a Decline in Critical Thinking and Analysis?\\" UCLA Newsroom. UCLA, 27 Jan. 2009. Web. 5 Feb. 2015. Many oppose the theory of learning through play because they think children are not gaining new knowledge. In reality, play is the first way children learn to make sense of the world at a young age. Research suggests that the way children play and interact with concepts at a young age could help explain the differences in social and cognitive interactions later. When learning what behavior to associate with a set action can help lead children on to a more capable future.https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/features/education-and-the-brain-what- happens-when-children-learn As children watch adults interact around them, they pick up on their slight nuances, from facial expressions to their tone of voice. They are exploring different roles, learning how things work, and learning to communicate and work with others. These things cannot be taught by a standard curriculum, but have to be developed through the method of play. Many preschools understand the importance of play and have designed their curriculum around that to allow children to have more freedom. Once these basics are learned at a young age, it sets children up for success throughout their schooling and their life. Many say that those who succeed in kindergarten know when and how to control their impulses. They can follow through when a task is difficult and listen to directions for a few minutes. These skills are linked to self-control, which is within the social and emotional development that is learned over time through play among other things.  Theories of child development  The Developmental Interaction Approach is based on the theories of Jean Piaget, Erik Erikson, John Dewey, and Lucy Sprague Mitchell. The approach focuses on learning through discovery. Jean Jacques Rousseau recommended that teachers should exploit individual children's interests in order to make sure each child obtains the information most essential to his personal and individual development.McDowall Clark, R (2013). Childhood in Society . London: Learning Matters. The five developmental domains of childhood development include: To meet those developmental domains, a child has a set of needs that must be met for learning. Maslow's hierarchy of needs showcases the different levels of needs that must be met the chart to the right showcases these needs. Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs * Physical: the way in which a child develops biological and physical functions, including eyesight and motor skills * Social: the way in which a child interacts with others Children develop an understanding of their responsibilities and rights as members of families and communities, as well as an ability to relate to and work with others. * Emotional: the way in which a child creates emotional connections and develops self-confidence. Emotional connections develop when children relate to other people and share feelings. *Language: the way in which a child communicates, including how they present their feelings and emotions, both to other people and to themselves. At 3 months, children employ different cries for different needs. At 6 months they can recognize and imitate the basic sounds of spoken language. In the first 3 years, children need to be exposed to communication with others in order to pick up language. \\"Normal\\" language development is measured by the rate of vocabulary acquisition.NIH (2011) Speech and language development milestones, USA: NIDCD: (accessed 15 April 2014). * Cognitive skills: the way in which a child organizes information. Cognitive skills include problem solving, creativity, imagination and memory. They embody the way in which children make sense of the world. Piaget believed that children exhibit prominent differences in their thought patterns as they move through the stages of cognitive development: sensorimotor period, the pre-operational period, and the operational period.Doherty, J. and Hughes, M. (2009). Child development: theory and practice 0-11. Harlow: Longman.  Vygotsky‚Äôs socio- cultural learning theory  Russian psychologist Lev Vygotsky proposed a \\"socio-cultural learning theory\\" that emphasized the impact of social and cultural experiences on individual thinking and the development of mental processes. Vygotsky's theory emerged in the 1930s and is still discussed today as a means of improving and reforming educational practices. In Vygotsky's theories of learning, he also postulated the theory of the zone of proximal development. This theory ties in with children building off prior knowledge and gaining new knowledge related to skills they already have. In the theory it describes how new knowledge or skills are taken in if they are not fully learned but are starting to emerge. A teacher or older friend lends support to a child learning a skill, be it building a block castle, tying a shoe, or writing one's name. As the child becomes more capable of the steps of the activity, the adult or older child withdraws supports gradually, until the child is competent completing the process on his/her own. This is done within that activity's zone‚Äîthe distance between where the child is, and where he potentially will be. In each zone of proximal development, they build on skills and grow by learning more skills in their proximal development range. They build on the skills by being guided by teachers and parents. They must build from where they are in their zone of proximal development. Vygotsky argued that since cognition occurs within a social context, our social experiences shape our ways of thinking about and interpreting the world. People such as parents, grandparents, and teachers play the roles of what Vygotsky described as knowledgeable and competent adults. Although Vygotsky predated social constructivists, he is commonly classified as one. Social constructivists believe that an individual's cognitive system is a resditional learning time. Vygotsky advocated that teachers facilitate rather than direct student learning. Teachers should provide a learning environment where students can explore and develop their learning without direct instruction. His approach calls for teachers to incorporate students‚Äô needs and interests. It is important to do this because students' levels of interest and abilities will vary and there needs to be differentiation. However, teachers can enhance understandings and learning for students. Vygotsky states that by sharing meanings that are relevant to the children's environment, adults promote cognitive development as well. Their teachings can influence thought processes and perspectives of students when they are in new and similar environments. Since Vygotsky promotes more facilitation in children's learning, he suggests that knowledgeable people (and adults in particular), can also enhance knowledges through cooperative meaning-making with students in their learning.McDevitt, T.M. & Ormrod, J.E. (2016). Cognitive Development: Piaget and Vygotsky. In Child Development and Education. (pp. 196-235). Pearson. Vygotsky's approach encourages guided participation and student exploration with support. Teachers can help students achieve their cognitive development levels through consistent and regular interactions of collaborative knowledge- making learning processes.  Piaget‚Äôs constructivist theory  Jean Piaget's constructivist theory gained influence in the 1970s and '80s. Although Piaget himself was primarily interested in a descriptive psychology of cognitive development, he also laid the groundwork for a constructivist theory of learning. Piaget believed that learning comes from within: children construct their own knowledge of the world through experience and subsequent reflection. He said that \\"if logic itself is created rather than being inborn, it follows that the first task of education is to form reasoning.\\" Within Piaget's framework, teachers should guide children in acquiring their own knowledge rather than simply transferring knowledge. According to Piaget's theory, when young children encounter new information, they attempt to accommodate and assimilate it into their existing understanding of the world. Accommodation involves adapting mental schemas and representations in order to make them consistent with reality. Assimilation involves fitting new information into their pre-existing schemas. Through these two processes, young children learn by equilibrating their mental representations with reality. They also learn from mistakes. A Piagetian approach emphasizes experiential education; in school, experiences become more hands-on and concrete as students explore through trial and error. Thus, crucial components of early childhood education include exploration, manipulating objects, and experiencing new environments. Subsequent reflection on these experiences is equally important. Piaget's concept of reflective abstraction was particularly influential in mathematical education. Through reflective abstraction, children construct more advanced cognitive structures out of the simpler ones they already possess. This allows children to develop mathematical constructs that cannot be learned through equilibration ‚Äî making sense of experiences through assimilation and accommodation ‚Äî alone. According to Piagetian theory, language and symbolic representation is preceded by the development of corresponding mental representations. Research shows that the level of reflective abstraction achieved by young children was found to limit the degree to which they could represent physical quantities with written numerals. Piaget held that children can invent their own procedures for the four arithmetical operations, without being taught any conventional rules. Piaget's theory implies that computers can be a great educational tool for young children when used to support the design and construction of their projects. McCarrick and Xiaoming found that computer play is consistent with this theory. However, Plowman and Stephen found that the effectiveness of computers is limited in the preschool environment; their results indicate that computers are only effective when directed by the teacher. This suggests, according to the constructivist theory, that the role of preschool teachers is critical in successfully adopting computers as they existed in 2003. Kolb's experiential learning theory David Kolb's experiential learning theory, which was influenced by John Dewey, Kurt Lewin and Jean Piaget, argues that children need to experience things in order to learn: \\"The process whereby knowledge is created through the transformation of experience. Knowledge results from the combinations of grasping and transforming experience.\\" The experimental learning theory is distinctive in that children are seen and taught as individuals. As a child explores and observes, teachers ask the child probing questions. The child can then adapt prior knowledge to learning new information. Kolb breaks down this learning cycle into four stages: concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualization, and active experimentation. Children observe new situations, think about the situation, make meaning of the situation, then test that meaning in the world around them. Practical implications of early childhood education In recent decades, studies have shown that early childhood education is critical in preparing children to enter and succeed in the (grade school) classroom, diminishing their risk of social-emotional mental health problems and increasing their self-sufficiency later in their lives.Connecticut Office of Early Childhood Planning, 2013 In other words, the child needs to be taught to rationalize everything and to be open to interpretations and critical thinking. There is no subject to be considered taboo, starting with the most basic knowledge of the world he lives in, and ending with deeper areas, such as morality, religion and science. Visual stimulus and response time as early as 3 months can be an indicator of verbal and performance IQ at age 4 years.Dougherty and Haith of the University of Denver, \\"Infant Expectations and Reaction Time as Predictors of Childhood Speed of Processing and IQ\\", published in volume 33 (1997) of the journal Developmental Psychology. When parents value ECE and its importance their children generally have a higher rate of attendance. This allows children the opportunity to build and nurture trusting relationships with educators and social relationships with peers. By providing education in a child's most formative years, ECE also has the capacity to pre-emptively begin closing the educational achievement gap between low and high-income students before formal schooling begins.Coleman, J. S., Campbell, E. Q., Hobson, C. J., McPartland, J., Mood, A. M., Weinfeld, F. D., & York, R. L. (1966). Equality of educational opportunity: Summary report (Vol. 2). US Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Office of Education. Children of low socioeconomic status (SES) often begin school already behind their higher SES peers; on average, by the time they are three, children with high SES have three times the number of words in their vocabularies as children with low SES.Hart, B., & Risley, T. R. (1995). Meaningful differences in the everyday experience of young American children. If a parent values the benefits of ECE, then they are more likely to have higher attendance, which aids children in forming meaningful relationships with their educators and peers. Paul H Brookes Publishing. Participation in ECE, however, has been proven to increase high school graduation rates, improve performance on standardized tests, and reduce both grade repetition and the number of children placed in special education.Schweinhart, L.J., Montie, J., Xiang, Z., Barnett, W.S., Belfield, C.R., and Nores, M. (2005). Lifetime effects: The High/Scope Perry Preschool study through age 40. Ypsilanti: High/Scope Press, 2005. A study was conducted by the Aga Khan Development Network's Madrasa Early Childhood Programme on the impact that early childhood education had on students‚Äô performance in grade school. Looking specifically at students who attended the Madrasa Early Childhood schools (virtually all of whom came from economically disadvantaged backgrounds), the study found that they had consistently ranked in the top 20% in grade 1 classes. The study also concluded that any formal early childhood education contributed to higher levels of cognitive development in language, mathematics, and non-verbal reasoning skills.Bartlett, Kathy, Judy Evans, and Shafique N. Virani. The Madrasa Early Childhood Programme: 25 Years of Experience. Geneva: Aga Khan Foundation and Rockhopper TV, 2008 https://www.academia.edu/37253564/The_Madrasa_Early_Childhood_Programme_25_Years_of_Experience Especially since the first wave of results from the Perry Preschool Project were published, there has been widespread consensus that the quality of early childhood education programs correlate with gains in low-income children's IQs and test scores, decreased grade retention, and lower special education rates. Several studies have reported that children enrolled in ECE increase their IQ scores by 4-11 points by age five, while a Milwaukee study reported a 25-point gain.Barnett, W. S. (1995). Long-term effects of early childhood programs on cognitive and school outcomes. The future of children, 25-50. In addition, students who had been enrolled in the Abecedarian Project, an often-cited ECE study, scored significantly higher on reading and math tests by age fifteen than comparable students who had not participated in early childhood programs.Campbell, F. A., Ramey, C. T., Pungello, E., Sparling, J., & Miller- Johnson, S. (2002). Early childhood education: Young adult outcomes from the Abecedarian Project. Applied Developmental Science, 6(1), 42-57. In addition, 36% of students in the Abecedarian Preschool Study treatment group would later enroll in four-year colleges compared to 14% of those in the control group. In 2017, researchers reported that children who participate in ECE graduate high school at significantly greater rates than those who do not. Additionally, those who participate in ECE require special education and must repeat a grade at significantly lower rates than their peers who did not receive ECE. The NIH asserts that ECE leads to higher test scores for students from preschool through age 21, improved grades in math and reading, and stronger odds that students will keep going to school and attend college. Nathaniel Hendren and Ben Sprung-Keyser, two Harvard economists, found high Marginal Values of Public Funds (MVPFs) for investments in programs supporting the health and early education of children, particularly those that reach children from low- income families. The average MVPF for these types of initiatives is over 5, while the MVPFs for programs for adults generally range from 0.5 to 2. Beyond benefitting societal good, ECE also significantly impacts the socioeconomic outcomes of individuals. For example, by age 26, students who had been enrolled in Chicago Child-Parent Centers were less likely to be arrested, abuse drugs, and receive food stamps; they were more likely to have high school diplomas, health insurance and full-time employment.Heckman, 2013 Studies also show that ECE heightens social engagement, bolsters lifelong health, reduces the incidence of teen pregnancy, supports mental health, decreases the risk of heart disease, and lengthens lifespans. and The World Bank's 2019 World Development Report on The Changing Nature of WorkWorld Bank World Development Report 2019: The Changing Nature of Work. identifies early childhood development programs as one of the most effective ways governments can equip children with the skills they will need to succeed in future labor markets. According to a 2020 study in the Journal of Political Economy by Clemson University economist Jorge Luis Garc√≠a, Nobel laureate James J. Heckman and University of Southern California economists Duncan Ermini Leaf and Mar√≠a Jos√© Prados, every dollar spent on a high-quality early-childhood programs led to a return of $7.3 over the long-term. The Perry Preschool Project The Perry Preschool Project, which was conducted in the 1960s in Ypsilanti, Michigan, is the oldest social experiment in the field of early childhood education and has heavily influenced policy in the United States and across the globe. The experiment enrolled 128 three- and four-year-old African-American children with cognitive disadvantage from low-income families, who were then randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. The intervention for children in the treatment group included active learning preschool sessions on weekdays for 2.5 hours per day. The intervention also included weekly visits by the teachers to the homes of the children for about 1.5 hours per visit to improve parent-child interactions at home. Initial evaluations of the Perry intervention showed that the preschool program failed to significantly boost an IQ measure. However, later evaluations that followed up the participants for more than fifty years have demonstrated the long-term economic benefits of the program, even after accounting for the small sample size of the experiment, flaws in its randomization procedure, and sample attrition. There is substantial evidence of large treatment effects on the criminal convictions of male participants, especially for violent crime, and their earnings in middle adulthood. Research points to improvements in non- cognitive skills, executive functioning, childhood home environment, and parental attachment as potential sources of the observed long-term impacts of the program. The intervention's many benefits also include improvements in late-midlife health for both male and female participants. Research also demonstrates spillover effects of the Perry program on the children and siblings of the original participants. A study concludes, \\"The children of treated participants have fewer school suspensions, higher levels of education and employment, and lower levels of participation in crime, compared with the children of untreated participants. Impacts are especially pronounced for the children of male participants. These treatment effects are associated with improved childhood home environments.\\" The study also documents beneficial impacts on the male siblings of the original participants. Evidence from the Perry Preschool Project is noteworthy because it advocates for public spending on early childhood programs as an economic investment in a society's future, rather than in the interest of social justice. International agreements The first World Conference on Early Childhood Care and Education took place in Moscow from 27 to 29 September 2010, jointly organized by UNESCO and the city of Moscow. The overarching goals of the conference are to: According to UNESCO, a preschool curriculum is one that delivers educational content through daily activities and furthers a child's physical, cognitive, and social development. Generally, preschool curricula are only recognized by governments if they are based on academic research and reviewed by peers. Preschool for Child Rights have pioneered into preschool curricular areas and is contributing into child rights through their preschool curriculum. Percentage of children aged 36 to 59 months who are developmentally on track, 2009‚Äì2017  Curricula in early childhood care and education  Curricula in early childhood care and education (ECCE) is the driving force behind any ECCE programme. It is ‚Äòan integral part of the engine that, together with the energy and motivation of staff, provides the momentum that makes programmes live‚Äô.Epstein, A, Larner, M and Halpern, R. 1995. A Guide to Developing Community-Based Family Support Programs. Ypsilanti, Michigan, High/Scope Press. It follows therefore that the quality of a programme is greatly influenced by the quality of its curriculum. In early childhood, these may be programs for children or parents, including health and nutrition interventions and prenatal programs, as well as center-based programs for children.  Orphan education  A lack of education during the early childhood years for orphans is a worldwide concern. Orphans are at higher risk of \\"missing out on schooling, living in households with less food security, and suffering from anxiety and depression.\\" Education during these years has the potential to improve a child's \\"food and nutrition, health care, social welfare, and protection.\\" This crisis is especially prevalent in sub-saharan Africa which has been heavily impacted by the aids epidemic. UNICEF reports that \\"13.3 million children (0-17 years) worldwide have lost one or both parents to AIDS. Nearly 12 million of these children live in sub-Saharan Africa.\\" Government policies such as the Free Basic Education Policy have worked to provide education for orphan children in this area, but the quality and inclusiveness of this policy has brought criticism.  Barriers and challenges  Children's learning potential and outcomes are negatively affected by exposure to violence, abuse and child labour. Thus, protecting young children from violence and exploitation is part of broad educational concerns. Due to difficulties and sensitivities around the issue of measuring and monitoring child protection violations and gaps in defining, collecting and analysing appropriate indicators,UNICEF. 2013. State of the World‚Äôs Children. Children with Disabilities. New York, UNICEF. data coverage in this area is scant. However, proxy indicators can be used to assess the situation. For example, ratification of relevant international conventions indicates countries‚Äô commitment to child protection. By April 2014, 194 countries had ratified the CRC3; and 179 had ratified the 1999 International Labour Organization's Convention (No. 182) concerning the elimination of the worst forms of child labour. However, many of these ratifications are yet to be given full effect through actual implementation of concrete measures. Globally, 150 million children aged 5‚Äì14 are estimated to be engaged in child labour. In conflict- affected poor countries, children are twice as likely to die before their fifth birthday compared to those in other poor countries.UNESCO. 2010. The World Conference on Early Childhood Care and Education: Building the Wealth of Nations - Concept Paper. In industrialized countries, 4 per cent of children are physically abused each year and 10 per cent are neglected or psychologically abused. In both developed and developing countries, children of the poor and the disadvantaged remain the least served. This exclusion persists against the evidence that the added value of early childhood care and education services are higher for them than for their more affluent counterparts, even when such services are of modest quality. While the problem is more intractable in developing countries, the developed world still does not equitably provide quality early childhood care and education services for all its children. In many European countries, children, mostly from low-income and immigrant families, do not have access to good quality early childhood care and education.Eurydice. 2009.

It is these goods that they value. The idea was originally proposed by Gary Becker, Kelvin Lancaster, and Richard Muth in the mid-1960s.

Background  After the release of the best-selling Ompa til du d√∏r, and the EPs D√∏d manns tango and Mann mot mann, the band started writing new material. \\"Die Polizei\\" was played in late 2001, although being part of the plot of the following album MaestroCD Booklet of V√•re Demoner rather than Evig pint. In February 2002, the band played the song \\"Salt og pepper\\" for the first time. The song continued to be played throughout 2002. Some new compositions were mentioned in interviews, called \\"Brolins Box Arrangement\\" and \\"Tyster\\". However, these were never mentioned again or played live. Nothing new surfaced until the band played \\"Djevelens orkester\\" once in fall 2002. Shortly after, in November, the recording sessions for the new album started. The sessions ended in December. A minimal amount of news about the new album surfaced, on their site and in newspapers and magazines. Nearing the end of 2002, Kaizers Orchestra spoke about the new album. It was to be called Evig pint, and was due for release on 3 February 2003. \\"Die Polizei\\" was ultimately cut, as the band decided that the true feel of the song could only be experienced live. Thus, it was kept as an exclusive live song, and was never released on any album until the band's live album Live at Vega in 2006. Despite their previous announcement of keeping the song exclusive to live shows, the song was recorded for the compilation album V√•re demoner in 2009.  Album art  The album art features the band's organist Helge Risa in his trademark gas mask before a dark brown background. The liner notes features pictures from a concert the band held at Rockefeller in Oslo.  Promotion and release  In early 2003, the band released \\"Di grind\\" as a free download, exclusively on their site. They premiered the song \\"Evig pint\\" at the Spellemannsprisen award show (Norwegian Grammy Award). The album was released finally on 3 February 2003. Like its predecessor, it received many positive reviews from the major newspapers in Norway; however, it did not receive as many full marks in its reviews as Ompa til du d√∏r. The album was later re-released in other countries, but unlike Ompa til du d√∏r, no additions, removals or changes were made to the recordings. It was also released as a digipak CD and LP. Lastly, it was re- released as a bundle together with the 2002 EP release Mann mot mann. In 2004, the album, together with the band's earlier and later releases, was re- released throughout Europe, due to the band having signed a contract with Universal Germany. Ultimately, the album did not sell as well as Ompa til du d√∏r and disappeared from the album charts in Norway considerably faster. However, Evig pint remains one of the albums with most consistency in its overall review score released in Norway to date.  Style and lyrical themes  Evig pint has a generally darker atmosphere than its predecessor, both musically and lyrically. A majority of the songs are about torment of the soul, heaven, hell, death and loneliness. The lyrics also relate to each other to a lesser extent than Ompa til du d√∏r.

Mintz. Book Two, page 79. Silk Pagoda (2006). ) was the thirtieth king of the Korean kingdom of Silla. He is usually considered to have been the first ruler of the Unified Silla period. Munmu was the son of King Muyeol and Munmyeong, who was the younger sister of Kim Yu- shin. Under his father's reign, he held the office of pajinchan, who apparently was responsible for maritime affairs, and played a key role in developing the country's diplomatic links with Tang China. He was born Prince Beopmin (Hangul:Î≤ïÎØº Hanja:Ê≥ïÊïè), and took the name Munmu when he succeeded his father to the throne. After his death, he was known by the title of Dragon King.Keith Pratt and Richard Rutt. Korea: A Historical and Cultural Dictionary. Routledge. P.298. Unification of Three Kingdoms King Munmu took the throne in the midst of a long conflict against Baekje and Goguryeo, shortly after General Gyebaek and Baekje had been defeated at Sabi by General Kim Yu-shin in 660. In these struggles, Silla was heavily aided by the Tang. The first years of his reign were spent trying to defeat Goguryeo, following an abortive attempt in 661. Finally, in 667, he ordered another attack which led to the defeat of Goguryeo in 668. After the small isolated pockets of resistance were eliminated, Munmu was the first ruler ever to see the Korean peninsula completely unified. War with Tang China King Munmu then faced the challenge of freeing his country from Tang domination. After the fall of Goguryeo, Tang created the Protectorate General to Pacify the East and attempted to place the entire Korean peninsula, including Silla, under its rule. To prevent this, Munmu forged alliances with Goguryeo resistance leaders such as Geom Mojam and Anseung, and launched a frontal attack on the Tang forces occupying former Baekje territories. The struggle lasted through the early 670s. In 674, Tang and its former ally, Silla, were in constant battle, as King Munmu had taken over much of former Baekje and Goguryeo territory from the Tang and fostered resistance against them. Emperor Gaozong, in anger, arbitrarily declared King Munmu's brother, Kim Inmun, the king. However, King Munmu formally apologized and offered tribute, and Emperor Gaozong ordered a withdraw and recalled Kim Inmun. In 675, Li Jinxing (Hanja:ÊùéË¨πË°å) reached Silla territory with Mohe forces that submitted to Tang. However, the Tang forces were defeated by the Silla army at the Maeso fortress (Tang sources claim that the Tang forces won this and other battles in Silla). Emperor Gaozong ordered withdrawal of Tang forces from the Korean Peninsula entirely and moved the Protectorate General to Pacify the East to Liaodong, allowing Silla to eventually expel Tang out of the Korean Peninsula and unify the parts of the peninsula south of the Taedong River. This victory, and the maintenance of Silla's independence, is generally regarded as a critical turning point in Korean history. After Unification Wars Munmu ruled over unified Silla for twenty years, until he fell ill in 681. On his deathbed, he left his last will and testament, and abdicated to his son, Prince Sinmun. Before he died he said: \\"A country should not be without a king at any time. Let the Prince have my crown before he has my coffin. Cremate my remains and scatter the ashes in the sea where the whales live. I will become a dragon and thwart foreign invasion.\\" King Sinmun did as his father asked, and scattered his ashes over Daewangam (the Rock of the Great King), a small rocky islet a hundred metres or so off the Korean coast. Moreover, King Sinmun built the Gomun Temple (the Temple of Appreciated Blessing) and dedicated it to his father, he built a waterway for the sea dragon to come to and from the sea and land, and he built a pavilion, Eegun, overlooking the islet so that future kings could pay their respects to the great King Munmu. In a dream, King Munmu and the famous general Kim Yu-shin appeared to King Sinmun and said to him: \\"Blowing on a bamboo flute will calm the heavens and the earth.\\" King Sinmun awoke from the dream, rode out to the sea and received the bamboo flute named Manpa-sikjeok (Ëê¨Ê≥¢ÊÅØÁ¨õ, ÎßåÌååÏãùÏ†Å). It was said that the blowing of this bamboo flute invoked the spirits of King Munmu and General Kim Yu-shin and would push back enemy troops, cure illnesses, bring rain during drought and halt the rains in floods. Ancestry The Stele of Munmu Wang suggests that he was of the ethnic Xiongnu origin, or at least that parts of his family arrived from the Xiongnu.

It stars John Thaw as Detective Inspector Jack Regan and Dennis Waterman as his partner, Detective Sergeant George Carter. The programme's title derives from \\"Sweeney Todd\\", which is Cockney rhyming slang for \\"Flying Squad\\". Produced by Thames Television subsidiary Euston Films for broadcast on the ITV network, it began as a television film Regan written by Ian Kennedy Martin, brother of Troy Kennedy Martin, who wrote several episodes and also the second film. Such was its popularity in the UK that it spawned two feature film spin-offs, Sweeney! and Sweeney 2. In the early 1990s repeats aired on UK Gold, but repeats currently air on ITV4 Background Originally developed from a one-off TV drama entitled Regan, a 90-minute television film that Ian Kennedy Martin wrote for Thames Television's Armchair Cinema series in 1974. The part of Regan was specifically written for John Thaw, who was by this time a friend of Ian Kennedy Martin, with whom he had worked on the TV drama series Redcap in the 1960s. From the very beginning, Regan was seen as having series potential. After the television film scored highly in the ratings, work began on the development of the series proper. Ian Kennedy Martin's idea was for the series to be mainly studio-based, with more dialogue and less action, but producer Ted Childs disagreed, and in consequence Ian Kennedy Martin parted company with the project. Childs produced it on 16mm film, a format that allowed for a much smaller film unit than videotape at that time. This made it possible to shoot almost entirely on location which helped give the series a startling degree of realism and to use film editing techniques which enabled him to give the show a heavy bias toward action sequences. The television play and the subsequent series were commissioned by Thames Television and produced by its film division Euston Films. It was originally broadcast on ITV between 2 January 1975 and 28 December 1978 at 21:00‚Äì22:00 on weekdays (usually Mondays), with repeated screenings at the same time until the early 1980s. The writers were given strict guidelines to follow: \\"Each show will have an overall screen time (minus titles) of 48 minutes 40 seconds. Each film will open with a teaser of up to 3 minutes, which will be followed by the opening titles. The story will be played across three acts, each being no more than 19 minutes and no less than 8 minutes in length. Regan will appear in every episode, Carter in approximately 10 out of 13 episodes. In addition to these main characters, scripts should be based around three major speaking parts, with up to ten minor speaking parts.\\" It is a fast-paced edge-of-your-seat action series, depicting the Squad's relentless battle against armed robbery; but it nevertheless includes a substantial degree of humour. For the time, it had a high degree of graphic on-screen violence and the episodes tend to have a high body count with several deaths per episode. Previously, most dramas featuring the police had shied away from showing them as fallible. The police in The Sweeney were brutal and violent in dealing with London's hardened criminals, and prone to cutting corners and bending laws. The series showed a somewhat more realistic side of the police, often depicting a disregard for authority, rules and the \\"system\\", so long it as got the job done. Until The Sweeney, this had been a subject largely ignored by British television. The series' own awareness of breaking new ground is evident in episodes such as the second series \\"Trojan Bus\\", where Regan briefly whistles the theme-tune to Dixon of Dock Green after a particularly elementary piece of detective work. The series reflected the fact that it was made during a dark period for the real-life Flying Squad, which in the late 1970s had been publicly censured for being involved in bribery, corruption and excessively close links with the criminal fraternity. The actual commander of the Flying Squad, Detective Chief Superintendent Kenneth Drury, was convicted of five counts of corruption and imprisoned for eight years on 7 July 1977 (the incident was a plot element in the movie Sweeney 2). An internal investigation, called Operation Countryman, was then launched to stamp out corruption.Andrew Walker. The Sweeney's proud history, BBC, 17 May 2004. Cast and characters=Main characters The main two characters were Detective Inspector Jack Regan and Detective Sergeant George Carter. Their senior officer was DCI Frank Haskins. However, occasionally other senior officers took charge of the Flying Squad when DCI Haskins was seconded to other duties or investigations. =Jack Regan= John Thaw stars as Detective Inspector John \\"Jack\\" Albert Regan, a tough police officer, often frustrated by Scotland Yard's red tape. Originally from Manchester (like Thaw himself), he has been in London for several years, so his accent has modified, but traces of his northern origins are still evident. He also occasionally refers to his northern roots (his poor upbringing, his father's work on the Manchester Ship Canal), which brings banter from George Carter, a Londoner, such as humming \\"The Red Flag\\". A heavy drinker and smoker (comically, he is sometimes seen stealing other people's cigarettes), Regan has some success with women‚Äîalthough not as much as Carter, or in one episode, DCI Haskins. He can be seen as quick with his fists. He has an ex-wife, Kate, and daughter, Susie, who live in Ruislip; in the last episode of the first series, \\"Abduction\\", Susie is kidnapped. Regan helps out an ex-informer whose son is kidnapped in \\"Feet of Clay\\" (Series 4); and his sympathetic pushing enables his boss Haskins to ask for help when his wife goes missing after a breakdown, in \\"Victims\\" (Series 4); it's Regan who finds her. Regan can bend the rules in order to achieve the desired result: for example, fabricating evidence and arranging for a criminal to be kidnapped in \\"Queen's Pawn\\", and illegally entering private properties and threatening to lie about being attacked by a prisoner in order to get information in Regan. Despite this, he's unwilling to cheat for personal gain: he delivers a sharp put-down to a corrupt copper in \\"Bad Apple\\", and refuses to take a bribe in \\"Golden Fleece\\". In the Squad, informality is everything. Everyone calls DCI Haskins simply \\"Haskins\\" (except to his face), though Regan occasionally calls him by his first name, Frank. No one ever calls Regan \\"Mister\\"‚Äîexcept the villains, or sometimes Carter when talking to Haskins. To the Squad, he is always simply \\"the Guv'nor\\", or just \\"Guv\\". In turn, he invariably calls Carter and the other Squad members by their first names. When off duty, he and George Carter are friends and drinking buddies, so in private Carter calls him \\"Jack\\". This is all in accordance with widespread police convention. Regan is driven around in a Ford Consul (Granada Mark I based) (1972‚Äì1975) 3.0 GT. Although he is seen driving various cars himself in the series, he always has a driver‚Äîusually Bill (an uncredited role played by Tony Allen)‚Äîwhen using the Consul Granada (and the similar Ford Granada models used in later stories), which served as a Squad car: when the Squad travelled they always went \\"mob handed\\" (in considerable numbers). Regan is seen to also have his own car outside of the Squad, a Mark II Ford Cortina. =George Carter= Dennis Waterman plays Detective Sergeant George Hamilton Carter who comes from south London; in the pilot episode, Regan seeks him out because of his knowledge of the south London area. His age is given in the episode \\"Hit and Run\\" as 26. In the series' timeline, we learn that George had previously been in the Squad, but had quit for family reasons (cf. Regan and \\"Jigsaw\\"). George was married to Alison Carter, a schoolteacher, but is widowed in the episode \\"Hit and Run\\" when Alison is murdered by mistake by a gang of diamond smugglers. He is a former amateur boxer, as shown in the pilot Regan, and is described as having professional boxing potential in the episode \\"Chalk and Cheese\\". Like his superior, he likes a drink (though less so than Regan), and appreciates football and‚Äîafter the death of his wife‚Äîattractive women. Carter is not as potentially violent or aggressive as Regan, and usually plays the \\"good cop\\" role. =Frank Haskins= Garfield Morgan plays Detective Chief Inspector Frank Haskins, who is married with three children at boarding schools, and is Regan's immediate superior. Prior to the series timeline, the character had done \\"National Service in the Signals Corps in a minor intelligence role\\" (as revealed in the episode \\"Stay Lucky, Eh?\\"). He is frequently seen at odds with Regan, preferring more conventional \\"by-the-book\\" policing methods. The main \\"Haskins episodes\\" are \\"Golden Fleece\\", in which he is set up to be the victim of a corruption inquiry, and \\"Victims\\", in which his wife suffers a mental breakdown attributed to her memories of a miscarriage. Although he appeared in the opening titles of every episode of the first three series, he did not appear in all of them. The character was not present at the start of the fourth, final series, and his role was taken by other superiors such as Detective Chief Inspector Anderson, played by Richard Wilson, and Detective Chief Superintendent Braithwaite, played by Benjamin Whitrow. Haskins returned a few episodes into the fourth series. There are two versions of the fourth series opening credits‚Äîone with and one without Haskins. Other recurring charactersThe squad= In the early episodes, the team has a variety of drivers including Len (Jack McKenzie) (the first two episodes) and Fred (Denis DeMarne) (in the episode \\"Jigsaw\\"). However, the episode \\"The Placer\\" in the first series introduces the character of Bill the driver (played by Tony Allen, who subsequently worked as wardrobe manager for many of John Thaw's later projects), and he remains a constant throughout the series, although he plays a peripheral, non-speaking role in most episodes. Detective Sergeant Tom Daniels (John Alkin) is the most prominent member of the supporting Squad. Other members include Sergeant Kent, Detective Constable Thorpe (Martin Read) and DS Matthews (John Flanagan) in the first series, DC Jerry Burtonshaw (Nick Brimble) (Series 1-2, 4) and DC Jellyneck (James Warrior) (Series 4). Detective Chief Superintendent Maynon (Morris Perry) appears occasionally as a senior officer, and is seen as being more willing than Haskins to bend the rules in order to get a result in the episode \\"Queen's Pawn\\". With Haskins absent, a semi-regular senior officer named DCS Braithwaite (Benjamin Whitrow) appears in Series 4. =Family= Other main characters include the close family of the three leads. Regan's ex-wife Kate appears in the episode \\"Abduction\\", after previously featuring in the pilot; and his daughter Susie (Jennifer Thanisch) appears in several episodes, most notably, \\"Abduction\\". Carter's wife Alison (Stephanie Turner) is seen attempting to prise him away from the Squad in the episode \\"Jigsaw\\", while her hostility toward Regan is apparent in the episode \\"Abduction\\". She is murdered in a case of mistaken identity in the episode \\"Hit and Run\\". In the DVD commentary for \\"Abduction\\", it is mentioned that the reason for this was that the actress (Stephanie Turner) was asking for too much money to continue to appear in the series. Her death was convenient for the show, releasing Carter to play a more freewheeling role, \\"on the pull\\"‚Äîand allowing his banter with Regan, which had become a very popular part of the show, to develop further. Stephanie Turner went on to appear in Juliet Bravo, also devised and part- written by Ian Kennedy Martin. Doreen Haskins features in some episodes, although the penultimate episode \\"Victims\\" deals with her deteriorating mental health and returns to the theme of the job's impact on family life. One of Haskins' three children, Richard, also appears in that episode.

Due to this, the number of different filming locations had to be restricted to 10, i.e. one location per day. At the Euston Films production office in Colet Court, Hammersmith, a standing set of the Flying Squad offices (referred to as \\"The Factory\\" by the characters) was constructed which provided an alternative option for when inclement weather restricted the day's shooting. Two days would normally be spent filming on the set, equalling 10 minutes of any episode being set in the offices. Shooting took place through the spring, summer, autumn and winter months; exterior night shooting was expensive, and was limited to three minutes of external night material in any episode. Each episode had an eight-and-a-half-week production schedule: two weeks' pre-production (for casting, finding locations etc.), two weeks' shooting, four weeks' picture editing (the first two weeks of which overlapped with the shoot), two weeks' sound editing, and two-and-a- half days' dubbing. Filming locations Most of the locations used for filming The Sweeney were around the west London area‚Äîin particular, Acton, Chiswick, Shepherd's Bush, Hammersmith, Fulham, Earl's Court, Kensington & Chelsea and Notting Hill districts, close to the Euston Films HQ at Colet Court in Hammersmith. The London Docklands, derelict at the time, were ideal for filming location sequences. The opening titles were filmed in Colet Gardens. However, other notable locations in London, the South East of England and further afield were also used for filming the show's episodes and included: *Chertsey/Penton Hook Lock, Surrey - \\"Thin Ice\\", \\"Bad Apple\\", \\"On the Run\\", \\"Feet of Clay\\" & \\"Jack or Knave?\\". *Battersea - \\"Jigsaw\\", \\"Stoppo Driver\\", \\"Faces\\", \\"Trap\\", \\"Trojan Bus\\", \\"Country Boy\\", \\"Visiting Fireman\\", \\"Tomorrow Man\\", \\"May\\" & \\"Victims\\", \\"Chalk & Cheese\\" (Craven Arms, Lavender Hill) *Bermondsey - \\"Regan\\". *Black Park Country Park, Wexham, Buckinghamshire - \\"Regan\\", \\"Payoff\\", \\"On the Run\\" & \\"Hearts & Minds\\". *Dulwich - \\"Regan\\", \\"Ringer\\". *Dulwich Hamlet F.C. \\"Ringer\\". *Gozo/Maltese Archipelago - \\"Sweeney 2\\". *Earl's Court - \\"Bait\\" (Cromwell Crescent & Logan Place). *Earlsfield - Garratt Lane and Garratt Snooker Club - \\"Supersnout\\". *Hammersmith - \\"Jackpot\\". *Heathrow - \\"Golden Boy\\", \\"Stoppo Driver\\" & \\"Tomorrow Man\\". *Kingston upon Thames - \\"Hit and Run\\" & \\"Trojan Bus\\". *Ladbroke Grove - \\"Hard Men\\" *Maida Vale - \\"Night Out\\". *Peckham - \\"Ringer\\". *Potters Bar \\"Big Spender\\". *Putney/Putney Bridge \\"Contact Breaker\\", \\"Abduction\\" \\"Taste of Fear\\" & \\"Sweeney 2\\". *Queens Park Rangers F.C., Loftus Road - \\"I Want the Man!\\". *Raynes Park - \\"Big Spender\\", \\"Golden Fleece\\" & \\"Victims\\". *Richmond (River Lane; Leonard Gold's house) -\\"The Bigger They Are\\" *Roehampton - \\"Queen's Pawn\\", \\"Golden Fleece\\" (Bank of England Sports Centre), \\"Victims\\" & \\"Sweeney 2\\" (Danebury Avenue/Alton Estate). *Sandown Park Racecourse, Esher, Surrey - \\"Big Spender\\". *Shepherd's Bush - \\"Jackpot\\". *Southall Gas Works - \\"Faces\\". *Southwark - \\"Ringer\\". *Staines, Middlesex - \\"The Placer\\". *Tooting Bec - \\"Abduction\\" (Trinity Road & Tooting Bec Tube Station). *Twickenham - \\"The Placer\\", \\"Golden Fleece\\" (Twickenham Stadium) & \\"Bad Apple\\". *Uxbridge - \\"Thou Shalt Not Kill\\" (Brunel University) & \\"Bad Apple\\". *Wandsworth - \\"Queens Pawn\\", \\"Jigsaw\\", \\"Abduction\\", \\"Country Boy\\", \\"Tomorrow Man\\", \\"May\\", \\"Drag Act\\" & \\"Sweeney 2\\". *White City - \\"May\\" (White City Stadium). *Wimbledon - \\"Contact Breaker\\" (Wimbledon Stadium), \\"Stay Lucky, Eh?\\" \\"May\\", \\"Lady Luck\\" & \\"Money, Money, Money\\". *Wokingham, Berkshire - \\"Thin Ice\\". Episodes A pilot episode, Regan, was made as part of the Armchair Cinema series, first shown 4 June 1974. In all, four series were made with Series One being broadcast between January and March 1975 and Series Two following between September and November of the same year. Series Three was broadcast between September and December 1976, with the final series being shown two years later from September to December 1978. Two 90-minute feature films, Sweeney! and Sweeney 2, were released in 1977 and 1978 respectively, between the third and fourth series. Series 1 The promotional episode shown to the press was \\"Thin Ice\\", which featured a relatively lightweight and somewhat humorous story, some comedy and international locations. Episodes from the first series included \\"Ringer\\", where the team were attempting to prevent a criminal being sprung from prison, \\"Jackpot\\", \\"Stoppo Driver\\", and \\"Abduction\\" (in which Regan's daughter Susie was kidnapped), focusing on the strains which the job caused to family life. \\"Jigsaw\\" subtly illustrated the backgrounds and family lives of Regan and Carter; parallels are drawn between the unhappy situation of the main villain's family and Regan's own domestic situation. The early episodes feature a great degree of hostility and mistrust between Regan and his senior officer, Haskins, who in one episode (\\"Ringer\\") attempts to separate Carter from Regan in order to help Carter's career. The episode \\"Queen's Pawn\\" is a display of how Regan is willing to bend the rules in order to get a result, as he fabricates evidence, illegally opens private mail, and even arranges the kidnapping of one of the criminals in order to get the desired result. ;Series 1 Episodes All episodes were broadcast in 1975 on ITV, Thursdays at 21:00. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%; margin:auto; background:#FFFFFF;\\" - ! style=\\"background-color: #dbe9f4; color:#000; text-align: center;\\"Episode No !! style=\\"background-color: #dbe9f4; color:#000; text-align: center;\\"Title !! style=\\"background-color: #dbe9f4; color:#000; text-align: center;\\"Original airdate } All Series 1 episodes were shot in 1974. Series 2 The episodes \\"Faces\\" and \\"Thou Shalt Not Kill\\" were broadcast during the second series. In the former, a communist group (which appears to be German-based, with echoes of the then- contemporary West German communist terrorist group the Baader-Meinhof gang) is staging heists to raise funds for its cause. However, the group has been infiltrated by British Secret Service MI5, leading to inter-departmental politics between the police and the security services. \\"Thou Shalt Not Kill\\" features a tense hostage situation inside a bank, with Haskins faced with the dilemma of whether to risk the hostages' lives by shooting the criminals. Other highlights included a pair of tongue-in-cheek episodes, \\"Golden Fleece\\" and \\"Trojan Bus\\", featuring two cocky but likeable Australian villains, played by British actors Patrick Mower and George Layton; and the more serious episode \\"Hit and Run\\", in which Carter's wife Alison is murdered. ;Series 2 Episodes All episodes were broadcast in 1975 on ITV, Mondays at 21:00. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%; margin:auto; background:#FFFFFF;\\" - ! style=\\"background-color: #dbe9f4; color:#000; text- align: right;\\"Ep.

Series 3 The episode \\"Taste of Fear\\" introduced violent psychopathic criminal Tim Cook (George Sweeney), an army deserter whose experiences in Northern Ireland had left him embittered. Cook also appeared in the later episode \\"On the Run\\". Other episodes explored different themes: \\"Tomorrow Man\\" focused on the clash between traditional policing methods and newer more technological ways of solving crime, methods which, in the modern world, have made crimes such as those depicted in The Sweeney‚Äîfor example, villains in stocking masks carrying out wages snatches‚Äîseem old-fashioned. \\"Bad Apple\\" dealt with police corruption, and here, Regan, despite being seen to bend the rules in other episodes in order to achieve convictions (i.e. for legitimate motives), will not bend them for his own profit, and is shown to hold the deepest contempt for the corrupt officers. ;Series 3 Episodes All episodes were broadcast in 1976 on ITV, Mondays at 21:00. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%; margin:auto; background:#FFFFFF;\\" - ! style=\\"background-color: #dbe9f4; color:#000; text-align: right;\\"Ep.

The following episodes were shot in 1976: Selected Target, In from the Cold, Taste of Fear, Bad Apple, May, Down to You, Brother!, Payoff and On the Run. Series 4 There was a two-year gap between the third and fourth series while the team made two full-length feature films (Sweeney! and Sweeney 2) to cash-in on the show's popularity. For the fourth series there were several changes, including a different title sequence and DCI Haskins being absent from a number of episodes. The final series has been criticised as the weakest. This decline in quality led John Thaw and Dennis Waterman to the realisation that the show was in danger of running out of steam, and to take the decision to end it while it was still at the peak of its popularity. Notable episodes include \\"Nightmare\\", which features a slightly experimental dream sequence as part of the plot. This is also the episode with the highest number of deaths, and features another then-contemporary plot of two ex-IRA men committing a major crime in order to buy their way back into the organisation. \\"Bait\\" featured a performance by George Sewell, who had starred in the Euston Films-produced episodes of an earlier police series, Special Branch; earlier still he had featured in the film Get Carter, which was a major influence on The Sweeney, and whose main character, Jack Carter, may have been the inspiration for the names of the two main Sweeney characters. \\"Hearts and Minds\\", the last episode to be filmed, featured the comedians Morecambe and Wise, and was a quid pro quo for the appearance of Waterman and Thaw in a sketch in the 1976 Morecambe and Wise Christmas show on the BBC. The final broadcast episode, \\"Jack or Knave?\\", which aired on 28 December 1978, saw an ambiguous ending, with the main character, Jack Regan, temporarily locked up after being implicated in a corruption scandal, then finally being exonerated. He then announces that he's had it with the Squad, and the series ends with him resigning in disgust, but it's left open as to whether he would be persuaded to change his mind. ;Series 4 Episodes All episodes were broadcast in 1978 on ITV, Thursdays at 21:00. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%; margin:auto; background:#FFFFFF;\\" - ! style=\\"background-color: #dbe9f4; color:#000; text-align: right;\\"Ep.

Film adaptations The cinema spin-offs of The Sweeney feature the same actors and characters. The two films have levels of swearing, violence, sex and nudity that would not have been possible on television at the time. In Sweeney! (1977), Regan and Carter become involved in a plot based on the Profumo affair. British actor Barry Foster features as an Americanised version of Stephen Ward. Made in 1976, the film appears to be set in the then near- future, indicated by the line \\"The same damned speech you made in 1978\\"; also visible on a wall in the scene where the OPEC delegates meet is a logo displaying \\"1979\\". In Sweeney 2 (1978), Carter and Regan eventually find themselves going to the island of Malta in order to track down a group of particularly violent armed robbers who have been committing bank and payroll robberies all over London and kill anybody that gets in their way, even members of their own gang, Regan and Carter were assigned the case by their recently convicted chief inspector as his last order, as he is about to be charged with corruption. In The Sweeney (2012) the setting moved to the present day, with Regan being played by Ray Winstone, Carter by Ben Drew and Haskins by Damian Lewis. Books Nine books were written and released in 1977 published by Futura Publications Ltd. *The SweeneyBook review, trashfiction.co.uk *Regan and the Manhattan File *Regan and the Deal of the Century *Regan and the Lebanese Shipment *Regan and the Human Pipeline *Regan and the Bent Stripper *Regan and the Snout Who Cried Wolf *Regan and the Venetian Virgin *Regan and the High Rollers The first three books were written by Ian Kennedy Martin, the rest by Joe Balham. The plots of the books are not taken from any of the television episodes; overall, the tone of the books differs somewhat from the television series in that Regan is usually depicted as working alone, and his relationship with Carter is distinctly unfriendly. Popular culture *The repeat of the episode \\"Selected Target\\" on 21 December 1978 had the highest viewing figure of the series with 19.05 million people watching. This coincided with a 24-hour strike at the BBC. *In series 1 to 3, the main characters' cars were a Ford Consul GT 3.0 litre V6 (often mistaken for a Granada Mk1), Granada GXL Mk1, Ford Granada S Mk1 and a Cortina Mk3. In series 4, a late Mk1 Ford Granada Ghia is used as well as the updated Granada Mk2 and Cortina Mk4. *Dennis Waterman was cast after his performance in the Special Branch episode \\"Stand and Deliver\\". In the same episode, Stephanie Turner (who played his wife in The Sweeney) played his sister. Later, Turner had the lead role in her own police series, Juliet Bravo. *The Sweeney is mentioned in the songs Wow! by Kate Bush and Cool for Cats by Squeeze. *In the orange-tinted photographs that are shown in the closing credits for Series 1‚Äì3, an enlarged set of fingerprints is displayed on a board behind Detective Chief Inspector Haskins. *A red Fiat 850 coup√© makes a cameo appearance in many episodes: typically, it's parked at the side of the road as the action takes place around it. One theory is that the car belonged to a crew member who tried to include it as an in-joke in as many episodes as possible. *Reference is made to The Sweeney in the Black Books episode \\"The Blackout\\". *Regan and Carter appear briefly as part of a stakeout operation in one of the novelizations of the TV series The Professionals. *Scotland Yard's real Flying Squad lost an important surveillance technique when The Sweeney exposed their use of the roadside tents erected by telephone engineers, who would place them over open manholes in the street to protect them from the weather. These tents are frequently shown in the series as hideaways for keeping a covert eye on suspects. *A two-part 1998 installment of Diagnosis: Murder, \\"Obsession\\", features lead villains named Carter Sweeney and Regan Sweeney. *The creators of the show Life on Mars and its sequel, Ashes to Ashes, have often stated that The Sweeney was a big influence on both programmes. *To date, only one episode of The Sweeney has been shown on the BBC. It was shown on 31 May 1993 as part of the \\"Cops On The Box\\" segment of BBC Two's \\"Crime And Punishment\\" season.https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1993-05-31#at-18.55 The episode broadcast was \\"Supersnout\\". It was introduced by Shaw Taylor, better known for his Police 5 series on ITV. ParodiesDetectives on the edge of a nervous breakdown The 1993 Comic Strip film Detectives on the Edge of a Nervous Breakdown features a character introduced as \\"Shouting George from The Weeny\\" (played by Jim Broadbent). Comics In 1977 and 1978, publishers Brown Watson (who specialised in annuals based on TV series) published two editions of The Sweeney Annual featuring a mix of comic strips (some with art by Brian Lewis) and illustrated text stories, interspersed with occasional features on the TV series, articles about policing, puzzles and (in the 1978 annual) an interview with John Thaw and Dennis Waterman. In the early 1980s, the comic Jackpot featured a strip called \\"The Teeny Sweeney\\" which was originally drawn by J. Edward Oliver. A trio of schoolboys played at being plain-clothes policemen, with two of them looking like little versions of Regan and Carter. They even had \\"Flying Squad\\" written on the side of their cartie. Their attempts at being helpful, however, almost always ended in disaster. TV ad A TV ad for the Nissan Almera car in the late 1990s had two characters similar to Carter and Regan racing through London to deal with a \\"bank job\\". A suspicious group of men have entered a bank dressed as painters. As \\"Carter\\" races the car through the streets, \\"Regan\\" keeps bellowing at him and others to \\"Shut it!\\" At one stage, \\"Regan\\" shouts \\"Mark it!\\", which is slang for following a suspect, but in this case, means \\"market\\" as \\"Carter\\" drives erratically through a market place. \\"Carter\\" tells \\"Regan\\" to stop shouting, to which \\"Regan\\" barks the reply \\"I can't!\\". When they burst into the bank, it turns out that the men are genuine painters and that \\"Regan\\", their guv (or boss), is there to tell them that they have the wrong sort of white paint(!) \\"Carter\\" says, \\"Think we'd better go back to the yard, guv, and get some more.\\" \\"Shut up!\\" One of the painters talks in a squeaky- like voice and is called \\"Squealer\\", which is slang for informant. DVD and CD releases The complete series of The Sweeney was released by Network on 14 DVDs in 2005 which did not feature the pilot episode or the two films released after the series ended . The pilot episode \\"Regan\\" was also released on DVD in November 2005. Both films, Sweeney! and Sweeney 2 have also been released on DVD.

Biosphere Preserves are created on the base of nature preserves or national parks including to their composition territories and objects of other categories of nature-preserving fund and other lands as well as including in the established order the World Network of Biosphere Reserves in the UNESCO framework \\"Man and the Biosphere Programme\\". The focal point in Poland for the Biosphere Reserves is the Polish Academy of Sciences (PAS), Institute of Geography and Spatial Organisation. Reserves There are currently ten such reserves in Poland, including trans-boundary reserves shared between Poland and neighboring countries. * (Reserve POL 01) Babia G√≥ra, Lesser Poland Voivodeship, , designated 1976, extended in 2001 The reserve is located on the border with Slovakia in the Western Beskidy Mountains. Babia G√≥ra is the second highest massif () in Poland and forms part of the watershed boundary between the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea basins. There are four environments that occur as the altitude increases. The forest belt is divided into a lower belt (up to ), consisting of forests of European beech (Fagus sylvatica), silver fir (Abies alba) and Carpathian spruce (Picea abies), and the upper belt (up to ) consisting of Carpathian spruce forest. Above the forest is the subalpine belt (up to ) with dwarf mountain pine (Pinetum mughi) and low-growth European blueberry (Vaccinium myrtillus). At the highest slopes is the alpine grassland belt (up to ) consisting of lichen- covered siliceous bedrock with tussock-based grasses like (Festuca supina) and (Avenella flexuosa). * (Reserve POL 02) Bia≈Çowie≈ºa Forest, Podlaskie Voivodeship, , designated 1976 The reserve, in northeastern Poland, lies adjacent to the Belovezhskaya Pushcha Biosphere Reserve in Belarus. The forest complex, the last and largest remaining mixed deciduous primeval forest on the North European Plain, is situated in the transition between the hemiboreal and continental climate areas. The forest is composed of a mosaic of diverse communities, principally composed of grey willow (Salix cinerea), European hornbeam (Carpinus betulus), arctic dwarf birch (Betula humilis) English oak (Quercus robur), small-leaved lime (Tilia cordata), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), Norway spruce (Picea abies), which reaches its southern limits in the northern hemisphere here, and sessile oak (Quercus petraea), which reaches its northeastern limit here. * (Reserve POL 03) ≈Åuknajno Lake, Warmian- Masurian Voivodeship, , designated 1976 The reserve is a glacial lake typical of those located in the Masurian Lake District with an area of , and a maximum depth of . The lake is connected with nearby Sniardwy Lake by a channel. The site is a breeding ground for water birds such as grebes, water rail (Rallus aquaticus), moorhen, grey heron (Ardea cinerea), bearded reedling (Panurus biarmicus), white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla), osprey (Pandion haliaetus), red kite, great cormorant and black tern (Chlidonias niger). The lake has been a protected location since 1937 as a habitat of the mute swan (Cygnus olor), as every year there are a dozen to tens of dozens of nesting pairs, and during moulting they arrive in numbers reaching up to 2,000 birds.

The coastal aeolian processes have produced some of the most extensive and active mobile sand dunes, which can reach high, on the Baltic Sea. Coastal erosion and other geological processes lead to the creation of sand-bars, forming brackish lakes and bogs. The area consists of a series of vegetation zones going from the sand communities of the coastline towards the forests of the mainland. The forest includes beech (Fagus sylvatica), birch (Betula pubescens), alder (Alnus glutinosa), pine and oak. It is an important way station for migrating waderbirds and waterbirds such as geese, ducks and swans. The white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) and other birds nest at the site. * (Reserve POL- SLO-UKR 01) East Carpathian, Subcarpathian Voivodeship, in Poland, designated 1992 and extended 1998, Joint with Slovakia and Ukraine The reserve is located in the Bieszczady Mountains on the border with Slovakia and Ukraine. There are four distinct altitude-dependent vegetation ecosystems in the mountains starting with beech forest (Fagetum sylvaticae), followed by mixed forests of beech and silver fir (Abies alba), forested areas of green alder (Alnetum viridis), and finally a belt of treeless poloniny, a subalpine meadows dominated by grasses. Over 100 species of birds live in the area such as the black stork (Ciconia nigra) and the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos). * (Reserve POL 05) Kampinos Forest, Masovian Voivodeship, , designated 2000 The reserve is located on the North European Plain, north-east of Warsaw, parallel to the Vistula River and is characterized by a high diversity of lowland habitats with dune belts separated by swamp areas and a mixture of forest types. The forests are principally composed of a mixture of grey willow (Salix cinerea), European hornbeam (Carpinus betulus), arctic dwarf birch (Betula humilis) English oak (Quercus robur), small-leaved lime (Tilia cordata) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). * (Reserve CZE-POL 01) Karkonosze, Subcarpathian Voivodeship, in Poland, designated 1992, Joint with Slovakia The reserve is part of the Western Sudetes mountains stretching from south-central Poland along the northern border of the Czech Republic to eastern Germany. The mountains are located at the watershed dividing the Baltic Sea and North Sea basins. The area is known for its high biodiversity in four altitudinal vegetation belts, from submontane to alpine. The river valleys and lower layers form the sub-montane zone made up of forests of European beech (Fagus sylvatica), silver fir (Abies alba) and Carpathian spruce (Picea Abies). The higher parts form the montane vegetation zone characterized by forested areas of Carpathian spruce (Picea Abies). Above is the subalpine zone, which is marked by dwarf mountain pine (Pinus mugo), mat-grass meadows and subarctic highmoors. There are three subapline bogs that support an extensive algal community important for migratory birds and raptors. The alpine vegetation zone, is characterized by large rocky deserts with herbaceous perennials such as Carici (rigidae)-Nardetum and Festucetum supinae. * (Reserve POL-SLO 01) Tatra Mountains, Subcarpathian Voivodeship, in Poland, designated 1992, Joint with Slovakia The reserve covers areas on each side of the border between Poland and Slovakia. The area contains a number of natural features such as a dwarf pine belt, alpine meadows, lakes and rocky peaks. The area consists of temperate broadleaf forests or woodlands made up of mixed beech (Fagus sylvatica) forest with fir (Abies alba) and sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus). Higher up in the mountains this transitions to forests of silver fir (Abies alba) and Carpathian spruce (Picea Abies) until the timber line (). Above the forest is the subalpine zone () with dwarf mountain pine (Pinetum mughi), Sorbus aucuparia and Betula carpatica. The alpine zone consists of grasses and low-growth herbaceous groundcover. * West Polesie, Lublin Voivodeship, in Poland, designated 2002 and extended 2012, Joint with Belarus and Ukraine The reserve comprises a vast open lowland landscape with a mosaic of swamps, moors, lakes, rivers and forests located between the basins of the Bug and Wieprz rivers. The site is part of the European Ecological Corridor of the Bug River. The location supports bird species including raptors such as lesser spotted eagle (Aquila pomarina), hen harrier (Circus cyaneus) and Montagu's harrier (Circus pygargus) and birds such as aquatic warbler (Acrocephalus paludicola), marsh sandpiper (Tringa stagnatilis) and Eurasian cranes (Grus grus). The area is considered to be an important crossing point for migratory birds. The north-south flyways and east-west flyways of birds meet in the region. The areas consists of boreal Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) forests, black alder (Alnus glutinosa) wetland forests, meadows and peatbog (raised bog, transitional bog and fen) ecosystems. * (Reserve POL 07) Tuchola Forest, Pomeranian Voivodeship, , designated 2010 The reserve covers one of the largest forests in Poland, containing mainly Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). The landforms of the area were sculpted by a glacier that retreated at the end of the last glacial age creating characteristically long ribbon lakes. Additionally there are large clusters of inland sand dunes. There are extensive areas of peat bogs formed as a result of the overgrowing of the shallower lakes. A number of species of birds live in the area such as the black stork (Ciconia nigra), black grouse (Tetrao tetrix), wood grouse (Tetrao urogallus) and peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus).

County SWA Greenway Trail Paper wasps are vespid wasps that gather fibers from dead wood and plant stems, which they mix with saliva, and use to construct nests made of gray or brown papery material. Some types of paper wasps are also sometimes called umbrella wasps, due to the distinctive design of their nests.\\"Paper Wasp\\" Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2006.  Species  The name \\"paper wasps\\" typically refers to members of the vespid subfamily Polistinae, though it often colloquially includes members of the subfamilies Vespinae (hornets and yellowjackets) and Stenogastrinae, which also make nests out of paper. Twenty- two species of Polistes paper wasps have been identified in North America and approximately 300 species have been identified worldwide. The most common paper wasp in Europe is Polistes dominula. The Old World tribe Ropalidiini contains another 300 species, and the Neotropical tribes Epiponini and Mischocyttarini each contain over 250 more, so the total number of true paper wasps worldwide is about 1100 species, almost half of which can be found in the neotropics.  Nests  Polistes dominula on part of a large nest, in California The nests of most true paper wasps are characterized by having open combs with cells for brood rearing, and a 'petiole', or constricted stalk, that anchors the nest.Lyon, W.F. and G.S. Wegner (1991). Paper Wasps and Hornets Ohio State University Extension Fact Sheet: Entomology Paper wasps secrete a chemical which repels ants, which they spread around the base of the anchor to prevent the loss of eggs or brood. Most social wasps of the family Vespidae make nests from paper, but some stenogastrine species, such as Liostenogaster flavolineata, use mud. A small group of eusocial crabronid wasps, of the genus Microstigmus (the only eusocial wasps outside the family Vespidae), also constructs nests out of chewed plant fibers, though the nest consistency is quite different from those of true paper wasps, due to the absence of wood fibers, and the use of silk extruded by female wasps to bind the fibers. Nests can be found in sheltered areas, such as the eaves of a house, the branches of a tree, on the end of an open pipe, or on an old clothesline. Some species, such as Ropalidia romandi, will vary their nest architecture depending on where they build their nest. Three species of Polistes are obligate social parasites, and have lost the ability to build their own nests, and are sometimes referred to as \\"cuckoo paper wasps\\". They rely on the nests of their hosts to raise their brood.Dapporto L, Cervo R, Sledge MF, Turillazzi S (2004) \\"Rank integration in dominance hierarchies of host colonies by the paper wasp social parasite Polistes sulcifer (Hymenoptera, Vespidae)\\". J Insect Physiol 50 :217‚Äì223 A few hornets and yellowjackets are also brood parasites (e.g., Vespula austriaca).  Behavior  Unlike yellowjackets and hornets, which can be very aggressive, polistine paper wasps will generally only attack if they themselves or their nest are threatened.Felixson, Carol (undated). \\"Paper wasps work together.\\" Retrieved 2009-04-26 from \\"L.A. Times\\" at http://www.latimes.com/features/kids/readingroom/la-et- kidcal5mar06,1,7872696.story. Since their territoriality can lead to attacks on people, and because their stings are quite painful and can produce a potentially fatal anaphylactic reaction in some individuals, nests in human- inhabited areas may present an unacceptable hazard.Drees, B.M. and John Jackman (1999). Field Guide to Texas Insects. Gulf Publishing Company, Houston, Texas. Excerpt available at: Texas Cooperative extension A study conducted on European paper wasps (Polistes dominula) concluded that wasps with brighter aposematic colors are more venomous, because they have larger poison glands, and offer a stronger warning signal to organisms threatening the nest.

Paper wasps feed on nectar and other insects, including caterpillars, flies, and beetle larvae. Because they are a known pollinator and feed on known garden pests, paper wasps are often considered to be beneficial by gardeners.

Peace had been achieved on 23 September by the intervention of the external powers that pushed the two nations to cease fire, afraid the conflict could escalate and draw in other powers. The war between India and Pakistan in 1965 was an escalation of the small scale and irregular fighting from April 1965 to September 1965 between both countries. It was over control of the resources and population of the state of Jammu and Kashmir, a sore point between both countries ever since Partition in 1947. Background The meeting was held in Tashkent in the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic, Soviet Union (now Uzbekistan) from 4 to 10 January 1966 to try to create a more permanent settlement. The Soviets, represented by Premier Alexei Kosygin, moderated between Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri and Pakistani President Muhammad Ayub Khan. The Tashkent Conference, under United Nations, American and Soviet pressure, compelled India and Pakistan to abide by their previous treaty obligations and accept the status quo ante bellum by returning the captured regions to each other to the 1949 ceasefire line in Kashmir. Declaration The conference was viewed as a great success, and a declaration was released that was hoped to be a framework for lasting peace by stating that Indian and Pakistani forces would pull back to their pre-conflict positions, their pre-August lines, no later than 25 February 1966; neither nation would not interfere in each other's internal affairs; economic and diplomatic relations would be restored; there would be an orderly transfer of prisoners of war and both leaders would work towards improving bilateral relations. Aftermath The agreement was criticized in India because it did not contain a no-war pact or any renunciation of guerrilla warfare in Kashmir. After signing the agreement, Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri died mysteriously in Tashkent. Shastri's sudden death has led to persistent conspiracy theories that he was poisoned. The Indian government has refused to declassify a report on his death claiming that this could harm foreign relations, cause disruption in the country and a breach of parliamentary privileges. In accordance with the Tashkent Declaration, talks at the ministerial level were held on 1 and 2 March 1966. Despite the fact that these talks were unproductive, diplomatic exchange continued throughout the spring and summer. Results weren‚Äôt achieved out of these talks, as there was a difference of opinion over the Kashmir issue. News of the Tashkent Declaration shocked the people of Pakistan who were expecting more concessions from India than they got. Things further worsened as Ayub Khan refused to comment and went into seclusion instead of announcing the reasons for signing the agreement. Demonstrations and riots erupted at various places throughout Pakistan. In order to dispel the anger and misgivings of the people, Ayub Khan decided to lay the matter before the people by addressing the nation on 14 January 1966. It was the difference over Tashkent Declaration, which eventually led to the removal of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto from Ayub‚Äôs government, who later on launched his own party, called the Pakistan People‚Äôs Party. Although Ayub Khan was able to satisfy the misgivings of the people, the Tashkent Declaration greatly damaged his image and was one of the factors that led to his downfall.The falling out at Tashkent (1966) between Ayub Khan and Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto The Friday Times (newspaper), Updated 4 November 2016, Retrieved 24 July 2020 See also *Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 *Shimla Agreement ReferencesExternal links *Full text of Tashkent Declaration , UN Peacemaker *All peace agreement for India, UN Peacemaker *All peace agreements for Pakistan, UN Peacemaker Category:History of the Republic of India Category:Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 Category:Foreign relations of the Soviet Union Category:Pakistan‚ÄìSoviet Union relations Category:India‚ÄìSoviet Union relations Category:1966 in the Soviet Union Category:Diplomatic conferences in the Soviet Union Category:Peace treaties of Pakistan Declaration Category:1966 in India Category:Peace treaties of India Category:Treaties concluded in 1966 Category:1966 in Pakistan Category:Treaties of India Category:Shastri administration Category:India‚ÄìPakistan treaties Category:India‚ÄìPakistan military relations ","title":"Tashkent Declaration"},{"id":"429562","text":"Babia hora memorial of John Paul II Babia G√≥ra (in Polish), or Babia hora (in Slovak), literally Old Wives' or Witches' Mountain, is a massif situated on the border between Poland and Slovakia in the Western Beskid Mountains. The name is also applied to the culmination of the massif, Diablak (\\"Devil's Peak\\"), which is also the highest peak of this part of the Carpathian Mountains, at above sea level. History Babia G√≥ra was first mentioned in the 15th century chronicle of Jan D≈Çugosz. It was first plotted on a map in 1558. Until the end of the 17th century most of the available information on the mountain came from folklore. According to folk tales, the mountain was the location of the witches' sabbath. The first known ascent was made in 1782 by the court astronomer of King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski, Jowin Fryderyk Bo≈Ñcza Bystrzycki. The period of scientific investigations began in the second half of the 19th century. Nature Lichen-covered stone slabs on the top Gentle from the south, steep from the north, Babia G√≥ra is home to bear, lynx, wolf and other species; as well as alpine flora endemic at this altitude. The first attempts to protect the area were made in the 1930s. In 1933 the Nature Reserve of Babia G√≥ra was established on the Polish side. Later, in 1954, the Babia G√≥ra National Park (Babiog√≥rski Park Narodowy) was established with an area of 17.04 km¬≤. In 1976 it became one of the first Biosphere Reserves in the world. For a long time Babia G√≥ra National Park was the smallest of the Polish national parks. In 1997 it was enlarged to 33.92 km¬≤ and a buffer zone was created of 84.37 km¬≤. Within the park, 10.62 km¬≤ is under strict protection. There are calls for strengthening of cross-border cooperation with Slovakia to better protect the fragile environment of the mountain.  Climate Babia G√≥ra is sometimes nicknamed Matka Niepog√≥d (Mother of Bad Weather). Located far from any other mountains of similar height that would provide a natural barrier, it is very susceptible to weather changes. Snow can remain on the northern slopes and in narrow gorges until summer. In May 2016, a climber was killed by lightning while attempting to descend the mountain when a thunderstorm approached.https://www.yahoo.com/news/children-hurt- lightning-strikes-paris-park-german-football-180233907.html Tourism Tourism in the region of Babia G√≥ra is quite a recent phenomenon. The first tourists in the 19th century were mainly intellectuals from nearby Cracow. Since then the village of Zawoja has developed into an important mountain resort. However, skiing facilities are very restricted due to the protected status of the area. Although generally relatively easy to climb, Babia G√≥ra can be reached by a more difficult yellow route called Perƒá Akademik√≥w (Academics' Path). It was marked out by university scholars to examine the mountain's unique flora. Today, despite (or perhaps because of) steep climbs, chains and metal steps fixed to the rocks along sections of the trail, it is very popular with tourists.

It sits within the borough of Charnwood local authority, where Shepshed is the second biggest settlement after the town of Loughborough. The town is twinned with the Parisian suburb of Domont. History=Origins The town originally grew as a centre for the wool trade. However, since the construction of the M1 motorway nearby, it has become a dormitory town for Loughborough, Leicester, Derby and Nottingham. It was officially a village until recently and claimed to be Britain's largest, and also claimed to have the highest number of pubs per head of population in the country. As of 2019, however, it is home to only ten public houses. There has been much controversy about the origin of the name of the town. The earliest form is Scepeshefde Regis as mentioned in the Domesday Book, which means \\"(King's) hill where sheep graze\\", but since then there have been many changes until the present form, Shepshed, was adopted in 1888. The addition of the suffix 'Regis' signifies that there was once a royal lodge in the area. Very little information about the settlement on the site of Shepshed appears before the Domesday Book but the name is certainly Anglo- Saxon: local history books claim that Shepshed has two of the oldest roads in the country, Ring Fence and Sullington Road, the latter being an ancient British track named after the goddess Solina. Anglo-Saxon Shepshed cannot have been much more than a hamlet in a large district of forest. However, succeeding centuries provide an abundance of historical material. The prosperity of medieval Shepshed was based on the wool industry and \\"Well Yard\\" on Forest Street may well be a corruption of \\"Wool Yard\\", where Bradford wool merchants congregated to buy from local inhabitants. In addition, there is considerable evidence to suggest that a weekly market was held, at least until the 14th century. Parish Church of St Botolph The 11th century Parish church of St Botolph (the westernmost parish church in England to bear the name) and its land the Oakley Wood was originally given to Odo of Bayeux, half-brother of William the Conqueror, after the Norman conquest in 1066. The ownership of the estate reverted to the Crown a number of times including in 1534. A wood carving exists in the church depicting a visit of Queen Elizabeth I though it is at present unclear if the Queen ever came to Shepshed itself, but if she did, it would have been the farthest north that she travelled in the country. The older part of the town is still centred on the church. The church's original patronage came from Leicester Abbey. Between 1699 and 1856, however, the patrons were the Phillips family of Garendon Hall. This family has been Lords of the Manor since its purchase by Sir Ambrose Phillips (1637‚Äì1691) in 1683. Garendon Hall (demolished 1964The de Lilse downsize ‚Äì Quenby Hall for sale 27 May 2012, accessed 31 December 2012) was built on the site of Garendon Abbey, a prominent Cistercian house which was founded in 1133 by Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester and survived until its dissolution by Henry VIII in 1536. Garendon Abbey, whose economy was largely based on sheep farming, was one of the most important possessor of granges in Leicestershire. 18th and 19th centuries The 18th century saw the enclosure of the common lands around Shepshed. There had been enclosures in the 15th and 16th centuries, but towards the end of the 18th century the last remaining common land, approximately 2,000 acres (8 km¬≤), was enclosed and divided among the principal commoners of the village. Much destruction was caused in the town when in 1753, 85 bays of buildings were destroyed by fire which had happened at what is now known as Hallcroft named after the school which had been burnt down in the fire. There were many changes during the 19th century. Shepshed was briefly linked by canal to Loughborough, and to the coalmines of West Leicestershire when the Charnwood Forest Canal was opened in 1798, but success was only short lived. By 1804 the canal had proved an uneconomic venture and was abandoned, though modern roads and footpaths still follow the course it took through Shepshed.Williams, B. C. J. (1994) An Exploration of the Leicester Navigation (celebrating 1794‚Äì1994). Sileby: Leicester Navigation 200 Group The Charnwood Forest Railway (nicknamed the Bluebell Line on account of the proliferation of the flower) was opened in 1883,Franks, D. L., (1975) The Ashby and Nuneaton Joint Railway together with the Charnwood Forest Railway Sheffield: Turntable Publications but regular passenger services ceased in 1931. However, the goods service did not close until 1963. Shepshed railway station no longer stands though part of the old line forms a bridleway between the town and Thringstone including the now redundant viaduct at Grace Dieu. Shepshed had a riot on election day in 1868, two hundred policemen were brought into the village the next day and 33 arrests were made (13 of the rioters being sentenced to 3 months imprisonment). Upon release they were met at the boundary by the local brass band and feted as heroes. On 31 December 1915 a German Zeppelin was seen over Shepshed. Education Hind Leys Community College educates pupils from 14 to 19, in the town, and includes pupils not only from Shepshed, but also from local towns and villages such as Loughborough, Kegworth, Belton, Castle Donington, Diseworth, Long Whatton and Tonge. Pupils aged from 10 to 14 attend the recently rebuilt Shepshed High School. There are four primary schools in the town, and three of these feed into Shepshed High School; Oxley, St Botolph's and Newcroft. The final primary school, St Winefride's, caters for Roman Catholic pupils until the age of 11, after which most of them transfer to De Lisle College 11‚Äì19 school in Loughborough. Transport Shepshed is located adjacent to junction 23 of the M1 motorway. The closest railway station is Loughborough railway station. East Midlands Airport is also less than 5 miles away.  Buses  Shepshed is serviced by Arriva Midlands services 16/16A and 126/127 with frequent buses into Loughborough and Coalville and Paul S Winson Coaches route 129 between Loughborough and Ashby.{https://www.arrivabus.co.uk/midlands} Skylink Nottingham-Coalville operated by trentbarton also links the village with East Midlands Airport and Nottingham.{https://www.trentbarton.co.uk/skylink} Sport The town is represented in the Midland Football League by Shepshed Dynamo F.C., who play at the Dovecote Stadium on Butthole Lane. Ingles FC (formed in 1972) also have two football teams. The 1st team ground shares with Shepshed Dynamo at the Dovecote stadium while the reserves are based at Little Haw Lane.

The major Rugby side in the town is Shepshed RFC. who train and play on the Hind Leys Campus. Founded in 1985, they won the LRU Division 4 in 2014 and the LRU Division 3 in 2015.http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/shepshedrfc Shepshed Fire Station Shepshed has a retained fire station, part of Leicestershire and Rutland Fire and Rescue Service, serving the town from the fire station on Charnwood Road. The station, which opened in 2002, replaced the previous station built on the same site in 1951http://www.leicestershire- fire.gov.uk/your-fire-service/who-we-are/locations-and-contacts/shepshed-fire- rescue-station and was initially opened as a combined Police and Fire Station.

His full posthumous name means \\"Entombed in Gukgangsang, Broad Expander of Domain, Peacemaker, Supreme King\\", sometimes abbreviated to Hotaewang. His era name is Yeongnak and he is occasionally recorded as Yeongnak Taewang (\\"Supreme King\\" or \\"Emperor\\" Yeongnak). Gwanggaeto's imperial reign title meant that Goguryeo was on equal standing as an empire with the imperial dynasties in China. Under Gwanggaeto, Goguryeo began a golden age, becoming a powerful empire and one of the great powers in East Asia. Gwanggaeto made enormous advances and conquests into: Western Manchuria against Khitan tribes; Inner Mongolia and the Maritime Province of Russia against numerous nations and tribes; and the Han River valley in central Korea to control over two-thirds of the Korean peninsula. In regard to the Korean peninsula, Gwanggaeto defeated Baekje, the then most powerful of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, in 396, capturing the capital city of Wiryeseong in present-day Seoul. In 399, Silla, the southeastern kingdom of Korea, sought aid from Goguryeo due to incursions by Baekje troops and their Wa allies from the Japanese archipelago. Gwanggaeto dispatched 50,000 expeditionary troops, crushing his enemies and securing Silla as a de facto protectorate; he thus subdued the other Korean kingdoms and achieved a loose unification of the Korean peninsula under Goguryeo. In his western campaigns, he defeated the Xianbei of the Later Yan empire and conquered the Liaodong peninsula, regaining the ancient domain of Gojoseon. Gwanggaeto's accomplishments are recorded on the Gwanggaeto Stele, erected in 414 at the supposed site of his tomb in Ji'an along the present-day China‚ÄìNorth Korea border. Constructed by his son and successor Jangsu, the monument to Gwanggaeto the Great is the largest engraved stele in the world. Birth and background At the time of Gwanggaeto's birth, Goguryeo was not as powerful as it once had been. In 371, three years prior to Gwanggaeto's birth, the rival Korean kingdom of Baekje, under the great leadership of Geunchogo, soundly defeated Goguryeo, slaying the monarch Gogukwon and sacking Pyongyang. Baekje became one of the dominant powers in East Asia. Baekje's influence was not limited to the Korean peninsula, but extended across the sea to Liaoxi and Shandong in China, taking advantage of the weakened state of Former Qin, and Kyushu in the Japanese archipelago. Goguryeo was inclined to avoid conflicts with its ominous neighbor, while cultivating constructive relations with the Former Qin, the Xianbei, and the Rouran, in order to defend itself from future invasions and to bide time to reshape its legal structure and to initiate military reforms. Gogukwon's successor, Sosurim, adopted a foreign policy of appeasement and reconciliation with Baekje, and concentrated on domestic policies to spread Buddhism throughout Goguryeo's social and political systems. Furthermore, due to the defeats that Goguryeo had suffered at the hands of the proto-Mongol Xianbei and Baekje, Sosurim instituted military reforms aimed at preventing such defeats in the future. Sosurim's internal arrangements laid the groundwork for Gwanggaeto's expansion. Sosurim's successor, Gogukyang, invaded Later Yan, the successor state of Former Yan, in 385 and Baekje in 386. Reign=Rise to power and campaigns against Baekje Gwanggaeto succeeded his father, Gogukyang, upon Gogukyang's death in 391. Upon Gwanggaeto's coronation, Gwanggaeto adopted the era name Yeongnak (Eternal Rejoicing) and the title Taewang (Supreme King), which was equivalent to \\"emperor\\", affirming that he was an equal to the Imperial rulers of China. In 392, Gwanggaeto led an attack on Baekje with 40,000 troops, capturing 10 walled cities. In response, Asin, the monarch of Baekje, launched a counterattack on Goguryeo in 393 but was defeated. Despite the ongoing war, during 393, Gwanggaeto established 9 Buddhist temples in Pyongyang. Asin invaded Goguryeo once more in 394, but was defeated again. After suffering multiple defeats against Goguryeo, Baekje's political stability began to crumble. In 395, Baekje was defeated once more by Goguryeo and was pushed south to its capital of Wiryeseong on the Han River. In the following year, in 396, Gwanggaeto led an assault on Wiryeseong by land and sea, using the Han River, and triumphed over Baekje. Gwanggaeto captured the Baekje capital and the defeated Asin submitted to him,Jeon ho-tae, „ÄàKoguryo, the origin of Korean power & pride„Äâ, Dongbuka History Foundation, 2007. p.137 surrendering a prince and 10 government ministers. Goguryeo at zenith under Gwanggaeto and Jangsu. Northern conquests In 395, while his campaign against Baekje was ongoing to the south, Gwanggaeto made an excursion to invade the Khitan Baili clan to the west on the Liao River, destroying 3 tribes and 600 to 700 camps. In 398, Gwanggaeto conquered the Sushen people to the northeast, who were Tungusic ancestors of the Jurchens and Manchus. In 400, while Gwanggaeto was occupied with Baekje, Gaya, and Wa troops in Silla, the Xianbei state of Later Yan, founded by the Murong clan in present-day Liaoning, attacked Goguryeo. Gwanggaeto repulsed the Xianbei troops. In 402, Gwanggaeto retaliated and conquered the prominent fortress called ÂÆøËªçÂüé near the capital of Later Yan. In 405 and again in 406, Later Yan troops attacked Goguryeo fortresses in Liaodong (ÈÅºÊù±Âüé in 405, and Êú®Â∫ïÂüé in 406), but was defeated both times. Gwanggaeto conquered all of Liaodong. By conquering Liaodong, Gwanggaeto recovered the ancient domain of Gojoseon; Goguryeo controlled Liaodong until the mid-late 7th century. In 407, Gwanggaeto dispatched 50,000 troops consisting of infantry and cavalry and won a great victory, completely annihilating the enemy troops and pillaging about 10,000 armors and countless war supplies; the opponent can be interpreted as Later Yan, Baekje, or Wa. In 410, Gwanggaeto attacked Eastern Buyeo to the northeast. Southern campaigns In 400, Silla, another Korean kingdom in the southeast of the Korean peninsula, requested aid from Goguryeo in repelling an allied invasion by Baekje, Gaya, and Wa. Gwanggaeto dispatched 50,000 troops and annihilated the enemy coalition. Thereupon, Gwanggaeto influenced Silla as a suzerain, and Gaya declined and never recovered. In 402, Gwanggaeto returned Prince Silseong, who had resided in Goguryeo as a political hostage since 392, back home to Silla and appointed him as the king of Silla. In 404, Gwanggaeto defeated an attack by the Wa from the Japanese archipelago on the southern border of what was once the Daifang commandery, inflicting enormous casualties on the enemy. Death and legacy Detail of Gwanggaeto Stele Gwanggaeto died of an unknown illness in 413 at the age of 39. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Jangsu, who ruled Goguryeo for 79 years until the age of 98, the longest reign in East Asian history. Gwanggaeto's conquests are said to mark the zenith of Korean history, building and consolidating a great empire in Northeast Asia and uniting the Three Kingdoms of Korea under his influence. Gwanggaeto conquered 64 walled cities and 1,400 villages. Except for the period of 200 years beginning with Jangsu, who would build upon his father's domain, and the golden age of Balhae, Korea never before or since ruled such a vast territory. There is archaeological evidence that Goguryeo's maximum extent lay even further west in present-day Mongolia, based on discoveries of Goguryeo fortress ruins in Mongolia. Gwanggaeto established his own era name, Yeongnak Eternal Rejoicing, proclaiming Goguryeo monarchs equal to their counterparts in the Chinese mainland. Gwanggaeto the Great is one of two rulers of Korea whose names are appended with the title \\"the Great\\", with the other being Sejong the Great of Joseon, who created Hangul the Korean alphabet, to promote literacy among the common people, and made great advances in science. Gwanggaeto is regarded by Koreans as one of the greatest heroes in Korean history, and is often taken as a potent symbol of Korean nationalism. The Gwanggaeto Stele, a 6.39 meter tall monument erected by Jangsu in 414, was rediscovered in the late 19th century. The stele was inscribed with information about Gwanggaeto's reign and achievements, but not all the characters and passages have been preserved. Korean and Japanese scholars disagree on the interpretation in regard to passages on the Wa. The Republic of Korea Navy operates Gwanggaeto the Great-class destroyers, built by Daewoo Heavy Industries and named in honor of the monarch. A prominent statue of Gwanggaeto alongside a replica of the Gwanggaeto Stele were erected in the main street of Guri city in Gyeonggi province.

It is the sequel to 1997's Grand Theft Auto, and the second main instalment of the Grand Theft Auto series. The game focuses on players taking on the role of a criminal as they roam a fictional futuristic city, conducting jobs for various crime syndicates and having free rein to do whatever they wish to achieve their goal. The game's intro is unique for a title in the series, as it involved live-action scenes filmed by Rockstar Games. The game received mixed reviews from critics, though the GBC version fared the worst, but was a modest commercial success. Grand Theft Auto 2 was succeeded by Grand Theft Auto III in October 2001, which started a new era for the series, while the game itself was re-released on Steam in January 2008.  Gameplay  Grand Theft Auto 2 being played at \\"dusk\\" in the Windows version. Like its predecessor Grand Theft Auto, the game focuses on players completing a series of levels, each requiring a set target score being achieved in order to progress to the next stage. Points are awarded from various criminal actions such as destroying cars, selling vehicles, and completing missions for various crime syndicates, with the latter awarding more points than doing simple criminal actions. Unlike its predecessor, Grand Theft Auto 2 is set in an unspecified time period‚Äîconflicting sources suggest anything from \\"three weeks into the future\\", to the year to be 2013, despite in-game references‚Äîand within a retrofuturistic metropolis referred to only as \\"Anywhere, USA\\", with each level focused on a different district of the city. Completing jobs earns points and a multiplier bonus, while failing them earns nothing. Creating chaos from their crimes will cause the player to be wanted by the police who will hound the player to arrest or kill them, with higher wanted levels increasing the level of response used. Being arrested or dying loses the player any equipment they found, and impacts their multiplier bonus. Grand Theft Auto 2 introduced several new features and improvements to the game. Players can now save their game during a playthrough of a level by visiting the church they start at, but must pay a set number of points to do so. Jobs on offer come from three different syndicates‚Äîeach level features two unique syndicates, alongside a third syndicate present in all levels. By doing jobs for a syndicate and successfully completing them, the player gains respect with that syndicate, allowing them to take on tougher jobs with enough respect, but lose it with their chief rivals, locking them out of their jobs and making the syndicate's members hostile to the player. Other improvements include vehicles and pedestrians being more interactive with the game's environment‚Äîsuch as gang members engaging in fights with police‚Äîthe presence of other criminals (such as muggers), a health meter, garages that can modify vehicles with special improvements, a selection of side missions ranging from running a taxi to driving a semi-truck, and groups of 'hidden' packages to find across the level.  GTA 2 ‚Äì The Movie  The game was developed with an eight-minute short film of live-action footage, filmed within New York City. The movie was devised as an introductory sequence for the game, and was made available on Rockstar Games's website. The film focuses on the exploits of a criminal named Claude Speed (played by Scott Maslen), who conducts jobs around Anywhere City for several criminal syndicates, before being killed by an assassin from one of the syndicates for betraying them. The film was based on a screenplay by Dan Houser, and directed by Alex De Rakoff.  Soundtrack  Each area features five radio stations from a pool of eleven, one of which is heard as the player drives most vehicles in-game. Changing radio stations for preference is possible. \\"Head Radio\\" was present in the original Grand Theft Auto, Grand Theft Auto III and Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories. Each gang has its own radio station that transmits within a limited area. Police vehicles, ambulances, fire trucks and tanks had no ability to listen to the radio channels. Instead, the player would hear the radio transmitter of the emergency services. All the music and the ads included in the game are exclusive, following the tradition of previous games. People in charge of the musical content were Craig Conner, Stuart Ross, Paul Scargill, Colin Anderson, Bert Reid and Moving Shadow. Some of these producers would keep their work on subsequent GTA releases. The Game Boy Color version uses some real songs, one of which is a sped up version of Back in Black by AC/DC. The Character Selection theme is an old Brazilian song titled \\"Chega de Saudade\\".  Reception  Grand Theft Auto 2s computer version received a \\"Silver\\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom. The game's PlayStation version received a \\"Platinum\\" sales award (300,000 or more units in the United Kingdom) from ELSPA. Grand Theft Auto 2 was released to mixed reviews. The game's graphics received mixed reactions from critics, who noted that they had barely any difference to the graphics in the original game. IGN's Tal Blevins called them \\"average at best\\", and that the scenery is \\"hard to appreciate\\". Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot said that the \\"graphics look a bit plain.\\" The game's soundtrack received positive feedback, with Jeff Gerstmann calling it a \\"great soundtrack\\", and that it \\"closely [mirrors] the station-style of the original game\\". Tal Blevins of IGN called it \\"one of the best features\\" of the game. Grand Theft Auto 2s gameplay elements received mixed reactions. IGN's Jeremy Dunham said that the gameplay is \\"where the game really takes a punch to the stomach\\", and that it \\"could've been a lot better.\\" Tal Blevins called it \\"simple, but effective.\\" Jeff Gerstmann said that \\"even though the gameplay is largely the same as in the previous GTA, it's still a lot of fun.\\" Edge highlighted the game's story development and inventive missions, stating that Grand Theft Auto 2 \\"manages to draw you deep into the complexities of its world\\". Blake Fischer reviewed the Dreamcast version of the game for Next Generation, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that it is \\"A great idea that, for one reason or another, never really gets into a must-play game.\\"  References Bibliography   External links  * Category:1999 video games Category:Action-adventure games Category:Cyberpunk video games Category:Dreamcast games Category:Freeware games Category:Game Boy Color games Category:Grand Theft Auto Category:Open world video games Category:Organized crime video games Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:Rockstar Games Category:Top-down video games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video game sequels Category:Windows games Category:Video games set in 2013 Category:Video games set in the United States Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Retrofuturistic video games Category:Cancelled Nintendo 64 games ","title":"Grand Theft Auto 2"},{"id":"429581","text":"Tibetan history, as it has been recorded, is particularly focused on the history of Buddhism in Tibet. This is partly due to the pivotal role this religion has played in the development of Tibetan and Mongol cultures and partly because almost all native historians of the country were Buddhist monks. Geographical setting Tibet lies between the core areas of the ancient civilizations of China and India. Extensive mountain ranges to the east of the Tibetan Plateau mark the border with China, and the towering Himalayas of Nepal and India form a barrier between Tibet and India. Tibet is nicknamed \\"the roof of the world\\" or \\"the land of snows\\". Linguists classify the Tibetan language and its dialects as belonging to the Tibeto-Burman languages, the non-Sinitic members of the Sino-Tibetan language family. Prehistory Rishabhanatha, the founder of Jainism attained nirvana near Mount Kailash in Tibet. Some archaeological data suggests archaic humans passed through Tibet at the time India was first inhabited, half a million years ago. Modern humans first inhabited the Tibetan Plateau at least twenty- one thousand years ago. This population was largely replaced around 3000 BC by Neolithic immigrants from northern China. However, there is a \\"partial genetic continuity between the Paleolithic inhabitants and the contemporary Tibetan populations\\". The vast majority of Tibetan maternal mtDNA components can trace their ancestry to both paleolithic and Neolithic during the mid-Holocene. Megalithic monuments dot the Tibetan Plateau and may have been used in ancestor worship. Prehistoric Iron Age hillforts and burial complexes have recently been found on the Tibetan Plateau, but the remote high altitude location makes archaeological research difficult. Early history (c. 500 BC ‚Äì AD 618)=Zhangzhung kingdom (c. 500 BC ‚Äì AD 625) According to Namkhai Norbu some Tibetan historical texts identify the Zhang Zhung culture as a people who migrated from the Amdo region into what is now the region of Guge in western Tibet.Norbu 1989, pp. 127‚Äì128 Zhang Zhung is considered to be the original home of the B√∂n religion.Helmut Hoffman in McKay 2003 vol. 1, pp. 45‚Äì68 By the 1st century BC, a neighboring kingdom arose in the Yarlung Valley, and the Yarlung king, Drigum Tsenpo, attempted to remove the influence of the Zhang Zhung by expelling the Zhang's B√∂n priests from Yarlung.Karmey 2001, p. 66ff He was assassinated and Zhang Zhung continued its dominance of the region until it was annexed by Songtsen Gampo in the 7th century. Tibetan tribes (2nd century AD) In AD 108, \\"the Kiang or Tibetans, who then lived a nomadic life west and south of the Koko-nor, attacked the Chinese posts of Gansu, threatening to cut the Dunhuang road. Liang Kin, at the price of some fierce fighting, held them off.\\" Similar incursions were repelled in AD 168‚Äì169 by the Chinese general Duan Gong. Chinese sources of the same era mentions of a Fu state () of either Qiang or Tibetan ethnicity \\"more than two thousand miles northwest of Shu County\\". Fu state was pronounced as \\"bod\\" or \\"phyva\\" in Archaic Chinese. Whether this polity is the precursor of Tufan is still unknown. First kings of the pre-Imperial Yarlung dynasty (2nd‚Äì6th centuries) The pre-Imperial Yarlung Dynasty rulers are more mythological than factual, and there is insufficient evidence of their definitive existence.Haarh, Erik: Extract from \\"The Yar Lun Dynasty\\", in: The History of Tibet, ed. Alex McKay, Vol. 1, London 2003, p. 147; Richardson, Hugh: The Origin of the Tibetan Kingdom, in: The History of Tibet, ed. Alex McKay, Vol. 1, London 2003, p. 159 (and list of kings p. 166-167). Nyatri Tsenpo is considered by traditional histories to have been the first king of the Yarlung Dynasty, named after the river valley where its capital city was located, circa fifty-five miles south-east from present-day Lhasa. The dates attributed to the first Tibetan king, Nyatri Tsenpo (), vary. Some Tibetan texts give 126 BC, others 414 BC.Norbu 1995, p. 220 Nyatri Tsenpo is said to have descended from a one-footed creature called the Theurang, having webbed fingers and a tongue so large it could cover his face. Due to his terrifying appearance he was feared in his native Puwo and exiled by the B√∂n to Tibet. There he was greeted as a fearsome being, and he became king. The Tibetan kings were said to remain connected to the heavens via a dmu cord (dmu thag) so that rather than dying, they ascended directly to heaven, when their sons achieved their majority.Geoffrey Samuel, Civilized Shamans: Buddhism in Tibetan Societies, Smithsonian Institution Press, Washington 1993 p.441 According to various accounts, king Drigum Tsenpo (Dri-gum-brtsan-po) either challenged his clan heads to a fight,Rolf A.Stein, Tibetan Civilization, Faber, London 1972 pp.48f.Samuel, ibid p.441 or provoked his groom Longam (Lo-ngam) into a duel. During the fight the king's dmu cord was cut, and he was killed. Thereafter Drigum Tsenpo and subsequent kings left corpses and the B√∂n conducted funerary rites.Karmey 2001, p. 66ffHaarh, The Yarlu·πÖ Dynasty. Copenhagen: 1969. In a later myth, first attested in the Ma·πái bka' 'bum, the Tibetan people are the progeny of the union of the monkey Pha Trelgen Changchup Sempa and rock ogress Ma Drag Sinmo. But the monkey was a manifestation of the bodhisattva Chenresig, or Avalokite≈õvara (Tib. Spyan-ras-gzigs) while the ogress in turn incarnated Chenresig's consort Dolma (Tib. 'Grol-ma).Thubten Jigme Norbu, with Colin Turnbull.

The Tibet Journal. Vol. XVI No. 3. Autumn 1991, pp. 52-62. (This article originally appeared in the Tibetan quarterly Bod-ljongs zhib-'jug (No. 1, 1986). Tibetan Empire (618‚Äì842) Historical timeline of Tibet (627‚Äì2013) The Tibetan Empire at its greatest extent between the 780s and the 790s AD The Yarlung kings gradually extended their control, and by the early 6th century most of the Tibetan tribes were under its control, when Namri Songtsen (570?‚Äì618?/629), the 32nd King of Tibet of the Yarlung Dynasty, gained control of all the area around what is now Lhasa by 630, and conquered Zhangzhung. With this extent of power the Yarlung kingdom turned into the Tibetan Empire. The government of Namri Songtsen sent two embassies to China in 608 and 609, marking the appearance of Tibet on the international scene.Forbes, Andrew ; Henley, David (2011). 'The First Tibetan Empire' in: China's Ancient Tea Horse Road. Chiang Mai: Cognoscenti Books. ASIN: B005DQV7Q2 From the 7th century AD Chinese historians referred to Tibet as Tubo (), though four distinct characters were used. The first externally confirmed contact with the Tibetan kingdom in recorded Tibetan history occurred when King Namri L√∂nts√§n (Gnam-ri- slon-rtsan) sent an ambassador to China in the early 7th century.Beckwith, C. Uni. of Indiana Diss., 1977 Traditional Tibetan history preserves a lengthy list of rulers whose exploits become subject to external verification in the Chinese histories by the 7th century. From the 7th to the 11th centuries a series of emperors ruled Tibet (see List of emperors of Tibet) of whom the three most important in later religious tradition were Songtsen Gampo, Trisong Detsen and Ralpacan, \\"the three religious kings\\" (mes-dbon gsum), who were assimilated to the three protectors (rigs-gsum mgon-po), respectively, Avalokite≈õvara, Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´ and VajrapƒÅni. Songtsen Gampo (c. 604‚Äì650) was the first great emperor who expanded Tibet's power beyond Lhasa and the Yarlung Valley, and is traditionally credited with introducing Buddhism to Tibet. Throughout the centuries from the time of the emperor the power of the empire gradually increased over a diverse terrain so that by the reign of the emperor in the opening years of the 9th century, its influence extended as far south as Bengal and as far north as Mongolia. Tibetan records claim that the Pala Empire was conquered and that the Pala emperor Dharmapala submitted to Tibet, though no independent evidence confirms this.Achut Dattatrya Pusalker. 'The History and Culture of the Indian People: The age of imperial Kanauj.-2d ed. Volume 4 of The History and Culture of the Indian People'. Published: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1964 . \\"The Tibetan records claim that some of their rulers, who were contemporaries of Dharmapala and Devapala, conquered the dominions of the Palas, and specifically, refer to Dharamapala as submitting to Tibetan supremacy. This is not, however, corroborated by any independent evidence, and we cannot say how far the claims can be regarded as historically true. It is not unlikely that Tibet exercised some political influence in Eastern India during the period A.D. 750-850, and the occasional reverses of the Pala rulers at the hands of the Pratiharas and the Rashtrakutas may be partly due to Tibetan aggression.\\" (p. 52) The varied terrain of the empire and the difficulty of transportation, coupled with the new ideas that came into the empire as a result of its expansion, helped to create stresses and power blocs that were often in competition with the ruler at the center of the empire. Thus, for example, adherents of the B√∂n religion and the supporters of the ancient noble families gradually came to find themselves in competition with the recently introduced Buddhism. Era of Fragmentation and Cultural Renaissance (9th‚Äì12th centuries)=Fragmentation of political power (9th‚Äì10th centuries) Map showing major religious regimes during the Era of Fragmentation in Tibet The Era of Fragmentation is a period of Tibetan history in the 9th and 10th centuries. During this era, the political centralization of the earlier Tibetan Empire collapsed.Shakabpa. p.173. The period was dominated by rebellions against the remnants of imperial Tibet and the rise of regional warlords.Schaik, Galambos. p.4. Upon the death of Langdarma, the last emperor of a unified Tibetan empire, there was a controversy over whether he would be succeeded by his alleged heir Yumt√§n (Yum brtan), or by another son (or nephew) √ñsung (‚ÄôOd-srung) (either 843‚Äì905 or 847‚Äì885). A civil war ensued, which effectively ended centralized Tibetan administration until the Sa-skya period. √ñsung's allies managed to keep control of Lhasa, and Yumt√§n was forced to go to Yalung, where he established a separate line of kings.Tsepon W. D. Shakabpa, Tibet, a Political History (New Haven: Yale, 1967), 53. In 910, the tombs of the emperors were defiled. The son of √ñsung was P√§lkhorts√§n (Dpal 'khor brtsan) (865‚Äì895 or 893‚Äì923). The latter apparently maintained control over much of central Tibet for a time, and sired two sons, Trashi Tsents√§n (Bkra shis brtsen brtsan) and Thrikhyiding (Khri khyi lding), also called Kyide Nyig√∂n (Skyid lde nyi ma mgon) in some sources. Thrikhyiding migrated to the western Tibetan region of upper Ngari (Stod Mnga ris) and married a woman of high central Tibetan nobility, with whom he founded a local dynasty.Petech, L. The Kingdom of Ladakh, (Serie Orientale Roma 51) Rome: Instituto Italiano per il Medio ed Estremo Oriente, 1977: 14‚Äì16 After the breakup of the Tibetan empire in 842, Nyima-Gon, a representative of the ancient Tibetan royal house, founded the first Ladakh dynasty. Nyima-Gon's kingdom had its centre well to the east of present-day Ladakh. Kyide Nyig√∂n's eldest son became ruler of the Mar-yul Ladakh region, and his two younger sons ruled western Tibet, founding the Kingdom of Guge and Pu-hrang. At a later period the king of Guge's eldest son, Kor-re, also called Jangchub Yeshe-√ñ (Byang Chub Ye shes' Od), became a Buddhist monk. He sent young scholars to Kashmir for training and was responsible for inviting Ati≈õa to Tibet in 1040, thus ushering in the Chidar (Phyi dar) phase of Buddhism in Tibet. The younger son, Srong-nge, administered day-to-day governmental affairs; it was his sons who carried on the royal line.Hoffman, Helmut, \\"Early and Medieval Tibet\\", in Sinor, David, ed., Cambridge History of Early Inner Asia, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990), 388, 394. Shakabpa, 56. Tibetan Renaissance (10th‚Äì12th centuries) Ati≈õa lived during the 11th century and was one of the major figures in the spread of Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism in Asia and inspired Buddhist thought from Tibet to Sumatra. According to traditional accounts, Buddhism had survived surreptitiously in the region of Kham. The late 10th century and 11th century saw a revival of Buddhism in Tibet. Coinciding with the early discoveries of \\"hidden treasures\\" (terma),Berzin, Alexander. The Four Traditions of Tibetan Buddhism: Personal Experience, History, and Comparisons the 11th century saw a revival of Buddhist influence originating in the far east and far west of Tibet.Conze, 1993, 104ff Muzu Saelbar (Mu-zu gSal-'bar), later known as the scholar Gongpa Rabsal (bla chen dgongs pa rab gsal) (832‚Äì915), was responsible for the renewal of Buddhism in northeastern Tibet, and is counted as the progenitor of the Nyingma (Rnying ma pa) school of Tibetan Buddhism. In the west, Rinchen Zangpo (958‚Äì1055) was active as a translator and founded temples and monasteries. Prominent scholars and teachers were again invited from India. In 1042 Ati≈õa (982‚Äì1054 CE) arrived in Tibet at the invitation of a west Tibetan king. This renowned exponent of the PƒÅla form of Buddhism from the Indian university of Vikramashila later moved to central Tibet. There his chief disciple, Dromtonpa founded the Kadampa school of Tibetan Buddhism, under whose influence the New Translation schools of today evolved. The Sakya, the Grey Earth school, was founded by Kh√∂n K√∂nchok Gyelpo (, 1034‚Äì1102), a disciple of the great Lotsawa, Drogmi ShƒÅkya (). It is headed by the Sakya Trizin, traces its lineage to the mahasiddha Vir≈´pa,Berzin. Alexander (2000). How Did Tibetan Buddhism Develop?: StudyBuddhism.com and represents the scholarly tradition. A renowned exponent, Sakya Pandita (1182‚Äì1251CE), was the great-grandson of Kh√∂n K√∂nchok Gyelpo. Other seminal Indian teachers were Tilopa (988‚Äì1069) and his student Naropa (probably died ca. 1040 CE). The Kagyu, the Lineage of the (Buddha's) Word, is an oral tradition which is very much concerned with the experiential dimension of meditation. Its most famous exponent was Milarepa, an 11th-century mystic. It contains one major and one minor subsect. The first, the Dagpo Kagyu, encompasses those Kagyu schools that trace back to the Indian master Naropa via Marpa Lotsawa, Milarepa and Gampopa. Mongol conquest and Yuan administrative rule (1240‚Äì1354) Tibet within the Yuan dynasty under the top- level department known as the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs (Xuanzheng Yuan) During this era, the region was dominated by the Sakya lama with the Mongols' support, so it is also called the Sakya dynasty. The first documented contact between the Tibetans and the Mongols occurred when the missionary Tsang-pa Dung-khur (gTsang-pa Dung-khur-ba) and six disciples met Genghis Khan, probably on the Tangut border where he may have been taken captive, around 1221‚Äì22.Paul D. Buell, 'Tibetans, Mongols and the Fusion of Eurasian Cultures,' in Anna Akasoy, Charles Burnett, Ronit Yoeli-Tlalim (eds.) Islam and Tibet: Interactions Along the Musk Routes, Ashgate Publishing, 2011, pp.188-208, p193-4. He left Mongolia as the Quanzhen sect of Daoism gained the upper hand, but remet Genghis Khan when Mongols conquered Tangut shortly before the Khan's death. Closer contacts ensued when the Mongols successively sought to move through the Sino-Tibetan borderlands to attack the Jin dynasty and then the Southern Song, with incursions on outlying areas. One traditional Tibetan account claims that there was a plot to invade Tibet by Genghis Khan in 1206, which is considered anachronistic; there is no evidence of Mongol- Tibetan encounters prior to the military campaign in 1240. The mistake may have arisen from Genghis's real campaign against the Tangut Xixia.\\"...erred in identifying Tibet as the country against Chinggis launched that early campaign. His military objective was the Tangut kingdom of Hsi-hsia.\\" The Mongols invaded Tibet in 1240 with a small campaign led by the Mongol general Doorda Darkhan\\"delegated the command of the Tibetan invasion to an otherwise unknown general, Doorda Darkhan\\". that consisted of 30,000 troops,Shakabpa. p.61: 'thirty thousand troops, under the command of Leje and Dorta, reached Phanpo, north of Lhasa.'Sanders. p. 309, his grandson Godan Khan invaded Tibet with 30000 men and destroyed several Buddhist monasteries north of Lhasa suffering 500 casualties. The Mongols withdrew their soldiers from Tibet in 1241, as all the Mongol princes were recalled back to Mongolia in preparation for the appointment of a successor to √ñgedei Khan. They returned to the region in 1244, when K√∂ten delivered an ultimatum, summoning the abbot of Sakya (Kun- dga' rGyal-mtshan) to be his personal chaplain, on pains of a larger invasion were he to refuse.Buell, ibid. p.194: Shakabpa, 1967 pp.61-2. Sakya Pa·πá·∏çita took almost 3 years to obey the summons and arrive in Kokonor in 1246, and met Prince K√∂ten in Lanzhou the following year. The Mongols had annexed Amdo and Kham to the east, and appointed Sakya Pa·πá·∏çita Viceroy of Central Tibet by the Mongol court in 1249. Tibet was incorporated into the Mongol Empire, retaining nominal power over religious and regional political affairs, while the Mongols managed a structural and administrative\\"To counterbalance the political power of the lama, Khubilai appointed civil administrators at the Sa-skya to supervise the mongol regency.\\" rule over the region, reinforced by the rare military intervention. This existed as a \\"diarchic structure\\" under the Mongol emperor, with power primarily in favor of the Mongols. Within the branch of the Mongol Empire in China known as the Yuan dynasty, Tibet was managed by the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs or Xuanzheng Yuan, separate from other Yuan provinces such as those governed the former Song dynasty of China. One of the department's purposes was to select a dpon-chen, usually appointed by the lama and confirmed by the Yuan emperor in Beijing. \\"The Mongol dominance was most indirect: Sakya lamas remained the sources of authority and legitimacy, while the dpon-chens carried on the administration at Sakya. However, there was no doubt as to who had the political clout. When a dispute developed between dpon-chen Kung-dga' bzari-po and one of 'Phags-pa's relatives at Sakya, the Chinese troops were dispatched to execute the dpon-chen.\\" In 1253, Drog√∂n Ch√∂gyal Phagpa (1235‚Äì1280) succeeded Sakya Pandita at the Mongol court. Phagpa became a religious teacher to Kublai Khan. Kublai Khan appointed Ch√∂gyal Phagpa as his Imperial Preceptor (originally State Preceptor) in 1260, the year when he became Khagan. Phagpa developed the priest-patron concept that characterized Tibeto-Mongolian relations from that point forward.F. W. Mote. Imperial China 900-1800. Harvard University Press, 1999. p.501. With the support of Kublai Khan, Phagpa established himself and his sect as the preeminent political power in Tibet. Through their influence with the Mongol rulers, Tibetan lamas gained considerable influence in various Mongol clans, not only with Kublai, but, for example, also with the Il-Khanids. In 1265, Ch√∂gyal Phagpa returned to Tibet and for the first time made an attempt to impose Sakya hegemony with the appointment of Shakya Bzang-po (a longtime servant and ally of the Sakyas) as the dpon-chen ('great administrator') over Tibet in 1267. A census was conducted in 1268 and Tibet was divided into thirteen myriarchies (administrative districts, nominally containing 10,000 households). By the end of the century, Western Tibet lay under the effective control of imperial officials (almost certainly Tibetans) dependent on the 'Great Administrator', while the kingdoms of Guge and Pu-ran retained their internal autonomy.Alex McKay, History of Tibet, Routledge, 2003 p.40. The Sakya hegemony over Tibet continued into the mid-14th century, although it was challenged by a revolt of the Drikung Kagyu sect with the assistance of Duwa Khan of the Chagatai Khanate in 1285. The revolt was suppressed in 1290 when the Sakyas and eastern Mongols burned Drikung Monastery and killed 10,000 people. Between 1346 and 1354, towards the end of the Yuan dynasty, the House of Pagmodru would topple the Sakya. The rule over Tibet by a succession of Sakya lamas came to a definite end in 1358, when central Tibet came under control of the Kagyu sect. \\"By the 1370s, the lines between the schools of Buddhism were clear.\\" The following 80-or-so years were a period of relative stability. They also saw the birth of the Gelugpa school (also known as Yellow Hats) by the disciples of Tsongkhapa Lobsang Dragpa, and the founding of the Ganden, Drepung, and Sera monasteries near Lhasa. After the 1430s, the country entered another period of internal power struggles.Karenina Kollmar-Paulenz, Kleine Geschichte Tibets, M√ºnchen 2006, pp. 98‚Äì104 Tibetan independence (14th-18th century) With the decline of the Yuan dynasty, Central Tibet was ruled by successive families from the 14th to the 17th centuries, to be succeeded by the Dalai Lama's rule in the 17th and 18th centuries. Tibet would be de facto independent from the mid-14th century on, for nearly 400 years.Rossabi 1983, p. 194 In spite of the weakening of central authority, the neighbouring Ming dynasty of China made little effort to impose direct rule, although it had nominal claims of the Tibetan territory by establishing the U-Tsang Regional Military Commission and Do-Kham Regional Military Commission in 1370s. They also kept friendly relations with some of the Buddhism religious leaders known as Princes of Dharma and granted some other titles to local leaders including the Grand Imperial Tutor.Tucci, G. Tibetan Painted Scrolls, Vol. 1-2. Rome 1949, Vol. 1: 692-3.Zhang, T. History of Ming- Geography III Family rule (14th‚Äì17th centuries)Phagmodrupa (14th‚Äì15th centuries)= The Phagmodru (Phag mo gru) myriarchy centered at Neudong (Sne'u gdong) was granted as an appanage to H√ºleg√º in 1251. The area had already been associated with the Lang (Rlang) family, and with the waning of Ilkhanate influence it was ruled by this family, within the Mongol-Sakya framework headed by the Mongol appointed P√∂nchen (dpon-chen) at Sakya. The areas under Lang administration were continually encroached upon during the late 13th and early 14th centuries. Jangchub Gyalts√§n (Byang chub rgyal mtshan, 1302‚Äì1364) saw these encroachments as illegal and sought the restoration of Phagmodru lands after his appointment as the Myriarch in 1322. After prolonged legal struggles, the struggle became violent when Phagmodru was attacked by its neighbours in 1346. Jangchub Gyalts√§n was arrested and released in 1347. When he later refused to appear for trial, his domains were attacked by the P√∂nchen in 1348. Janchung Gyalts√§n was able to defend Phagmodru, and continued to have military successes, until by 1351 he was the strongest political figure in the country. Military hostilities ended in 1354 with Jangchub Gyalts√§n as the unquestioned victor, who established the Phagmodrupa dynasty in that year. He continued to rule central Tibet until his death in 1364, although he left all Mongol institutions in place as hollow formalities. Power remained in the hands of the Phagmodru family until 1434.Petech, L. Central Tibet and The Mongols. (Serie Orientale Roma 65). Rome: Instituto Italiano per il Medio ed Estremo Oriente 1990: 85‚Äì143 The rule of Jangchub Gyalts√§n and his successors implied a new cultural self-awareness where models were sought in the age of the ancient Tibetan Kingdom. The relatively peaceful conditions favoured the literary and artistic development.Van Schaik, S. Tibet. A History. New Haven & London: Yale University Press 2011: 88‚Äì112. During this period the reformist scholar Je Tsongkhapa (1357‚Äì1419) founded the Gelug sect which would have a decisive influence on Tibet's history. =Rinpungpa family (15th‚Äì16th centuries)= Internal strife within the Phagmodrupa dynasty and the strong localism of the various fiefs and political-religious factions led to a long series of internal conflicts. The minister family Rinpungpa, based in Tsang (West Central Tibet), dominated politics after 1435. =Tsangpa dynasty (16th‚Äì17th centuries)= In 1565 they were overthrown by the Tsangpa Dynasty of Shigatse which expanded its power in different directions of Tibet in the following decades and favoured the Karma Kagyu sect. They would play a pivotal role in the events which led to the rise of power of the Dalai Lama's in the 1640s. Ganden Phodrang government (17th‚Äì18th centuries) Legal Document of the Tibetan Ruler Lhabzang Khan The Ganden Phodrang was the Tibetan regime or government that was established by the 5th Dalai Lama with the help of the G√ºshi Khan of the Khoshut in 1642. Lhasa became the capital of Tibet in the beginning of this period, with all temporal power being conferred to the 5th Dalai Lama by G√ºshi Khan in Shigatse. =Beginnings of the Dalai Lama lineage= The rise of the Dalai Lamas was intimately connected with the military power of Mongolian clans. Altan Khan, the king of the T√ºmed Mongols, first invited Sonam Gyatso, the head of the Gelugpa school of Tibetan Buddhism (later known as the third Dalai Lama), to Mongolia in 1569 and again in 1578, during the reign of the Tsangpa family. Gyatso accepted the second invitation. They met at the site of Altan Khan's new capital, Koko Khotan (Hohhot), and the Dalai Lama taught a huge crowd there. Sonam Gyatso publicly announced that he was a reincarnation of the Tibetan Sakya monk Drog√∂n Ch√∂gyal Phagpa (1235‚Äì1280) who converted Kublai Khan, while Altan Khan was a reincarnation of Kublai Khan (1215‚Äì1294), the famous ruler of the Mongols and Emperor of China, and that they had come together again to cooperate in propagating the Buddhist religion. While this did not immediately lead to a massive conversion of Mongols to Buddhism (this would only happen in the 1630s), it did lead to the widespread use of Buddhist ideology for the legitimation of power among the Mongol nobility. Last but not least, Yonten Gyatso, the fourth Dalai Lama, was a grandson of Altan Khan.Michael Weiers, Geschichte der Mongolen, Stuttgart 2004, p. 175ff. =Rise of the Gelugpa school= Yonten Gyatso (1589‚Äì1616), the fourth Dalai Lama and a non-Tibetan, was the grandson of Altan Khan. He died in 1616 in his mid-twenties. Some people say he was poisoned but there is no real evidence one way or the other. Lobsang Gyatso (Wylie transliteration: Blo-bzang Rgya-mtsho), the Great Fifth Dalai Lama (1617‚Äì1682), was the first Dalai Lama to wield effective political power over central Tibet. The Fifth Dalai Lama's first regent Sonam Rapten is known for unifying the Tibetan heartland under the control of the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism, after defeating the rival Kagyu and Jonang sects and the secular ruler, the Tsangpa prince, in a prolonged civil war. His efforts were successful in part because of help from G√ºshi Khan, the Oirat leader of the Khoshut Khanate.Karmay 2014, pp. 3-5 Under Sonam Rapten's regime, him being a fanatical and militant proponent of the Gelugpa, the other schools were then persecuted. Jonang sources today claim that the Jonang monasteries were either closed or forcibly converted, and that school remained in hiding until the latter part of the 20th century. However, before leaving Tibet for China in 1652 the Dalai Lama issued a proclamation or decree to Sonam Rapten banning all such sectarian policies that had been implemented by his administration after the 1642 civil war, and ordered their reversal.Karmay 2014, pp. 269-270 With G√ºshi Khan as a largely uninvolved devotee, the 5th Dalai Lama and his intimates especially Sonam Rapten (until his death in 1658) established a civil administration which is referred to by historians as the Lhasa state. This Tibetan regime or government is also referred to as the Ganden Phodrang. In 1652, the fifth Dalai Lama visited the Shunzhi Emperor of the Qing dynasty. He was not required to kowtow like other visitors, but still had to kneel before the Emperor; and he was later sent an official seal.Karmay 2014, Chapter 23 The fifth Dalai Lama initiated the construction of the Potala Palace in Lhasa, and moved the centre of government there from Drepung. The Potala Palace in Lhasa The death of the fifth Dalai Lama in 1682 was kept hidden for fifteen years by his assistant, confidant, Desi Sangye Gyatso (De-srid Sangs-rgyas Rgya-'mtsho). The Dalai Lamas remained Tibet's titular heads of state until 1959. During the rule of the Great Fifth, two Jesuit missionaries, the German Johannes Gruber and Belgian Albert Dorville, stayed in Lhasa for two months, October and November, 1661 on their way from Peking to Portuguese Goa, in India. They described the Dalai Lama as a \\"powerful and compassionate leader\\" and \\"a devilish God-the-father who puts to death such as refuse to adore him.\\" Another Jesuit, Ippolito Desideri, stayed five years in Lhasa (1716‚Äì1721) and was the first missionary to master the language. He even produced a few Christian books in Tibetan. Capuchin fathers took over the mission until all missionaries were expelled in 1745. In the late 17th century, Tibet entered into a dispute with Bhutan, which was supported by Ladakh. This resulted in an invasion of Ladakh by Tibet. Kashmir helped to restore Ladakhi rule, on the condition that a mosque be built in Leh and that the Ladakhi king convert to Islam. The Treaty of Temisgam in 1684 settled the dispute between Tibet and Ladakh, but its independence was severely restricted. Qing conquest and administrative rule (1720‚Äì1912) The Qing rule over Tibet was established after a Qing expedition force defeated the Dzungars who occupied Tibet in 1720, and lasted until the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912. The Qing emperors appointed imperial residents known as the Ambans to Tibet, who commanded over 2,000 troops stationed in Lhasa and reported to the Lifan Yuan, a Qing government agency that oversaw the region during this period.Emblems of Empire: Selections from the Mactaggart Art Collection, by John E. Vollmer, Jacqueline Simcox, p154 During this era, the region was dominated by the Dalai Lamas with the support from the Qing dynasty established by the Manchus in China. Map showing Dzungar‚ÄìQing Wars between Qing Dynasty and Dzungar Khanate Qing rule Tibet within the Qing dynasty in 1820 =Qing conquest= The Kangxi Emperor of the Qing dynasty sent an expedition army to Tibet in response to the occupation of Tibet by the forces of the Dzungar Khanate, together with Tibetan forces under Polhanas (also spelled Polhaney) of Tsang and Kangchennas (also spelled Gangchenney), the governor of Western Tibet,Mullin 2001, p. 290 they expelled the Dzungars from Tibet in 1720. They brought Kelzang Gyatso with them from Kumbum to Lhasa and he was installed as the 7th Dalai Lama.Richardson, Hugh E. (1984). Tibet and its History. Second Edition, Revised and Updated, pp. 48-9. Shambhala. Boston & London. (pbk)Schirokauer, 242 Qing protectorate over Tibet was established at this time, with a garrison at Lhasa, and Kham was annexed to Sichuan.Stein 1972, pp. 85-88 In 1721, the Qing established a government in Lhasa consisting of a council (the Kashag) of three Tibetan ministers, headed by Kangchennas. The Dalai Lama's role at this time was purely symbolic, but still highly influential because of the Mongols' religious beliefs. After the succession of the Yongzheng Emperor in 1722, a series of reductions of Qing forces in Tibet occurred. However, Lhasa nobility who had been allied with the Dzungars killed Kangchennas and took control of Lhasa in 1727, and Polhanas fled to his native Ngari. Qing troops arrived in Lhasa in September, and punished the anti-Qing faction by executing entire families, including women and children. The Dalai Lama was sent to Lithang MonasteryMullin 2001, p. 293 in Kham. The Panchen Lama was brought to Lhasa and was given temporal authority over Tsang and Ngari, creating a territorial division between the two high lamas that was to be a long lasting feature of Chinese policy toward Tibet. Two ambans were established in Lhasa, with increased numbers of Qing troops. Over the 1730s, Qing troops were again reduced, and Polhanas gained more power and authority. The Dalai Lama returned to Lhasa in 1735, temporal power remained with Polhanas. The Qing found Polhanas to be a loyal agent and an effective ruler over a stable Tibet, so he remained dominant until his death in 1747. At multiple places such as Lhasa, Batang, Dartsendo, Lhari, Chamdo, and Litang, Green Standard Army troops were garrisoned throughout the Dzungar war.Wang 2011, p. 30. Green Standard Army troops and Manchu Bannermen were both part of the Qing force who fought in Tibet in the war against the Dzungars.Dai 2009, p. 81. It was said that the Sichuan commander Yue Zhongqi (a descendant of Yue Fei) entered Lhasa first when the 2,000 Green Standard soldiers and 1,000 Manchu soldiers of the \\"Sichuan route\\" seized Lhasa.Dai 2009, pp. 81-2. According to Mark C. Elliott, after 1728 the Qing used Green Standard Army troops to man the garrison in Lhasa rather than Bannermen.Elliott 2001, p. 412. According to Evelyn S. Rawski both Green Standard Army and Bannermen made up the Qing garrison in Tibet.Rawski 1998, p. 251. According to Sabine Dabringhaus, Green Standard Chinese soldiers numbering more than 1,300 were stationed by the Qing in Tibet to support the 3,000-strong Tibetan army.Dabringhaus 2014, p. 123. The Qing had made the region of Amdo and Kham into the province of Qinghai in 1724, and incorporated eastern Kham into neighbouring Chinese provinces in 1728.Wang Lixiong, \\"Reflections on Tibet\\" , New Left Review 14, March‚ÄìApril 2002:'\\"Tibetan local affairs were left to the willful actions of the Dalai Lama and the shapes [Kashag members]\\", he said. \\"The Commissioners were not only unable to take charge, they were also kept uninformed. This reduced the post of the Residential Commissioner in Tibet to name only.' The Qing government sent a resident commissioner (amban) to Lhasa. Polhanas' son Gyurme Namgyal took over upon his father's death in 1747. The ambans became convinced that he was going to lead a rebellion, so they killed him. News of the incident leaked out and a riot broke out in the city, the mob avenged the regent's death by killing the ambans. The Dalai Lama stepped in and restored order in Lhasa. The Qianlong Emperor (Yongzheng's successor) sent Qing forces to execute Gyurme Namgyal's family and seven members of the group that killed the ambans. The Emperor re-organized the Tibetan government (Kashag) again, nominally restoring temporal power to the Dalai Lama, but in fact consolidating power in the hands of the (new) ambans. =Expansion of control over Tibet= Induction of Lungtok Gyatso, 9th Dalai Lama, in the presence of Ambans around 1808 The defeat of the 1791 Nepalese invasion increased the Qing's control over Tibet. From that moment, all important matters were to be submitted to the ambans.Chambers' Encyclopedia, Pergamon Press, New York, 1967, p637 It strengthened the powers of the ambans. The ambans were elevated above the Kashag and the regents in responsibility for Tibetan political affairs. The Dalai and Panchen Lamas were no longer allowed to petition the Qing Emperor directly but could only do so through the ambans. The ambans took control of Tibetan frontier defense and foreign affairs. The ambans were put in command of the Qing garrison and the Tibetan army (whose strength was set at 3,000 men). Trade was also restricted and travel could be undertaken only with documents issued by the ambans. The ambans were to review all judicial decisions. However, according to Warren Smith, these directives were either never fully implemented, or quickly discarded, as the Qing were more interested in a symbolic gesture of authority than actual sovereignty. In 1841, the Hindu Dogra dynasty attempted to establish their authority on √ú-Tsang but were defeated in the Sino-Sikh War (1841‚Äì1842). In the mid-19th century, arriving with an Amban, a community of Chinese troops from Sichuan who married Tibetan women settled down in the Lubu neighborhood of Lhasa, where their descendants established a community and assimilated into Tibetan culture.Yeh 2009, p. 60. Hebalin was the location of where Chinese Muslim troops and their offspring lived, while Lubu was the place where Han Chinese troops and their offspring lived.Yeh 2013, p. 283.

Bhutan and Sikkim later gains independence and Sikkim was attacked by the Indian Army in April 1975 and subsequently incorporated into India in May. The entire Assam and Ladakh were merged into the British Raj. Ant√≥nio de AndradeS√°ndor K≈ër√∂si Csoma The first Europeans to arrive in Tibet were Portuguese missionaries who first arrived in 1624 led by Ant√≥nio de Andrade. They were welcomed by the Tibetans who allowed them to build a church. The 18th century brought more Jesuits and Capuchins from Europe. They gradually met opposition from Tibetan lamas who finally expelled them from Tibet in 1745. Other visitors included, in 1774 a Scottish nobleman, George Bogle, who came to Shigatse to investigate trade for the British East India Company, introducing the first potatoes into Tibet.Teltscher 2006, p. 57 After 1792 Tibet, under Chinese influence, closed its borders to Europeans and during the 19th century only 3 Westerners, the Englishman Thomas Manning and 2 French missionaries Huc and Gabet, reached Lhasa, although a number were able to travel in the Tibetan periphery. During the 19th century the British Empire was encroaching from northern India into the Himalayas and Afghanistan and the Russian Empire of the tsars was expanding south into Central Asia. Each power became suspicious of intent in Tibet. But Tibet attracted the attention of many explorers. In 1840, S√°ndor K≈ër√∂si Csoma arrived in Darjeeling, hoping that he would be able to trace the origin of the Magyar ethnic group, but died before he was able to enter Tibet. In 1865 Great Britain secretly began mapping Tibet. Trained Indian surveyor- spies disguised as pilgrims or traders, called pundits, counted their strides on their travels across Tibet and took readings at night. Nain Singh, the most famous, measured the longitude, latitude and altitude of Lhasa and traced the Yarlung Tsangpo River. British invasions of Tibet (1903‚àí1904) and Qing control reasserted The 13th Dalai Lama in 1910 At the beginning of the 20th century the British and Russian Empires were competing for supremacy in Central Asia. Unable to establish diplomatic contacts with the Tibetan government, and concerned about reports of their dealings with Russia, in 1903‚Äì04, a British expedition led by Colonel Francis Younghusband was sent to Lhasa to force a trading agreement and to prevent Tibetans from establishing a relationship with the Russians. In response, the Qing foreign ministry asserted that China was sovereign over Tibet, the first clear statement of such a claim.Michael C. Van Walt Van Praag. The Status of Tibet: History, Rights and Prospects in International Law, p. 37. (1987). London, Wisdom Publications. . Before the British troops arrived in Lhasa, the 13th Dalai Lama fled to Outer Mongolia, and then went to Beijing in 1908. The British invasion was one of the triggers for the 1905 Tibetan Rebellion at Batang monastery, when anti-foreign Tibetan lamas massacred French missionaries, Manchu and Han Qing officials, and Christian converts before the Qing crushed the revolt. The Anglo-Tibetan Treaty of Lhasa of 1904 was followed by the Sino-British treaty of 1906. Beijing agreed to pay London 2.5 million rupees which Lhasa was forced to agree upon in the Anglo-Tibetan treaty of 1904.Melvyn C. Goldstein, Tibet, China and the United States: Reflections on the Tibet Question. , 1995 In 1907, Britain and Russia agreed that in \\"conformity with the admitted principle of the suzerainty of China over Tibet\\"Convention Between Great Britain and Russia (1907) both nations \\"engage not to enter into negotiations with Tibet except through the intermediary of the Chinese Government.\\" The Qing government in Beijing then appointed Zhao Erfeng, the Governor of Xining, \\"Army Commander of Tibet\\" to reintegrate Tibet into China.

His troops destroyed a number of monasteries in Kham and Amdo, and a process of sinification of the region was begun.Karenina Kollmar-Paulenz, Kleine Geschichte Tibets, M√ºnchen 2006, p. 140f The Dalai Lama once again fled, this time to India, and was once again deposed by the Chinese. The situation was soon to change, however, as, after the fall of the Qing dynasty in October 1911, Zhao's soldiers mutinied and beheaded him.Hilton 2000, p. 115 All remaining Qing forces left Tibet after the Xinhai Lhasa turmoil. De facto independence (1912‚Äì1951) Tibetan passport 1947/1948 ‚Äì issued to Tsepon Shakabpa, then Chief of the Finance Department of the Government of Tibet The Dalai Lama returned to Tibet from India in July 1912 (after the fall of the Qing dynasty), and expelled the Amban and all Chinese troops. In 1913, the Dalai Lama issued a proclamation that stated that the relationship between the Chinese emperor and Tibet \\"had been that of patron and priest and had not been based on the subordination of one to the other.\\"\\"Proclamation Issued by H.H. The Dalai Lama XIII\\" \\"We are a small, religious, and independent nation\\", the proclamation continued. For the next thirty-six years, Tibet enjoyed de facto independence while China endured its Warlord era, civil war, and World War II. Some Chinese sources argue that Tibet was still part of China throughout this period.Tibet during the Republic of China (1912‚Äì1949) There is also a book published in 1939 by a Swedish sinologist and linguist about the war in China where Tibet on a map is a part of China, the Chinese government in the 1930s tried to claim superiority.Bernhard Karlgren: Maktkampen i Fj√§rran √ñstren, 1939, KF:s bokf√∂rlag The USA also recognised Tibet as a province of China during this time as seen in the documentary film Why We Fight #6 The Battle of China produced by the USA War Department in 1944.Why We Fight #6 Battle of China. https://archive.org/details/BattleOfChina Some other authors argue that Tibet was also de jure independent after Tibet-Mongolia Treaty of 1913, before which Mongolia has been recognized by Russia.Kuzmin, S.L. Hidden Tibet: History of Independence and Occupation. Dharamsala, LTWA, 2011 Tibet continued in 1913‚Äì1949 to have very limited contacts with the rest of the world, although British representatives were stationed in Gyantse, Yatung and Gartok (western Tibet) after the Younghusband Mission. These so-called \\"Trade Agents\\" were in effect diplomatic representatives of the British Government of India and in 1936‚Äì37 the British also established a permanent mission in Lhasa. This was in response to a Chinese \\"condolence mission' sent to the Tibetan capital after the demise of the 13th Dalai Lama which remained in Lhasa as, in effect, a Republican Chinese diplomatic post. After 1947 the British mission was transferred to the newly independent Indian government control although the last British representative, Hugh Richardson remained in Lhasa until 1950 serving the Indian government. The British, like the Chinese, encouraged the Tibetans to keep foreigners out of Tibet and no foreigners visited Lhasa between the departure of the Younghusband mission in 1904 and the arrival of a telegraph officer in 1920. Just over 90 European and Japanese visited Lhasa during the years 1920‚Äì1950, most of whom were British diplomatic personnel.Western and Japanese visitors to Lhasa 1900-1950. Jim Cooper. The Tibet Journal, 28/4/2003. Very few governments did anything resembling a normal diplomatic recognition of Tibet. In 1914 the Tibetan government signed the Simla Accord with Britain, ceding the several small areas on the southern side of the Himalayan watershed to British India. The Chinese government denounced the agreement as illegal. In 1932, the National Revolutionary Army, composed of Muslim and Han soldiers, led by Ma Bufang and Liu Wenhui defeated the Tibetan army in the Sino-Tibetan War when the 13th Dalai Lama tried to seize territory in Qinghai and Xikang. It was also reported that the central government of China encouraged the attack, hoping to solve the \\"Tibet situation\\", because the Japanese had just seized Manchuria. They warned the Tibetans not to dare cross the Jinsha river again. A truce was signed, ending the fighting. The Dalai Lama had cabled the British in India for help when his armies were defeated, and started demoting his Generals who had surrendered. People's Republic of China rule (1950‚Äìpresent) Nyalam, Tibet, 1993 In 1949, seeing that the Chinese Communists, with the decisive support from Joseph Stalin, were gaining control of China, the Kashag expelled all Chinese connected with the Chinese government, over the protests of both the Kuomintang and the Communists. The People's Republic of China (PRC), founded in October 1949 by the victorious Communists under the leadership of Mao Zedong, lost little time in asserting a new Chinese presence in Tibet. In October 1950, the People's Liberation Army entered the Tibetan area of Chamdo, defeating sporadic resistance from the Tibetan army. In 1951, Tibetan representatives participated in negotiations in Beijing with the Chinese government. This resulted in a Seventeen Point Agreement which formalized China's sovereignty over Tibet, but was repudiated by the present Tibetan government-in-exile. From the beginning, it was obvious that incorporating Tibet into Communist China would bring two opposite social systems face-to- face.Goldstein 2007, p541 In Tibet, however, the Chinese Communists opted not to place social reform as an immediate priority. On the contrary, from 1951 to 1959, traditional Tibetan society with its lords and manorial estates continued to function unchanged. Despite the presence of twenty thousand Chinese soldiers in Central Tibet, the Dalai Lama's government was permitted to maintain important symbols from its de facto independence period. The Communists quickly abolished slavery and serfdom in their traditional forms. They also claim to have reduced taxes, unemployment, and beggary, and to have started work projects. They established secular schools, thereby breaking the educational monopoly of the monasteries, and they constructed running water and electrical systems in Lhasa.See Greene, A Curtain of Ignorance, 248 and passim; and Grunfeld, The Making of Modern Tibet, passim. The Tibetan region of Eastern Kham, previously Xikang province, was incorporated in the province of Sichuan. Western Kham was put under the Chamdo Military Committee. In these areas, land reform was implemented. This involved communist agitators designating \\"landlords\\"‚Äîsometimes arbitrarily chosen‚Äîfor public humiliation in thamzing () or \\"Struggle Sessions\\", torture, maiming, and even death.Craig (1992), pp. 76-78, 120-123. Tanggula railway station, located at , is the highest station in the world By 1956 there was unrest in eastern Kham and Amdo, where land reform had been implemented in full. These rebellions eventually spread into western Kham and √ú-Tsang. In 1956‚Äì57, armed Tibetan guerrillas ambushed convoys of the Chinese Peoples Liberation Army. The uprising received extensive assistance from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), including military training, support camps in Nepal, and several airlifts.See Kenneth Conboy and James Morrison, The CIA's Secret War in Tibet (Lawrence, Kansas: University of Kansas Press, 2002); and William Leary, \\"Secret Mission to Tibet\\", Air & Space, December 1997/January 1998 Meanwhile, in the United States, the American Society for a Free Asia, a CIA-financed front, energetically publicized the cause of Tibetan resistance, with the Dalai Lama's eldest brother, Thubten Norbu, playing an active role in that organization. The Dalai Lama's second-eldest brother, Gyalo Thondup, established an intelligence operation with the CIA as early as 1951. He later upgraded it into a CIA-trained guerrilla unit whose recruits parachuted back into Tibet.On the CIA's links to the Dalai Lama and his family and entourage, see Loren Coleman, Tom Slick and the Search for the Yeti (London: Faber and Faber, 1989). Many Tibetan commandos and agents whom the CIA dropped into the country were chiefs of aristocratic clans or the sons of chiefs. Ninety percent of them were never heard from again, according to a report from the CIA itself, meaning they were most likely captured and killed.Leary, \\"Secret Mission to Tibet\\" Ginsburg and Mathos reached the conclusion, that \\"As far as can be ascertained, the great bulk of the common people of Lhasa and of the adjoining countryside failed to join in the fighting against the Chinese both when it first began and as it progressed.\\"George Ginsburg and Michael Mathos Communist China and Tibet (1964), quoted in Deane, The Cold War in Tibet. Deane notes that author Bina Roy reached a similar conclusion. According to other data, many thousands of common Tibetans participated in the rebellion. Declassified Soviet archives provides data that Chinese communists, who received a great assistance in military equipment from the USSR, broadly used Soviet aircraft for bombing monasteries and other punitive operations in Tibet. In 1959, China's military crackdown on rebels in Kham and Amdo led to the \\"Lhasa Uprising.\\" Full-scale resistance spread throughout Tibet. Fearing capture of the Dalai Lama, unarmed Tibetans surrounded his residence, and the Dalai Lama fled to India.Jackson, Peter, Witness: Reporting on the Dalai Lama's escape to India, Reuters, 27 Feb 2009\\"The CIA's secret war in Tibet\\", Seattle Times, January 26, 1997, Paul Salopek Ihttp://www.timbomb.net/buddha/archive/msg00087.html The period from 1959 to 1962 was marked by extensive starvation during the Great Chinese Famine brought about by drought and by the Chinese policies of the Great Leap Forward which affected all of China and not only Tibet. The Tenth Panchen Lama was a keen observer of Tibet during this period and penned the 70,000 Character Petition to detail the sufferings of the Tibetans and sent it to Zhou Enlai in May 1962. In 1962, China and India fought a brief war over the disputed Aksai Chin region. Although China won the war, Chinese troops withdrew north of the McMahon Line. Military crackdown in Ngaba after 2008 Tibetan unrest In 1965, the area that had been under the control of the Dalai Lama's government from the 1910s to 1959 (√ú-Tsang and western Kham) was renamed the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR). Autonomy provided that the head of government would be an ethnic Tibetan; however, actual power in the TAR is held by the First Secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Regional Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, who has never been a Tibetan.Dodin (2008), pp. 205. The role of ethnic Tibetans in the higher levels of the TAR Communist Party remains very limited.Dodin (2008), pp. 195-196. The destruction of most of Tibet's more than 6,000 monasteries occurred between 1959 and 1961 by the communist party of China.Craig (1992), p. 125. During the mid-1960s, the monastic estates were broken up and secular education introduced. During the Cultural Revolution. Red Guards inflicted a campaign of organized vandalism against cultural sites in the entire PRC, including Tibet's Buddhist heritage. According to at least one Chinese source, only a handful of the religiously or culturally most important monasteries remained without major damage.Wang 2001, pp. 212-214 In 1989, the Panchen Lama died of a massive heart attack at the age of 50. The PRC continues to portray its rule over Tibet as an unalloyed improvement, but as some foreign governments continue to make protests about aspects of PRC rule in Tibet as groups such as Human Rights Watch report alleged human rights violations. Most governments, however, recognize the PRC's sovereignty over Tibet today, and none have recognized the Government of Tibet in Exile in India. Riots flared up again in 2008. Many ethnic Hans and Huis were attacked in the riot, their shops vandalized or burned. The Chinese government reacted swiftly, imposing curfews and strictly limiting access to Tibetan areas. The international response was likewise immediate and robust, with some leaders condemning the crackdown and large protests and some in support of China's actions. In 2018, German car manufacturer Mercedes-Benz reverted an advertisement and apologized for 'hurting feelings' of Chinese people by quoting the Dalai Lama. Tibetans in exile Fourteenth Dalai Lama with George W. Bush in the White house on May 23, 2001 Following the Lhasa uprising and the Dalai Lama's flight from Tibet in 1959, the government of India accepted the Tibetan refugees. India designated land for the refugees in the mountainous region of Dharamsala, India, where the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government-in-exile are now based. The 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso The plight of the Tibetan refugees garnered international attention when the Dalai Lama, spiritual and religious leader of the Tibetan government in exile, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989. The Dalai Lama was awarded the Nobel Prize on the basis of his unswerving commitment to peaceful protest against the Chinese occupation of Tibet. He is highly regarded as a result and has since been received by government leaders throughout the world. Among the most recent ceremonies and awards, he was given the Congressional Gold Medal by President Bush in 2007, and in 2006 he was one of only six people to ever receive an honorary Canadian citizenship (see Honorary Canadian citizenship). The PRC consistently protests each official contact with the exiled Tibetan leader. The community of Tibetans in exile established in Dharamshala and Bylakuppe near Mysore in Karnataka, South India, has expanded since 1959. Tibetans have duplicated Tibetan monasteries in India and these now house tens of thousands of monks. They have also created Tibetan schools and hospitals, and founded the Library of Tibetan Works and Archives‚Äîall aimed at continuing Tibetan tradition and culture. Tibetan festivals such as Lama dances, celebration of Losar (the Tibetan New Year), and the Monlam Prayer Festival, continue in exile. In 2006, Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama declared that \\"Tibet wants autonomy, not independence.\\" (originally in TIME Magazine) However, the Chinese distrust him, believing that he has not really given up the quest for Tibetan independence. Talks between representatives of the Dalai Lama and the Chinese government began again in May, 2008 with little result.\\"Dalai Lama's Envoys To Talk With Chinese.

Little else is known of his personal life--including the year and location of his birth. The Last Battle In 660, Baekje was invaded by a force of 50,000 from Silla, supported by 144,000 Tang soldiers. Gyebaek, with only 5,000 troops under his command, met them in the battlefield of Hwangsanbeol. Before entering the battlefield, Gyebaek reportedly killed his wife and children to prevent them from being enslaved if he lost. His forces won four initial battles, causing severe casualties to Silla forces. General Gyebaek fought very courageously and killed many Silla soldiers. However, in the end, exhausted and surrounded, Gyebaek's army was outnumbered and overwhelmed. Baekje's forces were annihilated in battle along with their leader Gyebaek. Aftermath Baekje was destroyed, shortly after Gyebaek's defeat and death at Hwangsanbeol. As Neo-Confucian philosophy became more influential in the later Korean Dynasties, Gyebaek was recognized by historians and scholars as exemplifying the Confucian ideals of patriotism and devotion to his King and praised as such. Although not much else is known about Gyebaek's life, his actions leading up to his last battle are well known to many Koreans.

Biography Caddel was born in Bedford and grew up in Gillingham, Kent. He studied music at the University of Newcastle, but changed to English after meeting poets Basil Bunting and Tom Pickard. He helped Tom and Connie Pickard organise the seminal Morden Tower poetry readings. Caddel's work was influenced by Bunting, by the Americans Lorine Niedecker, Louis Zukofsky, Robert Creeley and William Carlos Williams, and by the English landscape tradition as represented by John Clare. He published a number of small pamphlets, most of which were collected in three books: Sweet Cicely (1983), Uncertain Time (1990) and Larksong Signal (1997). A volume of selected poems, Magpie Words, appeared in 2002. His final book, Writing In The Dark, was published in late 2003. With his wife Ann Caddel, he ran Pig Press, through which he published a number of British, Irish and American poets of the latter half of the 20th century. Caddel edited Bunting's Uncollected Poems in 1991 and his Complete Poems in 1994. With Peter Quartermain, he edited the anthology Other: British And Irish Poetry Since 1970 (1998). He served as Director of the Basil Bunting Poetry Centre at Durham University for a number of years up to his death. A lifelong asthmatic, Caddel died of leukaemia on 1 April 2003.

The skin forms large, diamond-shaped plates that are separated by deep cracks. These affect the shape of the eyelids, nose, mouth, and ears and limit movement of the arms and legs. Restricted movement of the chest can lead to breathing difficulties. These plates fall off over several weeks. Other complications can include premature birth, infection, problems with body temperature, and dehydration. The condition is the most severe form of ichthyosis, a group of genetic disorders characterised by scaly skin. Harlequin-type ichthyosis is caused by mutations in the ABCA12 gene. This gene codes for a protein necessary for transporting lipids out of cells in the outermost layer of skin. The disorder is autosomal recessive and inherited from parents who are carriers. Diagnosis is often based on appearance at birth and confirmed by genetic testing. Before birth, amniocentesis or ultrasound may support the diagnosis. There is no cure for the condition. Early in life, constant supportive care is typically required. Treatments may include moisturizing cream, antibiotics, etretinate or retinoids. Around half of those affected die within the first few months; however, retinoid treatment can increase chances of survival. Children who survive the first year of life often have long-term problems such as red skin, joint contractures and delayed growth. The condition affects around 1 in 300,000 births. It was first documented in a diary entry by Reverend Oliver Hart in America in 1750. Signs and symptoms Newborns with harlequin-type ichthyosis present with thick, fissured armor-plate hyperkeratosis. Sufferers feature severe cranial and facial deformities. The ears may be very poorly developed or absent entirely, as may the nose. The eyelids may be everted (ectropion), which leaves the eyes and the area around them very susceptible to infection. Babies with this condition do often bleed during birth. The lips are pulled back by the dry skin (eclabium). Joints are sometimes lacking in movement, and may be below the normal size. Hypoplasia is sometimes found in the fingers. Polydactyly has also been found on occasion. In addition, the fish-mouthed appearance, mouth-breathing, and xerostomia-affected individuals at extremely high risk for developing rampant dental decay. Patients with this condition are extremely sensitive to changes in temperature due to their hard, cracked skin, which prevents normal heat loss. Respiration is also restricted by the skin, which impedes the chest-wall from expanding and drawing in enough air. This can lead to hypoventilation and respiratory failure. Patients are often dehydrated, as their plated skin is not well suited to retaining water. File:Harlequin ichthyosis.pngHarlequin-ichthyosis in a female infant. File:Harlequin ichthyosis (2).pngHarlequin-ichthyosis in a 3-year-old girl, the keratin-scales having almost completely fallen off.  Cause  Two genetic mechanisms that can result in harlequin-type ichthyosis Harlequin-type ichthyosis is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the ABCA12 gene. This gene is important in the regulation of protein synthesis for the development of the skin layer. Mutations in the gene cause impaired transport of lipids in the skin layer and may also lead to shrunken versions of the proteins responsible for skin development. Less severe mutations result in a collodion membrane and congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma-like presentation. ABCA12 is an ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC transporter), which are members of a large family of proteins that hydrolyze ATP to transport cargo across cell membranes. ABCA12 is thought to be a lipid transporter in keratinocytes necessary for lipid transport into lamellar granules during the formation of the lipid barrier in the skin.  Diagnosis  The diagnosis of harlequin-type ichthyosis relies on both physical examination and certain laboratory tests. Physical assessment at birth is vital for the initial diagnosis of harlequin ichthyosis. Physical examination reveals characteristic symptoms of the condition especially the abnormalities in the skin surface of newborns. Abnormal findings in physical assessments usually result in employing other diagnostic tests to ascertain the diagnosis. Genetic testing is the most specific diagnostic test for harlequin ichthyosis. This test reveals a loss of function mutation on the ABCA12 gene. Biopsy of skin may be done to assess the histologic characteristics of the cells. Histological findings usually reveal hyperkeratotic skin cells, which leads to a thick, white and hard skin layer. Treatment Constant care is required to moisturize and protect the skin. The hard outer layer eventually peels off, leaving the vulnerable inner layers of the dermis exposed. Early complications result from infection due to fissuring of the hyperkeratotic plates and respiratory distress due to physical restriction of chest wall expansion. Management includes supportive care and treatment of hyperkeratosis and skin barrier dysfunction. A humidified incubator is generally used. Intubation is often required until nares are patent. Nutritional support with tube feeds is essential until eclabium resolves and infants can begin nursing. Ophthalmology consultation is useful for the early management of ectropion, which is initially pronounced and resolves as scales are shed. Liberal application of petrolatum is needed multiple times a day. In addition, careful debridement of constrictive bands of hyperkeratosis should be performed to avoid digital ischemia. Cases of digital autoamputation or necrosis have been reported due to cutaneous constriction bands. Relaxation incisions have been used to prevent this morbid complication.  Prognosis  In the past, the disorder was nearly always fatal, whether due to dehydration, infection (sepsis), restricted breathing due to the plating, or other related causes. The most common cause of death was systemic infection, and sufferers rarely survived for more than a few days. However, improved neonatal intensive care and early treatment with oral retinoids, such as the drug Isotretinoin, may improve survival. Early oral retinoid therapy has been shown to soften scales and encourage desquamation. After as little as two weeks of daily oral isotretinoin, fissures in the skin can heal, and plate-like scales can nearly resolve. Improvement in the eclabium and ectropion can also be seen in a matter of weeks. Children who survive the neonatal period usually evolve to a less severe phenotype, resembling a severe congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma. Patients continue to suffer from temperature disregulation and may have heat and cold intolerance. Patients can also have generalized poor hair growth, scarring alopecia, contractures of digits, arthralgias, failure to thrive, hypothyroidism, and short stature. Some patients develop a rheumatoid factor- positive polyarthritis. Survivors can also develop fish-like scales and retention of a waxy, yellowish material in seborrheic areas, with ear adhered to the scalp. The oldest known survivor is Nusrit \\"Nelly\\" Shaheen, who was born in 1984 and is in relatively good health as of March 2017.SNAKE SKIN WOMAN: EXTRAORDINARY PEOPLE, Channel 5, March 22, 2017. The maximum lifespan of patients with this disease has not yet been determined with the new treatments. A study published in 2011 in the Archives of Dermatology concluded: \\"Harlequin ichthyosis should be regarded as a severe chronic disease that is not invariably fatal. With improved neonatal care and probably the early introduction of oral retinoids, the number of survivors is increasing.\\"  Epidemiology  The condition occurs in roughly 1 in 300,000 people. As an autosomal recessive condition, rates are higher among certain ethnic populations with a higher likelihood of consanguinity. History The disease has been known since 1750, and was first described in the diary of Rev. Oliver Hart from Charleston, South Carolina: > \\"On Thursday, April the 5th, 1750, I went to see a most deplorable object of > a child, born the night before of one Mary Evans in 'Chas'town. It was > surprising to all who beheld it, and I scarcely know how to describe it. The > skin was dry and hard and seemed to be cracked in many places, somewhat > resembling the scales of a fish. The mouth was large and round and open. It > had no external nose, but two holes where the nose should have been. The > eyes appeared to be lumps of coagulated blood, turned out, about the bigness > of a plum, ghastly to behold. It had no external ears, but holes where the > ears should be. The hands and feet appeared to be swollen, were cramped up > and felt quite hard. The back part of the head was much open. It made a > strange kind of noise, very low, which I cannot describe. It lived about > forty-eight hours and was alive when I saw it.\\" The harlequin-type designation comes from the diamond shape of the scales at birth (resembling the costume of Arlecchino). Notable cases *Nusrit \\"Nelly\\" Shaheen (born in 1984) is possibly the oldest known survivor; she resides in Coventry, England, and was one of nine children in a Pakistani Muslim household.

He led the unification of the Korean Peninsula by Silla under the reign of King Muyeol of Silla and King Munmu of Silla. He is said to have been the great-grandchild of King Guhae of Geumgwan Gaya, the last ruler of the Geumgwan Gaya state. This would have given him a very high position in the Silla bone rank system, which governed the political and military status that a person could attain. Much of what is known about Kim's life comes from the detailed account in the Samguk Sagi, Yeoljeon 1-3, and the much briefer record in the Samguk Yusa, vol. 1.  Early years  Kim Yu-shin was the son of General Gim Seohyeon (the second son of General Kim Mu-ryeok) and Lady Manmyeong, who was a daughter of Kim Sukheuljong (, King Jinheung of Silla's younger brother). He was born in Gyeyang, Jincheon County in 595, became a Hwarang warrior at just 15 and was an accomplished swordsman and a Gukseon (; Hwarang leader) by the time he was 18 years old. By the age of 34 (in 629) he had been given total command of the Silla armed forces. Three years later, Kim Yu-shin's cousin, Princess Deokman, became Queen Seondeok of Silla and kept Kim Yu-sin as commander in chief of the royal army. During the reign of Queen Seondeok of Silla (632-647), Kim Yu-shin owned ten thousand private soldiers, won many battles against Baekje and became one of the most powerful men in Silla.  Military accomplishments  Equestrian statue of Gim Yu-sin at Hwangseong Park in Gyeongju. Namsan Park, Seoul, South Korea Kim Yu-Shin's first military engagement in command is believed to have occurred around 629 AD, and through it he quickly proved his capabilities as a warrior. Silla was in a constant struggle with its neighbor to the west, Baekje, over territory. There had been gains and losses on both sides, and the struggle lasted for many years. It was during this period that Yu-shin rose through the ranks of the military, rising to the position of general and becoming a skilled field commander. Baekje and Silla had formed an alliance to counter Goguryeo's power and its intentions to push southwards, and together they launched a successful attack on it, Silla taking the northern territory and Baekje the one south of the Han river. But Silla broke the alliance and attacked Baekje in order to claim both territories for itself. After this betrayal, Baekje allied with Goguryeo. When Goguryeo and Baekje attacked Silla in 655, Silla joined forces with Tang Dynasty China to battle the invaders. Although it is not clear when Kim Yu-shin first became a general, he was certainly commanding the Silla forces by this time. Eventually, with the help of the Silla navy and some 130,000 Tang forces, Yushin attacked the Baekje capital, Sabi, in 660, in one of the most famous battles of that century, the Battle of Hwangsanbeol. The Baekje defenders were commanded by none other than General Gyebaek, although the Baekje forces consisted of about 5,000 men and were no match for Yu-Shin's warriors, which numbered about ten times as many. Baekje, which had already been experiencing internal political problems, crumbled. Kim Yu-Shin's Silla forces and their Tang allies now moved on Goguryeo from two directions, and in 661 they attacked the seemingly impregnable Goguryeo kingdom, but were repelled. The attack had weakened Goguryeo, though. In 667 another offensive was launched which, in 668, finally destroyed Goguryeo. Silla still had to subdue various pockets of resistance, but their efforts were then focused on ensuring that their Tang allies did not overstay their welcome on the peninsula. After some difficult conflicts, Silla eventually forced out the Tang troops and united the peninsula under their rule.  Legends  Many stories exist about Kim Yu-Shin. It is told that he once was ordered to subdue a rebel army, but his troops refused to fight as they had seen a large star fall from the sky and took this to be a bad omen. To regain the confidence of his troops, the General used a large kite to carry a fire ball into the sky. The soldiers, seeing the star return to heaven, rallied and defeated the rebels. It is also related how General Kim ingeniously used kites as a means of communication between his troops when they had become divided between islands and the mainland. Kim Yu-Shin spend the night at a courtesan's tavern, when his mother learned of this, she cried and asked Kim Yu-Shin to never set his foot in that kind of place again. One night, Kim Yushin was very drunk, and his horse took him to the courtesan's house. When Kim Yu-Shin woke up, he was so angry thinking that he broke his promise to his mother and slit the horse's throat.  His final years  Throughout his life, Kim Yu-Shin felt that Baekje, Goguryeo, and Silla should not be separate countries but rather united as one. He is regarded as the driving force in the unification of the Korean Peninsula, and is the most famous of all the generals in the unification wars of the Three Kingdoms. Tomb of General Gim Yu-sin in Gyeongju Kim Yu-Shin was rewarded handsomely for his efforts in the campaigns. In 668, King Munmu bestowed upon him the honorary title of Taedaegakgan (Hangul:ÌÉúÎåÄÍ∞ÅÍ∞Ñ Hanja:Â§™Â§ßËßíÂπ≤), something like \\"Supreme Herald of Defense\\" (literally \\"greatest- great-trumpet-shield\\"). He reportedly received a village of over 500 households, and in 669 was given some 142 separate horse farms, spread throughout the kingdom. He died four years later, leaving behind ten children. Kim Yu-Shin lived to the age of 79 and is considered to be one of the most famous generals and masters of Korean swords in Korean history. He is the focus of numerous stories and legends, and is familiar to most Koreans from a very early age. Following his death on 18 August (the 1st day of the 7th lunar month) 673, General Kim was awarded the honorary title of King Heungmu, and was buried at the foot of Songhwa Mountain, near Gyeongju in southeastern Korea, in a tomb as splendid as that of kings.  Family  Kim Yu-Shin had two sisters, Kim Bohee and Kim Moonhee (). Kim Moonhee, later known as Queen Munmyeong (Hangul:Î¨∏Î™ÖÏôïÌõÑ Hanja:ÊñáÊòéÁéãÂêé), married Yushin's friend Kim Chunchu, King Taejong Muyeol of Silla, who is credited for having led the unification of the Korean peninsula under Silla. Muyeol and Munmyeong were the parents of King Munmu of Silla and Gim Inmun. Kim Yu-Shin's third wife, Lady Jiso (Hanja:Êô∫ÁÇ§Â§´‰∫∫), was the third daughter of King Muyeol of Silla. Yushin had ten children. His second son, Kim Won-sul, would later play a central role in completing the independence of Silla from the Tang Dynasty.  Legacy  According to Samguk Sagi, Kim Yu-Shin was the descendant of Shaohao.„Äé‰∏âÂúãÂè≤Ë®ò„ÄèÂàóÂÇ≥ Á¨¨‰∏ÄÔºöÈáëÂ∫æ‰ø° ‰∏ä :ÈáëÂ∫æ‰ø° Áéã‰∫¨‰∫∫‰πü ÂçÅ‰∫å‰∏ñÁ•ñÈ¶ñÈú≤ ‰∏çÁü•‰ΩïË®±‰∫∫‰πü ‰ª•ÂæåÊº¢Âª∫Ê≠¶ÂçÅÂÖ´Âπ¥Â£¨ÂØÖ ÁôªÈæúÂ≥Ø ÊúõÈßïÊ¥õ‰πùÊùë ÈÅÇËá≥ÂÖ∂Âú∞ ÈñãÂúã ËôüÊõ∞Âä†ËÄ∂ ÂæåÊîπÁà≤ÈáëÂÆòÂúã ÂÖ∂Â≠êÂ≠´Áõ∏Êâø Ëá≥‰πù‰∏ñÂ≠´‰ªá‰∫• Êàñ‰∫ë‰ªáÊ¨°‰ºë ÊñºÂ∫æ‰ø°Áà≤ÊõæÁ•ñ ÁæÖ‰∫∫Ëá™Ë¨ÇÂ∞ëÊòäÈáëÂ§©Ê∞è‰πãÂæå ÊïÖÂßìÈáë Â∫æ‰ø°Á¢ë‰∫¶‰∫ë ËªíËΩÖ‰πãË£î Â∞ëÊòä‰πãËÉ§ ÂâáÂçóÂä†ËÄ∂ÂßãÁ•ñÈ¶ñÈú≤ ËàáÊñ∞ÁæÖÂêåÂßì‰πü Today, Kim Yu-Shin is remembered by Koreans as one of the greatest generals in Korean history.

Late in January she was ordered to form a \\"wolfpack\\" with and and patrol the western approaches to Balabac Strait and the southern entrance to Palawan Passage. On 3 February, Barbel sent a message reporting that she had been attacked three times by enemy aircraft dropping depth charges and would transmit further information on the following night. Barbel was never heard from again. Japanese aviators reported an attack on a submarine off southwest Palawan on 4 February. Two bombs were dropped and one landed on the submarine near the bridge. The sub plunged, under a cloud of fire and spray. This was very likely the last engagement of Barbel. She was officially reported lost on 16 February 1945. Awards Barbel received three battle stars for her World War II service. Memorials The Barbel has a War memorial in the Oregon Trail Veterans Cemetery in Casper, Wyoming.

Its name derives from Old English Eadhelmsbrigge (meaning \\"Eadhelm's Bridge\\"). It is located on the Kent /Surrey border on the upper floodplain of the River Medway and gives its name to the latter's tributary, the River Eden. The town has a population of around 9,000. History The old town of Edenbridge in 2018 The old part of the town grew along a section of the otherwise disused Roman road, the London to Lewes Way at the point where it crossed the river. Iron slag from iron smelting in the surrounding area was used in building the road. In the Middle Ages it became a centre of the Wealden iron industry. There are many mediaeval timber buildings in the town, one of which houses the Eden Valley Museum. With the coming of the railways the town expanded and the community of Marlpit Hill, north of the original settlement, is now part of the town. Owing to its position on the River Eden floodplain, the centre of the town is prone to severe flooding. The worst flood occurred in 1958, before any flood defences were built, and led to enormous damage to Edenbridge High Street. Ten years later in 1968, despite the Eden having been dredged to prevent the same occurrence, the town was once again flooded after heavy storms. Although there were no fatalities, a helicopter was needed to save a man from his flooded home. Local legend has it that he hadn't noticed the flood waters rising, having been too engrossed in The Forsyte Saga on television. More adequate flood defences have been built since then, with the local community now well prepared to deal with possible flooding. Mills Edenbridge has had four mills over the centuries, Haxted Mill and Honour's Mill on the River Eden, Christmas Mill on a tributary of the Eden, and a windmill to the south of the town. All four mill buildings survive, but now converted to other uses. Railways There are two railway stations serving Edenbridge. The earliest, on the South Eastern Railway (SER) route from Redhill to Tonbridge, was opened on 26 May 1842. The station, simply named Edenbridge, is located in Marlpit Hill. To the west of that station the route crosses what was once the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway main line from London to Tunbridge Wells and Eastbourne (via Lewes), opened on 2 January 1888. The crossing of the two lines takes place at a mid- break in the Edenbridge Tunnel on the SER line. The second station, named Edenbridge Town is about a mile South-east of this point. The line serving it is now truncated at Uckfield. There is no connection here between the two routes: Edenbridge is not a junction; one existed four miles (6 km) to the west of Edenbridge Town at Crowhurst, but that junction with the Oxted to East Grinstead line no longer exists. Severe damage to the embankments of both the SER line and the East Grinstead line occurred following the excessive rains in the winter of 2019/2020 but was repaired after extensive works by end of March 2020 All services at both stations are operated by Southern, which manages both stations. Edenbridge Station is served by an hourly shuttle service (half-hourly during the peak periods) between and . Edenbridge Town Station is served by an hourly service (half-hourly during the peak periods) between and . On Sundays this service terminates at instead of London Bridge. Town Edenbridge is twinned with Mont-Saint-Aignan in France. The inner relief road that was built in the early 2000s to relieve traffic pressure on the old, narrow High Street is named Mont St Aignan Way. There are now no banks in the town, (just a mobile bank at the small Thursday market) a post office next to St Lawrence's RC church and a number of major retail chains. Despite being a relatively small town, Edenbridge still has its own hospital - The Edenbridge War Memorial Hospital. Initially a cottage hospital built to care for soldiers returning from The First World War, a purpose built building was established to the south of the town in 1931. With an Out Patients Department, Physiotherapy facilities and a Minor Injuries Unit the hospital is a major part of the fabric of the town. In recent years the hospital has been faced with closure many times, on each occasion it has been saved by local campaigners and townspeople, who see the hospital as an essential part of the community. It is now planned to replace it with a new GP centre with day surgery facilities. Parish and places of worship Church of St. Peter and St. Paul The 13th-century Anglican parish church is dedicated to St Peter and St Paul. The Grade II*-listed building has a set of windows by Sir Edward Burne-Jones in the east wall. The church contains examples of medieval graffiti including ritual protection marks such as the VV symbol. A Baptist chapel on the High Street was registered for marriages in 1860. It was the home of the Edenbridge Baptist Church, which re-combined with its 'daughter' church at Marlpit Hill in 2003 to form the Eden Church, which moved in 2013 to The Eden Centre Roman Catholics worship at St Lawrence's Church, registered in 1933. Also in the parish is the hamlet of Marsh Green. Two places of worship are located here: St John's United Reformed Church and a Kingdom Hall which serves the Oxted Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses. It was registered for marriages in 1999. The Grade II-listed former Ebenezer Chapel, used by Independent Calvinists and later by Strict Baptists, stands on Edenbridge High Street. It is now a community caf√© and meeting place In the Marlpit Hill area of the town, St Paulinus' Church Centre was used for worship and as a village hall, but has an uncertain future. Nearby, Marlpit Hill Baptist Church (built in the late 19th century) re-combined with its former parent (see above) to form the Eden Church and the building has been demolished to be replaced by housing.

Biography Daniell was born in London. In 1831 he became the first professor of chemistry at the newly founded King's College London; and in 1835 he was appointed to the equivalent post at the East India Company's Military Seminary at Addiscombe, Surrey. His name is best known for his invention of the Daniell cell,Philosophical Transactions, 1836. an element of an electric battery much better than voltaic cells. He also invented the dew-point hygrometer known by his name,Quarterly Journal of Science, 1820. and a register pyrometer;Philosophical Transactions, 1830. and in 1830 he erected in the hall of the Royal Society a water-barometer, with which he carried out a large number of observations.Philosophical Transactions, 1832. A process devised by him for the manufacture of illuminating gas from turpentine and resin was in use in New York City for a time. In 1842 he was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Civil Law by the University of Oxford. Publications Daniell's publications included Meteorological Essays (1823), an Essay on Artificial Climate considered in its Applications to Horticulture (1824), which showed the necessity of a humid atmosphere in hothouses devoted to tropical plants, and an Introduction to the Study of Chemical Philosophy (1839). Lectures In 1840 he was invited to deliver the Royal Institution Christmas Lecture on The First Principles of Franklinic Electricity. Death and commemoration Daniell died suddenly of apoplexy in London in March 1845, while attending a meeting of the council of the Royal Society, of which he had become a fellow in 1813 and Foreign Secretary in 1839.

In Taoism, when so ordered by heaven, Leigong punishes both earthly mortals guilty of secret crimes and evil spirits who have used their knowledge of Taoism to harm human beings. He carries a drum and mallet to produce thunder, and a chisel to punish evildoers. Leigong rides a chariot driven by a young boy named A Xiang. Since Leigong's power is thunder, he has assistants capable of producing other types of heavenly phenomena. Leigong's wife Dianmu is the goddess of lightning, who is said to have used flashing mirrors to send bolts of lightning across the sky.TIAN-MU on Godchecker Other companions are Yun Tong (\\"Cloud Youth\\"), who whips up clouds, and Yu Shi (\\"Rain Master\\") who causes downpours by dipping his sword into a pot. Roaring winds rush forth from a type of goatskin bag manipulated by Fengbo (\\"Earl of Wind\\"), who was later transformed into Feng Po Po (\\"Lady Wind\\"). Iconography Statue of Leigong in Tainan Fengshen Temple ( the temple of Wind-god). Leigong is depicted as a fearsome creature with claws, bat wings, and a blue face with a bird's beak who wears only a loincloth. Temples dedicated to him are rare, but some people honor him in the hope that he will take revenge on their personal enemies. He used to smile a lot and also wore a friendly face. Legend Leigong began life as a mortal. While on earth, he encountered a peach tree that originated from Heaven during the struggle between the Fox Demon and one of the Celestial Warriors. When Leigong took a bite out of one of its fruit he was transformed into his godly form. He soon received a mace and a hammer that could create thunder. The Jade Emperor told Leigong to kill bad people. But the sky got really dark whenever he struck people. So sometimes he kills the wrong people since he can't see. Dianmu was once a human. She lives with her mother. One day she was dumping the husk of rice because it's too hard for her mother to eat it. Leigong gets angry easily, so when he saw her dumping the husk out he thought she's wasting food so he killed her. The Jade Emperor found out and got angry that he killed the wrong person again. So the Jade Emperor revived Dianmu and made her into a goddess. Also told Dianmu to marry him. He killed her so it's his fault and his responsibility to take care of her now. Dianmu's job is to work with Leigong. She uses mirrors to shine light onto earth so Leigong can see who he hits and makes sure they aren't innocent. This is why lightning comes first.

Its main effect is to reduce the activity of the vagus nerve, which is a nerve that activates the vomiting center in the medulla oblongata. It does not have much effect on vomiting due to motion sickness. This drug does not have any effect on dopamine receptors or muscarinic receptors. Granisetron was developed by chemists working at the British drug company Beecham around 1988 and is available as a generic. It is produced by Roche Laboratories under the trade name Kytril. The drug was approved in the United Kingdom in 1991 and in United States in 1994 by the FDA. A granisetron transdermal patch with the trade name Sancuso was approved by the US FDA on September 12, 2008. Sancuso is manufactured by 3M Drug Delivery Systems for Kyowa Kirin, Inc. Granisetron is metabolized slowly by the liver, giving it a longer than average half-life. One dose usually lasts 4 to 9 hours and is usually administered once or twice daily. This drug is removed from the body by the liver and kidneys. It was patented in 1985 and approved for medical use in 1991. Medical uses=Chemotherapy It may be used for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and appears to work about the same as ondansetron. The most common side- effects of chemotherapy treatment are nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. This is one type of drug that a doctor can prescribe to prevent, lessen, or relieve discomfort. Post operative A number of medications including granisetron appear to be effective in controlling post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV). It is unclear if it is more or less effective than other agents such as droperidol, metoclopramide, ondansetron or cyclizine.  Gastroparesis  The granisetron patch (Sancuso) has been studied for use in gastroparesis, though it is not FDA approved for this indication. Other * Is a possible therapy for nausea and vomiting due to acute or chronic medical illness or acute gastroenteritis * Treatment of cyclic vomiting syndrome although there are no formal trials to confirm efficacy. Adverse effects Granisetron is a well-tolerated drug with few side effects. Headache, dizziness, and constipation are the most commonly reported side effects associated with its use. There have been no significant drug interactions reported with this drug's use. It is broken down by the liver's cytochrome P450 system and it has little effect on the metabolism of other drugs broken down by this system. Extended release An extended release injectable version of granisetron, known as Sustol is also available in the United States as of 2016.Drugs.com Heron Therapeutics Announces FDA Approval of Sustol (granisetron) Extended- Release Injection for the Prevention of Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting The long acting form is used for the treatment of both acute and delayed CINV in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and anthrocycline and/or cyclophosphamide (AC) highly emetogenic regimens. In its review, the FDA did not grant the broad HEC label to the drug citing the focus on AC regimens, primarily breast-cancer, and lack of data.FDA.gov Sustol Prescribing Information.

The term is also interchangeable with the geographically weighted PCAs in geophysics. The i th basis function is chosen to be orthogonal to the basis functions from the first through i ‚àí 1, and to minimize the residual variance. That is, the basis functions are chosen to be different from each other, and to account for as much variance as possible. The method of EOF analysis is similar in spirit to harmonic analysis, but harmonic analysis typically uses predetermined orthogonal functions, for example, sine and cosine functions at fixed frequencies. In some cases the two methods may yield essentially the same results. The basis functions are typically found by computing the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the data set. A more advanced technique is to form a kernel out of the data, using a fixed kernel. The basis functions from the eigenvectors of the kernel matrix are thus non-linear in the location of the data (see Mercer's theorem and the kernel trick for more information).

These beetles are elongate, in size ranging from 5‚Äì8 mm, and color ranging from a reddish brown to black. Both the thorax and the elytra are deeply grooved lengthwise, thus giving these beetles their common name. The head is also grooved, and posteriorly constricted into a short but visible \\"neck\\". The 11-segment antennae are short, resembling a string of beads, while the mandibles lack cutting edges and are thus nonfunctional. The front legs are short and strongly built, Adults and larvae live in moist rotten wood that is infested with slime moulds, which are believed to be their diet. Instead of using their mandibles to bite, they use the anterior edge of the mentum and swivel their heads to cut off pieces of food. Adults do not make burrows, instead just squeezing between the cell layers of the decomposed wood, generally leaving no visible trace of their passage, while larvae live in short tunnels. They occur on all continents with forested areas, the richest fauna being found in New Guinea, Indonesia, the Philippines, and northern South America. Classification remains controversial, with specialist Ross T. Bell arguing for placement as a tribe Rhysodini of Carabidae, while R. G. Beutel and others argue that larval characteristics indicate that rhysodids are their own family. Recent DNA analysis supports the placement of Rhysodidae within the family Carabidae. The following genera have generally been treated as members of the family Rhysodidae, but are now sometimes considered members of Carabidae instead. * Arrowina Bell & Bell, 1978 (Palearctic, Indomalaya) * Clinidium Kirby 1835 * Dhysores Grouvelle 1903 (Africa) * Grouvellina Bell & Bell 1978 (Madagascar, Comoros) * Kaveinga Bell & Bell 1978 (Australasia) * Kupeus Bell & Bell 1982 (New Zealand) * Leoglymmius Bell & Bell, 1978 (Australia) * Medisores Bell & Bell, 1987 (South Africa) * Neodhysores Bell & Bell 1978 (South America) * Omoglymmius Ganglbauer, 1891 * Plesioglymmius Bell & Bell, 1978 * Rhysodes Germar 1822 (Paleac) * Rhyzodiastes Fairmaire 1895 * Shyrodes Grouvelle, 1903 (Indomalaya) * Sloanoglymmius Bell & Bell, 1991 (Australia) * Srimara Bell & Bell, 1978 (Vietnam) * Tangarona Bell & Bell 1982 (New Zealand) * Xhosores Bell & Bell, 1978 (South Africa) * Yamatosa Bell & Bell, 1979 References * Ross H.

It is part of the Midlands Region and is also located in the province of Leinster. It is named after the ancient Kingdom of U√≠ Failghe and was formerly known as King's County. Offaly County Council is the local authority for the county. The county population was 77,961 at the 2016 census.  Geography and political subdivisions  Offaly is the 18th largest of Ireland's 32 counties by area and the 24th largest in terms of population. It is the fifth largest of Leinster's 12 counties by size and the 10th largest by population.  Physical geography  The Slieve Bloom Mountains Bluebells and trees in Charleville Forest Tullamore is the county town and largest town in Offaly and is the 30th largest in Ireland. Offaly borders seven counties: Galway, Roscommon, Tipperary, Laois, Westmeath, Kildare and Meath. The Slieve Bloom Mountains are in the southern part of the county on the border with County Laois. Offaly has the 24th highest county peak in Ireland. The highest point is Arderin () in the Slieve Blooms at . The Slieve Bloom Mountains contain the county's highest points including Stillbrook Hill and Wolftrap Mountain which are the county's second and third highest peaks. Croghan Hill rises from the Bog of Allen and is located in northern Offaly. Although only 234 metres high, it is known for its view over the surrounding area and it stands out by itself. The floodplain of the River Shannon is in the north-western part of the county. The River Camcor runs through the town of Birr and is a Wild Trout Conservation Area. The River Brosna runs across the county from Lough Owel in Westmeath to Shannon Harbour. Silver River runs through several towns in the south of the county before joining Brosna near the town of Ferbane. The Grand Canal also runs across the county from Edenderry on the north-east to Shannon Harbour before joining the Shannon. The county contains many small lakes from Lough Boora to Pallas Lake and it also contains 42 hectares of swamp land. There are a number Eskers in the counties landscape including Esker Riada. Offaly largely comprises a flat landscape and is known for its extensive bog and peatlands. There are many large bogs in Offaly including the Bog of Allen, Clara bog, Boora bog and Raheenmore Bog which are spread out across the county with the Bog of Allen extending into four other counties. The county consists of approximately 42,000 hectares of peatlands which is 21% of Offaly's total land area. Offaly contains approximately of forest and woodland area, which only amounts to 4.5% of the county's land area. This includes woodlands within the Slieve Blooms and the Lough Boora Parklands. Roughly 75% of Offaly's forested area is Conifer High Forest.

The council is responsible for local services such as housing policy, social and cultural services, economic development and planning, motor taxation and infrastructural policy in the county. Under the Local Government Reform Act 2014 the number of councillors was reduced to 19 from 21. The reforms also reduced the number of electoral areas to three: Tullamore (7 members), Birr (6 members) and Edenderry (6 members).. Until the 2011 general election Offaly was part of the Laois‚ÄìOffaly constituency which elected five TDs to the D√°il. Between 1921 and 2011 this consisted of the full territory of both counties. For the 2011 general election some electoral divisions in South Offaly were part of Tipperary North. The Electoral (Amendment) (D√°il Constituencies) Act 2013 established a new constituency called Offaly for the 2016 general election. The constituency incorporates all of Offaly from the previous Laois‚ÄìOffaly constituency, and 24 electoral divisions from Tipperary North. This constituency elected 3 TDs to the D√°il. It was abolished in 2020 Since the 2020 general election, Laois‚ÄìOffaly became a 5-seat constituency again.Laois Offaly constituency return for next general election History Clonmacnoise Monastery One of the earliest known settlements in County Offaly is at Boora bog which dates back to the Mesolithic era. Excavations here provide evidence of a temporary settlement as no structures were found at the site. Stone axes, arrow heads and blades were discovered which date to between 6,800 ‚Äì 6,000 BCE. The Dowris Hoard dating from the Late Bronze Age was found in a bog at Dowris, Whigsborough near Birr. It is the largest collection of Bronze Age objects ever found in Ireland. It includes more than 200 items of which roughly 190 are extant, 111 in the National Museum of Ireland and 79 in the British Museum. Forty four spearheads were found, forty-three axes, twenty-four trumpets, and forty-four crotals (a kind of bell or chime instrument, unique to Ireland). A bronze bucket was also found, it was constructed of sheets of bronze riveted together, this item is considered to be an imported item, two other buckets were also found and these are presumed to be native copies. After Christianisation, the monastic complex of Clonmacnoise was erected at the River Shannon near Shannonbridge. It is today a significant tourist destination. The county itself was formed following the Tudor plantations of Laois and Offaly in an attempt by the English Crown to expand its sphere of influence in Ireland which had declined following the Norman Conquest of Ireland. Both Laois (Leix) and Offaly (U√≠ Failghe) were petty kingdoms in Gaelic Ireland located just outside the Pale (a region around Dublin and the mid east of Ireland that remained loyal to the English Crown following the Norman Conquest). The older kingdoms of Leix and U√≠ Failghe are not coterminous with the present day counties that were formed. The Kingdom of U√≠ Failghe from which the name Offaly is derived, was ruled by the √ì Conchobhair Failghe (anglicised as: O'Conor Faly) whose territory extended from the east of the county into north Kildare. The Kingdom of Firceall ruled by the O'Molloy clan constituted much of the centre of the county. The Kingdom of Firceall was part of the Kingdom of Meath while U√≠ Failghe was part of the Kingdom of Leinster. Much of the south of the present day county (as well as northern County Tipperary) was ruled by √ì Cearbhaill of √âile (anglicised as: O'Carroll Ely). Ely formed part of the Kingdom of Munster. These petty kingdoms were swept aside by the Tudor plantations. In 1556, an Act of the Parliament of Ireland created \\"King's County\\", named after Philip, the then king of Ireland.3 & 4 Phil & Mar, c.2 (1556) This replaced the old Kingdoms with Baronies and the present day County System. Despite the county's name being upheld as Offaly through the 2001 Local Government Act, no legislation was ever enacted after independence explicitly changing the name from King's County, the name formally established under the 1898 Local Government Act which continued to have legal effect. Legal transfers and assignments of land in the county still refer to it as \\"King's County\\".

The Central Statistics Office estimates that the increase in population between 2002 and 2006 (7,205) comprised a natural increase of 2,026 people with the balance of 5,179 accounted for by net in-migration from within Ireland as well as abroad. The population increased by 11.3% between 2002 and 2006 which was a greater rate than the national average rate of 8.2%. This may be attributed to the county's proximity to the Greater Dublin Area, increased accessibility to Dublin (M6, M7, and improved rail services) and lower house prices than in Dublin. The population of many towns rose during the period 1996 to 2006: Birr +21.5%, Tullamore +28.8% and Edenderry +53.9%. The population of Portarlington increased by 50.1% between 2002 and 2006. The population as of census 2016 was 77,961 people with 34.7% (27,085 people) under the age of 25 and 13.6% (10,951 people) over the age of 65. Economy Commercial peat extraction was traditionally the largest industry in the county Traditionally, agriculture and industry have been the main driving force of the economy in the county. Offaly has extensive bogland, particularly in the northern parts of the county, that forms part of the Bog of Allen. Bord na M√≥na was founded in 1946 and provided employment to hundreds of people in Offaly by making peat briquettes (for home domestic use) and supplying peat to power stations operated by ESB. Peat briquettes are currently made at the Bord na M√≥na factory at Derrinlough near Birr. Power stations are operating at Shannonbridge and Edenderry. With the continuing depletion of the bogs a number of power stations have closed down in recent years. The ESB power station at Lumcloon, Ferbane was a major employer in the midlands but closed in 2001. Rhode power station closed down soon afterwards. These were major landmarks in Offaly with large cooling towers that were visible for miles around Offaly and beyond, but were demolished soon after the stations closed. Many bogs are now used as wildlife reserves or for tourism activities such as Lough Boora. The opening of the Grand Canal in the 18th century brought prosperity to towns such as Banagher and Tullamore. Both towns were important stops on the Dublin to Limerick navigation which supported a number of industries and brought cheap and efficient water transport to the county in that era. The Celtic Tiger also brought an increase in economic activity to Offaly with business enterprise and industrial parks opening in Birr, Edenderry and Tullamore. Many people particularly in the east of the county are within an easy commuting distance to Dublin where many find employment. Infrastructure=TransportRail= Clara railway station Offaly is well served by rail transport. Railway stations are located at Tullamore and Clara. Both stations are on the main Dublin-Westport/Galway railway line with regular trains serving the area especially for Dublin commuters. Portarlington railway station is located just over the County Laois border and is in a catchment area for the south east of the county. Portarlington railway station is on the main Dublin-Cork railway line with regular commuter services to Heuston Station, Dublin and intercity services to Cork, Limerick, Killarney & Tralee. The Limerick-Ballybrophy railway line travels through the south of the county however there are no railway stations on the line in County Offaly. The nearest stations are located at Cloughjordan and Roscrea both just outside the county boundary. A railway line from Birr connected to the line at Roscrea until it was closed in the 1960s. A controversial railway line also connected Birr to Portumna between 1868 and 1878, and became something of a folk legend. =Road= Road network of Offaly Three main national secondary routes pass through the county. The N52 road passes from Kilbeggan to Tullamore and Birr which then continues to Nenagh where it intersects with the M7. The N62 from Athlone passes through Ferbane and Birr and continues onto Roscrea and Thurles. The N80 route starts in Tullamore and continues to the south east passing through Portlaoise and Carlow. There are no main national primary routes in the county, however, the M6 skirts the county to the north and the M7 skirts the county to the south through Moneygall. Road infrastructure has improved with the completion of the Tullamore bypass in 2009 and improved access to regional cities following completion of the intercity motorway network. =Bus= Bus √âireann provide public transport services throughout the county with regular bus services to Limerick and Waterford from Athlone bus station. Other private bus coach services provide direct bus services from Birr to Dublin such as Kearns bus service who run several services daily. Slieve Bloom Coaches run services from Tullamore and Portarlington to Dublin. Radio transmitter in Ballycommon =Waterway= The Grand Canal connecting Dublin to the river Shannon was constructed through the towns of Edenderry and Tullamore and joins the Shannon at Shannon Harbour. Traditionally this was an important route for transport, communication and trade between Dublin, Limerick and the midlands of Ireland. The route fell into decline as road transport became more popular. Much of the route is now used for boating and leisure activities. MediaRadio= Midlands 103 (originally Midlands Radio 3) which broadcasts to Laois, Offaly and Westmeath is based in Tullamore and has studios across the midlands. RT√â's medium wave transmitter broadcasting RT√â Radio 1 was also located in Tullamore but transmission stopped in 2008. =Print= A number of local newspapers are published in Offaly. The Offaly Independent and Tullamore Tribune are based in Tullamore. The Midland Tribune based in Birr covers local news in the west and south of the county as well as parts of northern Tipperary including the towns of Birr, Roscrea and Nenagh and surrounding areas. The Offaly Express was a former newspaper based in Tullamore. It closed down in July 2012 after 29 years in operation. It is now an on line news platform for the county at www.offalyexpress.ie Sport=GAA Seir Kieran GAA hurlers, 1938 Gaelic games are popular in the county. Offaly GAA consists of some 44 clubs playing Gaelic football and hurling in communities throughout the county. Birr is generally considered a hurling stronghold with Birr GAA winning four All- Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championships. County teams have also had national success in both hurling and football, winning the Liam MacCarthy Cup four times and the Sam Maguire Cup three times. The football team is perhaps best known for the Seamus Darby goal in the dying minutes of the 1982 football final when Offaly took the title by one point denying Kerry an historic five All-Ireland titles in a row.

The original software was implemented by Gary Chevsky, from his own design. Warthen, Chevsky, Justin Grant, and others built the early AskJeeves.com website around that core engine. In 2006, the \\"Jeeves\\" name was dropped and they refocused on the search engine, which had its own algorithm. In late 2010, facing insurmountable competition from more popular search engines like Google, the company outsourced its web search technology and returned to its roots as a question and answer site. Douglas Leeds was elevated from president to CEO in 2010. Ask.com has been criticized for its browser toolbar, which has been accused of behaving like malware due to its bundling with other software and the difficulty of its uninstallation. Three venture capital firms, Highland Capital Partners, Institutional Venture Partners, and The RODA Group were early investors. Ask.com is currently owned by InterActiveCorp (IAC) under the NASDAQ symbol , and its corporate headquarters are located at 555 City Center, in the Oakland City Center development in downtown Oakland, California. History leftAsk.com was originally known as Ask Jeeves, \\"Jeeves\\" being the name of a \\"gentleman's personal gentleman\\", or valet, fetching answers to any question asked. The character was named after Bertie Wooster's Valet character Jeeves, in the fictional works of P. G. Wodehouse. The original idea behind Ask Jeeves was to allow users to get answers to questions posed in everyday, natural language, as well as by traditional keyword searching. The current Ask.com still supports this, with support for math, dictionary, and conversion questions. Ask Jeeves launched in beta in mid-April 1997 and fully launched on June 1, 1997. On September 18, 2001, Ask Jeeves acquired Teoma for over $1.5 million. In July 2005, Ask Jeeves was acquired by IAC. In February 2006, Jeeves was removed from Ask Jeeves and the search engine rebranded to Ask.

Ask.com now reaches 100 million global users per month through its website with more than 2 million downloads of its flagship mobile app. The company has also released additional apps spun out of its Q&A; experience, including Ask Around in 2011 and PollRoll in 2012. Search engine shut-down In 2010, Ask.com abandoned the search industry, with the loss of 130 search engineering jobs, because it could not compete against more popular search engines such as Google. Earlier in the year, Ask had launched a Q&A; community for generating answers from real people as opposed to search algorithms then combined this with its question-and‚Äìanswer repository, utilizing its extensive history of archived query data to search sites that provide answers to questions people have. To avoid a situation in which no answers were available from its own resources, the company outsourced to an unnamed third-party search provider the comprehensive web search matches that it had gathered itself. Ask Sponsored Listings Formerly the direct sales engine for Ask.com, Ask Sponsored Listings is no longer available, having merged with Sendori, an operating business of IAC, in 2011.

In July 2005, the ASKJ ticker was retired upon the acquisition by IAC, valuing at US$1.85 billion. In 2012 Ask.com made two acquisitions as part of a larger strategy to offer more content on the Ask.com website. On July 2, 2012, Ask.com purchased content discovery start-up nRelate, for an undisclosed amount. That was followed by the company's acquisition of expert advice and information site About.com, which closed in September 2012. On August 14, 2014, Ask.com acquired popular social networking website ASKfm, where users can ask other users questions, with the option of anonymity. As of August 14, 2014, Ask.fm had 180 million monthly unique users in more than 150 countries around the world, with its largest user base in the United States. Available on the web and as a mobile app, ASKfm generates an estimated 20,000 questions per minute with approximately 45 percent of its mobile monthly active users logging in daily. To date, the mobile app has been downloaded more than 40 million times. Marketing and promotion Apostolos Gerasoulis, the co- creator of Ask's Teoma algorithmic search technology, starred in four television advertisements in 2007, extolling the virtues of Ask.com's usefulness for information relevance. A Jeeves balloon appeared in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade through 2000‚Äì2004. After a hiatus from mass consumer marketing, Ask returned to TV advertising in the fall of 2011 after refocusing its site on questions and answers. Instead of national advertising, Ask focused on local markets. In the summer of 2012, Ask launched a national cinema campaign, along with other out-of-home tactics in certain markets such as New York and Seattle. As part of a Seattle-based local market effort, Ask.com launched its ‚ÄúYou Asked We Answered‚Äù campaign in 2012, in which the company ‚Äúanswered‚Äù residents' top complaints about living in their city, including easing morning commutes and stadium traffic, as well as keeping the local Parks and Rec department wading pools open. On January 14, 2009, Ask.com became the official sponsor of 2000 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Champion Bobby Labonte's No. 96 Ford. Ask would become the official search engine of NASCAR. Ask.com was the primary sponsor for the No. 96 for 18 of the first 21 races and had rights to increase this to a total of 29 races that season. The Ask.com car debuted in the 2009 Bud Shootout where it failed to finish the race, but subsequently returned strongly, placing as high as 5th in a March 1, 2009 Shelby 427 race at Las Vegas Motor Speedway.

Origins The English Ford company had developed the car and introduced it in 1932 as the Ford Model Y. The German- built version, renamed Ford K√∂ln to stress the vehicle's German provenance, was first seen at the 1933 Berlin Motor Show. The name came from the German name for the city of Cologne. The early cars were built with components and other support from the company's English associate, but during the first year of production componentry was increasingly sourced locally. Evolution Subsequently the German company offered alternative bodied cars of its own design, including notably, for 1934/35, a cheap open topped \\"Cabrio-Limousine\\" that used timber frame construction with synthetic leather covering after the manner of some of the smaller DKWs and Adlers. This bargain basement special was promoted as a \\"car for everyman\\" (\\"Wagen f√ºr Jedermann\\") and priced in 1935 at 1,850 Marks, which was 360 Marks less than the manufacturer's advertised price for the normally bodied two-door sedan/saloon. Technical specification The K√∂ln had a four-cylinder, four-stroke engine of 933 cc giving 21 hp (16 kW) at 3400 rpm. The top speed was . It had a three-speed gearbox (plus reverse) with synchromesh on second and third gear. It was a small car weighing, in bare chassis form, only : an empty car with a body fitted weighed between and . Commercial Public response to the car was lukewarm due to a rigid axle based front suspension and a perpendicular body style which was by now perceived as old fashioned. In its class the car faced heavy competition, mainly from Opel, DKW and Adler: commercially the Ford K√∂ln, with 11,121 cars produced between 1933 and 1936, was not a great success. Adler produced 24,013 of their similarly sized Trumpf Juniors in less than two years between 1934 and 1935. Ford K√∂ln volumes were also disappointing when compared with the 153,117 produced by Ford of Britain of the equivalent model. In 1935 the Ford K√∂ln was replaced by the Ford Eifel which was a larger car (based on the British Model C).

Located near the towns of Oswestry, Whitchurch and Wrexham. It is notable for its proximity to a number of prominent Meres. History Ellesmere Castle was probably an 11th-century motte-and-bailey castle most likely built by either Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, or his son Roger the Poitevin at Castlefields overlooking the Mere. Only its earthworks now remain, with the top of the motte being used for the bowling green, which still commands a fine view. In 1114, King Henry I gave Ellesmere to William Peverel as a part of the Maelor, which included Overton & Whittington at that time. His descendants retained Ellesmere until apparently the late 1140s when the lordship was acquired, probably by force, by Madog ap Maredudd of Powys. Madog died in 1160 and Ellesmere came into the hands of King Henry II. In 1177 King Henry II gave the manors of Ellesmere and Hales in England to Dafydd ab Owain Gwynedd (who already had a castle at Rhuddlan and was, by this time, the sole ruler of Gwynedd. Earlier, in the summer of 1174, Dafydd had married Emme of Anjou, half sister of Henry, and sister of Hamelin de Warenne, Earl of Surrey, both illegitimate children of Geoffrey V, Count of Anjou). Dafydd remained Lord of Ellesmere until his death in 1203. In mid-April 1205, Llywelyn the Great married Joan, Lady of Wales illegitimate daughter of King John and Ellesmere was given to them as a wedding gift. Llywelyn's mother was Marared (Margaret), daughter of Madog ap Maredudd, Prince of Powys. There is evidence that, after her first husband Iorwerth's death, Marared married in the summer of 1197, Gwion, the nephew of Roger Powys of Whittington Castle. She seems to have pre-deceased her husband, after bearing him a son, David ap Gwion, and therefore there can be no truth in the story that she later married into the Corbet family of Caus Castle (near Westbury, Shropshire) and later, Moreton Corbet Castle. Ellesmere was ordered to be attacked by King Henry III in 1231, but Llywelyn retained control of the lordship until his death in 1240. In 1241 King Henry III ordered John le Strange to repair the wooden castle of Ellesmere. The lordship appears to have later passed into the hands of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd or his brother Dafydd ap Gruffydd, grandsons of Llywelyn ab Iorwerth and last of the native Princes of Wales. The castle fell to royal troops from Chester during March 1282. In 1287, Oliver Ingham, who was an English commander and administrator in Aquitaine during the War of Saint-Sardos and early Hundred Years War was born in Ellesmere. His daughter Joan married Robert (\\"Roger\\") le Strange, 4th Baron Strange, son of Lord Strange of Knockin & Isolda de Walton. By 1294, the preceptory of Dolgynwal (Ysbyty Ifan, Denbighshire, on the banks of the River Conwy) had been united with Halston, which was subsequently the administrative centre for all Knights Hospitaller estates in North Wales. Dolgynwal, which had been founded c. 1190, had acquired Ellesmere Church, its most substantial property, from Llywelyn the Great in 1225 In 1435, Griffin Kynaston, Seneschal of the Lordship of Ellesmere, (born at Stocks of landed gentry ‚Äì descended from the princes of Powys), gave evidence at Shrewsbury to confirm the age of John Burgh, Lord of Mowthey, sponsored by Lord John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, Lieutenant of Ireland. Griffin's fourth son, Sir Roger Kynaston, was appointed for life as Escheator and Sheriff of Merioneth and became Constable of Harlech Castle and Sheriff of Shropshire. Humphrey Kynaston, the son of Roger and his second wife Elizabeth Grey was, in 1491, declared an outlaw by King Henry VII and took shelter in a cave in the west point of Nesscliffe Rock, called to this day \\"Kynaston's Cave\\". He was pardoned in 1493. The former Marcher Lordship of Ellesmere (formerly a Hundred in its own right) was annexed to Shropshire and the Hundred of Pymhill by section 11 of the Laws in Wales Act 1535. Francis Egerton, 1st Earl of Ellesmere and Viscount Brackley, was born Lord Francis Leveson-Gower, in Ellesmere in 1800. A patron of the arts, in 1848 he purchased at auction for 355 guineas from the estate of Richard Temple-Grenville, 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, the only known (or suspected) portrait of William Shakespeare in existence. Ellesmere Island in Canada was named after him. There was a tannery located on the edge of the Mere in what is now known as Cremorne Gardens. These gardens were given to the people of Ellesmere by Lord Brownlow who was heavily involved in the Edward VIII abdication crisis of 1936. Geography The Mere The town is located by the side of Ellesmere (aka 'the Mere'), one of the largest natural meres in England outside the Lake District and one of nine glacial meres in the area. ('glacial' means that the depression occupied by the mere was the location of a block of ice that persisted at the end of the last Ice Age). These meres are different from those in the Lake District in that they do not have a flow of water into them to maintain the level. An artificial island in the Mere was constructed in 1812 from soil dug out during the making of the gardens at Ellesmere House. This was later named Moscow Island, as Napoleon was forced to retreat from Moscow that year. The Mere has a visitors' centre and is popular with birdwatchers, many of whom visit to see grey herons nesting. There are eight other meres nearby: Blakemere, Colemere, Crosemere, Kettlemere, Newtonmere, Whitemere, Sweatmere and Hanmer Mere. The civil parish which constitutes the town is Ellesmere Urban; the surrounding parish, covering a large rural area, is Ellesmere Rural. Transport The A495 and A528 roads cross at Ellesmere. The latter runs 15 miles south-southeast from Ellesmere to the county town, Shrewsbury. The town lies beside the Llangollen Canal with a short side arm reaching the town centre wharf. The canal eventually terminates just outside Llangollen at Llantysilio after passing through the 18 km World Heritage site which includes Chirk Aqueduct and Pontcysyllte Aqueduct. It was originally known as the Ellesmere Canal. Thomas Telford was overall director of its construction. Work lasted from 1793 to 1805 with the aim of linking Chester on the River Dee and the River Mersey at Ellesmere Port (named after the town) with Shrewsbury, but it never got that far due to rising costs and completion of alternative routes which later became the Shropshire Union Canal. During its construction, Telford lived in a house next to the canal in Ellesmere, which still stands today. Ellesmere no longer has a railway, but it was once on the Oswestry, Ellesmere and Whitchurch Railway main line of the Cambrian Railways. However, the section from Whitchurch to Welshpool (Buttington Junction), via Ellesmere, Whittington, Oswestry and Llanymynech, closed on 18 January 1965 in favour of the more viable alternative route via Shrewsbury. Ellesmere was also the terminus of the Wrexham and Ellesmere Railway branch line to Wrexham (Central), via Overton-on-Dee, Bangor-on-Dee and Marchwiel. This line closed on 10 September 1962. Ellesmere railway station still stands albeit derelict and disused. The nearest station to Ellesmere is Gobowen for Oswestry which less than 2 miles away. Bus services are operated by Arriva Midlands, Lakeside Coaches and Tanat Valley Coaches. The main services are as follows: *53 to Oswestry via Dudleston Heath, St. Martin's, Gobowen and the Orthopaedic Hospital ‚Äì every 40 minutes Monday to Saturday (Arriva Midlands); *205 Town Service (Tuesdays and Fridays) (Lakeside Coaches) *449 to Oswestry via Welsh Frankton and Whittington ‚Äì roughly hourly Monday ‚Äì Saturday, with 3 journeys daily continuing from Ellesmere to Welshampton (Lakeside Coaches, with Arriva Midlands operating the three Welshampton services: one in the morning and two in the evening); *501 to Shrewsbury via Cockshutt, Myddle (most but not all) and Harmer Hill ‚Äì roughly hourly (Lakeside coaches).

Ellesmere Primary School is a primary and nursery school for boys and girls aged 4‚Äì11. Lakelands Academy provides state-paid education for boys and girls in the 11‚Äì16 age range (for whom schooling is compulsory) and its former pupils include Luke Preston. Several other nearby schools serve the wider community, such as Welshampton Church of England School, which recently scored among the highest in the country in OFSTED reports in all categories. A short distance outside the town is Ellesmere College, a public (i.e., private) boarding school founded in 1884 by Canon Nathaniel Woodard for sons of the middle classes. It is now a fully co-educational school catering for pupils from 7‚Äì18. Lakelands School formally known as Lakelands School Sports and Language College, is located on Oswestry Road. In 2013 Lakelands School became an academy. Sport Sports clubs in Ellesmere include Ellesmere Cricket Club, one of the oldest in north-east Shropshire, which after a number of years in the doldrums is on the rise with a successful first XI which was runner up in the Shropshire Cricket League Division 4 in 2006 and were Division 3 champions in 2007 and were promoted to the First Division as second division runners up at the end of the 2008 season. The town also has a semi- professional football club, Ellesmere Rangers FC, who play their home games at Beech Grove. They are currently members of the North West Counties Football League Division One South, the 10th tier of the English football pyramid.

The organisation was founded as the Cats Protection League on 16 May 1927 by Jessey Wade, at a meeting in Caxton Hall, London. The name was shortened in 1998. The current Chief Executive is James Yeates. Aims * To find good homes for cats in need * To support and encourage the neutering of cats * To improve people's understanding of cats and their care Operations Cats Protection charity shop in Horsforth, Leeds In 2017, the charity helped nearly 193,000 cats (rehoming around 43,000 of these and neutering 153,000). Its network had 36 centres, 250+ volunteer-run branches, 121 charity shops and approximately 10,200 volunteers and staff located throughout the UK. The charity's income for 2017 was ¬£62.9 million. In 2011, the charity announced that it had helped more than one million cats over the previous five years, 80% of this figure being neutering and 20% being rehoming. Alongside rehoming cats and kittens, the charity runs a neutering scheme for owners on a limited income, and a National Information Line (03000 12 12 12). In addition, they monitor (and feed) feral colonies in the area including trapping, neutering and re- releasing (where possible) feral cats back to where they came from. They also work to educate adults and children about cat welfare, and run talks and educational resource programmes across the UK. Volunteer branches The charity operates in two ways: volunteer-run branches and centres. The main difference is that volunteer-run branches are people with a spare room or space in a garden for a pen (or two). Instead of visiting a dedicated centre, the person wishing to adopt a cat usually visits it in another person's home. Anyone picking up a cat or kitten from a fosterer's home can be subject to same home visits (pre- and post-homing) and the same terms and conditions as someone picking up a cat or kitten from a centre. Volunteer-run branches receive a small amount of funding from the charity's headquarters but are required to raise most of their funds from their local areas. They do not usually have any paid members of staff, and would take the cats home if they had to. Adoption centres Dedicated centres are of varying size and have paid staff in addition to volunteers on their team. The vast majority of the public visit these places to adopt a cat or a kitten. Centres are funded centrally by the charity, though many also have \\"Friends of...\\" groups that raise funds locally. In addition, there is often the chance of cat sponsorship, where members of the public can sponsor a pen in return for a monthly or annual donation. Sponsors receive regular updates on the cats using their pens. In 2002, Cat Protection acquired the Isle of Thorns estate from the University of Sussex. The estate is now the National Cat Centre. In 2008, the charity was affected by the financial markets crisis emanating from Iceland, losing ¬£11.2 million of its financial reserves. In 2012, having suffered continuing financial losses, the charity was forced to make over 80 staff redundant, the majority of these being staff working on the operational front line in adoption centres or supporting branches.

Ratification defines the international act in which a state indicates its consent to be bound to a treaty if the parties intended to show their consent by such an act. In the case of bilateral treaties, ratification is usually accomplished by exchanging the requisite instruments, and in the case of multilateral treaties, the usual procedure is for the depositary to collect the ratifications of all states, keeping all parties informed of the situation. The institution of ratification grants states the necessary time-frame to seek the required approval for the treaty on the domestic level and to enact the necessary legislation to give domestic effect to that treaty. The term applies to private contract law, international treaties, and constitutions in federal states such as the United States and Canada. The term is also used in parliamentary procedure in deliberative assemblies.  Private law  In contract law, the need for ratification can arise in two ways: if the agent attempts to bind the principal despite lacking the authority to do so; and if the principal authorizes the agent to make an agreement, but reserves the right to approve it. An example of the former situation is an employee not normally responsible for procuring supplies contracting to do so on the employer's behalf. The employer's choice on discovering the contract is to ratify it or to repudiate it. The latter situation is common in trade union collective bargaining agreements. The union authorizes one or more people to negotiate and sign an agreement with management. A collective bargaining agreement can not become legally binding until the union members ratify the agreement. If the union members do not approve it, the agreement is void, and negotiations resume.  Ratification of an international treaty  The ratification of international treaties is always accomplished by filing instruments of ratification as provided for in the treaty. In most democracies, the legislature authorizes the government to ratify treaties through standard legislative procedures by passing a bill.  Australia  In Australia, power to enter into treaties is an executive power within Section 51 of the Australian Constitution so the Australian Government may enter into a binding treaty without seeking parliamentary approval. However, implementation of treaties requires legislation by the Australian parliament, following Section 51(xxix) of the Australian Constitution, signed by the Governor-General of Australia.  India  The President makes a treaty in exercise of his executive power, on the aid and the advice of the Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister, and no court of law in India may question its validity. However, no agreement or treaty entered into by the president is enforceable by the courts which is incompatible with Indian constitution/ national law, as India follows dualist theory for the implementation of international laws. If the Parliament wishes to codify the agreement entered into by the executive thereby making it enforceable by the courts of India, it may do so under Article 253 of the constitution.  Japan  In Japan, in principle both houses of the parliament (the National Diet) must approve the treaty for ratification. If the House of Councilors rejects a treaty approved by the House of Representatives, and a joint committee of both houses cannot come to agreement on amendments to the original text of the treaty, or the House of Councilors fails to decide on a treaty for more than thirty days, the House of Representatives the will be regarded as the vote of the National Diet approving the ratification. The approved treaty will then be promulgated into law by the act of the Emperor.  United Kingdom  Treaty ratification was a Royal Prerogative, exercised by the monarch on the advice of the government. By a convention called the Ponsonby Rule, treaties were usually placed before Parliament for 21 days before ratification.A. Horne and D. Gracia, Treaty Scrutiny ‚Äì A Brave New Frontier for Parliament, U.K. Const. L. Blog (18th March 2020). It was put onto a statutory footing by the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010.  United States  Treaty power is a coordinated effort between the Executive branch and the Senate. The President may form and negotiate, but the treaty must be advised and consented to by a two-thirds vote in the Senate. Only after the Senate approves the treaty can the President ratify it. Once it is ratified, it becomes binding on all the states under the Supremacy Clause. While the House of Representatives does not vote on it at all, the requirement for the Senate's advice and consent to ratification makes it considerably more difficult to rally enough political support for international treaties. Also, if implementation of the treaty requires the expenditure of funds, the House of Representatives may be able to block or at least impede such implementation by refusing to vote for the appropriation of the necessary funds. The President usually submits a treaty to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (SFRC) along with an accompanying resolution of ratification or accession. If the treaty and resolution receive favorable committee consideration (a committee vote in favor of ratification or accession), the treaty is then forwarded to the floor of the full Senate for such a vote. The treaty or legislation does not apply until it has been ratified. A multilateral agreement may provide that it will take effect upon its ratification by less than all of the signatories.An example for such a treaty can be seen in the Convention on Cluster Munitions, which enters into force as soon as it has been ratified by at least 30 states (Article 17). Even though such a treaty takes effect, it does not apply to signatories that have not ratified it. Accession has the same legal effect as ratification, for treaties already negotiated and signed by other states. An example of a treaty to which the Senate did not advise and consent to ratification is the Treaty of Versailles, which failed to garner support because of the Covenant of the League of Nations. The US can also enter into international agreements by way of executive agreements. They are not made under the Treaty Clause and do not require ratification of two thirds of the Senate. Congressional-executive agreements are passed by a majority of both houses of Congress as a regular law. If the agreement is completely within the President's constitutional powers, it can be made by the President alone without Congressional approval, but it will have the force of an executive order and can be unilaterally revoked by a future President. All types of agreements are treated internationally as \\"treaties\\". See Foreign policy of the United States#Law.  Ratification of a constitution  Federations usually require the support of both the federal government and some given percentage of the constituent governments for amendments to the federal constitution to take effect.  Ratification in the Constitution of India  Not all constitutional amendments in India require ratification by the states. Only constitutional amendments that seek to make any change in any of the provisions mentioned in the proviso to Article 368 of the Constitution of India, must be ratified by the Legislatures of not less than one-half of the States. These provisions relate to certain matters concerning the federal structure or of common interest to both the Union and the States viz., the election of the President (articles 54 and 55); the extent of the executive power of the Union and the States (Articles 73 and 162); the High Courts for Union territories (Article 241); The Union Judiciary and the High Courts in the States (Chapter IV of Part V and Chapter V of Part VI); the distribution of legislative powers between the Union and the States (Chapter I of Part XI and Seventh Schedule); the representation of States in Parliament; and the provision for amendment of the Constitution laid down in Article 368. Ratification is done by a resolution passed by the State Legislatures. There is no specific time limit for the ratification of an amending Bill by the State Legislatures. However, the resolutions ratifying the proposed amendment must be passed before the amending Bill is presented to the President for his assent. However, when the treaty terms are interfering with the powers exclusively applicable to states (State List), prior ratification of all applicable states are to be obtained per Article 252 of the Indian constitution before the ratification by the Parliament.  Ratification in the United States Constitution  Article VII of the Constitution of the United States describes the process by which the entire document was to become effective. It required that conventions of nine of the thirteen original States ratify the Constitution. If fewer than thirteen states ratified the document, it would become effective only among the states ratifying it.U.S. Const. art. VII. New Hampshire was the ninth state to ratify, doing so on June 21, 1788, but, as a practical matter, it was decided to delay implementation of the new government until New York and Virginia could be persuaded to ratify. Congress intended that New York City should be the first capital, and that George Washington, of Mount Vernon, Virginia, should be the first President, and both of those things would have been somewhat awkward if either New York or Virginia were not part of the new government. Ratification by those states was secured--Virginia on June 25 and New York on July 26--and the government under the Constitution began on March 4, 1789. For subsequent amendments, Article V describes the process of a potential amendment's adoption. Proposals to adopt an amendment may be called either by a two-thirds vote by both houses of Congress or by a national convention as a result of resolutions adopted by two-thirds (presently at least 34 out of 50) of the states' legislatures. For a proposed amendment to be adopted, three-quarters of the states (presently at least 38 out of 50) must then ratify the amendment either by a vote of approval in each state's legislature or by state ratifying conventions. Congress may specify which method must be used to ratify the amendment. Congress may also set a deadline by which the threshold for adoption must be met.  Use in parliamentary procedure  A deliberative assembly, using parliamentary procedure, could ratify action that otherwise was not validly taken. For example, action taken where there was no quorum at the meeting is not valid until it is later ratified at a meeting where a quorum is present.

They are commonly referred to as shield bugs, chust bugs, and stink bugs. As Hemiptera, they share a common arrangement of sucking mouthparts. The roughly 7000 species under Pentatomoidea are divided into 14 or 15 families. Description The Pentatomoidea are characterised by a well- developed scutellum (the hardened extension of the thorax over the abdomen). It can be triangular to semielliptical in shape. Pentatomoidea species usually have antennae with five segments. The tarsi usually have two or three segments. Shield bugs have glands in their thoraces between the first and second pair of legs that produce a foul-smelling liquid, which is used defensively to deter potential predators and is sometimes released when the bugs are handled. The nymphs, similar to adults except smaller and without wings, also have stink glands. The nymphs and adults have piercing mouthparts, which most use to suck sap from plants, although some eat other insects. When they group in large numbers, they can become significant pests. Species that resemble pentatomoids are found in the superfamily Coreoidea.

Along with neighbouring Woodley, it forms part of the extensive eastern suburbs of Reading. The Office for National Statistics places Earley within the Reading/Wokingham Urban Area; for the purposes of local government it falls within the Borough of Wokingham, outside the area of Reading Borough Council. The name is sometimes spelt Erleigh or Erlegh. The suburb consists of a number of smaller areas, including Maiden Erlegh and Lower Earley, and lies some south and east of the centre of Reading, and some northwest of Wokingham. It has a population of around 32,000. In 2014, the RG6 postcode area (which is nearly coterminous with the area of the civil parish) was rated one of the most desirable postcode areas to live in England. The main campus of the University of Reading, Whiteknights Park, lies partly in Earley and partly in the borough of Reading. History Evidence of prehistoric man has been found in locations around Earley. For example, a hand axe was found in the railway cutting; flint implements in a garden in Elm Lane; and hand axes in the gardens in Fowler Close and Silverdale Road. Most of these finds are thought to date from the late Paleolithic period, around 35,000 years ago. Traces of flimsy shelters from the Mesolithic were discovered at the site of the old power station at Thames Valley Park in north Earley. Tools from that time have also been found, including a flint blade found in a garden in Silverdale Road. Archaeological evidence for continued human presence during the Bronze Age and Iron Age was also discovered on the site of the Thames Valley Business Park, and Roman remains were found on a building site off Meadow Road.Earley Days, Earley Local History Group, 2000 Earley is mentioned in the Domesday Book as \\"Herlei\\", with two main manors: Erleigh St Bartholomew, later known as Erleigh Court; and Erleigh St Nicolas, later Erleigh White Knights.'the New Berkshire village book', Berkshire Federation of Women's Institutes, 1985 In Domesday Herlei is said to be \\"held by Osbern Giffard from the King, previously Dunn held it from King Edward in freehold. The value was 100 shillings, later 60 shillings, now ¬£4\\".Domesday 39.1, Winchester 1086 The Erleghs, a family of knightly rank who took their name from the manors, held the manors of St Bartholemew and St Nicolas in the latter part of the 12th century through the 13th century and part of the 14th century. John de Erlegh (or John of Earley) was known as the White Knight, hence the renaming of the manor of Erleigh St Nicolas to Whiteknights. The Whiteknights estate was later owned by the Englefields, from 1606 to 1798,'The Buildings of England ‚Äì Berkshire', Pevsner 1966 and then by the Marquis of Blandford, later the 5th Duke of Marlborough. The manor of Maiden Erleigh was formed out of the Manor of Erlegh, as a gift of land by John de Erlegh to Robert de Erlegh in 1368. Later it was transferred to Charles Hide of Abingdon. In 1673 the estate was sold to Valentine Crome, and after many changes of ownership at the end of the 18th century, it belonged to William Matthew Birt, who was Governor General of the Leeward Islands. In 1818 the property passed to the Rt Hon Edward Golding, MP for Downton in Wiltshire. In 1878 it was purchased by John Hargreaves, Master of the South Berks Hunt, who founded a course where hunt and yeomanry (similar to modern hunter chases) races were run. The course extended over an area now covered by Sutcliffe Avenue, Hillside Road and Mill Lane. The grandstand stood on an area opposite Loddon Infant School. The estate was purchased in 1903 by the millionaire Solly Joel, well known in horse racing circles, who had a racecourse on the estate. The racecourse was demolished during the First World War and the grandstand was re-erected at Newbury Racecourse.Earley Town Guide 2010‚Äì12 page 37 He donated a piece of his land to the village to be used for sporting purposes: the park and pavilion were opened by the Duke of York, later King George VI, in 1927 and, as Sol Joel Park, the park and the original pavilion are used to this day. The estate of Bulmershe Court once belonged to the Abbey of Reading. In the 18th century it was the home of Henry Addington, Viscount Sidmouth, Prime Minister. Bulmershe College, which became part of the University of Reading in 1989, occupied this site until 2012. The site of the former Bulmershe College has been redeveloped, principally for housing. Until 1888, Earley extended westwards from the Three Tuns crossroads down the Wokingham Road and into Reading. To enable this section to be linked into the drainage system, Reading extended its boundaries to the Three Tuns crossroads, and this part of Earley was incorporated into Reading. At that time, the centre of Earley was the crossroads and Saint Peters Church. Even today, some residents living over the boundary in Reading think of themselves as belonging to Earley even though they pay their council tax to Reading Borough Council (at least three businesses along the stretch of Wokingham Road lying within Reading Borough include 'Earley' in their business names). Indeed, this area of Reading Borough still forms part of the ecclesiastical parish of Earley St Peter, which extends as far as, but does not include, Palmer Park. The University of Reading began as a University College, Reading, in 1892; it became the University of Reading in 1926 and acquired its new site, which straddles the boundary between Earley and Reading, in 1947. Of the six large villas on the estate four were designed by Waterhouse (Erleigh Park 1859, Whiteknights 1868 (now called Old Whiteknights House), Foxhill 1868 and the Wilderness 1873). Waterhouse also designed Reading School (1865‚Äì71) in Erleigh Road, in the borough of Reading, extended Pepper Manor, now 'Old School' in Leighton Park School, on Shinfield Road, in 1890, and built Grove House on the north of the school site (1892‚Äì94). Earley grew rapidly both before and after World War II, and was designated a town in 1974. From 1977, the Lower Earley housing estate was constructed by private companies, almost doubling Earley's population to the current level. Two new primary schools were built, together with a large supermarket complex, which opened in 1979, and a sports centre. In 1988 a second shopping area, Maiden Place, opened. An additional secondary school was planned roughly opposite the sports centre next to Rushey Way, possibly on the site next to the police station. However, the school never materialised, and the land was built on. Listed buildings Despite its generally 19th- and 20th-century appearance, Earley has some remnants of its older past hidden in amongst the newer development.

The name Lower Earley is however very old, having originally been applied to the low-lying land between the old Maiden Erlegh Estate and the River Loddon. Even after its recent development, Earley has some remnants of ancient woodland within its boundaries, including Pearman's Copse (a local nature reserve) and Redhatch Copse. There is a nature reserve on the edge of Earley called Highwood. Earley falls within the parliamentary constituency of Wokingham, except for the Whitegates Town Ward (comprising the part of Earley lying north of the Reading - Waterloo railway line), which falls within Reading East. Earley is bordered by the B3270 (Lower Earley Way) to the south and south-east; the boundary then follows the Reading - Waterloo railway line until it turns north to run to the east of the B3350 (Church Road and Pitts Lane) as far as the gyratory system where the B3350 joins the A4; the boundary then runs north to the River Thames. The boundary then runs upstream along the Thames as far as the River Kennet, then follows the Reading - Waterloo railway line again, until it meets the B3350; it then runs north-west along Whiteknights Road, cuts irregularly across the University of Reading Whiteknights Campus, and then runs to the east of the A327 (Shinfield Road) until it meets up again with the B3270. The extension of the Reading Borough boundaries in 1888 (referred to above) has the result that the section of Earley lying to the north of the railway line (sometimes referred to as Old Earley or North Earley) is connected to the larger part to the south by only a narrow corridor of land. The Borough of Reading lies to the west, the River Thames to the north-west, Woodley to the north-east, Winnersh to the east, and Arborfield and Shinfield to the south. Government Earley has two levels of local government: Earley Town Council, created from the former Parish Council in 1974, based at Radstock House in Radstock Lane, and Wokingham Borough Council based at Shute End in Wokingham. There are 25 councillors representing eight wards on the Town Council and 12 Borough Councillors (out of 54 on the Borough Council) representing four Earley wards (Hillside; Hawkedon; Maiden Erlegh; and Bulmershe and Whitegates). The Bulmershe and Whitegates ward also includes the Bulmershe ward of Woodley Town Council. The Town Wards do not coincide with the Borough Wards: Cutbush and Hawkedon Town Wards make up the Hawkedon Borough Ward; Hillside and Radstock the Hillside Borough Ward; Redhatch, St Nicolas and Maiden Erlegh the Maiden Erlegh Borough ward; and Whitegates together with the Woodley Town Ward of Bulmershe make up the Bulmershe and Whitegates Borough Ward. Town Council elections are held every four years; the last one was in 2019. Borough Elections are held by thirds with one in 3 years out of every 4 for the three member wards and one year with no election. Amongst other functions, Earley Town Council runs Sol Joel Park, leased from Reading Borough Council for 50 years, Meadow Park off Meadow Road, Bulmershe Park (jointly with Woodley), the BMX track near Paddick Drive which was opened in 2011, 2 community centres and Maiden Erlegh Local Nature Reserve, which was declared a nature reserve in 1997.Maiden Erlegh Lake Homepage The council has a large and well maintained allotment at Culver Lane and a lawn cemetery at Mays Lane. The Council also provides the familiar green bus shelters at the main Reading-bound stops. Within Earley, the Borough Council has provided the Waterside Centre, a canoe centre in Thames Valley Park, and the Loddon Valley Leisure Centre. They also own Chalfont Park and Laurel Park in Earley, both of which include football pitches. Transport Earley railway station Earley railway station is on the line from to . Winnersh Triangle railway station, which opened in 1986, is also near Earley. Earley is served by Reading Buses who provide a number of bus services to and from the centre of Reading, namely the 4, X4, 19a, 19b, 19c; and the 21, a 24-hour service. The 17 bus runs 24 hours a day from the junction at the Three Tuns, through Reading town centre, towards Tilehurst. Wokingham can be reached by bus on the Wokingham Road or by train from Earley or Winnersh Triangle stations. Earley is to the north of the M4 motorway which connects London with Bristol. Economy Earley is home to the Thames Valley Business Park which is alongside the Thames to the east of the A329(M) motorway. The park houses offices of many major companies including the UK headquarters of BG group, Microsoft, ING direct and SGI together with offices of Oracle, Computacenter, David LLoyd, Cybersource, JP Executive Recruitment, Open Text, Regus, Websense and Worktube CV. The neighbouring Suttons Business Park houses more service and high tech companies such as Rentokil Initial, Service Point, HP Invent, MOOG, FPS and Royal Mail. One of the main industries located in Earley was Sutton Seeds, whose headquarters were in London Road, at the northern end of what was once the A329(M) motorway spur (now the A3290). The building was partly taken over by the civil engineering consultancy Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners in June 1974, when it relocated from London. Sutton Seeds finally departed in 1975 to its new base in Torquay.

History=Origins in the 1930s The league was the brainchild of Indianapolis grocer Irv Kautsky, who sponsored the Indianapolis Kautskys club team, and Goodyear Tire Company, who originally sponsored the Akron Wingfoots. After a false start in the early 1930s, the league was restarted in 1938, with the Wingfoots winning the initial NBL title. By World War II, both the Wingfoots and the Firestone Tire Company's Non-Skids had suspended play, but other seminal pro teams such as the Ft. Wayne Zollner Pistons (now the Detroit Pistons), Syracuse Nationals (now the Philadelphia 76ers), Rochester Royals (now the Sacramento Kings), Minneapolis Lakers (now the Los Angeles Lakers), and Tri-Cities BlackHawks (now the Atlanta Hawks), all of whom are currently playing in the NBA, had joined. After World War II, the fledgling Basketball Association of America was established by arena owners in large cities to try to capture the popularity of the NBL teams from the smaller communities. This attempt failed miserably as 13 of the 16 BAA teams folded. Undaunted, the remaining BAA teams, the Philadelphia Warriors, Boston Celtics, and New York Knicks convinced the top NBL teams to join with them and they formed the NBA. Thus, the early NBA was composed mostly of teams brought over from the NBL and three BAA teams. 1947‚Äì1961: The creation of the NIBL The remaining NBL teams reformed and changed the name to the National Industrial Basketball League (NIBL) where teams such as the Denver Truckers, Chicago Jamaco Saints, Akron Wingfoots, Phillips 66ers, Peoria Cats, Philadelphia Tapers, Lexington Marathon Oilers and Cleveland Pipers thrived as club teams. In the 1960s the league recognized the changing sponsorship of the teams away from the large industrial companies and renamed it the National AAU Basketball League (NABL).

By the end of the 1970s, the NABL teams elected to adapt touring schedules rather than league schedules and the NABL format was mothballed until it was brought back in the 1990s when many of the legendary teams had been restarted under a new wave of sponsors. Today, the NABL teams are focused on preparing post-college players for the opportunity to play pro basketball overseas. National Amateur Athletic Union Basketball League (1966‚Äì1973) In 1966, the NABL organized the National Amateur Athletic Union Basketball League, with the league's champions playing at FIBA's Intercontinental Cup, as the North American Champions.

A. F. Penrose Jr., was an American mining geologist and entrepreneur. He was from a prominent Philadelphia family of Cornish descent.White, G. Pawley, A Handbook of Cornish Surnames. (His Penrose family is mentioned by name) His brothers were U.S. senator Boies Penrose, mining engineer Spencer Penrose, and gynecologist Charles Bingham Penrose, and his grandfather was U.S. politician Charles B. Penrose. Penrose graduated in 1885 with a Ph.D. from Harvard for work on phosphates. Later, he performed geological surveys in Texas and Arkansas until 1892, and then traveled the country as a mining surveyor. Most notable was his survey of Cripple Creek, Colorado, for the U.S. Geological Survey. Penrose refrained from purchasing or investing in mines in the Cripple Creek area because of what he saw as his ethical responsibility as a USGS employee, but did purchase and invest in mines elsewhere, including silver and copper mines in Arizona. In 1903 his brothers and father were investors who formed the Utah Copper Company. After his father died in 1908, Penrose made a complete career change, using his knowledge as a mining geologist to succeed as a mining investor and as an entrepreneur in other areas as well. Having amassed considerable wealth in these efforts, Penrose established the Penrose Medal of the Geological Society of America (GSA) in 1927. Penrose was very active in GSA: he was elected as a Member of GSA in 1889, served on GSA Council from 1914 to 1916, was GSA vice president in 1919, a member of the Finance Committee from 1924 to 1929, and GSA president in 1930.

Pentatomidae is the largest family in the superfamily Pentatomoidea, and contains around 900 genera and over 4700 speciesRobert G. Foottit, Peter H. Adler Insect Biodiversity: Science and Society, John Wiley and Sons, 2009,. As hemipterans, the pentatomids have piercing sucking mouthparts, and most are phytophagous, including several species which are severe pests on agricultural crops. However, some species, particularly in the subfamily Asopinae, are predatory and may be considered beneficial. Etymology The name \\"Pentatomidae\\" is from the Greek pente meaning \\"five\\" and tomos meaning \\"section\\", and refers to the five segments of their antennae. Pentatomids are generally called \\"shield bugs\\" in English, or \\"stink bugs\\" in American English. However, the term shield bugs is also applied broadly to include several related families (e.g. Acanthosomatidae, Scutelleridae, and Cydnidae), or specifically only to refer to species in the family Acanthosomatidae. The term shield bug refers to the generalized body shape of adult bugs in these families which resembles a heraldic shield when viewed from above. The American name \\"stink bug\\" is specific to the Pentatomidae, and refers to their ability to release a pungent defensive spray when threatened, disturbed, or crushed. The composition of this spray may vary between species, and even by sex or age, but generally includes aldehydes and alkanes. Descriptions of the smells vary widely, and include oily, dusty, woody and earthy, and like coriander. In some species, the liquid contains cyanide compounds and a rancid almond scent, used to protect themselves and discourage predators. The term \\"stink bug\\" may also be a vernacular for unrelated insects such as pinacate beetles (the genus Eleodes). Taxonomy There are several subfamilies, of which the Australian Aphylinae is often given family status, but is here retained as a subfamily, following Grazia et al. (2008). Description All pentatomids have 5-segmented antennae, and 3 tarsal segments on each foot. They generally have a large triangular scutellum in the center of the back. The body shape of adult pentatomids is generally \\"shieldlike,\\" when viewed from above, but this varies between species, and is not true for the immature nymphal stages. The forewings of stink bugs are called hemelytra, with the basal half thickened while the apex is membranous. At rest, the wings are laid across the back of the insect, with the membranous wingtips overlapping. The hindwings are entirely membranous. Economics Several stink bugs and shield bugs are considered agricultural pests, because they can grow into large populations that feed on crops, damaging production, and they are resistant to many pesticides. They are a threat to cotton, corn, sorghum, soybeans, native and ornamental trees, shrubs, vines, weeds, and many cultivated crops. Pentatomidae morphology In Mexico, some species of stink bugs are called jumil, chinche de monte, xotlinilli, or chumil (e.g. Edessa mexicana). They are most often eaten in the states of Morelos and Guerrero. The flavor is sometimes said to resemble cinnamon, or sometimes a bitter medicinal flavor. Jumiles may be used for making sauces or as taco filling. Since recent arrival in the U.S., populations of the brown marmorated stink bug have grown significantly. As of October 2014, brown marmorated stink bugs can be found in 41 out of 50 states within the U.S. In 2016 New Zealand's MPI put out an alert to prevent this invasive species from entering via imported cargo.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) is an executive non-departmental public body of the Department of Health in England, which publishes guidelines in four areas: * the use of health technologies within the National Health Service (England) and within NHS Wales (such as the use of new and existing medicines, treatments and procedures) * clinical practice (guidance on the appropriate treatment and care of people with specific diseases and conditions) * guidance for public sector workers on health promotion and ill-health avoidance * guidance for social care services and users. These appraisals are based primarily on evidence-based evaluations of efficacy, safety and cost- effectiveness in various circumstances. It serves both the English NHS and the Welsh NHS. It was set up as the National Institute for Clinical Excellence in 1999, and on 1 April 2005 joined with the Health Development Agency to become the new National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (still abbreviated as NICE). Following the Health and Social Care Act 2012, NICE was renamed the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence on 1 April 2013 reflecting its new responsibilities for social care, and changed from a special health authority to an Executive Non-Departmental Public Body (NDPB). NICE was established in an attempt to end the so-called postcode lottery of healthcare in England and Wales, where treatments that were available depended upon the NHS Health Authority area in which the patient happened to live, but it has since acquired a high reputation internationally as a role model for the development of clinical guidelines. One aspect of this is the explicit determination of cost‚Äìbenefit boundaries for certain technologies that it assesses. NICE also plays an important role in pioneering technology assessment in other healthcare systems through NICE International, established in May 2008 to help cultivate links with foreign governments. Policy history The notion of an Institute to determine the clinical effectiveness of interventions first emerged at the end of John Major's Conservative Government as moves elsewhere were being made to set professionally agreed standards for clinical care. In 1997, the UK National Screening Committee (NSC) had been established by Sir Kenneth Calman and Muir Gray (now Sir Muir Gray) by the Policy Team led by Dr Tim Riley and latterly Sir Charles Nightingale for the Department of Health. The NSC aimed to ensure that evidence-based medicine informed policy making on what national screening programmes were approved for funding and what quality assurance mechanisms should be in place. This was a timely action as screening quality in breast cancer screening services came under question at Exeter in 1997 and followed in the wake of the 1995 Calman-Hine Report. The idea of what was originally termed a National Institute for Clinical Excellence took root when Labour came to power in 1997. Frank Dobson became Secretary of State and was supported by a team of Ministers keen on introducing clinical and health outcome measures to achieve improvements in the quality and delivery of care. The team included Alan Milburn, Baroness Margaret Jay, and Tessa Jowell. The name and mission was agreed in a meeting between the Ministerial team, Dr Tim Riley and Dr Felicity Harvey shortly after the election and it was agreed that NICE should be described in the first policy white paper, The New NHS: Modern, Dependable 1997. Riley led the team that developed the policy for NICE and which managed the legislation through Parliament in addition to formalising the new institute as a Special Health Authority. Riley joined Sir Michael Rawlins (the then recently appointed Chair of NICE) at the Health Select Committee in February 1999 where questions were raised as to whether NICE was just a means to \\"ration\\" healthcare. Sir Michael Rawlins presented a compelling case that positioned NICE as a standards setting body first and foremost. However, the reality was that although NICE was principally aimed at aligning professional standards through clinical guidelines and audit, the acceptability of drugs, devices and technological interventions in defining those standards, could not be ignored and so the concept of a \\"fourth hurdle\\" for drugs accessing the NHS market was invoked. This controversial policy shift meant that NICE was critical for decisions on drug reimbursement. Indeed, the first drug appraisal by NICE was on the drug Relenza which was turned down amidst criticisms from Glaxo-Wellcome that the appraisal had been fast tracked.NICE put on defensive as ruling on Relenza ends in row over 'leaks' Health Service Journal, 7 October 1999 Later, this policy development whereby the criteria for decision making, the role of costs, and the degree to which decisions of NICE and the secretary of state would be binding on clinicians was analysed by Andrew Dillon, Trevor Gibbs, Tim Riley, and Trevor A. Sheldon.Milbank Quarterly, September 2001 Technology appraisals Since January 2005, the NHS in England and Wales has been legally obliged to provide funding for medicines and treatments recommended by NICE's technology appraisal board. This was at least in part as a result of well-publicised postcode lottery anomalies in which certain less-common treatments were funded in some parts of the UK but not in others due to local decision making in the NHS. Before an appraisal, the Advisory Committee on Topic Selection (ACTS) draws up a list of potential topics of clinical significance for appraisal. The Secretary of State for Health or the Welsh Assembly must then refer any technology so that the appraisal process can be formally initiated. Once this has been done NICE works with the Department of Health to draw up the scope of the appraisal. NICE then invites consultee and commentator organisations to take part in the appraisal. A consultee organisation would include patient groups, organisations representing health care professionals and the manufacturers of the product undergoing appraisal. Consultees submit evidence during the appraisal and comment on the appraisal documents. Commentator organisations include the manufacturers of products to which the product undergoing appraisal is being compared. They comment on the documents that have been submitted and drawn up but do not actually submit information themselves. An independent academic centre then draws together and analyses all of the published information on the technology under appraisal and prepares an assessment report. This can be commented on by the Consultees and Commentators. Comments are then taken into account and changes made to the assessment report to produce an evaluation report. An independent Appraisal Committee then looks at the evaluation report, hears spoken testimony from clinical experts, patient groups and carers. They take their testimony into account and draw up a document known as the 'appraisal consultation document'. This is sent to all consultees and commentators who are then able to make further comments. Once these comments have been taken into account the final document is drawn up called the 'final appraisal determination'. This is submitted to NICE for approval. The process aims to be fully independent of government and lobbying power, basing decisions fully on clinical and cost- effectiveness. There have been concerns that lobbying by pharmaceutical companies to mobilise media attention and influence public opinion are attempts to influence the decision-making process. A fast-track assessment system has been introduced to reach decisions where there is most pressure for a conclusion. Clinical guidelines NICE carries out assessments of the most appropriate treatment regimes for different diseases. This must take into account both desired medical outcomes (i.e. the best possible result for the patient) and also economic arguments regarding differing treatments. NICE has set up several National Collaborating Centres bringing together expertise from the royal medical colleges, professional bodies and patient/carer organisations which draw up the guidelines. The centres are the National Collaborating Centre for Cancer, the National Clinical Guideline Centre, the National Collaborating Centre for Women and Children¬¥s Health, and the National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health. The National Collaborating Centre appoints a Guideline Development Group whose job it is to work on the development of the clinical guideline. This group consists of medical professionals, representatives of patient and carer groups and technical experts. They work together to assess the evidence for the guideline topic (e.g. clinical trials of competing products) before preparing a draft guideline. There are then two consultation periods in which stakeholder organisations are able to comment on the draft guideline. After the second consultation period, an independent Guideline Review Panel reviews the guideline and stakeholder comments and ensures that these comments have been taken into account. The Guideline Development Group then finalises the recommendations and the National Collaboration Centre produces the final guideline. This is submitted to NICE to formally approve the guideline and issue the guidance to the NHS. To date NICE has produced more than 200 different guidelines. In October 2014 Andy Burnham said that a Labour government could reduce variation in access to drugs and procedures by making it mandatory for commissioners to follow NICE clinical guidelines. \\"We need to look at how you strengthen NICE. Where they have said something is effective and affordable, on what basis does a local commissioner withhold that from somebody? I‚Äôm not comfortable with that. I don‚Äôt support that.\\" NICE has a service called Clinical Knowledge Summaries (CKS) which provides primary care practitioners with a readily accessible summary of the current evidence base and practical guidance. Social care guidance Under the Health and Social Care Act 2012, NICE was given responsibility for developing guidance and quality standards for social care, using an evidence-based model. This is being delivered by the NICE Collaborating Centre for Social Care (NCCSC), which is hosted by the Social Care Institute for Excellence (SCIE) and 4 partner organisations - Research in Practice, Research in Practice for Adults, Personal Social Services Research Unit and the EPPI-Centre. NICE receives referrals for social care guidance from the Department of Health and the Department for Education, and commission the guidance from the NCCSC. NICE, along with the NCCSC, carries out a scoping exercise with a scoping group and with input from key stakeholders, at both a workshop and a public consultation, to ensure the guidance to be produced is focused and achievable. A chairperson and members of the Guidance Development Group are appointed, and pose review questions which will enable systematic evidence reviews to take place, thus delivering the guidance and subsequent recommendations. Service user and carer involvement takes place throughout, as well as public consultation on the draft guidance. The Guidance Development Group then finalises the recommendations and the NCCSC produces the final guideline. This is submitted to NICE for formal approval and publication. The entire process from pre-scoping to publication takes approximately 24 months. The guidance is then available to NICE standing committees to develop a quality standard on the topic. The quality standard is developed using the guidance and other accredited sources, to produce high-level concise statements that can be used for quality improvement by social care providers and commissioners, as well as setting out what service users and carers can expect of high quality social care services. The NCCSC is unique within NICE, in that it is the only collaborating centre to have responsibility for the adoption and dissemination support for guidance and quality standards in the social care arena. Drawing on the expertise of SCIE and their partners within the sector, each of the guidance products and quality standards have a needs assessment carried out to determine the requirements for tools to help embed the guidance and quality standards within the sector. These can include tailored versions of guidance for specific audiences, costing and commissioning tools and even training and learning packages. As of August 2013, NICE and the NCCSC had scheduled guidance delivery for five topics: domiciliary care, older adults with long- term conditions, transition between health and social care settings, transition from children's to adults' services and child abuse and neglect. Cost‚Äìeffectiveness As with any system financing health care, the NHS has a limited budget and a vast number of potential spending options. Choices must be made as to how this limited budget is spent. Economic evaluations are carried out within a health technology assessment framework to compare the cost-effectiveness of alternative activities and to consider the opportunity cost associated with their decisions.Methods for the Economic Evaluation of Health Care Programmes, Drummond et al (2005) By choosing to spend the finite NHS budget upon those treatment options that provide the most efficient results, society can ensure it does not lose out on possible health gains through spending on inefficient treatments and neglecting those that are more efficient. NICE attempts to assess the cost‚Äìeffectiveness of potential expenditures within the NHS to assess whether or not they represent 'better value' for money than treatments that would be neglected if the expenditure took place. It assesses the cost‚Äìeffectiveness of new treatments by analysing the cost and benefit of the proposed treatment relative to the next best treatment that is currently in use.NICE guidance, 2008 Quality-adjusted life years NICE guidance supports the use of quality-adjusted life years (QALY) as the primary outcome for quantifying the expected health benefits associated with a given treatment regime. By comparing the present value (see discounting) of expected QALY flows with and without treatment, or relative to another treatment, the net/relative health benefit derived from such a treatment can be derived. When combined with the relative cost of treatment, this information can be used to estimate an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), which is considered in relation to NICE's threshold willingness- to-pay value. As a guideline rule, NICE accepts as cost-effective those interventions with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of less than ¬£20,000 per QALY and that there should be increasingly strong reasons for accepting as cost-effective interventions with an incremental cost- effectiveness ratio of over a threshold of ¬£30,000 per QALY. Over the years, there has been great controversy as to what value this threshold should be set at. Initially, there was no fixed number. But the appraisal teams created a consensus amount of about ¬£30,000. However, in November 2008 Alan Johnson, the then Secretary of State, announced that for end-of-life cancer drugs the threshold could be increased above ¬£30,000. The first drug to go through the new process was Lenalidomide, whose ICER was ¬£43,800. Cost per quality- adjusted life year gained The following example from NICE explains the QALY principle and the application of the cost per QALY calculation. A patient has a life-threatening condition and is expected to live on average for 1 year receiving the current best treatment which costs the NHS ¬£3,000. A new drug becomes available that will extend the life of the patient by three months and improve his or her quality of life, but the new treatment will cost the NHS more than three times as much at ¬£10,000. Patients score their perceived quality of life on a scale from 0 to 1 with 0 being worst possible health and 1 being best possible health. On the standard treatment, quality of life is rated with a score of 0.4 but it improves to 0.6 with the new treatment. Patients on the new treatment on average live an extra 3 months, so 1.25 years in total. The quality of life gained is the product of life span and quality rating with the new treatment less the same calculation for the old treatment, i.e. (1.25 x 0.6) less (1.0 x 0.4) = 0.35 QALY. The marginal cost of the new treatment to deliver this extra gain is ¬£7,000 so the cost per quality life year gained is ¬£7000/0.35 or ¬£20,000. This is within the ¬£20,000-¬£30,000 that is suggested by NICE to be the limit for drugs to be cost-effective.Measuring effectiveness and quality effectiveness - the QALY National Institute for clinical effectiveness If the patient was expected to live only one month extra and instead of three then NICE would issue a recommendation not to fund. The patient's primary care trust could still decide to fund the new treatment, but if not, the patient would then have two choices. He or she could opt to take the free NHS standard treatment, or he or she may decide to pay out of pocket to obtain the benefit of the new treatment from a different health care provider. If the person has a private health insurance policy the person could check to see whether the private insurance provider will fund the new treatment. About 8% of the population has some private health insurance from an employer or trade association and 2% pay from their own resources. Basis of recommendations Theoretically, it might be possible to draw up a table of all possible treatments sorted by increasing the cost per quality-adjusted life year gained. Those treatments with lowest cost per quality-adjusted life year gained would appear at the top of the table and deliver the most benefit per value spent and would be easiest to justify funding for. Those where the delivered benefit is low and the cost is high would appear at the bottom of the list. Decision makers would, theoretically, work down the table, adopting services that are the most cost effective. The point at which the NHS budget is exhausted would reveal the shadow price, the threshold lying between the CQG gained of the last service that is funded and that of the next most cost effective service that is not funded. In practice this exercise is not done, but an assumed shadow price has been used by NICE for many years in its assessments to determine which treatments the NHS should and should not fund. NICE states that for drugs the cost per QALY should not normally exceed ¬£30,000 but that there is not a hard threshold, though research has shown that any threshold is \\"somewhat higher\\" than being in the range ¬£35,000 - ¬£40,000. The House of Commons Health Select Committee, in its report on NICE, stated in 2008 that \\"the (...) cost-per-QALY it uses to decide whether a treatment is cost-effective is of serious concern. The threshold it employs is not based on empirical research and is not directly related to the NHS budget, nor is it at the same level as that used by primary care trusts (PCTs) in providing treatments not assessed by NICE, which tends to be lower. Some witnesses, including patient organisations and pharmaceutical companies, thought NICE should be more generous in the cost per QALY threshold it uses, and should approve more products. On the other hand, some PCTs struggle to implement NICE guidance at the current threshold and other witnesses argued that a lower level should be used. However, there are many uncertainties about the thresholds used by PCTs.\\" It went on to recommend that \\"an independent body should determine the threshold used when making judgements of the value of drugs to the NHS.\\" Criticism The work that NICE is involved in, attracts the attention of many groups, including doctors, the pharmaceutical industry, and patients. NICE is often associated with controversy, because the requirement to make decisions at a national level, can conflict with what is (or is believed to be) in the best interests of an individual patient. Approved cancer drugs and treatments such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy are funded by the NHS without any financial contribution being taken from the patient. Where NICE has approved a treatment, the NHS must fund it. But not all treatments have been assessed by NICE and these treatments are usually dependent on local NHS decision making. In the case of cancer the Cancer Drugs Fund was set up in 2011 after complaints about NICE decisions on new and expensive cancer drugs with limited benefits. Treatment for fertility problems are approved but not always funded by clinical commissioning groups and they may cap the number of rounds. NICE has been criticised for being too slow to reach decisions. On one occasion, the Royal National Institute of Blind People said it was outraged over its delayed decision for further guidance regarding two drugs for macular degeneration that are already approved for use in the NHS. However the Department of Health said that it had 'made it clear to PCTs that funding for treatments should not be withheld simply because guidance from NICE is unavailable'. Some of the more controversial NICE decisions have concerned donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine (review) and memantine for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and bevacizumab, sorafenib, sunitinib and temsirolimus for renal cell carcinoma. All these are drugs with a high cost per treatment and NICE has either rejected or restricted their use in the NHS on the grounds that they are not cost-effective. A Conservative shadow minister once criticized NICE for spending more on communications than assessments. In its defence, NICE said the majority of its communications budget was spent informing doctors about which drugs had been approved and new guidelines for treatments and that the actual cost of assessing new drugs for the NHS includes money spent on NICE's behalf by the Department of Health. When these were added to NICE's own costs, the total cost of the technology appraisal programme far outstrips the cost of NICE communications. A report from the University of York Centre for Health Economics written by Karl Claxton in February 2015 suggested that the maximum threshold, currently around ¬£30,000 a year, for judging a medicine cost-effective should be more than halved. They found that any intervention costing more than ¬£13,000 per Quality-adjusted life year risked causing more harm than good by denying cost effective treatment to other patients. The institute's approach to the introduction of new oral therapy for Hepatitis C has been criticised. Sofosbuvir was approved in 2015. It costs about ¬£30,000 for 12 weeks treatment. NHS England established 22 Operational Delivery Networks to roll out delivery and proposes to fund 10,000 courses of treatment in 2016-17. Each has been given a ‚Äúrun rate‚Äù of how many patients they are allowed to treat. This is the NHS‚Äô single biggest new treatment investment this year. In the North East London network patients with cirrhosis or fibrosis go to the front of the queue and three new patients at the Grahame Hayton Unit at the Royal London Hospital start treatment each month. Those without such complications may faced considerable delays before they start treatment.

It is distinguishable by its very high first dorsal fin and interdorsal ridge. It is not to be confused with the similarly named sand tiger shark, or Carcharias taurus. Description Upper teeth Lower teeth The sandbar shark is also called the thickskin shark or brown shark. It is one of the biggest coastal sharks in the world, and is closely related to the dusky shark, the bignose shark, and the bull shark. Its dorsal fin is triangular and very high, and it has very long pectoral fins. Sandbar sharks usually have heavy-set bodies and rounded snouts that are shorter than the average shark's snout. Its upper teeth have broadly uneven cusps with sharp edges. Its second dorsal fin and anal fin are close to the same height. Females reach sexual maturity around the age of 13 with an average fork-length (tip of the nose to fork in the tail) of 154.9 cm, while males tend to reach maturity around age 12 with an average fork-length of 151.6 cm. Females can grow to , males up to . Its body color can vary from a bluish to a brownish grey to a bronze, with a white or pale underside. Sandbar sharks swim alone or gather in sex-segregated schools that vary in size. Distribution and habitat The sandbar shark, true to its nickname, is commonly found over muddy or sandy bottoms in shallow coastal waters such as bays, estuaries, harbors, or the mouths of rivers, but it also swims in deeper waters (200 m or more) as well as intertidal zones. Sandbar sharks are found in tropical to temperate waters worldwide; in the western Atlantic they range from Massachusetts to Brazil. Juveniles are common to abundant in the lower Chesapeake Bay, and nursery grounds are found from Delaware Bay to South Carolina. Other nursery grounds include Boncuk Bay in Marmaris, Muƒüla/Turkey and the Florida Keys. Predators and feeding habits Sandbar shark caught in the Atlantic. Natural predators of the sandbar shark include the tiger shark, and rarely great white sharks. The sandbar shark itself preys on fish, rays, and crabs. Reproduction Sandbar sharks are viviparous. The embryos are supported in placental yolk sac inside the mother. Females have been found to exhibit both biennial and triennial reproductive cycles, ovulate in early summer, and give birth to an average of eight pups, which they carry for 1 year before giving birth. The longevity of the sandbar shark is typically 35‚Äì41 years.Bray, Dianne J. (2011) Sandbar Shark, Carcharhinus plumbeus (Nardo 1827), in Fishes of Australia Interactions with humans=Fishing restrictions Sandbar sharks have been disproportionately targeted by the U.S. commercial shark fisheries in recent decades due to their high fin-to-body weight ratio, and U.S. fishing regulation requiring carcasses to be landed along with shark fins. In 2008, the National Marine Fisheries Service banned all commercial landings of sandbar sharks based on a 2006 stock assessment by SEDAR, and sandbar sharks were listed as vulnerable, due to overfishing. Currently, a small number of specially permitted vessels fish for sandbar sharks for the purpose of scientific research. All vessels in the research fishery are required to carry an independent researcher while targeting sandbars. Danger to people In spite of their large size and similar appearance to other dangerous sharks such as bull sharks, very few, if any attacks are attributed to sandbar sharks, so they are considered not to be dangerous to people. As a result, they are considered one of the safest sharks to swim with and are popular sharks for aquaria.  Conservation status  The New Zealand Department of Conservation has classified the sandbar shark as \\"Data Deficient\\" under the New Zealand Threat Classification System.

It is a major navigational channel of the Port of New York and New Jersey.  Etymology  The name Arthur Kill is an anglicization of the Dutch language achter kill meaning back channel, which would refer to its location \\"behind\\" Staten Island and has its roots in the early 17th century during the Dutch colonial era when the region was part of New Netherland.https://www.scribd.com/document/118047403/Bayonne-South-Hudson Placenaming by early explorers and settlers during the era often referred to a location in reference to other places, its shape, its topography, and other geographic qualities. Kill comes from the Middle Dutch word kille, meaning riverbed, water channel, or stream. The area around the Newark Bay was called Achter Kol. During the British colonial era the bay was known as Cull bay. The bay lies behind Bergen Hill, the emerging ridge of the Hudson Palisades which begins on Bergen Neck, the peninsula between it and the Upper New York Bay. The sister channel of Arthur Kill, Kill van Kull refers to the waterway that flows from the col or ridge or passage to the interior and translates as channel from the pass or ridge.  Geography and geology Shown in red, between New Jersey and Staten Island, Arthur Kill connects Raritan Bay on the south with Newark Bay on the north The channel is approximately long and connects Raritan Bay on its south end with Newark Bay on the north. Along the New Jersey side it is primarily lined with industrial sites, part of which is called the Chemical Coast. The Staten Island side is primarily lined with salt marshes. Course As seen from Staten Island, with Carteret, New Jersey, in the background and small creek in foreground Arthur Kill is an abandoned river channel carved by an ancestral phase of the Hudson River resulting from the blockage of the main channel of the Hudson at the Narrows by moraine or an ice dam. The size of Arthur Kill channel is large, suggesting that it was, for a time, the primary drainage from the region. However, it could not have been a primary drainage for long because the river did not have enough time to carve a broad flood plain.U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey Because of the complex nature of the tides in New York-New Jersey Harbor Estuary near the mouth of the Hudson River, the hydrology of Arthur Kill is still an open subject. In particular, the net flow of the channel is not well established. It was heavily polluted in the 1960s and 1970s, with few fish species able to live in it. Since the 1990s, crabs, baitfish, striped bass and bluefish have returned to this water. Tributaries and islands It contains two small uninhabited islands, Prall's Island and the Isle of Meadows, both of which are part of the borough of Staten Island. John's Cove is located near its northern end in New Jersey. On the New Jersey side the Elizabeth River,http://njconservation.org/arthurkillgreenway.htm Rahway River, Morses Creek https://goo.gl/maps/nadmvXbZeVoPiles Creek https://goo.gl/maps/p8ZPwGUy53G2 flow into the kill.

On the Staten Island side Old Place Creek,http://www.dec.ny.gov/outdoor/55405.html Fresh Kills (an estuary fed by the Richmond Creek and Main Creek and part of Freshkills Park), Bridge Creek (off Goethal Pond), Old Place Creek, and Sawmill Creek flow into the strait. Shipping Chemical Coast & Howland Hook A heavily used marine channel, it provides access for ocean-going tankers to industrial facilities along the channel itself. The Howland Hook Marine Terminal is located at its mouth at Newark Bay. It provided the primary marine access to the now-closed Fresh Kills Landfill on Staten Island and is the location of the Staten Island boat graveyard. The channel is dredged periodically to a depth of and a width of to maintain its usefulness for commercial ship passage. As part of its Harboring Deepening Project, the Kill is being deepened to a depth of to accommodate larger ships and allow for their passage while carrying full loads. Crossings Goethals and Arthur Kill Vertical Lift bridges Arthur Kill is spanned by the Goethals Bridge and the Outerbridge Crossing, as well as by the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge, a railroad bridge and the largest bridge of its type in the United States. For many years the Kill was traversed by a ferry between Tottenville and the Perth Amboy Ferry Slip. Another ferry ran from the tip of Victory Boulevard in Travis to Carteret. History The Arthur Kill was a critical dividing line during the American Revolution, with the British holding Staten Island for the duration of the conflict while New Jersey remained largely in Continental hands. Numerous skirmishes, including the Battle of Staten Island, spanned the Arthur Kill. , the likelihood of the planned Pilgrim Pipeline, to pipe crude oil, kerosene, and diesel fuel through New York and New Jersey, is not known, but it is expected to terminate at the Linden side of the kill.Detailed map of the proposed Pilgrim Pipeline route https://arcg.is/0iaOHr View from Tottenville, Staten Island to Perth Amboy, New Jersey See also *Chemical Coast *Achter Col, New Netherland and Toponymy of New Netherland *List of New Jersey rivers *Lower New York Bay *Raritan Bay *Hudson Canyon *Geography of New York-New Jersey Harbor Estuary *Perth Amboy Ferry Slip *John's Cove (New Jersey) ReferencesExternal links *U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Dredging Report, Dec. 2003 Category:Straits of New Jersey Category:Straits of Richmond County, New York Category:Borders of New York (state) Category:Borders of New Jersey Category:Bodies of water of Middlesex County, New Jersey Category:Bodies of water of Union County, New Jersey Category:Port of New York and New Jersey Category:Bodies of water of Staten Island Category:Rahway River Category:Bodies of water in Woodbridge Township, New Jersey ","title":"Arthur Kill"},{"id":"429694","text":"Arthur Louis Day (October 30, 1869 ‚Äì March 2, 1960) was an American geophysicist and volcanologist.

The paper is known on the left for its polemical articles, and for its close attention to Marxist theory and the politics of other Marxist groups. It claims an online readership averaging over 20,000 a week,Average Readership, Accessed 20/02/09 but prints only 500 copies a week.  Outlook  The CPGB-PCC's declared intention is to emulate IskraWeekly Worker and Iskra, Accessed 20/02/09 in providing Marxist analysis of politics and organisation to an initial vanguard of the working class. The Weekly Worker is integral to the CPGB-PCC's identity, given that the party, probably dialectically, does not consider itself to be a Marxist party. It aims instead to have the paper provide a focus for Communist organisation and theory that will be absorbed by a Marxist party that will arrive in a time of greater working-class activism. The paper has a policy of printing a variety of viewpoints. For example, it has printed articles by the Revolutionary Democratic Group (RDC) over a significant part of the paper's history. The paper has also given columns to factions within the CPGB-PCC, notably the Red Platform faction during a debate over the CPGB-PCC's stance towards the newly founded Respect. The Weekly Worker is known for its reporting of the activities of other left-wing groups, with a particular focus on the Socialist Workers Party and the Alliance for Workers' Liberty. Critics regard this as trading in gossip and amounting to sectarianism, a charge inverted by the CPGB-PCC.Open Publishing, Accessed 20/02/09 The paper prides itself on publishing a variety of letters, including critical ones. This has often resulted in lengthy debates being conducted through the letters section, leading to a set of familiar names appearing repeatedly. The paper has also attracted many activists who are not members of the CPGB-PCC to write articles. Leading UK gay rights activist Peter Tatchell, former Soviet dissident Boris Kagarlitsky, Marxist scholar Hillel Ticktin (editor of the magazine Critique) and Graham Bash of Labour Left Briefing have been regular contributors.  Structure  The paper is typically around sixteen pages long (after having been eight pages long until the mid-1990s). Rarely it incorporates publications by other attached groups such as Communist Students. The basic structure is: * Front Page: typically of magazine format, with a large striking image and overlaid text. The image tends to be artistic: examples include Hieronymus Bosch's The Garden of Earthly delights to a picture of Barack Obama titled \\"World's No 1' Terrorist\\"Obama, Accessed 20/02/2009 * Letters Page: one or two pages of letters sent to the paper during the week. * Action Column: a column containing upcoming eventsAction Column, Accessed 17/02/09 * News: the next few pages typically contain Marxist interpretation of World News * Left Politics: this tends to be followed by articles outlining developments with the left-wing political sphere * Theory and Reviews: towards the end of the paper there are articles dealing theoretical issues in Marxism, historical points and reviews of recent plays books etc. * Final News Item: the paper typically ends with a Marxist interpretation and response to a world event. The paper runs a weekly section 'What we Fight for'What we fight for, Accessed 1/02/2009 outlining in bullet point the core programme of the CPGB-PCC.

As the new millennium moved on the online version of the Weekly Worker became more important, till print readership became a small fraction of the total readership.Web Importance, Accessed 20/02/09 In 2008 the party's press broke irreversibly. After considering stopping print publication altogether the party decided to focus on web publication but attempt to develop the facilities to print an A4 version of the Weekly Worker. The party has been involved in its archive of both the Weekly Worker and The Leninist, whilst modernising and overhauling its website.Website Update, Accessed 20/02/09 Back issues of The Leninist were published online in July 2012. In May 2014, the Weekly Worker moved to a website separate from the party website.  History  The paper was first published in 1993, having developed out of The Leninist, the eponymous underground publication of the left group opposed to the Euro-communist leadership of the by then dissolved Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB). The group was defined by their adherence to orthodox Soviet Marxism and their strong opposition to Euro-communism within the former CPGB. This found primary expression in their stance towards the Soviet Union, where they denounced Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms and the developments within the Warsaw Pact. The party's position was as rigorous to lead the group to publish denouncements of the Polish Solidarno≈õƒá trade union for agitation against the workers regime. Such positioning was charactured by the nickname \\"Tankies\\".Tankies, Good News Section, Accessed 20 February 2009 The Leninist had a convoluted path to publication. After a factional confrontation with the then Euro-communist leaning leadership, a group called the New Communist Party (NCP) split from the CPGB in 1977. An event later regretted as premature and having been a move away from the real site of class struggle, the CPGB.NCP-CPGB Split, Accessed 20/02/09 A part of the NCP engaged close alliance with the Communist Party of Turkey (CPT), which left a lasting influence on the groups philosophy.Communist Party of Turkey and CPGB, accessed 20/02/09Communist Party of Turkey and CPGB, Accessed 20/02/09 A result of this contact with an active and intellectually lively communist organisation was disillusionment with the inadequacies of the NCP. Another split followed, leading to six joining the CPT and becoming active members. After a period of years this small grouplet, headed by John Chamberlain, decided that they should refocus on Britain's political situation. The group now numbering four members, began a two-year period of Marxist study with the aiming to \\"reforge the CPGB\\".Reforging the old CPGB, Accessed 20/02/09Reforging the CPGB, Accessed 20/02/09 These two years of study finally culminated in the publication of the first edition of The Leninist.First Leninist, Accessed 20 February 2009 After the dissolution of the CPGB, the group around The Leninist declared their intention to reforge the party on what they declared to be \\"firm Leninist principles\\". They organised an \\"emergency conference\\", at which they claimed the CPGB name, but not its assets. The group are technically named the CPGB- PCC but commonly known as just the CPGB. They are distinct from the Communist Party of Britain, which has the electoral rights to the Communist Party name, and the Communist Party of Great Britain (Marxist-Leninist). After having made this transition the group began the first publication of the Weekly Worker shortly after in 1993 and began its attempts to 'reforge the CPGB'. The 1990s marked a period of introspection for the group. The nature of the Soviet Union was reappraised as being Stalinist, however the group reaffirmed their Leninist heritage (as opposed to the Trotskyist heritage of many other left groups). Having decided on the central importance of re-evaluating theory, this debate was primarily conducted through the Weekly Worker. The Weekly Worker was a faultline during unity negotiations between left groups during the Socialist Alliance. It was proposed that the groups within the SA produced a single paper. This would have resulted in the loss of the Weekly Worker, something that was contentious within the CPGB, both pro and against. The discussions however became moot after the Socialist Workers Party decided to leave the Socialist Alliance and join the movement that would result in the formation of Respect ‚Äì The Unity Coalition. The formation of Respect ‚Äì The Unity Coalition marked an upswing in the importance of the Weekly Worker. The CPGB was initially divided whether to embrace the organisation, the PCC initially sided with the pro-affiliation faction led by Ian Donovan. It however reversed this position early in Respect's life to agree retrospectively with the anti-affiliation faction; Red Platform led by Manny Neira. This reversal managed to alienate both factions at different times, resulting initially in Manny Neira breaking away to form the short lived Red Party, followed by Ian Donovan after the change of position. This early debate though settled into a strong editorial line against Respect, for being an 'unprincipled unpopular front', which followed through to the split resulting in Respect Renewal and Left List. The paper's commitment to angular debate and reporting on the topic, combined with the lack of coverage from more official sources, led to increase in readership. The paper, at the height of the Respect project, reached 40,000 readers a week. This controversy has refreshed the party, seemingly leading to a new wave of confidence and generation of recruits.Confidence, Good News Section, Accessed 20/02/09 The paper offered to become the paper of the Campaign for a Marxist Party. This collapsed after repeated disagreements about Marxist theory and the logistics of running the movement with members of the Democratic Socialist Alliance. The paper has also been at the forefront over debates between the CPGB-PCC and the Alliance for Workers Liberty over Communist policy towards Israel. In line with Marxist tradition the actual CPGB-PCC contributors write under a variety of assumed names. John Chamberlain usually calls himself \\"Jack Conrad\\" or \\"John Bridge\\". This explains the multiplicity of authors but familiar sets of prose. The Weekly Worker has been estimated to have as few as 37 members as of 2007 (which is consistent with the ¬£1,000 the party attempts to raise through the paper every month to cover printing costs). This is an increase on the 10 or so who were initially part of The Leninist. John Chamberlain and Mike Macnair are reasonable indicators of the party position, with both sitting on the central committee of the CPGB-PCC, writing leading articles on theory and being the only members to have had books published by the party.Book List  References  External links  * Weekly Worker website Category:Communist newspapers Category:Communist Party of Great Britain Category:Publications established in 1993 Category:Weekly newspapers published in the United Kingdom Category:1993 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Socialist newspapers published in the United Kingdom ","title":"Weekly Worker"},{"id":"429704","text":"The Porteous Riot by James Skene, 1818 James Drummond The Porteous Riots surrounded the activities of Captain John Porteous (c. 1695 - 1736), Captain of the City Guard of Edinburgh, Scotland, who was lynched by a mob for his part in the killing of innocent civilians while ordering the men under his command to quell a disturbance during a public hanging in the Grassmarket, Edinburgh in April 1736. Although the rioters were generally supportive of the convicted smugglers, Porteous seems to have been a somewhat overbearing official, despised by the mob and the underclasses of Edinburgh society. The riot Re-enactors dressed as the Edinburgh City Guard at the time of the Porteous Riot On 14 April 1736 three convicted smugglers, Andrew Wilson, William Hall and George Robertson, were arrested, tried and condemned to death. Hall's sentence was commuted to exile, while Wilson and Robertson awaited their fate. A few days before the execution George Robertson was enabled by Wilson to escape from his guards while attending a service in St Giles', and, with the help of sympathetic supporters, eventually made his way to the Netherlands. The remaining convict, Andrew Wilson, was taken to be publicly hanged in the Grassmarket, Edinburgh on 14 April 1736. The body of Wilson was cut down against the wishes of the mob, and the ensuing riot was such that the hangman had to be placed in protective custody. As the situation worsened, the Lord Provost of Edinburgh, for fear of an attempt to rescue the victims, instructed Captain Porteous to call out the entire guard and to furnish them with powder and shot. After the execution the mob became violent and began to stone the City Guard. Accounts of events are confused, but what is certain is that Captain Porteous instructed his men to fire above the heads of the crowd but, in so doing, they shot and wounded people in the windows of the high tenement buildings opposite. The crowd became increasingly violent and, as panic set in, Captain Porteous ordered the guard to shoot into the mob, which led to the deaths of six people in all. The trial and appeal Porteous was arrested the same afternoon and charged with murder. He was tried at the High Court of Justiciary on 5 July 1736, where a majority of witnesses testified that Porteous had personally fired into the crowd on 14 April, although sixteen others said they had not seen him do so. Feelings were running high in Edinburgh and the jury unanimously found Porteous guilty of murder. He was sentenced to death, the execution set to take place in the Grassmarket on 8 September 1736. Porteous was imprisoned in the Tolbooth. Events in Scotland alarmed the government in London, and Sir Robert Walpole attempted to influence events by asking his representative in Edinburgh to become involved. But he had miscalculated, underestimating the depth of feeling in Scotland. A formal appeal was petitioned and the execution was deferred. Death of Porteous Drawing of the West Bow which connected the Lawnmarket to the Grassmarket Public resentment at a possible reprieve was such that a plot to murder Captain Porteous was hatched, and when the authorities heard of this it was decided to increase the guard at the Tolbooth prison. However, on the evening before this was due to happen, a large crowd of over four thousand gathered at Portsburgh, west of the city. Making their way across the Grassmarket to the Cowgate and up to the High Street, the mob converged on the Tolbooth, where they were eventually able to overpower the guards. Porteous was dragged from his cell up the Lawnmarket to the West Bow and down to the Grassmarket, where he was lynched from a dyer's pole, using a rope taken from a local draper's shop. After a short while he was dragged down and stripped of his nightgown and shirt, which was then wrapped around his head before he was hauled up again. However, the mob had not tied his hands and, as he struggled free, they broke his arm and shoulder, while another attempted to set light to his naked foot. He was taken down a further time and cruelly beaten before being hung up again, and died a short while later, just before midnight on 7 September 1736. He was buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh, the following day. Aftermath A plaque marks the spot where the lynching of Porteous took place The events in Edinburgh heightened the sense of alarm in London, where the government was concerned about the threat to its management of Scotland. It was thought by Walpole, Queen Caroline and the Duke of Newcastle that Porteous had been unnecessarily sacrificed and there were even rumours that the conspiracy had involved the local city magistrates. In February 1737 a parliamentary inquiry was held; the House of Lords initially proposed the disbanding of the town guard and removal of Netherbow Port, but subsequently dropped these suggestions. Eventually the only punishments enforced were a ¬£2,000 fine imposed on the city (used to support Porteous' widow) and the disbarment from all offices of the then Lord Provost Alexander Wilson. It was variously thought that Porteous' murder was carried out by friends of those who had been shot and killed, revenge by the smugglers, a Jacobite plot, or even a conspiracy by Presbyterian extremists. However, the organisation of events seems to imply a degree of planning, thought to be the work of James Maxwell, an Edinburgh journeyman carpenter, together with a small group of city tradesmen and journeymen. However, despite a reward of ¬£200 being made available by the government for information, those responsible for the murder of Porteous were never found. The events surrounding the Porteous Riots form part of the early chapters of the novel The Heart of Midlothian by Sir Walter Scott (1818), where they are recorded in graphic detail. Memorials Porteous's grave The final resting place of John Porteous in Greyfriars Kirkyard had for more than two hundred years been marked by a small square stone engraved with the single letter \\"P\\" and the date 1736.

They use a queue for messaging ‚Äì the passing of control or of content. Group communication systems provide similar kinds of functionality. The message queue paradigm is a sibling of the publisher/subscriber pattern, and is typically one part of a larger message- oriented middleware system. Most messaging systems support both the publisher/subscriber and message queue models in their API, e.g. Java Message Service (JMS). Remit and ownership Message queues implement an asynchronous communication pattern between two or more processes/threads whereas the sending and receiving party do not need to interact with the message queue at the same time. Messages placed onto the queue are stored until the recipient retrieves them. Message queues have implicit or explicit limits on the size of data that may be transmitted in a single message and the number of messages that may remain outstanding on the queue.Dive Into Queue Module In Python. Overview of POSIX message queues Remit Many implementations of message queues function internally within an operating system or within an application. Such queues exist for the purposes of that system only.Win32 system message queues. Linux and POSIX message queues. Overview of POSIX message queues at linux.die.netUsing Linux Message Queues. Linux message queue functions at www.civilized.com Other implementations allow the passing of messages between different computer systems, potentially connecting multiple applications and multiple operating systems.For example, the MSMQ product. These message queuing systems typically provide resilience functionality to ensure that messages do not get \\"lost\\" in the event of a system failure. Examples of commercial implementations of this kind of message queuing software (also known as message-oriented middleware) include IBM MQ (formerly MQ Series) and Oracle Advanced Queuing (AQ). There is a Java standard called Java Message Service, which has several proprietary and free software implementations. Real-time operating systems (RTOSes) such as VxWorks and QNX encourage the use of message queuing as the primary inter-process or inter- thread communication mechanism. This can result in integration between message passing and CPU scheduling. Early examples of commercial RTOSes that encouraged a message-queue basis to inter-thread communication also include VRTX and pSOS+, both of which date to the early 1980s. The Erlang programming language uses processes to provide concurrency; these processes communicate asynchronously using message queuing. Ownership The message queue software can be either proprietary, open source or a mix of both. It is then on run either on premise in private servers or on external cloud servers (message queuing service). * Proprietary options have the longest history, and include products from the inception of message queuing, such as IBM MQ, and those tied to specific operating systems, such as Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ). Cloud service providers also provide their proprietary solutions such as Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS), StormMQ, Solace, and IBM MQ. * Open source choices of messaging middleware systems includes Apache ActiveMQ, Apache Kafka, Apache Qpid, Apache RocketMQ, Enduro/X, JBoss Messaging, JORAM, RabbitMQ, Sun Open Message Queue, and Tarantool. Examples on hardware-based messaging middleware vendors are Solace, Apigee, and IBM MQ. Usage In a typical message- queueing implementation, a system administrator installs and configures message-queueing software (a queue manager or broker), and defines a named message queue. Or they register with a message queuing service. An application then registers a software routine that \\"listens\\" for messages placed onto the queue. Second and subsequent applications may connect to the queue and transfer a message onto it. The queue-manager software stores the messages until a receiving application connects and then calls the registered software routine. The receiving application then processes the message in an appropriate manner. There are often numerous options as to the exact semantics of message passing, including: * Durability - messages may be kept in memory, written to disk, or even committed to a DBMS if the need for reliability indicates a more resource-intensive solution. * Security policies - which applications should have access to these messages? * Message purging policies - queues or messages may have a \\"time to live\\" * Message filtering - some systems support filtering data so that a subscriber may only see messages matching some pre-specified criteria of interest * Delivery policies - do we need to guarantee that a message is delivered at least once, or no more than once? * Routing policies - in a system with many queue servers, what servers should receive a message or a queue's messages? * Batching policies - should messages be delivered immediately? Or should the system wait a bit and try to deliver many messages at once? * Queuing criteria - when should a message be considered \\"enqueued\\"? When one queue has it? Or when it has been forwarded to at least one remote queue? Or to all queues? * Receipt notification - A publisher may need to know when some or all subscribers have received a message. These are all considerations that can have substantial effects on transaction semantics, system reliability, and system efficiency. Standards and protocols Historically, message queuing has used proprietary, closed protocols, restricting the ability for different operating systems or programming languages to interact in a heterogeneous set of environments. An early attempt to make message queuing more ubiquitous was Sun Microsystems' JMS specification, which provided a Java-only abstraction of a client API. This allowed Java developers to switch between providers of message queuing in a fashion similar to that of developers using SQL databases. In practice, given the diversity of message queuing techniques and scenarios, this wasn't always as practical as it could be. Three standards have emerged which are used in open source message queue implementations: #Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) ‚Äì feature-rich message queue protocol, approved as ISO/IEC 19464 since April 2014 #Streaming Text Oriented Messaging Protocol (STOMP) ‚Äì simple, text-oriented message protocol #MQTT (formerly MQ Telemetry Transport) - lightweight message queue protocol especially for embedded devices These protocols are at different stages of standardization and adoption. The first two operate at the same level as HTTP, MQTT at the level of TCP/IP. Some proprietary implementations also use HTTP to provide message queuing by some implementations, such as Amazon's SQS. This is because it is always possible to layer asynchronous behaviour (which is what is required for message queuing) over a synchronous protocol using request-response semantics. However, such implementations are constrained by the underlying protocol in this case and may not be able to offer the full fidelity or set of options required in message passing above. Synchronous vs. asynchronous Many of the more widely known communications protocols in use operate synchronously. The HTTP protocol ‚Äì used in the World Wide Web and in web services ‚Äì offers an obvious example where a user sends a request for a web page and then waits for a reply. However, scenarios exist in which synchronous behaviour is not appropriate. For example, AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) can be used to asynchronously send text, JSON or XML messages to update part of a web page with more relevant information. Google uses this approach for their Google Suggest, a search feature which sends the user's partially typed queries to Google's servers and returns a list of possible full queries the user might be interested in the process of typing. This list is asynchronously updated as the user types. Other asynchronous examples exist in event notification systems and publish/subscribe systems. * An application may need to notify another that an event has occurred, but does not need to wait for a response. * In publish/subscribe systems, an application \\"publishes\\" information for any number of clients to read. In both of the above examples it would not make sense for the sender of the information to have to wait if, for example, one of the recipients had crashed. Applications need not be exclusively synchronous or asynchronous. An interactive application may need to respond to certain parts of a request immediately (such as telling a customer that a sales request has been accepted, and handling the promise to draw on inventory), but may queue other parts (such as completing calculation of billing, forwarding data to the central accounting system, and calling on all sorts of other services) to be done some time later. In all these sorts of situations, having a subsystem which performs message-queuing (or alternatively, a broadcast messaging system) can help improve the behavior of the overall system. Implementation in UNIX There are two common message queue implementations in UNIX. One is part of the SYS V API, the other one is part of POSIX. SYS V UNIX SYS V implements message passing by keeping an array of linked lists as message queues. Each message queue is identified by its index in the array, and has a unique descriptor. A given index can have multiple possible descriptors. UNIX gives standard functions to access the message passing feature. ;\`msgget()\`: This system call takes a key as an argument and returns a descriptor of the queue with the matching key if it exists. If it does not exist, and the \`IPC_CREAT\` flag is set, it makes a new message queue with the given key and returns its descriptor. ;\`msgrcv()\`: Used to receive a message from a given queue descriptor. The caller process must have read permissions for the queue. It is of two types. :*Blocking receive puts the child to sleep if it cannot find a requested message type. It sleeps till another message is posted in the queue, and then wakes up to check again. :*Non-blocking receive returns immediately to the caller, mentioning that it failed. ;\`msgctl()\`: Used to change message queue parameters like the owner. Most importantly, it is used to delete the message queue by passing the \`IPC_RMID\` flag. A message queue can be deleted only by its creator, owner, or the superuser. POSIX The POSIX.1-2001 message queue API is the later of the two UNIX message queue APIs. It is distinct from the SYS V API, but provides similar function. The unix man page \`mq_overview(7)\` provides an overview of POSIX message queues. Graphical user interfaces Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) employ a message queue, also called an event queue or input queue, to pass graphical input actions, such as mouse clicks, keyboard events, or other user inputs, to the application program. The windowing system places messages indicating user or other events, such as timer ticks or messages sent by other threads, into the message queue. The GUI application removes these events one at a time by calling a routine called \`getNextEvent()\` or similar in an event loop, and then calling the appropriate application routine to process that event.

At its introduction, the Cutlass was Oldsmobile's smallest model; it began as a unibody compact car, but saw its greatest success as a body-on-frame intermediate. Introduced as the top trim level in Oldsmobile's compact F-85 line, the Cutlass evolved into a distinct series of its own, spawning numerous variants, including the formidable 4-4-2 muscle car in 1964, premium Cutlass Supreme in 1966, and outright performance Hurst/Olds in 1968, as well as the Vista Cruiser station wagon. By the 1980s, Oldsmobile was using the Cutlass as a sub-marque, with numerous vehicle lines bearing the name simultaneously. These included the Cutlass Calais compact, the midsize Cutlass Ciera, the Cutlass Cruiser station wagon, and top of the line midsize Cutlass Supreme. The Cutlass was named after the type of sword, which was common during the Age of Sail. Origins The 1954 Oldsmobile Cutlass on display at the 1955 General Motors Motorama Oldsmobile first used the Cutlass name on an experimental sports coupe designed in 1954. It rode a wheelbase, and featured a dramatic fastback roofline and stock V8. Its platform was similar to the compact F-85 introduced seven years later. First-generation (compact) 1961‚Äì1963 General Motors began developing its first compact cars in 1956, beginning with initial planning on what would become the Chevrolet Corvair in 1960. The following year a second series of somewhat larger cars was planned for Buick, Oldsmobile, and Pontiac; what would be termed \\"senior compacts\\". They would share the same body shell and lightweight engine. Oldsmobile designer Irvin Rybicki began work on the Olds model in 1957. It finally went on sale in 1960 as a 1961 model. The Oldsmobile F-85 shared a new Y-body platform with the Buick Special and Pontiac Tempest, using a 112-inch (2845 mm) wheelbase and still-novel unibody construction. It was Oldsmobile's smallest, cheapest model‚Äîsome two feet (60 cm) shorter and $451 less than the next-smallest Olds, the full-sized Dynamic 88. The F-85 had double wishbone front suspension and a four-link live axle in the rear, suspended with coil springs all around; the drum brakes had a diameter of . Unlike its platform mates, the first- generation F-85 was only ever offered with a V8 engine. Standard engine was the new Rockette all-aluminum V8, Oldsmobile's version of the Buick aluminum V8 which later became famous as the Rover V8. With a two-barrel carburetor and an 8.75:1 compression ratio, it was rated at 4,800 rpm and at 3,200 rpm. Specifications for the base engine remained the same throughout the 1961‚Äì1963 production run. 1961 The first-year F-85 was offered in two body styles, a four-door sedan or a four-door station wagon with either two or three seats, and in a choice of two trim levels, base or De Luxe. Transmission options were initially a 3-speed manual (with synchromesh on the top two gears) and the newly introduced 3-speed Roto Hydramatic. Overall length was , and curb weight was around . A few months after the model introduction, Oldsmobile added a \\"power pack option\\", which included a four-barrel carbureted, high-compression (10.25:1), dual exhaust version of the 215 cu in aluminum V8, and a shorter 3.36:1 final drive ratio with either manual and automatic transmissions. This premium fuel-only engine was rated at at 4,800 rpm and at 3,200 rpm. Initial sales were somewhat disappointing, but were soon picked up by the May 1961 introduction of a pair of pillared two-door coupes, each with a different roofline and market placement: the F-85 Club Coupe, which became the lowest- priced Oldsmobile model, and the sporty F-85 Cutlass. The Cutlass came equipped with the 185 hp \\"power pack\\" drivetrain, and featured De Luxe-type exterior trim with , a more upscale interior with standard bucket seats, upholstered in two-tone vertically pleated vinyl, and an optional center console. 80,347 F-85s were built in total for the 1961 model year. Rear view of a 1962 Oldsmobile F-85 Club Coupe Car Life magazine tested an F-85 with the standard engine and automatic transmission, and recorded a 0-60 (0‚Äì96 km/h) time of 14.5 seconds, with a top speed just over . They praised its construction, but found its steering too slow and its suspension too soft for enthusiastic driving. 1962 For 1962 styling changes were minor, and included a new grille, different chrome ornamentation on the bodysides and new interior trim. The existing F-85 models returned, and a convertible was added to the line-up in September, available in both standard and Cutlass versions. The automatic transmission was replaced with an upgraded 4 speed Roto 5 Hydro- Matic transmission, and an all-synchromesh four-speed manual became optional. Overall F-85 sales rose to 97,382, with the Cutlass displacing the four-door De Luxe sedan as the top-selling model. =The Oldsmobile Jetfire= The bigger news was the arrival of the Oldsmobile Jetfire, a Cutlass pillarless hardtop with a turbocharged version of the 215 V8, dubbed Turbo-Rocket. This made the 1962 Jetfire the first ever turbocharged production car, an honor it shares with the 1962 Chevrolet Corvair Monza Spyder. Equipped with a Garrett AiResearch turbocharger and a sidedraft, one-barrel, blow-through carburetor, the Turbo-Rocket engine was rated at at 4,600 rpm and at 3,200 rpm. The Jetfire came with bucket seats and console, unique trim‚Äîtwo chrome fins on the hood and full-length contrast stripes on the bodysides‚Äîand a pressure/vacuum gauge mounted in the console (where it was almost hidden). Although much faster than a standard F-85, the Jetfire was criticized for having the same soft suspension as its less-powerful brothers, for its lack of a tachometer and other instruments, and for the poor shift quality of both the automatic transmission and the optional four-speed. Car and Driver tested an automatic Jetfire and obtained a 0‚Äì60 time of 9.2 seconds, with a top speed of 110 mph (176 km/h). The Jetfire's high cost (nearly $300 over a standard Cutlass hardtop) and reliability problems with its turbocharged engines limited sales to 3,765. Ultimately the Jetfire engine was far ahead of its time. With forced induction and an already high compression ratio the Jetfire was capable of producing more torque than a naturally aspirated engine that was twice its size, significantly improving the engine's efficiency and usability in real- life driving conditions, turbo lag not being an issue at motorway speeds. But since turbo and supercharging the engine essentially means forcing the compression in the combustion chamber even higher, the Jetfire was prone to 'spark-knock' and without modern engine management systems the only way to mitigate this was to use a 50/50 mixture of methanol and distilled water.https://www.hemmings.com/stories/2013/04/18/yesterdays-car-of- tomorrow-1962-1963-oldsmobile-jetfire 1963 The F-85 was restyled for the 1963 model year, to a crisper, more squared off design than the one of the 1961‚Äì62 models. While the wheelbase was unchanged at 112 inches, the new sheetmetal added to the F-85's rear overhang, increasing overall length to . The Jetfire and its turbocharged V8 returned, for what would be its final year. Three-row seating was dropped on station wagons. On automatic transmission models only, the compression ratio of the \\"Cutlass\\" engine was raised to 10.75:1, pushing output to at 4800 rpm and at 3200 rpm. A Delcotron alternator became standard on all models, as well as on the rest of the Oldsmobile car line. Overall sales climbed again to 121,639, of which 53,492 were Cutlasses. Second generation (intermediate) 1964‚Äì1967 Disappointing sales of the compact F-85, along with the introduction of Ford Motor Company's intermediate Fairlane in 1962, prompted GM to enlarge the senior compacts for the 1964 model year. 1964 The new intermediate F-85 now rode a conventional body-on-frame chassis with a perimeter frame which it shared with the newly-introduced \\"A-body\\" Chevrolet Chevelle, and upgraded Buick Special and Pontiac Tempest. Wheelbase grew to , overall length to , and weight by more than . Both the aluminum V8 and the Roto Hydramatic were discontinued in favor of a new cast-iron small-block V8 of displacement and an optional two- speed Jetaway automatic transmission with variable-pitch stator. Buick's V6 was the standard engine. The body styles of the previous model returned, and a new Vista Cruiser, a stretched-wheelbase () version of the standard station wagon featuring a raised rear roof with tinted skylights and a fold-down, forward-facing third seat, debuted on February 4, 1964. The 4-4-2 model, derived from the BO-9 police package, was also introduced in March 1964 (costing $285.14 in 1964), as an answer to the new intermediate muscle car market created by the Pontiac GTO that same year. Sales increased to 167,002 for 1964, not counting Vista Cruisers. 1965 For 1965 a modest facelift increased overall length to while the front end received a \\"dumbbell-style\\" grille similar to full-sized Olds models. A bigger 400 cu in (6.6 L) engine was included with the 4-4-2 option, based on the newly introduced 425 cu in (6.9 L) engine from the full-sized Oldsmobiles while the Buick 225 V6 and Olds 330 Jetfire Rocket V8 were carried over from the previous year, with increased power ratings for the V8 options. Sales increased again to 187,097. The year 1965 was the first for Oldsmobile's \\"Rocket\\" logo that would last, with minor variations, until the 1990s. 1965 Oldsmobile F-85 V6 Sports Coupe 1966 The 1966 models were slightly restyled again, with body lines similar to the full-sized 88, and semi-fastback rooflines with extended sail panels and tunneled rear windows on Sport (pillared) and Holiday (hardtop) coupes. The Buick V6 was replaced on base models by an Oldsmobile-badged \\"Action-Line 6\\" version of Chevrolet's \\"Turbo-Thrift\\" straight-6 engine, while the Jetfire Rocket V8 continued with power ratings of . New that year was the Cutlass Supreme four-door hardtop sedan also dubbed the Holiday Sedan by Oldsmobile, the first such body style for Olds' intermediate line. 1966 Oldsmobile Cutlass Celebrity Sedan 1967 Changes for 1967 included the availability of optional disc brakes and the three-speed Turbo-Hydramatic to supplement the two-speed Jetaway. A new option was the Turnpike Cruiser package on Cutlass Supreme coupes and convertibles, which used a two-barrel carburetor and mild camshaft with the 400 cu in (6.6 L) engine and a (numerically) low axle ratio for efficient and relatively economical freeway cruising. The Turnpike Cruiser used the heavy-duty suspension of the 4-4-2, and was available only with a Turbo-Hydramatic. 1967 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme Holiday Sedan Third generation (intermediate) 1968‚Äì1972=1968 The F-85/Cutlass underwent a major body restyle in 1968, as did all other GM A-body cars. Oldsmobile's was penned by the styling studio headed by Stan Wilen. Two-door and four-door models now rode different wheelbases: for two-doors and for four-doors. Ostensibly, this change was to allow more individual styling, although several engineers were quoted off the record as saying the wheelbase had created problems with uncomfortable \\"freeway hop\\" owing to its resonance frequency. Overall length shrunk about , but curb weight rose approximately to for the hardtop coupe. Two-door F-85 and Cutlass models adopted a semi-fastback roofline. Base model remained the F-85, with mid-level Cutlass S, and upscale Cutlass Supreme, as well as the 4-4-2, which became a distinct model instead of an option package. A limited-production model was the Hurst/Olds, a special 4-4-2 marketed by Oldsmobile and Hurst Performance. The H/O combined the 4-4-2 suspension package with a Rocket V8, not ordinarily offered in Cutlasses because of a GM policy limiting intermediates to engines of or less. Cutlass and Vista Cruiser station wagons were likewise redesigned; the F-85 wagon was discontinued. Engine options were similar to the previous year, although the Cutlass's V8 option was expanded to , still with both two- and four-barrel carburetion. The variable-pitch stator feature of both optional two-speed Jetaway and three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic automatic transmissions was discontinued. 1969 1969 Oldsmobile Cutlass S Convertible The 1969 F-85/Cutlass models received only minor trim changes from their '68 counterparts such as a now-Olds trademark split grille with vertical bars and vertical taillights. Per federal safety regulations, headrests were now standard equipment and the ignition switch moved from the instrument panel to the steering column to lock the steering wheel when not in use, in common with all other 1969-model GM cars, one year before the locking steering columns were federally mandated. Engine offerings were unchanged from 1968, but a new three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic 350 transmission was added to the option list and available with all versions of the Rocket V8, including the standard two- barrel version, four-barrel \\"Ultra High Compression\\" option and the W-31 option, conservatively rated at . The two-speed Jetaway automatic was still available with the Chevy-built \\"Action-Line\\" six or the two-barrel V8. The Turnpike Cruiser two-barrel Rocket V8 was dropped and the four-barrel 400 engine from the 4-4-2 was available only in the Vista Cruiser wagons. 1970 1970 Oldsmobile Cutlass S Sport Coupe From 1970 the Cutlass Supreme Holiday Coupe wore a unique notchback roofline. The 1970 F-85 and Cutlass was available in seven body styles, three of which were coupes: a pillared fastback Sports Coupe (in F-85, Cutlass S or 4-4-2 trims), an hardtop fastback Holiday Coupe (Cutlass S and 4-4-2 only), and finally a more formal notchback Holiday Coupe, only offered in Cutlass Supreme trim. This practice was similar to that followed at the time by Ford and Mercury for theirintermediates, which were offered in both notchback and fastback coupes starting in 1968. Also available were a four-door hardtop Holiday Sedan, a four-door Town Sedan, a convertible, a flat-top station wagon called the Custom Cruiser, as well as the fancier Vista-Cruiser station wagon. Counting all trim level and body style permutations, Oldsmobile's 1970 lineup included 15 different intermediate models. With GM tossing out the 400 cubic-inch limit for intermediates and the 4-4-2 now coming standard with the larger 455 cubic-inch Rocket V8 from the big Oldsmobiles and previously used in the 1968-69 Hurst/Olds, Olds discontinued the 400 engine entirely and also offered the 455 as an option in the Cutlass S models and the Vista Cruiser wagons. There was an SX option that became available in 1970 and was available only on the Cutlass Supreme hardtop and convertible. The SX cars all had the 455 engine and TH-400 automatic transmission. The same assortment of three- and four- speed manual transmissions were carried over from previous years with Hurst shifters used on floor-mounted three-speeds and all four-speeds. The two-speed Jetaway automatic transmission was discontinued entirely with the three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic now the sole offering for shiftless driving. Cutlass S coupes with the optional Strato bucket seats and Turbo Hydra-matic could be equipped with the Hurst Dual-Gate shifter (also known as the \\"His and Her- Shifter\\") in conjunction with the extra-cost center console. The Hurst Dual- Gate made it possible to either put the transmission in Drive, and let the transmission decide when to shift. Or it could be placed in a manual mode, much like today's computer-controlled automatics. 1970 Oldsmobile Rallye 350 A 1970-only offering was the Oldsmobile Rallye 350, a value-priced high- performance model using the 350 engine. It was intended for younger buyers that wanted the performance and looks of a supercar, but might have trouble with the rising insurance premiums associated with 455-engined cars like the 4-4-2. In essence the Rallye 350 was an appearance package (coded W45) tied to mandatory options, and could be ordered on the Cutlass S Holiday or Sports Coupe as well as on the F-85 Sports Coupe. All Rallye 350s were painted in Sebring Yellow with matching urethane-coated bumpers front and rear. The package also included special black and orange decals, blacked out grille and yellow-painted 7\\" wide Super Stock II rally wheels without trim rings, wearing G70√ó14\\" bias-belted Wide Oval blackwall tires. The engine was the L74 air- inducted high-compression 350 cu.in. Rocket V8 engine, fitted with a Quadrajet carburetor and producing . Required options were the associated \\"Force-Air\\" fiberglass vented hood, dual exhaust with 4-4-2-style megaphone outlets, 3.23:1 axle ratio, heavy-duty \\"Rallye-Sport Suspension\\" with front and rear stabilizers, sports mirrors and sports steering wheel. 1971 1971 Oldsmobile Cutlass Town Sedan The 1971 model shared much of the same exterior sheetmetal as the 1970, but with a new hood, grille, and headlight assemblies, as well as new bumpers and taillights. Four new exterior body colors were offered, Viking Blue, Lime Green, Bittersweet, and Saturn Gold. The famous \\"Rocket\\" V8 continued in several different sizes and power options, with both the large 455 and 'small-block' 350 available with either 2- or 4-barrel carburetors. This was the last year for the 250 cubic-inch six-cylinder engine, as it had not been a popular offering in Olds intermediates. All engines were now fitted with hardened valve seats, preparing for the upcoming mandate for unleaded gasoline that took effect with the introduction of catalytic converters on 1975 models. The 1971 Olds engines also featured lowered compression ratios and designed to run on regular leaded, low-lead or unleaded gasoline with a research octane rating of 91 or higher (equivalent to 87 octane by today's octane measurements). 1972 1972 Oldsmobile Cutlass hardtop For 1972, there were minor style changes to the Cutlass, and the 4-4-2 reverted to being a trim line (W-29 option) on the Cutlass instead of an individual model, as it was in 1971. The primary changes to the 1972 Cutlass were the front grilles and the tail lights. The straight six engine was dropped, but would return to the lineup in 1975. The Hurst/Olds used the Cutlass Supreme notchback hardtop and convertible bodies. A 1972 Hurst/Olds paced the Indianapolis 500, and Olds built about 630 replicas, some 25% of them convertibles.Flory, J. \\"Kelly\\", Jr. American Cars 1960‚Äì1972 (Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Coy, 2004), p.864. The entry-level F-85 series was reduced to a single four-door sedan, and then discontinued mid-year due to low sales. This ended the use of the F-85 nameplate, although it would later resurface on an entry-level version of the compact Omega. Fourth generation (intermediate) 1973‚Äì1977=1973 The Cutlass line was redesigned for 1973 using GM's new \\"Colonnade\\" A-body platform. The model lineup consisted of the base Cutlass, Cutlass \\"S\\", Cutlass Supreme, Cutlass Salon, Vista Cruiser station wagon, and the 4-4-2 appearance package on the Cutlass \\"S\\" colonnade coupe. While rooflines were shared with other GM divisions, the Cutlass bodies had two Oldsmobile-specific convex creases‚Äîone starting behind the front wheel and running rearward into the door and curving upward at its trailing end, and the other curving down just ahead of the rear wheel and continued by the crease line of the quarter panel behind the rear wheel. The Cutlass \\"S\\" and 4-4-2 offered optional \\"Strato\\" bucket seats with high seatbacks and built-in head restraints; these seats could be swiveled 90 degrees to permit easier entry and exit for the driver and front passenger. The new Cutlass Salon was offered first as a 4-door Colonnade sedan, which was joined in 1974 by a 2-door hardtop coupe. It was an upscale Euro-style luxury/sports package, similar in concept to the Pontiac Grand Am, and was the first Oldsmobile with the international-flags emblem. The Salon included items such as upgraded suspension, radial tires, reclining bucket seats and a hand-operated headlamp dimmer switch built into the turn signal switch. All Cutlass models came standard with front disc brakes The standard engine was a 350 Rocket V8 (K VIN engine code), a 350 Rocket V8 with dual exhaust (M code), a 455 Rocket V8 (U code, or L75), and a 455 V8, with a hotter cam and W30-style heads. This engine was called the L77 (V code), and was used primarily in four-speed cars and automatics without air conditioning in the Hurst/Olds. Transmissions included a standard column-shift three-speed manual, optional four-speed Muncie M20 manual with Hurst shifter, and three-speed Turbo-Hydramatic automatic. Upgraded gauges were optional. 1974 Changes for 1974 included new taillight lenses and radiator grilles, and a new front fascia with bumper- mounted turn signals used only on the base model. There were newly-mandated rear bumpers, with a new hydraulic energy absorpotion system. Both the 350 and 455 Rocket V8s were carried over unchanged from 1973 aside from revisions required to meet 1974 emissions regulations. The Turbo Hydramatic transmission became standard equipment on all Cutlass models. 1975 1975 Cutlass 4-door sedan For 1975, Oldsmobile added two smaller engines to attract economy-minded buyers in the aftermath of the 1973‚Äì74 energy crisis. These were the Chevrolet-built inline six (previously offered from 1966‚Äì71) and a new 260 V8 based on the Olds 350 Rocket V8, which continued as an option. Also continuing was the 455 Rocket V8, rated at . All engines had catalytic converters and required unleaded gasoline in the United States; Canadian buyers could opt to delete the converter.\\"Canada Hangs Tough in Rough Times\\", The Windsor Star, 9 July 1975, p.42 The three-speed manual transmission returned as standard equipment in conjunction with the six-cylinder engine on all Cutlass models except Salons and station wagons. However, only 0.2% of Cutlasses were built with a manual transmission as most buyers wanted the 350 V8 and Turbo Hydramatic as in previous years. The 1975 grilles were somewhat more angular and separated into eight pieces on each side. The front turn signals were now incorporated into the grille. At the rear, new two-piece taillights were divided vertically. The S and Supreme both had a chrome strip atop the hood, while the Supreme also had the Oldsmobile logo mounted atop the grille. A fuel economy gauge was optional. The Cutlass line overtook the full- size Delta 88 as the best-selling Oldsmobile line in 1975, with the Cutlass Supreme coupe accounting for the majority of those sales, surpassing the Chevrolet Chevelle and Ford Torino to become the best-selling intermediate- sized car in America. The Cutlass was also the second-best selling car line in the U.S. in 1975, with only the full-sized Chevrolet Impala/Caprice ahead of it. 1976 The Cutlass became America's best selling car this year and would hold this title for most years into the 1980s. A restyled front end with waterfall-type split grilles and new rectangular headlights was introduced that would become an Olds Cutlass trademark in coming years, lasting into the late 1980s. Coupe bodies were reshaped for a smoother, less contoured look than the 1973-75 design, a design change shared with Buick's A-body coupes. Cutlass sedans and wagons kept their bulges through the end of model year 1977. Taillights were revised and the license plate/fuel filler was moved above the bumper. The base Cutlass line was dropped, with the Cutlass S nameplate now applied to the entry-level coupe and sedan this year - both of which featured an aerodynamic slanted front nose in contrast to the upright front ends of other Cutlass models including the Cutlass Supreme coupe, sedan and wagon, Vista Cruiser wagon, Cutlass Salon coupe and sedan, and the new Cutlass Supreme Brougham coupe. The 4-4-2 option was still offered on Cutlass S coupes as an appearance/handling package. Engine offerings were carried over from 1975 including the Chevy-built 250 cubic-inch inline six and Olds-built Rocket V8s of 260, 350 or 455 cubic inches. A three-speed manual transmission was standard with the six-cylinder engine but Turbo Hydra-matic was optional with this engine and the 260, and required with the 350 and 455 V8s. A new option this year was the T-50 Borg-Warner five-speed manual transmission, which was available only with the 260 V8. 1977 1977 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme Brougham Coupe New grilles highlighted all 1977 Cutlass models with Cutlass S sedans and coupes reverting to an upright grille/front end while the more aerodynamic slanted front end was only offered with the 4-4-2 option. \\"Oldsmobile\\" nameplates in a new sans-serif typeface replaced the former script ones. Inside was a slightly revised instrument panel with the clock relocated to the right side of the dash above the glovebox. This also marked the introduction of Oldsmobile's new mechanical digital clock. The Chevrolet inline six was replaced by Buick's 231 V6 (standard on all models except Salon and Vista Cruiser), while the 260 and 350 Rocket V8s were carried over. The big-block 455 Rocket V8 was discontinued and replaced by a new small-block 403 cubic inch Rocket V8. Transmissions included a three-speed manual (standard and only available with the V6 engine), five-speed manual (coupes with 260 V8 only) or three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic - optional on V6 models, included with the 260 V8 in sedans and 350 and 403 V8s on all models, and standard on station wagons. A sedan was added to the Supreme Brougham line, while the Salon lost its sedan version. The base wagon dropped the Cutlass Cruiser nameplate and became part of the Vista Cruiser line. 632,742 Cutlasses were built in 1977, the highest production for the model. Fifth-generation (intermediate) 1978‚Äì1988=1978 The 1978 Cutlass was downsized to the new version of GM's A-body with a shorter, wheelbase. This Cutlass was lighter than earlier versions at around , and it could be ordered with any of several engines built by GM's different divisions; a Buick 231 V6, Oldsmobile 260 V8, Pontiac 301 V8 or Chevrolet 305 V8s with either two- or four-barrel carburetors. This generation could still be ordered with the T-50 Borg-Warner five-speed manual transmission for several model years. The '78 Cutlass lineup included the Salon and Salon Brougham fastback coupes and sedans and the formal roof Supreme, Supreme Brougham and Calais coupes. The Salons quickly proved to be far less popular than the notchback Supreme and Calais coupes. There were also \\"two-seat\\" (6 passengers in two rows) Cutlass Cruiser and Cutlass Cruiser Brougham station wagons; both being smaller, more conventional replacements of the three-seat (8 passenger) Vista Cruiser. Oldsmobile Cutlass Salon Broughams featured softer, quieter rides, and fancier trim and upholstery. A factory T-top was optional on notchback coupes only. The 4-4-2 appearance and handling package, available on Salon coupes, featured large lower body stripes and 4-4-2 decals outside but not always shown with decals, unique 4-4-2 seats and badges inside, and a taut performance suspension featuring quicker-ratio steering, heavier springs, stiffer shocks, a stiffer front stabilizer bar, a rear stabilizer bar, and bigger tires. The Cutlass Calais used essentially the same suspension as the 4-4-2, but it also came standard with several other performance and touring options, including full instrumentation, an aluminum spoked sport steering wheel, reclining front bucket seats and a center console with floor shifter. Cosmetically, the 1978 line continued through 1979 with only slight changes front and rear. A bewildering array of grilles were used on the different equipment levels for 1978 and 1979, including two sets each of slotted (Salon), waterfall (Supreme incl. Brougham), and eggcrate (Calais) style designs. 1979 Cutlass Calais coupe with the Hurst/Olds W-30 package The same model lineup continued, with a revision of both the front grille and taillight lenses. A diesel version of the Oldsmobile 260 (based on the Olds 350 diesel) was optional; diesel Cutlasses had the \\"Oldsmobile Diesel\\" badges on the decklids, where gasoline-powered Cutlasses had the \\"Rocket\\" logo. Only 2499 Cutlass Calais coupes were equipped with the Hurst/Olds W-30 package, featuring unique aluminum wheels trimmed with gold paint, an exclusive console-mounted Hurst Dual Gate floor shifter, special gold over black or white two-tone paint and an otherwise unavailable Oldsmobile 350 V8 with a four-barrel carb and dual outlet exhausts. It is estimated that only 537 cars with the H/O package had T-Tops. 1980 Cutlass Supreme and Calais coupes received new header panels incorporating four headlights, mimicking the 1977 model. The four-door Salon was dropped due to poor sales. Taking its place was a conventional notchback sedan known simply as \\"Cutlass,\\" with base, LS, and Brougham trim levels available. Sister division Buick did the same with their Buick Century sedan (the 1978 to 1980 Centuries shared the bodyshell with the Cutlass Salon). The 4-4-2 package was moved to the Cutlass Calais, and while it lacked the Dual Gate shifter, it was essentially a carryover of the 1979 Hurst/Olds, even having the Oldsmobile 350 V8 886 80 442's were produced for 1980. The 260 diesel engine was dropped, as it was considerably slower yet no more economic than the 5.7-litre diesel. 1981 Cutlass Supreme notchback sedan 1981 1981 Cutlass Cruiser diesel station wagon The fastback Salon coupe was dropped, and the Supreme and Calais got a restyle that included a more aerodynamic nose and smoother body lines. Sedans got quad headlamps and a new grille. The 4-4-2 was dropped. Most of this range continued to be marketed as the Cutlass Supreme until 1986, although the Cutlass Cruiser was replaced for 1984. Cutlass family 1982‚Äì1997 In 1982, Oldsmobile began using the Cutlass nameplate as a sub-marque, with numerous distinct vehicle lines bearing the name simultaneously. Cutlass Ciera (1982‚Äì1996) 1987 Cutlass Ciera The more space-efficient Cutlass Ciera was introduced on GM's new front-wheel drive mid-sized A platform in 1982. The Cutlass Cruiser station wagon nameplate followed the Ciera to its new platform in 1984. Coupes were produced until 1992, sedans and wagons until 1996. For the final year in production, this model was renamed simply Oldsmobile Ciera. During its run, the Cutlass Ciera was consistently Oldsmobile's best-selling model. Cutlass Supreme (1982‚Äì1997)1980‚Äì1988= 1987 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme 442 Meanwhile, the previous-generation Cutlass Supreme continued on the (now renamed) rear-wheel-drive G-body platform for six more years. The Hurst/Olds edition reappeared for two years in 1983 and 1984. From 1985 through 1987 the 4-4-2 replaced the Hurst/Olds as the high performance model. Until 1984, the deluxe Cutlass Supreme model was known as the Cutlass Calais. When the Calais nameplate moved to its own platform in 1985, the top Supreme was renamed to Cutlass Salon. As the new front-wheel drive Cutlass Supreme model was being launched in 1988, the rear-drive G-special coupe remained in production for one final model year as the Cutlass Supreme Classic. =1988‚Äì1997= 1990-91 Cutlass Supreme sedan The premium Cutlass Supreme nameplate was moved to the new front-wheel-drive mid-sized GM W platform in 1988. Originally a coupe, a 4-door sedan model was added in 1990. Convertibles were also produced from 1990 to 1995. In 1998, the Cutlass Supreme was replaced by the Oldsmobile Intrigue. Cutlass Calais (1985‚Äì1991) 1985-86 Cutlass Calais coupe The third Cutlass nameplate introduced was the compact Cutlass Calais (originally just Oldsmobile Calais) on the front-wheel-drive N-body in 1985. The famed 4-4-2 nameplate was revived for the Cutlass Calais in 1990 and 1991. The Cutlass Calais was replaced by the Oldsmobile Achieva in 1992. Sixth generation (midsize) 1997‚Äì1999 1997-1999 Oldsmobile Cutlass The Oldsmobile Cutlass name was revived for the 1997 model year as a slightly upscale version of the mechanically identical fifth generation Chevrolet Malibu. The Cutlass did have a few minor differences. Visually, it had a split grille front fascia like other Oldsmobiles at the time and all red rear tail lamps. Mechanically, the 3.1-liter V6 engine was the only engine offered. The Cutlass was available in GL and GLS trim. Available options on the base GL model included power windows, power driver's seat, power mirrors, CD player, and alloy wheels. The GLS included most of the GL's options as standard equipment plus added leather interior and was available with a power astroroof. This generation of Cutlass was intended as a placeholder model to fill the gap left by the discontinuation of the Ciera, before the all-new Alero arrived. Production of this generation of Cutlass ended July 2, 1999, making it the final vehicle to bear the Cutlass name.

Pedicures are done for cosmetic, therapeutic purposes. They are popular throughout the world, and especially among women. Pedicures include care not only for the toenails; dead skin cells are rubbed off the bottom of the feet using a rough stone (often a pumice stone). Skin care is often provided up to the knee, including granular exfoliation, moisturizing, and massage. The word pedicure is derived from the Latin words pedis, which means \\"of the foot\\", and cura, which means \\"care\\". History People have been pedicuring their nails for more than 4,000 years. In southern Babylonia, noblemen used solid gold tools to give themselves manicures and pedicures. The use of fingernail polish can be traced back even further. Originating in China in 3000 BC, nail color indicated one‚Äôs social status, according to a Ming Dynasty manuscript; royal fingernails were painted black and red. Ancient Egyptians have been manicuring all the way back to 2300 BC. A depiction of early manicures and pedicures was found on a carving from a pharaoh‚Äôs tomb, and the Egyptians were known for paying special attention to their feet and legs. The Egyptians also colored their nails, using red to show the highest social class. It is said that Cleopatra‚Äôs nails were painted a deep red, whereas Queen Nefertiti went with a flashier ruby shade. In ancient Egypt and Rome, military commanders also painted their nails to match their lips before they went off to battle. Pedicures in the United States Pedicures generally take approximately 45 minutes to an hour in the US. According to the US Department of Labor, manicure and pedicure specialists earned a median income of around $20,820 in 2015. Most professionals earn an hourly wage or salary which can be augmented through customer tips. Independent nail techs depend on repeat business and consistent business to earn their livings. The most successful independent manicure technicians may earn salaries of over $50,000 per year. Nail technicians can earn up to $100 per hour from performing more technical nail treatments, such as pink and whites and sculpting. Although these treatments are not particularly popular for the feet, they are, nonetheless, an available option should anyone wish to have such a treatment. A standard pedicure treatment usually costs around $40.

Some of the most common types are as follows (names and products may vary from spa to spa): *Regular pedicure: A simple treatment that includes foot soaking, foot scrubbing with a pumice stone or foot file, nail clipping, nail shaping, foot and calf massage, moisturizer and nail polishing. *Shanghai pedicure: involves soaking feet in hot water and using scalpel *Spa pedicure: Includes the regular pedicure and generally adds one of the following- Paraffin dip, masks, mud or seaweed treatment. *Dry or Waterless pedicure: A pedicure typically including nail shaping, cuticle cleanup, callus smoothing, moisturizer with massage, nail polish or buffing, but definitively without soaking the feet in water. Often the callus smoothing, nail shaping, and cuticle cleaning are all performed with an electric file. *Paraffin pedicure: A treatment that includes a regular pedicure but also includes the use of paraffin wax. The feet are covered with layers of paraffin wax to moisturize feet. *Stone pedicure: Basically a foot massage that involves the use of different essential oils that are rubbed with the help of hot stones for the massage of the feet and legs. *French pedicure: A regular pedicure that involves the use of white polish on the nail tips with a sheer pink color on the base. *Mini pedicure: This focuses mainly on the toes with a quick soak, nail shaping and polish, but does not include the massage or sole care. This is designed for an appointment between regular pedicures for generally well maintained feet. *Athletic pedicure: Similar to a regular pedicure for both the genders. It includes either a clear polish or toenail buffing. Usually, the aromatics used will be more cooling, such as peppermint, cucumber, or eucalyptus. *Chocolate pedicure: A pedicure which may include a chocolate foot soak, chocolate foot mask, or chocolate moisturizing lotion. *Ice Cream pedicure: A pedicure where a \\"bath ball\\", which looks like a scoop of ice cream, is chosen. The soak is followed with a foot scrub (usually vanilla, chocolate, or strawberry) and topped with a whipped moisturizing lotion. Red nail polish simulates the ice cream's \\"cherry\\". *Margarita pedicure: A regular pedicure which includes a salt scrub, soaking water with fresh limes, a lime-based massage oil, and moisturizer. *Champagne or Wine pedicure: This is a regular pedicure usually featuring a grape-seed scrub, grape mask peel, and finished off with a grape seed oil or moisturizing massage. Warnings *Most places use a pumice stone or a PedEgg-type device to shave off calluses. If calluses are shaved too aggressively and the skin is broken, this can become a portal for bacteria or fungus. This is especially problematic for diabetics, who need specialized foot care. *Solutions and chemicals used to cleanse or soak feet may cause skin irritation. *There can be a risk of developing an ingrown toenail from improper trimming. *Instruments may not be sterilized and can thus pass on fungal or bacterial cells. Fungi are easily transmittable from one person to another. These organisms can live for days on objects, especially if not properly cleaned.

Unlike many other US highways, it has not seen deletion or replacement on most of its length by an encroaching Interstate highway corridor, due to its mostly rural and mountainous course. Because of this, it still travels from border to border and is a primary north‚Äìsouth highway in both Nevada and Idaho. This is one of the few US Routes or Interstate highways to cross from Mexico to Canada. As of 2010, the highway's southern terminus is in San Luis, Arizona, on the Mexico‚ÄìUS border, where Calle 1, a short spur leads to Mexican Federal Highway 2 in San Luis R√≠o Colorado, Sonora. Its northern terminus is in Boundary County, Idaho, at the Canada‚ÄìUS border in Eastport, Idaho, where it continues north as British Columbia Highway 95.Endpoints of US highways: U.S. Highway 95 and U.S. Highway 630 Route description=Arizona US 95 begins in the United States at the border with Mexico at Mexico's Federal Route 2. It then follows the Colorado River northward to San Luis and on to Yuma, where it goes through town and crosses I-8. As it leaves Yuma, US 95 is an undivided two-lane highway which passes through the U.S. Army's Yuma Proving Ground. Sign for a US 95 junction along Interstate 10 It then travels northward between the proving ground to the west and the Kofa National Wildlife Refuge to the east until Quartzsite. Here it merges with I-10 and runs concurrent, heading westward for 17 miles (27 km) until the Colorado River, where it enters California, just shy of Blythe. In all, US 95 spends in Arizona. California U.S. 95 enters California at Blythe through a concurrency with Interstate 10. It travels largely parallel to the west bank of the Colorado River until it joins Interstate 40 in Needles. The route then travels north from Goffs to the Nevada state line. The total distance in California is about 130 miles. It is the only U.S. highway to enter California but not terminate there. Nevada US 95 in Nevada is a divided highway between Cal-Nev-Ari (the SR 163 junction to Laughlin) and Boulder City. It joins at the interchange as a multi-lane divided freeway past SR 173 and as part of the concurrent route of I-11 and US 93 in Boulder City. Upon entering the Las Vegas Valley, I-11 ends at I-215 and SR 564 and I-515 begins here in Henderson. It is also concurrent with I-515 and US 93 between Henderson and Downtown Las Vegas. It crosses I-15 at the Spaghetti Bowl, where I-515 ends here and US 93 continues north on I-15. The highway continues as a freeway for several miles until again becoming a divided highway at Corn Creek Road northwest of the Las Vegas Valley. Shortly after entering Nye County, US 95 becomes an undivided two-lane highway past the Mercury interchange, as it meanders northwestward through the state, roughly paralleling the California state line. Along this route it runs through the Amargosa Valley serving Beatty before heading north into Goldfield and Tonopah. The highway is concurrent with US 6 for several miles north of Tonopah before it then heads north towards Hawthorne, Schurz (where it meets US 95 ALT which heads northwest towards Yerington, Carson City (via US 50 west), Reno (via Ramsey Weeks Cutoff, US 50 east, SR 439 north and I-80 west) and Fernley) and Fallon. North of Fallon it meets and runs concurrently with I-80 for 93 miles (150 km), from Exit 83 west of Lovelock to Exit 176 at Winnemucca. It then heads north to the border with Oregon at McDermitt, a distance of 73 miles (117 km). Oregon In Oregon, US 95 is an undivided two-lane highway in the sparsely populated high desert in the southeastern corner of the state, running completely in rural Malheur County. From the Nevada state line at McDermitt, the highway heads north and gradually climbs to its crest at Blue Mountain Pass, at an elevation of 5293 feet (1613 m) above sea level. US 95 descends to Basque Station (webcam) and Burns Junction at 3960 feet (1207 m), then eastward down to Rome (3390 ft, 1033 m) and up to Jordan Valley (4389', 1338 m) (webcam). The highway heads north-northeastward to the Idaho state line, entering southwest of Marsing in Owyhee County. The speed limit on US 95 in Oregon was 55 miles per hour until March 2016, when it was raised to 70 miles per hour in order to match the speed limits set by Nevada and Idaho. Intersection of US 95 and Oregon Route 78 US 95 is designated the I.O.N. Highway No. 456 (see Oregon highways and routes), with the I.O.N. for Idaho‚ÄìOregon‚ÄìNevada. This section of highway is a primary commercial route between Boise and northern California, connecting to Interstate 80 at Winnemucca, Nevada. US 95 crosses into the Mountain Time Zone approximately 35 miles (56 km) north of Nevada. Idaho US 95 is an undivided two-lane highway during most of its length in Idaho, which is over 538 miles (866 km). US 95 enters Idaho from Oregon in Owyhee County, about southwest of Boise. It passes through Homedale and crosses the Snake River before a junction with concurrent US 20 and US 26, which run together for eight miles (13 km). As it proceeds north, US 95 crosses I-84 and US 30 before going through the Payette National Forest. Immediately after Riggins, the highway re-enters the Pacific Time Zone as it crosses the Salmon River. US 95 follows the descending river, then climbs over White Bird Hill to the Camas Prairie, then descends the Lapwai Canyon to the Clearwater River. In August 2015, milepost 420 was replaced with one reading 419.9, to prevent the sign being stolen by marijuana enthusiasts. US 95 becomes a four-lane divided highway after crossing the river east of Lewiston; it runs concurrent with US 12 for several miles. The highways split as US 12 continues west to Lewiston, and US 95 turns northwest and climbs a steep grade up to the rolling Palouse. At a junction with US 195, US 95 proceeds north to Moscow as a recently completed divided highway. It becomes an undivided highway in Moscow and continues north to Coeur d'Alene, crossing I-90. US 95 goes north to Sandpoint, where it joins with US 2, after which the highways run concurrent until after Bonners Ferry, where US 2 heads east to Montana and US 95 continues north to Canada, meeting BC 95 at the Canadian border. History U.S. Route 95 was one of the original U.S. highways proposed in the 1925 Bureau of Public Roads numbering plan. Under the original proposal, the highway would only exist in Idaho, from Payette to the Canada‚ÄìUS border north of Eastport. When the plan was adopted by the American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials in November 1926, the route of US 95 had been approved south to Weiser, still existing solely in Idaho. A proposal to extend US 95 south to Winnemucca, Nevada, was considered by AASHO in 1937; however, action was deferred due to sections in Oregon that were incomplete. AASHTO reconsidered the idea at its meeting on June 28, 1939, as part of a larger plan to extend the highway south to Blythe, California. This plan was adopted at that meeting and became effective on January 1, 1940. Washington (former) North of Lewiston, Idaho, US 95 entered Washington for 0.54 miles (0.87 km), partially concurrent with U.S. Route 195. The route was moved to a new 4-laned divided road that bypassed Washington in the 1970s.Washington State Department of Transportation, State Highway Log , 2006 The route is now U.S. Route 195 Spur. Idaho In April 2005, the Idaho legislature approved a bill to widen the entire highway from two lanes to four lanes for the entire route starting at the US-Canada port of entry in Eastport, and ending at the border with Oregon in remote Owyhee County. The contract for the project was awarded to Washington Group International and CH2M Hill. The contract is worth more than $1.2 billion, and is slated to last for more than six years, cover 13 major reconstruction projects, affecting over 250 miles (402 km) of the highway's nearly 460 miles (740 km) in the state. The major factors in the reconstruction are due to the fact that US 95 is the only route that runs from north to south in western Idaho, starting at Eastport in the north and ending in remote Owyhee County; as well as safety concerns because there have been numerous accidents and fatalities on the narrow and very dangerous curves. This change started with the reconstruction and improvements made to White Bird Hill. Major projects have been undertaken including on the Coeur d'Alene Indian Reservation. The first stage was completed in August 2005 from just south of Coeur d'Alene to Fighting Creek Road, and is an upgraded four-lane highway for approximately ten miles (16 km). The second stage, from Fighting Creek Road to Lake Creek on the Coeur d'Alene Indian Reservation, was completed in late July-early August 2006 and upgraded a seven-mile (11 km) stretch of the highway. The third stage, from Lake Creek to Worley, started mid-to-late 2006 and was completed in 2008. This section is significant, as it is on the Coeur d'Alene Indian Reservation. The \\"new\\" highway bypasses the Coeur d'Alene Casino, the largest business on the reservation, with the old highway becoming an alternate route that will connect the highway to the casino and the more remote regions of the reservation. This project improved a 20-mile (32 km) stretch of highway and shortened the length of the highway by about 20 miles (32 km). Also, a nearly 20-mile (32 km) stretch was completed in 2007 from just north of Lewiston to 6 miles (10 km) south of Moscow. Future=Nevada Future I-11 in Nevada US 95 is part of a proposed northwestward extension of Interstate 11 (I-11) from Las Vegas. The interstate highway would primarily follow the US 95 corridor through central and northwestern Nevada, extending to I-80 near Reno and Sparks via Tonopah. In 2018, the Nevada Department of Transportation had initiated public outreach regarding its long-range planning efforts to narrow down options for the future I-11 corridor.

Their assassination in Sarajevo sparked a series of events that eventually led to World War I.  Early life  Sophie was born in Stuttgart as the fourth daughter of Count Bohuslav Chotek von Chotkow und Wognin, a Bohemian aristocrat and Ambassador, and his wife Countess Wilhelmine Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettau.Montgomery-Massingberd, Hugh (editor).

As a young woman, Sophie became a lady-in-waiting to Archduchess Isabella, the wife of Archduke Friedrich, Duke of Teschen, head of the Bohemian cadet branch of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine.  Courtship with Franz Ferdinand  It is unknown where Sophie first met Archduke Franz Ferdinand, although it may have been at a ball in Prague in 1894. Franz Ferdinand, who was stationed at a military garrison in Prague, paid frequent visits to Halbturn Castle, the home of Archduke Friedrich, and it was assumed that he had fallen in love with Friedrich's eldest daughter, Archduchess Marie Christine. The liaison was discovered by Archduchess Isabella, herself only born into a mediatised family (the House of Cro√ø). When Isabella discovered Franz Ferdinand's locket lying on the tennis court, she opened it, expecting a photo of her daughter. Instead, the locket contained a photo of Sophie. From this, a scandal ensued. Franz Ferdinand had become heir presumptive to the throne, after the suicide of his cousin Crown Prince Rudolf in 1889 and the death of his father Karl Ludwig of typhoid in 1896. As such his uncle, the Emperor Franz Joseph, informed him that he could not marry Sophie, who could not become an empress consort. To be an eligible consort for any member of the Imperial House of Habsburg-Lorraine, one needed to belong to one of the reigning or formerly reigning dynasties of Europe. Although the Choteks were noble since at least the 14th century and had been made counts of the Holy Roman Empire in 1745, they were not of dynastic rank (although Sophie was a descendant of Habsburgs, from Elisabeth, sister of King Rudolph I of Germany, Franz Ferdinand's ancestor). Seal of Albert IV, Count of Habsburg, mutual ancestor of Sophie and Franz Ferdinand. Franz Ferdinand refused to renounce Sophie to marry equally and beget an heir to the throne, compounding the scandal surrounding the death and illicit affair of the emperor's previous heir.  Marriage with Franz Ferdinand  In 1899, under pressure from family members (especially the Archduchess Maria Theresa, the emperor's formidable sister-in-law and Franz Ferdinand's stepmother) the couple were granted permission to wed. Franz Ferdinand was allowed to retain his place in the order of succession and a suitable title was promised for his future wife. However, to prevent Franz Ferdinand from attempting to proclaim his wife empress-queen or declaring their future children dynasts and thus eligible to inherit the crown (especially that of Hungary, where morganatic marriages were unknown to law) once he ascended the throne, he was compelled to appear at the Hofburg Imperial Palace before the gathered archdukes, ministers, and dignitaries of the court, the Cardinal-Archbishop of Vienna and the Primate of Hungary on 28 June 1900 to execute by signature an official instrument in which he publicly declared that Sophie would be his morganatic wife, never to bear the titles of empress, queen or archduchess, and acknowledging that their descendants would neither inherit nor be granted dynastic rights or privileges in any of the Habsburg realms. Sophie and Franz Ferdinand were married on 1 July 1900 at Reichstadt (now Z√°kupy) in Bohemia. The Emperor did not attend the nuptials, nor did any of the archdukes, including Franz Ferdinand's brothers. The only members of the Imperial family who were present were Franz Ferdinand's stepmother, Archduchess Maria Theresa, and her two daughters. Upon her marriage, Sophie was given the title F√ºrstin von Hohenberg (\\"Princess of Hohenberg\\") with the style of Durchlaucht (\\"Serene Highness\\"). In 1909, she was elevated to Herzogin (Duchess) and accorded the higher style of Hoheit (\\"Highness\\"). Nonetheless, all of the archduchesses, mediatized princesses and countesses of Austria and Hungary took precedence before her. For the fourteen years of their marriage, Sophie never shared her husband's rank, title, or precedence. Her position at the Imperial court was humiliating, aggravated by the Imperial Obersthofmeister, Alfred, 2nd Prince of Montenuovo, whose insecurity about his own morganatic background is said to have prompted him to rigorously enforce court protocol at Sophie's expense. Problems of protocol prevented many royal courts from hosting the couple despite Franz Ferdinand's position as heir to the throne. Nonetheless, some did so, including King George V and Queen Mary of the United Kingdom, who warmly welcomed the couple to Windsor Castle from 17‚Äì21 November 1913. The couple had four children: * Princess Sophie of Hohenberg (1901‚Äì1990), married Count Friedrich von Nostitz- Rieneck (1891‚Äì1973) * Maximilian, Duke of Hohenberg (1902‚Äì1962), married Countess Elisabeth von Waldburg zu Wolfegg und Waldsee (1904‚Äì1993). Ironically his descendants married descendants of the Royal Houses of France and Portugal and Austria (Archduke Joseph Arpad). * Prince Ernst of Hohenberg (1904‚Äì1954), married Marie-Therese Wood (1910‚Äì1985) * stillborn son (1908)  Assassination  morganic (or morganatic) wife, the caption of the image in this report further asserting that \\"because she was not of royal blood, she was cordially detested by all Austrians\\". In 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand was invited by General Oskar Potiorek, Governor of the Austro-Hungarian province of Bosnia and Herzegovina, to watch troops on maneuvers for three days in Sarajevo, the provincial capital. Sophie was not usually allowed to accompany her husband on ceremonial visits because of her lower status, but on this occasion, Franz Ferdinand was invited as a military commander rather than a royal personage. The archduke therefore arranged for Sophie to join him on 28 June, the third and final day, for a troop review followed by a visit to the city to dedicate a new museum before returning to Vienna. The date coincided with the 14th anniversary of their Oath of Renunciation and was a rare opportunity to celebrate in public together, although he knew that the visit would be dangerous. At 10:10 am of Sunday, 28 June 1914, when the procession passed the Sarajevo central police station, Nedeljko ƒåabrinoviƒá hurled a hand grenade at the archduke's car. The driver accelerated when he saw the object flying towards the car and the grenade exploded under the wheel of the next car. Two of the occupants, Eric von Merizzi and Count Boos-Waldeck, were seriously wounded. Fourteen spectators were hit by bomb splinters. After attending the official reception at the City Hall, Franz Ferdinand asked about the members of his party that had been wounded by the bomb. When the archduke was told they were badly injured in hospital, he insisted on being taken to see them. A member of the archduke's staff, Andreas, Freiherr von Morsey, suggested this might be dangerous, but Oskar Potiorek, who was responsible for the safety of the Imperial party, replied, \\"Do you think Sarajevo is full of assassins?\\" However, Potiorek did accept it would be better if Sophie remained behind in the city hall. When Freiherr Morsey told Sophie about the revised plans, she refused to stay, arguing: \\"As long as the Archduke shows himself in public today I will not leave him.\\" In order to avoid the city centre, General Oskar Potiorek decided that the Imperial car should travel straight along the Appel Quay to the Sarajevo Hospital. However, Potiorek forgot to tell the driver, Leopold Loyka, about this decision. On the way to the hospital, by the Latin Bridge, the driver took a right turn into Franz Joseph Street. One of the conspirators, Gavrilo Princip, was standing on the corner at the time. Oskar Potiorek immediately realized the driver had taken the wrong route and shouted \\"What is this? This is the wrong way! We're supposed to take the Appel Quay!\\" The driver put his foot on the brake, and began to back up. In doing so he moved slowly past the waiting Gavrilo Princip. The assassin stepped forward, drew his pistol, and at a distance of about five feet, fired twice into the car. Franz Ferdinand was hit in the neck and Sophie in the abdomen. Sophie said to her husband, \\"For God's sake, what has happened to you?!\\" then she fell bleeding. Before losing consciousness he pleaded, \\"Sopherl! Sopherl! Don't die! Stay alive for our children!\\", using his pet name for the duchess. They were both dead within an hour.  Funeral and burial  The bodies were transported to Trieste by the battleship and then to Vienna by special train for a joint funeral mass in a short ceremony at the Hofburg Palace attended by the immediate imperial family. The Archduke and Duchess were then taken to be entombed side by side as he had requested in the crypt of Artstetten Castle, the Habsburgs' summer home, because burial in the Imperial Crypt was forbidden to Sophie. Today the castle houses a museum in their memory. Photo montage (2012) showing Artstetten Castle, its Chapel, and the final resting place of the couple, showing each resting at equal heights.

They were critically acclaimed and have achieved a cult status. Their style was described as being \\"folktronica\\", a blend of folk, Scottish, electronic, rock, trip hop, and experimental jamming. The Beta Band disbanded in 2004. During the course of their career, they were hailed by both Radiohead and Oasis. History=Formation The Beta Band formed in 1996 around St Andrews musicians Steve Mason (vocals, guitar) and Gordon Anderson. The two had plans to call their group The Pigeons but later changed their minds. As they pulled together songs for their debut EP, Champion Versions, they added Robin Jones (drums), John Maclean (DJ, sampler, keyboards), and Steve Duffield (bass). While living in a flat in Shepherd's Bush they met Phil Brown, who after hearing their demo took it to Miles Leonard, who promptly signed the band. Duffield quit the band soon after recording Champion Versions. Not long after they were signed to Regal/Parlophone, Anderson became ill and quit the band. He later produced recordings under the name Lone Pigeon. The remaining members added Englishman Richard Greentree to play bass and solidified their lineup. The Three E.P.'s Champion Versions was released in July 1997 to critical acclaim not only for the music but also for the record's innovative cut-and- paste sleeve design (the work of John Maclean). The trumpet solos recorded for \\"Dry the Rain\\" on Champion Versions were played by Jonathan Levien, credited as Jon Levien on the record. Jonathan was attending the Royal College of Art in 1997 where he met John Maclean in the Art Bar and mentioned that he could make some interesting whale sounds on his trumpet. Jonathan Levien was invited to the Chalk farm recording studio shortly afterwards where he was asked to play three riffs on his trumpet for Dry the Rain. Two further EPs followed in 1998 produced by Chris Allison and the band: The Patty Patty Sound in March and Los Amigos del Beta Bandidos in July. All three EPs received widespread critical praise, and all three appeared on the appropriately titled The Three E.P.'s collection in September 1998. The compilation was rated by Pitchfork in the Top 10 Albums of the year. The song \\"Dr Baker\\" featured on the acclaimed soundtrack of the first series of Trigger Happy TV. The Beta Band The band soon commenced work on their first full-length recording. The record, titled The Beta Band, was released in June 1999. The first track, \\"The Beta Band Rap\\", managed to tell the band's back story over alternating bubblegum pop, rap and rockabilly backing tracks. The album was more stylistically diverse than the initial EPs. The mixed press turned decidedly negative when the band announced their own disdain for the record. They claimed that Regal's unreasonable deadline and tight budgets kept them from refining their improvisations into coherent songs. Also in June that year the band made a four-stop tour in the United States.\\"Live Reviews: The Beta Band June 18, 1999 Aro Space, Seattle, Washington\\". Chart Attack, June 1999. The band returned to the studio to record the double A-side single \\"To You Alone\\"/\\"Sequinsizer\\", recorded by future The Go! Team producer, Gareth Parton. It was released on 24 January 2000. The single was received favourably and was regarded as a return to form for the band. The NME made it their \\"Single of the Week\\", and would later select it as one of the 50 greatest singles of 2000 in their end-of-year awards. \\"To You Alone\\" was also included on the soundtrack of the 2000 remake of the television series Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased), released in March. The band's music was featured in a scene in the film High Fidelity (based on the Nick Hornby novel of the same name), released in late March 2000 in the United States and July in the UK. In the film, a record store owner played by John Cusack mentions the band by name (\\"I will now sell five copies of The Three E.P.'s by The Beta Band\\") and plays a minute or so of the song \\"Dry the Rain\\". This exposed the band to a wide range of new listeners, particularly in the U.S. Hot Shots II A hiatus followed, during which Mason released his second King Biscuit Time EP. The band gradually gravitated back into the studio, this time recruiting UK producer Colin Emmanuel, aka C-Swing, to oversee the process. The album, Hot Shots II, appeared in mid-2001, and was warmly received by critics and fans.\\"CD Reviews: The Beta Band, Default, Toploader and many more\\". Chart Attack, July 17, 2001 It sacrificed much of the first album's experimentation for more boiled-down pop structure and hooks. The band had originally intended to release \\"Squares\\" (b/w \\"Won\\"), which featured a sample from the G√ºnter Kallmann Choir's 1970 version of Wallace Collection's \\"Daydream\\", as the lead single. A video had been filmed and promo discs issued, but because another single (\\"Daydream in Blue\\" by I Monster) featuring a sample from the same G√ºnter Kallmann Choir recording was to be released at around the same time, the band opted to release \\"Broke\\" instead. Two other singles were released from the album: \\"Human Being\\" in October 2001 and \\"Squares\\" in February 2002 (with the I Monster track long out of the charts). The band embarked on a long tour to support the album, at one point supporting Radiohead. In August 2002, they made No. 3 on Q magazine's list of \\"50 Bands to See Before You Die\\". Heroes to Zeros and split The band began demo sessions for their third album in September 2002. They entered the studio with producer Tom Rothrock in 2003 and completed a number of tracks; however, neither the band nor the Regal executives were pleased with the results. Producer Nigel Godrich was called in to mix the album, which was finally completed in early 2004. Lead single, \\"Assessment\\", was released on 12 April 2004, followed by the album Heroes to Zeros on 26 April. One of the tracks, \\"Liquid Bird\\" is based on a sample of \\"Painted Bird\\" by Siouxsie and the Banshees. A second single, \\"Out-Side\\", followed in July. The band announced their breakup on their website on 2 August 2004, citing financial discourse with their label, who they owed a ¬£1.2 million debt to. In November, they performed at the Summer Sundae festival and set out on a farewell tour. Their final show was at Edinburgh's Liquid Rooms venue on 5 December 2004. On 3 October 2005, the band released a 2-disc DVD set, The Best of The Beta Band - Film, featuring most of the band's videos and a selection of short films, television footage, documentaries as well as four songs recorded live at the Shepherds Bush Empire on 29 November 2004, one of the band's final performances. Also released on the same day was a two CD set, The Best of The Beta Band - Music, comprising a compilation disc of studio recordings and a disc containing the Shepherds Bush gig. Since the split, Steve Mason has released music with his solo project King Biscuit Time, as well as new projects Black Affair and Good Face. In May 2010, he released the first record in his own name entitled \\"Boys Outside\\". Robin Jones and John Maclean have become The Aliens along with former Beta Band member Gordon Anderson (a.k.a. Lone Pigeon) and Richard Greentree is working with his new band The General and Duchess Collins.

Based in New York City, he is best known for his eponymous fashion lines. Mizrahi currently serves as a judge on Project Runway: All Stars. Early life Mizrahi was born in Brooklyn, the son of Sarah, a homemaker, and Zeke Mizrahi, who worked in the clothing business. He is from an observant Sephardic Jewish family from Syria. He grew up as the youngest boy of his family in Midwood. His father gave him a sewing machine at the age of ten. At 15, he launched his own label, IS New York, with the help of a family friend. He attended Yeshivah of Flatbush, High School of Performing Arts, and the Parsons School of Design. Fashion career Mizrahi presented his first collection in 1987 at a trunk show held by New York department store Bergdorf Goodman. The line immediately earned praise from fashion editors, prompting several top retailers to place orders. In 1989, he discussed his designs in an interview with Elizabeth Cannon. He described them as \\"controlled and glamorous\\", \\"elegant\\", \\"distilled, refined\\", inspired by decadence, and by the diversity of New York City. He also expressed his interest in appealing to a refined and exclusive clientele.Cannon, Elizabeth http://bombsite.com/issues/29/articles/1259, \\"BOMB Magazine\\" Fall 1989. Retrieved on July 19, 2011. In 1992, the French fashion house Chanel bought a stake in the company and began to bankroll its operations. Despite continued critical acclaim, sales were inconsistent; Bloomingdale's executive Kal Ruttenstein stated that Mizrahi had \\"good years and bad years.\\" This volatility is mainly attributed to the designer's failure to establish a defined aesthetic or \\"Mizrahi look\\", as the frenetic designer was famed for changing gears each season. Though the company grossed $10‚Äì20 million a year, it never made a profit, and lost substantial amounts in its final four years of operation. Chanel eventually tired of the mounting losses and pulled financing in October 1998, forcing the closure of the company after the Fall 1998 collection. Among Mizrahi's fans and clients were Hollywood stars Nicole Kidman, Selma Blair, Julia Roberts, Sarah Jessica Parker, Debra Messing and Natalie Portman. From 1995 to 1997, Mizrahi also designed a diffusion line, named \\"IS**C\\" in an act of \\"name effacement\\" intended to prevent dilution of the designer's full name. This lower-priced line (in the $275 to $850 range) was meant to diversify the label from the very expensive Isaac Mizrahi collection, but it failed to gain traction and was shuttered in 1997. Mizrahi returned to fashion in 2002 when he began designing another diffusion collection, Isaac Mizrahi for Target. The line was an enormous hit, and soon spread to cover accessories, bedding, housewares, and pet products. Sales volume tripled over five years to over $300 million and introduced the designer to mainstream America. The line was discontinued in 2008 as Mizrahi left for Liz Claiborne. Mizrahi designed for Claiborne for only one year, 2009. Although advertising campaigns for his Claiborne work‚Äîfeaturing Mizrahi and women of all sizes, races, and ages‚Äîwere found in major fashion magazines, the line was a disaster almost from launch. The clothes and accessories were very difficult to find, as only a few minor department stores, which were not found in major cities, carried Claiborne clothes. Gottschalks carried only a few pieces before declaring bankruptcy and liquidating, only weeks after Mizrahi's launch. Furthermore, the few Liz Claiborne outlets that existed were also far from major cities and were found at outlet malls that were too remote for most customers to visit. As a result, in December 2009, the Liz Claiborne website was closed and rumors abounded that the company was bankrupt and in serious debt. As of fall 2010, Liz Claiborne clothes were sold at J.C. Penney and were not designed by Mizrahi. In 2010, Mizrahi launched a label called IsaacMizrahiLIVE! exclusively on QVC. In 2011, Mizrahi sold his brand to Xcel Brands, Inc. In addition to continuing the IsaacMizrahiLIVE! business on QVC, Xcel Brands launched various categories under the Isaac Mizrahi New York, Isaac Mizrahi Jeans, and Isaac Mizrahi brands. As of August 2012, footwear and denim have launched in Bloomingdale's and Nordstrom, and Mizrahi's first-ever fragrance, Fabulous, was set to debut September 6 on QVC, and in Bloomingdale's in October. Mizrahi remained a shareholder, creative director, and media personality for his namesake brand under Xcel. Media Mizrahi has made appearances in numerous television shows and movies since the 1990s. In 1995, a movie was released about the development of his Fall 1994 collection called Unzipped. In Fall 2005, the Isaac show debuted on Style Network. He previously had a show on the Oxygen network. Mizrahi appears on many of E!'s programs and has become well known for being flamboyant. He also appeared as himself in the episode \\"Plus One is the Loneliest Number\\" of the fifth season of Sex and the City, and in an episode of Spin City. He guest starred on the American dramedy series Ugly Betty, in which he played a reporter for the cable channel Fashion TV in the episode \\"Lose the Boss\\". He appeared as himself in The Apprentice season 1 (episode 6) as one of the celebrities supporting an auction for the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation. He also appeared on the public radio game show Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me in 2006, saying, \\"Fat is the new black\\". He also appeared in a Season 4 episode of Gossip Girl. Mizrahi has stated that he sees himself as an entertainer who can sing and act. On his Oxygen show, he sang jazz in a nightclub. He has also acted in films, appearing in Woody Allen's Small Time Crooks, Hollywood Ending and Celebrity. Mizrahi was a contestant in the Jeopardy! Million Dollar Celebrity Invitational. While initially finishing second in a quarter-final game to Jane Curtin, as the highest scoring non-qualifier, he replaced semi- finalist Andy Richter, who had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts. He eventually lost to Michael McKean. In 2006, Mizrahi designed pro bono the Smithsonian American Art Museum and the National Portrait Gallery's conservators' denim work aprons. In 2009, Mizrahi began co-hosting the first season of The Fashion Show on Bravo TV with singer Kelly Rowland. Bravo launched the series to replace its former hit Project Runway, which then moved to the Lifetime network. Mizrahi returned as co-host in November 2010 for the show's second season, opposite a close friend and colleague, supermodel Iman, who previously hosted the Canadian version of Project Runway. A representative of the network indicated that Bravo believed Mizrahi's exciting presenting style would work well with newcomer Iman and the credibility that she brought as a genuine pioneer in the fashion world. In 2012, Mizrahi participated in the debut season of Project Runway: All Stars as a head judge, alongside Marchesa designer Georgina Chapman, which aired on the Lifetime TV Network. In February 2012, Mizrahi served as red carpet correspondent for Live with Kelly during the 84th Annual Academy Awards. The segment included interviews with Brad Pitt, Emma Stone, Rooney Mara, and Gwyneth Paltrow. It aired the morning after the Oscars, during a special episode of Live with Kelly.

It is part of the University of South Carolina System and enrolls about 1,900 students. The main campus is in Bluffton, offering over 20 programs of study. The institution's campus in Beaufort houses the school's honor programs and the Department of Visual Arts & Design. The campus in Hilton Head Island is home to the school's program for hospitality management. History In 1795, a preparatory school and college in Beaufort was chartered as the Beaufort College to serve the families of local residents. Classes began in 1802, and the college reached a prominent status in the community during the antebellum period. The college was forced to close in 1861 at the beginning of the Civil War and the Beaufort College building, constructed in 1852, was occupied by the Union forces for use as a hospital. The college building was used by the Freedmen's Bureau during Reconstruction, and it was an elementary school from 1909 to 1959. In the 1950s, two factors brought about the return of higher education to the Beaufort region. The University of South Carolina sought to expand its reach throughout the state by the establishment of extension campuses and the Beaufort County Higher Education Commission was formed by citizens of Beaufort to bring a campus to the area. A branch campus of the University of South Carolina was established in 1959 at the site of the old Beaufort College, but the official opening was delayed by Hurricane Gracie. The campus experienced steady growth through the years, and it expanded south along Carteret Street. In 2002, the campus was upgraded from a regional campus to a senior campus offering bachelor's degrees. USCB opened a second, campus with housing in Bluffton. In 2004, it also began offering programs for the United States Marine Corps on Parris Island. In 2018, the institution opened its third campus, located on Hilton Head Island, to house the program for hospitality management. Academics USCB is one of the three senior campuses in the University of South Carolina system and is a Southern Association of Colleges and Schools accredited four- year university. It offers the bachelor's degree in human services online through Palmetto College. USCB offers the region's only human services degree as well as more traditional degrees like English, psychology, business, and education. The school opened a nursing facility in Spring 2009. Human simulators provide nursing students hands-on training opportunities. Another popular program capitalizing on nearby Hilton Head Island resorts is the hospitality management program, which draws international students and provides internships. The biology program allows students to explore and study first-hand the continental-shelf and estuarine environment with a concentration in coastal ecology and conservation. Student activities=Student organizations The University of South Carolina Beaufort has numerous student organizations. The largest organization on campus is the Student Government Association. It consists of twelve student senators and an executive board. Gamma Beta Phi A first-class organization which was incorporated on March 22, 1964. The society is a non-secret, non-profit, scholastic, honor, education-service organization that recognizes and encourages excellence in education, promotes the development of leadership ability and character in its members, and fosters, disseminates, and improves education by appropriate service projects. Athletics  The South Carolina‚ÄìBeaufort Sand Sharks (USCB), are part of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) Division I level, primarily competing in the Sun Conference, formerly known as the Florida Sun Conference (FSC). Men's sports include baseball, cross country, golf and track & field, while women's sports include cross country, golf, soccer, softball and track & field. Both the Sand Shark baseball and softball teams practice and play home games at the City of Hardeeville's Recreation Complex (The Richard Gray Baseball Complex). Housing=Palmetto Village Palmetto Village is located on USCB's Hilton Head Gateway Campus in Bluffton. There are 10 dorms on campus, named Beaufort, Colleton, Hampton, Jasper, Chechesse, May River, Okatee River, Port Royal, Combahee River, and Broad River.

There are over 10,000 rose bushes of approximately 650 varieties. The roses bloom from April through October with the peak coming in June, depending on the weather. New rose cultivars are continually sent to the garden from many parts of the world and are evaluated on several characteristics, including disease resistance, bloom formation, color, and fragrance. It is the oldest continuously operating public rose test garden in the United States and exemplifies Portland's nickname, \\"City of Roses\\". The garden draws an estimated 700,000 visitors annually. History In 1915 Jesse A. Currey, president of Portland's Rose Society and Sunday editor of the Oregon Journal, convinced city officials to institute a rose test garden to serve as a safe haven during World War I for hybrid roses grown in Europe. Rose lovers feared that these unique plants would be destroyed in the bombings. The Park Bureau approved the idea in 1917 and by early 1918, hybridists from England began to send roses. A decade before the test garden was proposed, of Portland's streets had been lined with rose bushes for the 1905 Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition. Portland was already dubbed \\"The City of Roses\\" and the test garden was a way to solidify the city‚Äôs reputation as a rose-growing center internationally. In early 1918, the garden began receiving plants from growers in England and Ireland, as well as Los Angeles, Washington and the Eastern United States. In 1921 Florence Holmes Gerke, the landscape architect for the city of Portland, was charged with designing the International Rose Test Garden and the amphitheatre. The garden was dedicated in June 1924. Currey was appointed as the garden's first rose curator and served in that capacity until his death in 1927. Since 1940, the rose garden has been one of the official testing gardens for what is now called the All- America Rose Selections. Originally, the garden occupied about a block, sandwiched between a playground and an elk corral. A parking lot replaced the original rose garden when the garden moved to its current location in 1928. The garden later expanded in the 1950s when Washington Park's zoo moved to its current location. The award called Portland‚Äôs Best Rose was established in 1996. Rose experts from around the world attend a one-day judging in June and select the best rose that day from thousands of submissions. Portland remains the only North American city to issue such an award. By 2013, the garden's collection had expanded to over 10,000 rose bushes of over 650 varieties. Features International Rose Test Garden (2013) The International Rose Test Garden covers in several tiers facing downtown Portland, the Willamette River, and East Portland. On clear days, there are views of the Cascade Range, with Mount Hood featured prominently. The roses and other plantings are tended by three paid staffers and dozens of volunteers. The garden is one of eleven American Garden Rose Selections test sites in the United States. Rose breeders and distributors from across the world typically donate about 2,500 roses per year to the garden. Sometimes the garden gets roses a year or two before they're introduced to the market, but most of the roses in the garden are commercially available. The garden features an inventory that shows the names and locations for all of the roses. The Queens Walk is a brick walkway at the base of the garden with bronze plaques featuring each Queen's hand written name and year, honoring each Rose Festival queen since 1907. The plaques originally were installed in Lambert Gardens near Reed College, but were moved to the International Rose Test Garden in the early 1950s. Gardens One of several gardens within the International Rose Test Garden The American Garden Rose Selection (AGRS) test garden covers two terraces of the Rose Garden. The roses testing in the garden are identified by number rather than by name; the plants are evaluated for two years by multiple criteria before being judged. The Gold Award Garden, dedicated in 1970, features award-winning roses from the AGRS Test Garden. The garden features a gazebo added in 1991, and a wall honoring past presidents of the Portland Rose Society. It is a popular site for weddings. The Royal Rosarian Garden displays roses honoring past Prime Ministers of the Royal Rosarians, a civic group which serves as the official greeters and goodwill ambassadors for the City of Portland who serve in the many Rose Festival events, and features a stone bench honoring Jesse Currey. The Royal Rosarian Garden contains many roses that are no longer commercially available. Established in 1975, the Miniature Rose Garden is a test ground to help determine what miniature roses will go to market. The Miniature Rose Garden is one of only eight such miniature rose testing grounds for the American Rose Society. The national annual American Rose Society winners are displayed in the middle of the garden along the center aisle. The Shakespeare Garden was donated by the Shakespeare Society in 1943. It originally featured botanicals mentioned in the works of William Shakespeare. Over time, the Shakespeare Garden has evolved, planted with summer annuals, tropical plants, year-round shrubs, and roses. The rose varieties are named after characters in Shakespeare's plays. The Shakespeare Garden includes a formal walkway and a raised sitting area. Amenities The Rose Garden Store opened May 1, 2000. The store sells rose-themed books, merchandise, and garden supplies. The garden includes an amphitheater designed with the original garden. It hosts many events throughout the year, predominantly classical music concerts and a few plays. During good weather, the amphitheater is popular for picnicking and flying disc games. Public art * Frank E. Beach Memorial Fountain (officially titled Water Sculpture), an abstract stainless steel sculpture and fountain located ialong the main promenade, was designed and built by Oregon artist Lee Kelly and dedicated in 1975. The fountain honors Frank Edwin Beach (1853-1934), the man who is said to have christened Portland the \\"City of Roses\\" and who first proposed the annual Rose Festival. * Royal Rosarian is a bronze statue located near the promenade that depicts a Royal Rosarian tipping his hat. It was created by American artist Bill Bane and dedicated in 2011.

It was absorbed within the city boundaries in 1991. It is commonly called Old Marston to distinguish it from the suburb of New Marston that developed between St. Clement's and the village in the 19th and 20th centuries. The A40 Northern Bypass, part of the Oxford Ring Road forms a long north-west boundary of the village and parish and a limb, namely a distributary, of the Cherwell forms the western boundary. History The toponym is said to come from \\"Marsh-town\\", because of the low-lying nature of the land, still green space, near the River Cherwell, which in earlier times was liable to frequent flooding. The parish used to be part of the manor of Headington. The Church of England parish church of St Nicholas began as a chapel, first mentioned in a charter of 1122 by which it was granted to the Augustinian canons of St Frideswide's Priory. The building dates from the 12th century, and has substantial additions in the 15th century. The village played an important part in the Civil War, during the siege of Oxford. While the Royalist forces were besieged in the city, which had been used by King Charles I as his capital, the Parliamentary forces under Sir Thomas Fairfax had quarters in Marston, and used the church tower as a lookout post for viewing the enemy's artillery positions in what is now the University Parks. Oliver Cromwell visited Fairfax at Manor House, which is now known as \\"Cromwell House\\" at 17 Mill Lane, and \\"Manor House\\" at 15 Mill Lane, and the Treaty for the Surrender of Oxford was signed there in 1646. In the 20th-century expansion of Oxford, new housing followed the Marston Road from St Clement's towards Marston, which was soon absorbed by the city. New Marston became a separate parish in the 1950s. Old Marston parish become part of the City of Oxford in 1991. It retains its (civil) parish council. Marston has had a number of notable residents, including members of the Oxford penicillin team: Howard Florey and his second wife Margaret Jennings, and Norman Heatley. The village has been associated with the origin of the Jack Russell breed of terrier. Amenities St Nicholas' church hall, formerly the parish school. A cycle route links Marston with central Oxford via the meadows west of New Marston, over a bridge on the River Cherwell, past the southern boundary of The Parks to the junction of South Parks Road and St Cross Road near the Science Area of Oxford University.

The highway's northern terminus is in Noyes, Minnesota, at the Canadian border, where it once continued as Manitoba Highway 75 on the other side of the now-closed border crossing. Its southern terminus is at Interstate 30 (I-30) and I-45 in Dallas, where it is known as North Central Expressway. US 75 was a cross-country route, from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico at Galveston, Texas. However, the entire segment south of Dallas has been decommissioned in favor of I-45, a cutoff section of town-to-town surface road having become Texas State Highway 75. Route description=Texas The first freeway in Texas was a several-mile stretch of US 75 (now I-45)‚ÄîThe Gulf Freeway‚Äîopened to Houston traffic on October 1, 1948. The stretch of US 75 between I-30 and the Oklahoma state line has exits numbered consecutively from 1 to 75 (with occasional A and B designations), excluding 9-19. All other Texas freeways that have exit numbers are coordinated with mile markers. From Denison north to the Oklahoma border, US 75 runs concurrently with US 69\\\\. Oklahoma US 75 remains concurrent to US 69 from the Texas border north to Atoka. While US 69 continues to the northeast as a multilane highway, US 75 turns north to serve several small communities between Atoka and Henryetta. Through travellers bypass this segment of US 75 via US 69 and the Indian Nation Turnpike, where the speed limit is . From Henryetta through Tulsa and on through Bartlesville to the Kansas State Line, US 75 is once again a multilane highway. In the early 1990s, some portions of US 75 in Oklahoma were slated to become part of the Interstate Highway System. The 1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) states that \\"upon the request of the Oklahoma State highway agency, the Secretary shall designate the portion of United States Route 69 from the Oklahoma‚ÄìTexas State line to Checotah in the State of Oklahoma as a part of the Interstate System.\\" This would have created an Interstate route from I-40 south to the Texas line, including the portion of US 75 co-signed with US 69 south of Atoka. The legislation was unclear whether the route would enter Texas to connect with or become an extension of I-45. A current plan is to construct a new segment of the Oklahoma Turnpike along the US 69 corridor to bring it to corridor standards. Kansas A major north‚Äìsouth artery in Kansas, US 75 enters the state at Caney. It passes through Independence and crosses I-35 south of Olivet at the BETO Junction. From I-35 to Melvern Lake, US 75 is a Super-2 highway, with controlled access interchanges at Township Road, K-278, and K-31 southbound. From Melvern Lake to just north of Lyndon, US 75 and K-31 share a long concurrency. At US 56 near Scranton US 75 becomes a freeway. There is no direct access to the Kansas Turnpike from US 75, but the highway joins with I-470 less than from I-470's interchange with the turnpike. US 75 and I-470 run together along the west side of Topeka to I-70. US 75 turns east along I-70 for about before exiting northbound as a freeway. This freeway segment runs to Elmont, then becomes an expressway to Holton. The remainder of US 75 in Kansas is two lanes. The highway exits the state north of Sabetha. There was a US 75 Alternate in Topeka. It was on Topeka Boulevard and was the route US 75 originally took through the city. Nebraska I-480 sign in Omaha US 75 enters Nebraska south of Dawson. From Nebraska City northward, it closely parallels the Missouri River. A brief section which serves as a bypass for Nebraska City is an expressway called the J. Sterling Morton Beltway. Nebraska City itself is served with Business Route US 75\\\\. US 75 and US 34 overlap from Union to Plattsmouth. North of Plattsmouth, US 75 becomes the Kennedy Freeway, serving as an arterial highway through Bellevue and the South Omaha neighborhood of Omaha. It follows I-480 briefly through central Omaha before branching off as the North Omaha Freeway. From I-680 northward to Nashville ( south of Fort Calhoun) US 75 is an expressway. North of Nashville it becomes a two-lane road again. It is briefly concurrent with US 30 in Blair. It joins with US 77 at Winnebago. The two highways run together until their junction with I-129 and US 20 at South Sioux City. US 75 follows I-129 and US 20 towards the Missouri River and Iowa. Iowa US 75 is a major north-south artery in the northwestern corner of Iowa. It enters the state by a Missouri River crossing at Sioux City concurrent with I-129 and US 20\\\\. US 75 and US 20 run together on a freeway bypass around the southeast side of Sioux City before US 20 turns east at Gordon Drive. US 75 continues as a freeway to the Woodbury‚ÄìPlymouth county line, where it becomes an expressway. This expressway becomes a freeway bypass of Le Mars. North of Le Mars, US 75 exits off the freeway bypass, which continues on as Iowa Highway 60, and turns north. US 75 continues as a two-lane, undivided highway passing through Sioux Center and Rock Rapids before leaving the state north of Iowa Highway 9. The segment from the Missouri River to LeMars is part of a larger expressway project which will eventually provide a direct connection between Sioux City and the Twin Cities region in Minnesota. Minnesota In Minnesota, US 75 stays very close to the state's western border. It passes through few large towns. US 75 enters Minnesota south of Luverne near Ash Creek and Steen, and passes through Pipestone, Canby, and Breckenridge. It is the main north‚Äìsouth route through Moorhead. North of Moorhead, the route turns northeast to pass through Crookston (east of Grand Forks, North Dakota), then turns northwest towards the Red River of the North. US 75 does not cross the Red River, ending instead at the Canadian border at the unincorporated community of Noyes. It is not possible to cross the border at Noyes as the Noyes‚ÄìEmerson East Border Crossing closed in July 2006. Border traffic is instead directed to the nearby crossing in Pembina, North Dakota, (via MN 171, ND 59 and I-29). Manitoba Highway 75 previously continued on the other side of the Noyes border crossing, but has since been rerouted to the Pembina crossing. All of US 75 in Minnesota is officially designated the Historic King of Trails, sponsored by the towns along the route. The King of Trails was in fact the historic Auto Trail name for this road before the trunk highway system was commissioned in 1920. Legally, the Minnesota section of US 75 is defined as Routes 6 and 175 in Minnesota Statutes ¬ß¬ß 161.114(2) and 161.115(106). History=Texas In the initial assignment of state highways in 1917, Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston were connected by a branch of SH 2 (SH 2, the Meridian Highway), which ran via Waco and Bryan and continued on to Galveston. The more direct route followed by US 75 was not initially part of the system between Richland (connected to Dallas by SH 14) and Huntsville (connected to Houston by SH 19). This Richland‚ÄìHuntsville cutoff was added by 1919 as State Highway 32, and US 75 was assigned to the alignment, as well as SH 6 north of Dallas, in 1926. The branch of SH 2, which US 75 followed between Houston and Galveston, eventually became part of SH 6, and these numbers were dropped in the 1939 renumbering. Prior to the coming of the Interstate Highway System in the late 1950s, the only improvements to US 75 in Texas beyond building a two-lane paved roadway were in the Houston and Dallas areas. However, the highways in and near these cities included some of the first freeways in the state: the Gulf Freeway (Houston) and the Central Expressway (Dallas). When Interstate 45 was built in the 1960s, its alignment bypassed many of the towns and built-up areas between downtown Dallas and Houston. The bypassed routes retained the US 75 designation until the designation was truncated to downtown Dallas in 1987. Many of the original alignments continue to exist under other designations. In Dallas, the route followed what is now the Good Latimer Expressway (formerly Spur 559) southeast, out of downtown, along US 175 and south along SH 310. Near Ferris, Trumbull, Palmer, Ennis, and Corsicana In-45 veers east to avoid the more populated areas. The old US 75 alignments through these towns, decommissioned in 1987, now carry the following designations: *Interstate 45 Business (originally Loop 560) through Ferris *Loop 561 through Trumbull *Interstate 45 Business through Palmer (originally Loop 562) *Spur 469, Interstate 45 Business (originally U.S. Highway 287 and Spur 563) through Ennis *Interstate 45 Business (originally Loop 564) through Corsicana Through Streetman, Fairfield, Buffalo, Centerville, Madisonville, Huntsville, New Waverly, Willis, and Conroe, US 75 followed what is now SH 75. In Galveston, the alignment of SH 87 from 20th Street to the southern terminus of I-45 was also part of US 75 until its 1987 truncation. In other cases alignments were bypassed while US 75 remained in existence; they now carry the following designations: *SH 3 through La Marque, Dickinson, League City, South Houston and Houston, bypassed 1952 *SH 5 from north of Dallas via Plano, McKinney, Anna and Van Alstyne to Howe, bypassed 1959-1967 *SH 91 from Sherman to Denison, bypassed 1984 *Spur 503 and U.S. Highway 69 around downtown Denison to near Oklahoma **SH 91 through downtown Denison, bypassed 1957 Oklahoma The main line of US 75 between Okmulgee and Tulsa, known locally as the \\"Okmulgee Beeline\\", is a modern four-lane highway. The prior route continues to exist, beginning with North Oklahoma Avenue in Okmulgee and becoming Old Highway 75 to the town of Beggs, Oklahoma. The part of the original route from Beggs north to the city of Sapulpa, Oklahoma was re- designated, together with a connecting segment along SH 16 between new US 75 and Beggs, as Alternate US 75, also signed as US 75A or SH 75A. Historically, the old US 75 met US 66 (now SH 66) in Sapulpa, and the routes were co-signed into Tulsa. Nebraska Development of US 75 in North Omaha was the source of much contention in when it was constructed. One state agency reports, \\"Construction of the North Omaha Freeway, coupled with social unrest in the 1970s, greatly impacted the North Omaha area. One neighborhood experienced a 30 percent housing loss and major increase in crime.\\" Further, the City of Omaha refused to complete upgrades to the freeway, eliminating the possibility of achieving the I-580 designation planned for it. Nebraska‚ÄìIowa From when the route was created in 1926 until 1984, US 75 left Nebraska in Omaha, crossing over the Missouri River into Council Bluffs, Iowa over the Ak-Sar-Ben Bridge before 1966, and the I-480 Bridge from 1966 until 1984. US 75 then followed an alignment that went through western Iowa between Council Bluffs and Sioux City. After I-29 was built, US 75 was eventually moved onto I-29. In 1984, US 75 was rerouted into Nebraska to replace most of US 73\\\\. Previously, US 73 was concurrent with US 75 between Dawson, Nebraska and Omaha, and occupied the current segment of US 75 between Omaha and Winnebago.

The tower is the second-tallest in the city, the fifth-tallest in Texas, and the 47-tallest in the United States. Renaissance Tower was designed by the architectural firm Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum, completed in 1974, and renovated by architects Skidmore, Owings and Merrill in 1986. Major tenants include Neiman Marcus Group, Hilltop Securities and Godwin Lewis PC. History At the time of completion in 1974, it was the tallest building in Dallas at and was originally known as the First International Bancshares Tower (First International Bancshares, Inc. was the new holding company parent of First National Bank in Dallas). In 1985, it was surpassed by Fountain Place and Bank of America Plaza, which became Dallas's tallest building by far. It was also clear that Renaissance Tower would be overtaken by Comerica Bank Tower and Chase Tower then under construction. Therefore, in order to regain some status, the building underwent a major renovation in 1986 that included a re-glazed exterior and removal of the lighting on its sides. In 1986, James T. Chiles was brought in by the owner, the Prudential Insurance Company of America to design the broadcast center and towers on top the building, one of which was . This brought the structural height of the building up to , securing its place as the second-tallest building in Dallas. Excluding antennas and spires, the Renaissance Tower is the fifth-tallest. Dan Goodwin, a high-rise firefighting and rescue advocate, scaled the outside of the Renaissance Tower on November 7, 1981, clad in a Spider-Man suit and using only suction cups and his hands and feet to climb the outside of the building. Goodwin later stated he made the climb as a gift to a young Dallas boy stricken with cystic fibrosis whom he had met shortly after his ascent of Chicago's Sears Tower on May 25, 1981. Goodwin scaled the Renaissance Tower on his twenty-sixth birthday. In 1986, Winstead PC moved from the Mercantile National Bank complex to the Renaissance Tower. In 2008, Winstead PC occupied almost of space in the building. During that year, the firm hired CB Richard Ellis to study possibilities for relocation. Winstead selected an Uptown Dallas as a location and relocated in 2012. In 1996, Blockbuster Inc., which was then headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, began studying the idea of moving its headquarters, which consisted of 400 employees, into of space in the Renaissance Tower. In November 1996, Blockbuster confirmed that it was moving into of space on eight floors in the Renaissance Tower, choosing floor 23 as their center of operations. Blockbuster moved all employees out of Renaissance Tower in 2011 following its bankruptcy. In 2014, Westhan Global Logistics moved from its company's registered address to Renaissance Tower. Occupying a space on the 7th Floor. At the base of the building, there is a glass-pyramid structure that houses a two story underground food court and cafeteria. The food court connects to other nearby structures with tunnels via the Dallas Pedestrian Network.

The Gramophone Vol. 54. p. 978.International Music Guide 1978) was a British musician, musicologist, broadcaster and Gustav Mahler expert. Life Cooke was born in Leicester to a poor, working-class family; his father died when he was a child, but his mother was able to afford piano lessons. Cooke acquired a brilliant technique and began to compose. From Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys he won an organ scholarship to Selwyn College, Cambridge, where he was taught by Patrick Hadley and Robin Orr. His undergraduate studies were interrupted by the Second World War, during which he served in the Royal Artillery and took part in the invasion of Italy. Towards the end of the war he became pianist in an army dance band. Back in Cambridge, a number of his compositions were successfully performed, but he was insecure about their unfashionably conservative idiom, and eventually destroyed most of his works. After graduating in 1947 Cooke joined the BBC; apart from an interlude (1959‚Äì65) working as a freelance writer and critic, he worked for the corporation for the remainder of his life. His job involved writing and editing scripts for the music department and broadcasting for radio and television, where his thoughtful, unaffected manner made him an ideal communicator. In 1959 his first book, The Language of Music, argued that music is essentially a language of the emotions, and showed that composers throughout history had tended to choose the same musical phrases to express similar feelings or dramatic situations. Beginning in the run-up to the Mahler centenary in 1960, Cooke (in association with Berthold Goldschmidt) made his first attempt at producing a 'performing version' of the unfinished draft of Mahler's 10th Symphony. Originally a lecture demonstration broadcast by the BBC in 1960, the first full (continuous) version was premi√®red on 13 August 1964 at the Proms by the London Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Goldschmidt. Revised editions followed, with the composers David Matthews and Colin Matthews assisting Cooke and Goldschmidt in the attempt to produce an authentically Mahlerian orchestration. Finally seen into print by Cooke and his collaborators in 1976, the work has now become a part of the repertoire. Cooke's last years were marred by ill health, and he died prematurely of a cerebral haemorrhage in 1976, at the age of 57. During the final years of his life he had worked on a large-scale study of Wagner's massive operatic tetralogy Der Ring des Nibelungen. However, only part of the first volume, dealing with the text, was finished; it was published after his death as I Saw the World End. The full work would almost certainly have been the definitive study of the music of the Ring. A collection of Cooke's essays and talks was also published after his death as Vindications.

It comes very close to meeting its parent route, US 75, but decommissioning and rerouting in Downtown Dallas brings it a couple of miles short. Before the decommissioning of US 75 south of downtown Dallas in favor of Interstate 45 (I-45), US 175 met US 75. US 175's western terminus is in Dallas at I-45. The highway's eastern terminus is in Jacksonville at an intersection with US 69. Much of the US 175 corridor (from I-20 in Balch Springs to US 69 in Jacksonville) is part of TxDOT's network of evacuation routes in the event of a hurricane. TxDOT also considers the highway an alternative to using I-20 to travel to and from Dallas-Fort Worth, and feels the corridor is an important connection for students to get to Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches, as well. Besides its hurricane evacuation route status, US 175 is considered part of the National Highway System, the Texas Trunk System (later revised to just the portion between Mabank and Jacksonville), and is also included in the state's highway freight network. Of the three-digit U.S. Highways in Texas, US 175 is the shortest. Route description=Dallas County US 175 begins south of downtown Dallas at an interchange with Interstate 45. At this point, US 175 is four lanes in width‚Äîtwo eastbound and two westbound. The highway is a freeway- style structure that is, at first, elevated over the nearby neighborhoods of Ideal and Bonton, in South Dallas. US 175 also carries the name of C.F. Hawn Freeway here. After passing over S.M. Wright Freeway (which is also State Highway 310 south of US 175), a third lane is added in each direction of the freeway. After passing Bexar Street and Municipal Drive, the freeway goes into a lowland area that includes a crossing of White Rock Creek, then the freeway turns southeastward at the Second Avenue/Bruton Road exit. US 175 comes back up from the lowland area at the Lake June Road exit. US 175 passes through the Pleasant Grove area of Dallas past an interchange with Loop 12 (Buckner Blvd.), and then Interstate 20 a few miles later. The interchange with I-20 is a ‚Äústack‚Äù style, and is located just south of I-20‚Äôs interchange with Interstate 635; this is also a brief point where US 175 passes out of Dallas and into Balch Springs, then right back into Dallas. The freeway continues, but narrows to four lanes (two in each direction) at the I-20 interchange. After the Woody Road exit, US 175 leaves Dallas and enters the city of Seagoville. On the east side of Seagoville, US 175 leaves Dallas County. Kaufman County Kaufman As US 175 comes into Kaufman County, the surroundings become more rural. The freeway descends into a river valley and wetlands area , and then crosses the East Fork of the Trinity River. This marks the city limit boundary between Seagoville and Crandall. After rising out of the valley area, the highway goes through Crandall by intersecting Farm to Market Road 741 (which connects Crandall to Forney), then passing the center of town, and another exit, with Farm to Market Road 148 (connecting Crandall to Terrell). A few miles later, a rural interchange for County Road 4104-Bud Stoy Road marks the city limit border of Crandall and Kaufman. The freeway continues into Kaufman past a wide right curve at the State Highway 243 interchange, then passes by a brief urban section at the Business State Highway 34 (Washington Street) exit. After another mile, an exit for State Highway 34 comes along. After that exit, US 175 loses its freeway characteristics but continues as a four-lane divided highway. The highway proceeds for several miles before approaching Kemp. Here a bypass takes US 175 around the north and east of town, while the first of three business routes of US 175 goes through Kemp along US 175's previous routing in the area. After the bypass makes its way past a freeway-style exit at State Highway 274 (which also forms the east end of Business US 175), US 175 leaves the main part of Kemp. The highway continues as a divided four-lane road past two multi-bridge spans of Cedar Creek Reservoir. Between the two spans is the city limit border between Kemp and Mabank. After the second span of the lake, US 175 begins bypassing the main part of Mabank while another US 175 business route serves a through-town portion along a previous routing of the highway. One part of US 175 along its bypass is freeway-style, at an interchange with State Highway 198. The highway leaves Kaufman County just before completing its bypass of Mabank. Henderson County US 175 enters Henderson County as it approaches an at-grade intersection with the east end of Business US 175. The highway continues being divided with four lanes. A rural at-grade intersection with a county road marks the city limit border between Mabank and Gun Barrel City, then US 175 approaches a freeway-style interchange with State Highway 334. This state highway connects to the main portion of Gun Barrel City to the west, and is the last major road connecting US 175 to Cedar Creek Reservoir. Westbound lane of US 175 near Eustace (January 2010) After the interchange, US 175 leaves the city limits of Gun Barrel City, and within a mile, it enters the city limits of Eustace. Soon afterward, the highway narrows to an undivided four-lane road with a left-turn lane. US 175 approaches its first signal light at the intersection of Farm to Market Road 316, which comes into Eustace from the south; the intersection is the beginning of a brief overlap of the two roads near the center of town. FM 316's overlap concludes after four short blocks by turning left at another signal-lighted intersection to go north out of Eustace. US 175 continues out of Eustace and goes on another mile or so before becoming divided once again with four lanes. Once out of Eustace, US 175's speed limit goes up to , the highest maximum speed of any segment of the highway. Just northwest of Athens, a picnic area west of the RM 2329 intersection US 175 continues southeast for several more miles, then it passes a state-maintained roadside picnic area, the only one on the whole highway. An intersection with Ranch to Market Road 2329 comes up right afterward, then within a mile, US 175 enters the city limits of Athens. A few more miles later, the divided roadway narrows again, to an undivided four-lane road with a left-turn lane. After another mile, US 175 intersects Loop 7; it begins bypassing Athens by turning left and overlapping the loop (as well as State Highway 31, which also bypasses Athens by way of the loop). At this same intersection, the third of US 175's four business routes goes into Athens, along a previous routing of US 175. The portion of the route carrying US 175, SH 31, and Loop 7 is a four-lane highway with a left turn lane. On the north side of Athens, the highway intersects State Highway 19 with a grade-separated exit; the south-bound SH 19 bypasses Athens by merging with US 175, SH 31, and Loop 7 here while north-bound SH 19 turns left to go away from Athens, and a business route of SH 19 begins here to go south into the main part of town. Sign assembly in Athens illustrating the four concurrent routes sharing this part of the city's loop. This is the most routes that overlap with US 175 on any part of the highway. The four routes continue around Athens eastward past an at-grade intersection with Farm to Market Road 1616. SH 31 turns away from the four-route overlap at the next exit; it leaves by turning left (northeast) toward Tyler, while a business route of SH 31 turns right at the exit to go into Athens. US 175, SH 19, and Loop 7 continue their overlap around to the east edge of Athens, past a grade-separated exit of Farm to Market Road 2495. This road connects to Lake Athens and the Texas Freshwater Fisheries Center. A short distance later, US 175 turns away from SH 19 and Loop 7 at the next exit; US 175 goes left to return to its southeastward path, and the east end of Business US 175 is also found at this exit by turning right from the exit intersection. The roadway US 175 takes after leaving the Loop and the southeast side of Athens is once again a divided four-lane. After a few miles, US 175 intersects Farm to Market Road 804 in the community of Baxter. The divided four-lane arrangement continues past rural, rolling terrain, then after several miles is an intersection with Loop 60 in the community of Larue. The signage at the at-grade turn to the left also points to an eventual intersection with Farm to Market Road 607. A short distance later is an intersection with Ranch to Market Road 2588, on the south side of Larue. A short distance further is another intersection with Loop 60. Leaving the vicinity of Larue, and after a few miles, the LaPoynor consolidated school campus can be found on the left side of the highway; it includes a school zone with a speed limit of . For less than a mile along the north side of the highway, a service road can be found along the frontage of the school, which provides a safe connection and access for faculty and students. The service road continues a short distance further west past the school campus until an intersection with a local county road. About a mile past the school campus, at a county road crossing, is the city limits for the town of Poynor. Just before reaching the center of town, a left turn accesses the west end of Business US 175-H, which connects US 175 with Poynor's main crossroad, Farm to Market Road 315. US 175 continues on as a bypass around the center of Poynor, crossing a bridge that spans but does not connect to FM 315. After another half mile, US 175 reaches the east end of Business US 175-H. Texas Forest Trail sign along US 175 in Frankston At this point, US 175 becomes part of the Texas Forest Trail, one of several posted regional byways across the state. The Trail wanders around to several protected forest areas and scenic spots around eastern Texas. About a mile further, US 175 reaches the city limit border on the east side of Poynor, then it leaves Henderson County around a mile after that. Anderson County US 175 enters Anderson County by continuing its divided four-lane arrangement. After a few miles, the four lanes narrow, excluding the dividing median, but including a left-turn lane. Not long afterward, US 175 crosses the city limit line of Frankston. US 175 also goes by the name of Pine Street in Frankston. A few blocks after entering the town, the business district can be seen, with Frankston's downtown area just south of US 175. It is here where the highway intersects State Highway 155, the other major highway that serves the vicinity of Frankston. There is a full signal light at the intersection as well as a left-turn lane on each approach. This intersection marks the end of US 175's segment of the Texas Forest Trail; from here, it turns north to follow SH 155. After SH 155, and over a hill, US 175 leaves the urban portion of Frankston and, for the first time along the road, the four-lane section narrows to two lanes. This roadside spring just west of the Neches River has been a favorite stop for locals for many years. The east city limits of Frankston is crossed in less than two more miles. An assortment of hills, climbing lanes, and gentle curves are encountered on the highway. At the top of a hill east of Frankston is an intersection with Farm to Market Road 1892; this road connects to the south end of Lake Palestine near its dam. After a gradual downward slope and at the bottom of a hill, the bridge crossing of the Neches River is reached; this is the point where US 175 leaves Anderson County. Cherokee County After the bridge span over the Neches River and into Cherokee County, and a short distance later, US 175 reaches the west city limit border of Cuney. There is not much of a town center besides a city hall and post office, mainly scattered stores, modest homes, and a church along the way. Just after crossing the east city limit border of Cuney, US 175 comes to an intersection with Farm to Market Road 855. A left curve is ahead, then US 175 enters the community of Reese. There are two cemeteries, one on each side of the highway, then mostly homes and acreages in the community. Upon leaving Reese, there is a curve in the road to the right, then a slight ascent up a long hillside, with a climbing lane eastbound. At the top of the hill and around a wide right curve, US 175 approaches Cove Springs. The community is similar to Reese with mostly homes and acreages alongside the highway. As US 175 departs Cove Springs, it descends a long hillside with a climbing lane on the westbound side. A county road intersection at the top of the next hill leads south into the community of Church Hill. Then US 175 descends down a slightly longer hill, and a slight right curve to an intersection with County Road 3405, which leads north. The site of the Killough Monument can be accessed by way of this same road. Old Neches Saline Road state Historical Marker at this spot northwest of Jacksonville Across from this intersection is a Texas Historical Marker commemorating the past existence of the Neches Saline Road (a part of which is traversed by County Road 3405), a path once used by Native Americans and early area settlers. After another mile, a county road turns off to the right toward the community of Lakeview. A short hill ahead features climbing lanes in both directions. After another mile or so, US 175 approaches the city limit border on the northwest side of Jacksonville. This part of US 175 in Jacksonville is also known as Frankston Street. Between the city limits and the next street intersection, Pineda Street, an elementary school is on the right, with a special lower school zone speed. A signal light after three blocks marks an intersection with Farm to Market Road 347 (North Bolton Street). For its final three blocks, US 175 changes street names to Alexander Boulevard and widens to four lanes with a left turn lane, with wide berms beyond the sides of the street, separating it from neighborhoods to the north and south. Another signal light ahead marks an intersection with U.S. Highway 69 (North Jackson Street); this point marks US 175's eastern terminus. Business routes Sign display for Business US 175-G at its southeast terminus in Athens There are currently four business routes of U.S. Highway 175. Business U.S. Highway 175-D (formerly Loop 346) is a business loop that goes east into Kemp from its intersection of US 175 west. The route runs along Elm Street to an intersection with State Highway 274, then turns left to go north, overlapped with SH 274, until intersecting again with US 175. Most of the route is part of a previous route of US 175. The Business route was created in 1991 and is long. Business U.S. Highway 175-E is a business loop that runs through Mabank. This route runs on Mason Street, along a previous route of US 175, past an intersection with State Highway 198 until intersecting again with US 175. The business route was created in 1991 when US 175 was rerouted further north and east around town. The route is long. Business U.S. Highway 175-G is a business loop that runs through Athens. This route runs southeast on a previous routing of US 175 from an intersection of US 175 west / State Highway 31 / Loop 7, to an intersection with Business SH 31, then turns left where the two routes overlap on Corsicana Street. At the center of town by the courthouse square, Business SH 31 turns left away from Business US 175-G. The road passes an intersection with Business SH 19 on the east side of the square, then proceeds east, then later curves to the southeast, eventually intersecting again with US 175 / Loop 7 (as well as State Highway 19). The route was created in 2004 when US 175 was rerouted to go to the north and east of Athens on Loop 7. Business US 175-G is long. Business U.S. Highway 175-H is a business loop that passes through the town of Poynor. This route runs southeast on a previous routing of US 175 from an intersection of US 175 on the west side of town, past an intersection with Farm to Market Road 315, then intersecting again with US 175 on the east side of Poynor. The route was created in 2019 after US 175 was rerouted on a new bypass alignment to the south and east of town. Business US 175-H is long. Former Business routes There is one former Business Route along US 175. Business U.S. Highway 175-B was located in Crandall between 1992 and 2002 and was long. The route went southeast along Main Street from an intersection with the eastbound service road of US 175, to an intersection with Trunk Street, then turned left (northeast) until another intersection with the eastbound service road of US 175. This route had been previously designated Loop 219 before 1992; since 2002, though, the portions along Main and Trunk have been maintained by the city of Crandall. History An early figure in the formation of what would become US 175 was William Richardson, who settled with his family on land just northwest of Athens in late 1855. Richardson was called upon to help map out an early road path between Athens and Kaufman. The routing US 175 takes now in that area is based in part on what Richardson helped to plan. Hobby Highway logo, which marked the auto trail's path at various roadside points.For a time during the auto trails era, much or most of the path of today's US 175 was part of the Hobby Highway. It followed a path from southeast Texas, through Beaumont, Nacogdoches, Jacksonville, Dallas, and on to Gainesville. It is uncertain how long the Hobby Highway naming was in existence, nor how well and often it was marked and signed. Early style of signage used on State Highway 40 prior to when US 175 was commissioned.Before 1920, and subsequently into the 1930s, a state highway, SH 40, existed from Beaumont to the Texas-Oklahoma border. The routing of SH 40 included a portion between Dallas and Jacksonville. It was this portion that became U.S. Highway 175 by July 1932. The other parts of SH 40 became parts of other US highways (US 77 north of Dallas by 1926; US 271 south of Jacksonville from 1930 to 1934, when the designation transitioned to US 69) as well (Map sources into at least the mid-1930s show a co-signing of US 175 and SH 40 along US 175's entire route; it is unclear whether these were mapping mistakes of some kind or if the two designations were allowed as an orientative transition, if so, it is unclear as to for how long.). Traces of SH 40's pre-US 175 route exist on 2 street signs, one near Cedar Creek Country Club (between Kemp and Mabank), the other just off SH 274 on the edge of Kemp. These changes phased out the SH 40 designation until almost 60 years later, when a short portion of highway in College Station was given the SH 40 designation in 1994. As the U.S. system of highways was beginning to spread across the country, there were some routes‚Äîand routings‚Äîstill to be decided. US Highway 77 was one of those. It had made it as far south as Dallas by 1930, but there would be more of it to the south to come. So far in Texas, the path to Dallas for US 77 was along SH 40's route. A petition with over 1000 signatures favoring the extension of US 77 along SH 40 between Dallas and Jacksonville was brought to a September 1930 meeting of the Texas Highway Commission. The delegation heading up the presentation of the petition included W.W. Gibbard, president of the Highway No. 77 Association, R.A. Thompson with the Dallas Chamber of Commerce, and W.R. Cousins of Beaumont, a state Senator. At the meeting, the Commission went on to pass an order requesting the executive committee of AASHO (the American Association of State Highway Officials; now called AASHTO) to consider the US 77 extension. It is not exactly clear what eventually took place with the extension request, but US 77 would go on to be extended southward, toward Waco instead of toward Jacksonville, and of course, US 175 ended up being the numeric designation of the Dallas to Jacksonville SH 40 segment almost 2 years later. In 1988, the portion of US 75 between Galveston and Dallas was truncated; this included much of South Central Expressway south of downtown. In US 75's place, US 175 was extended north from the South Central-C.F. Hawn interchange to I-45; a separate numbering, SH 310, was used for the portion of South Central south of US 175. The state decreed in the mid-1990s that all of South Central Expressway south of I-45 be renamed for Sylvester (S.M.) Wright, who grew up just south of the future Hawn Freeway, in the Bon Ton neighborhood of South Dallas. A pastor at Peoples Missionary Baptist Church, Rev. Wright was influential in his community towards solutions dealing with race in the late 1950s and into the 1960s. George W. Bush, Texas' governor at the time, was in attendance for the rededication ceremony of the freeway. On April 25, 2013, a minute order was issued by the state Transportation Commission authorizing the change of designation for US 175 to a new direct routing west to I-45. This extension is currently under construction. At a meeting of the Texas Transportation Commission in January 2015, a minute order was issued authorizing the increase of US 175 speed limits in Kaufman County. In a reversal of what had been a reduction in 2001 of speed limits because of emissions concerns, the commissioners approved the change to a 70 mile per hour speed limit for the whole county. Previously, the part of US 175 between the Dallas County-Kaufman County line and the east side of Crandall had a 60 mile per hour speed limit; while the part from Crandall to the Kaufman County- Henderson County line in Mabank had a 65 mile per hour limit beforehand. By mid-April 2015, updated speed limit signs were in place in the affected area. Construction projects * In the 1950s, one of the first improvements along US 175 in Dallas occurred at a signal-lighted intersection in Pleasant Grove; it was the site of several previous accidents. The intersection was made into a freeway-style exit with grade separation and ramps. At the time of construction, US 175 had a vehicles-per-day count of more than 10,000 at the intersection. Right of way there, went from a width of to . The project commenced in February 1956, and was completed in March 1957. It is at the present-day site of the Loop 12-Buckner Blvd. exit off US 175. * Not long after work commenced on the new freeway exit in Pleasant Grove, a new machine was being used for installing curbs of concrete down the center of streets surrounding the courthouse square in Athens. One of the streets was Corsicana Street, which was the through-town path of US 175 at the time (now Business US 175). * In January 1964, a new west terminus was completed, connecting South Central Expressway with Second Avenue. This formed one of the first freeway segments in Dallas on US 175. It also, for the first time, bypassed sections of Dallas which had been served since 175 became a US highway some 32 years earlier. No longer would it connect Deep Ellum, Fair Park, or the Second Avenue corridor of South Dallas. The new freeway's namesake, Charles (C.F.) Hawn, was a businessman from Athens who served on the Texas Highway Commission for six years. He was involved in the family's lumber store, as well as banking, ranching, and development. After aiding in funding dilemmas between Dallas County and the city of Dallas, it was decided that the new freeway east of South Central Expressway in Dallas be named for Hawn. He was present at the dedication, which was attended by dignitaries and family from all along Highway 175, including Athens. The same day, a luncheon was held in Hawn's honor at Market Hall in Dallas.. * Eight years later, in January 1972, an interchange with I-635 was completed. The interchange was constructed in a multi-layer \\"stack\\" style. I-635 was originally built along the northern, eastern, and southern sides of Dallas east of I-35E, but a transition between the late 1970s and 1990 eventually truncated I-635's southern part back to just north of its interchange with US 175. The freeway that directly crosses at the US 175 interchange is now part of the path of I-20. Charles Hawn was present at the dedication for the interchange. Along US 175's path, several cities have been bypassed that previously had been served with through-town routings, including Seagoville, Crandall, Kaufman, Kemp, Mabank, and Athens. Other updates to US 175 have included widenings that have transformed much of the highway; it has become freeway over the years between Dallas and Kaufman, while further southeastward, US 175 has been widened to a divided four-lane highway as far as Baxter, in Henderson County. The bypassed sections in Seagoville and Crandall came in conjunction with a new alignment between the two cities and a higher bridge over the East Fork of the Trinity River. In Kaufman, the bypass was built as a freeway style to the west and south of downtown, where US 175 was previously routed there. The center of Kemp was bypassed to the north and east in an incomplete freeway style. Mabank's bypass came later, with a mostly freeway-style route to the north and east of town. The construction of Loop 7 around Athens was the catalyst for US 175's bypass there; the city decreed that the loop would be made a truck route, so, as such, the city was able to get the state to reroute the designations of each highway serving the town (US 175, State Highway 19 and State Highway 31) to the loop, making each route bypass the city. US 175's portion was signed afterward along the north and east sides of Loop 7. It appears that LaRue may have been first to be bypassed, but it is unclear as to whether it was formulated in the early years of US 175's time, or if it was done while the path was signed as SH 40. The section in question is currently designated as Loop 60. There have been many sections that have been widened, mostly to a divided four-lane arrangement, while some have four lanes with a left-turn lane in the middle of the highway. From Kaufman to Kemp, a previously two lane section was made into a four lane divided section, with crossovers to access each side of the highway. From Kemp to Mabank, a two lane section was made into a four lane divided section, with crossovers to access each side of the highway, along with new bridge spans over two sections of Cedar Creek Reservoir, which were built for the new westbound lanes. These were built higher than the bridge spans along the original two lane portion. A multi- phase project from Mabank to Athens began in 2006 to make a two lane section into a four lane divided section between Mabank and Eustace, which included a grade-separation for the intersection of US 175 and SH 334, then, a four-lane section with a left-turn lane within Eustace, then the other phase was widening the two-lane Eustace to Athens portion into a divided four lane highway. The work was completed by 2011. During the 1980s, a two-lane section of US 175 between Athens and Baxter was made into a four-lane divided highway. * Between May 2001 and April 2002, US 175's east terminus was relocated and straightened in Jacksonville. After many years of zigzagging its way to the center of town, the highway was finally rerouted to a new, wider path for its last three blocks prior to the new intersection with US Highway 69. Harold Alexander, a past city council member in Jacksonville, donated land for the straightening and improvements for the new east terminus and was a proponent of the project. The city named the new three-block section for Alexander at its dedication. There had previously been three east termini in Jacksonville: Frankston Street at North Bolton Street until sometime in the 1960s, when US 69 was rerouted off North Bolton; South Jackson at East Rusk Street, at the south end of a new railroad overpass; and North Jackson at Cherokee Street around 1999. * In October 2016, a new bypass around the south and east parts of Kaufman was completed for State Highway 34; this project included a new exit on US 175. The exit on US 175 at South Washington Street, SH 34's previous routing, became an exit for Business SH 34 after the opening of the new bypass. In August 2018, the SH 34 bypass bridge was named for longtime local Congressman Ralph Hall at a dedication ceremony. * A three-phase project widened the portion of US 175 between Baxter and Frankston. One phase widened the highway from Baxter to just east of LaRue from a very narrow two-lane section to a four-lane divided highway; this phase began construction in April 2015. The second phase was from LaRue to just east of Poynor; it also made a very narrow two-lane section into a four-lane divided road, with a short service road-style section in front of the LaPoynor School complex, as well as a short bypass of Poynor's downtown area that included a bridge over FM 315; work started on this phase in October 2015. The third of the three phases went from just east of Poynor to Frankston with a widening of a two-lane section to a four-lane divided arrangement. The Poynor‚ÄìFrankston phase of construction was the last to be completed, in late 2019. * Work was completed in Dallas on a project to extend the C.F. Hawn Freeway from the 90-degree curve at S.M. Wright Freeway westward across South Lamar Street to a new west terminus at I-45. The new terminus was only constructed with ramp movements from US 175 west to I-45 north, and from I-45 south to US 175 east. As of March 2020, the new portion from I-45 south to US 175 east was open to traffic, but the other direction took a bit longer, opening to traffic in early July 2020. Native artifacts unearthed during construction project After construction commenced on a US 175 widening project between Baxter and Frankston, and prior to July 2015, at least three sites were found by construction workers that contained various items which included stone tools and ceramic vessels. Research showed that Natives settled or farmed in these areas between the 1400s and the mid-1600s. As the archeological process was still taking place by July 2015, TxDOT felt it necessary not to disclose the exact locations of the finds to ensure a secure process, as it is against the law to trespass on sites such as those. Construction workers were able to continue their work elsewhere on the widening project as the protected areas were being probed by investigators. Future Workers install signals in August 2017 at the US 175/FM 1895 intersection in Kemp. The ones facing FM 1895 will blink red, while US 175 traffic will see yellow flashing signals. This work is likely an interim solution until funding is made available to better improve the intersection. * There are plans to continue and finish widening the remainder of US 175. The last portion not yet done is a 17-mile (27 km) section between Frankston and Jacksonville. Funding and right-of-way acquisition have not been finalized for that part of the highway. * Another project involves adding a missing service road along the south side of US 175 between FM 148 in Crandall and the County Road 4106 exit; it wasn't originally built when US 175 was made a freeway there due to close proximity to a parallel section of the Southern Pacific railroad (which has since been abandoned). Construction is scheduled to begin in 2020 and be completed by 2022. * In conjunction with the service road project, a plan proposed by TxDOT would build a bypass for FM 148 to the east of the current alignment in Crandall; this would include a new exit and overpass at US 175. A public hearing was held in Crandall in August 2018 to inform residents there about project plans. According to those plans, letting for construction is due to take place by 2021. * The intersection of FM 2860 between Kaufman and Kemp has been a candidate for years to be upgraded to a grade-separated, freeway-style exit, but funding hasn't been set aside for this project. * The US 175 bypass of Kemp is the site of another potential project, to make the intersections at Business US 175 west and at FM 1895 into full freeway-style, grade-separated exits, but no funding has been made available. * A proposal by TxDOT to widen US 175 in Dallas from 6 lanes to 8 lanes between the SH 310 exit and the I-20 interchange is being studied; reportedly no funding is yet available for the project. * Loop 9, a planned outer loop continuation of the Bush Turnpike, will run between US 67 south of Dallas and I-20 east of Dallas; it is due to intersect with US 175 east of the Malloy Bridge Road exit in Seagoville. * A TxDOT project that would improve the US 175/I-20 interchange has been proposed. There are no specifics as of yet, other than the affected span (from the Masters Road exit east to the Edd Road exit), and the amount of funding it may need ($200 million) to complete it. No timeline has yet been posted, nor have any designs been made public. Current construction * Work is progressing in Dallas on a project to transform the former 'Dead Man's Curve' as part of a freeway-to-parkway reconstruction along S.M. Wright Freeway. The project, from C.F. Hawn Freeway northward, encompasses a now-former section of US 175. All exits along S.M. Wright are to become at-grade intersections. Other associated changes will be made to I-45 just north of the new US 175 interchange. Some think that this project will not only fix a highway problem, but also help toward putting a separated community back together. * Preliminary work has begun in advance of the construction work to construct a service road along the south side of US 175 east of the FM 148 intersection in Crandall. This is mainly clearing of trees and brush, as well as relocation of underground utility lines. * Road work is taking place between southeast Loop 7 in Athens, and the community of Baxter. This work will add shoulders along the eastbound section of this part of US 175, a portion of the road that has, inexplicably, never had them before. Major intersectionsIn popular culture * In the reality series Police Women of Dallas, during transitions between scenes and in return-from- commercial-break bumpers, occasional evening shots of US 175 entrance ramps (signage included) could be seen, with the Dallas skyline lit up in the background. * The Route 66 episode \\"1800 Days to Justice\\" was filmed in Crandall, and used a previous routing of US 175 (Trunk Street) in one scene.

It carries New York State Route 440 (NY 440) and New Jersey Route 440, with the two roads connecting at the state border near the bridge's center. The Outerbridge Crossing is one of three vehicular bridges connecting New Jersey with Staten Island, and like the others, is maintained and operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The others are the Bayonne Bridge (also carrying Route 440), which connects Staten Island with Bayonne, and the Goethals Bridge (carrying Interstate 278 (I-278), which connects the island with Elizabeth). Description View from top of tower through truss work The bridge was named for Eugenius Harvey Outerbridge, the first chairman of the then‚ÄìPort of New York Authority and a resident of Staten Island. (note: his daughter was responsible for bringing lawn tennis to the US). Rather than calling it the \\"Outerbridge Bridge\\", the span was labeled a \\"crossing\\", but many New Yorkers and others mistakenly assume the name comes from the fact that it is the most remote bridge in New York City and the southernmost crossing in New York state. The bridge is of a steel cantilever construction, designed by John Alexander Low Waddell and built under the auspices of the Port of New York Authority, now the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which currently operates it. It opened simultaneously with the first Goethals Bridge on June 29, 1928. Both spans had similar designs prior to replacement of the Goethals with the current cable-stayed bridge in 2018. Neither bridge saw high traffic counts until the opening of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge in 1964. Traffic counts on both bridges were also depressed due to the effects of the Great Depression and World War II. The Outerbridge Crossing has undergone numerous repairs as a result of the high volume of traffic that crosses the bridge each day. On October 11, 2013, the Port Authority announced the completion of the bridge's repaving project. On March 2, 2017, Port Authority Executive Director Patrick Foye announced the funding of a study into a potential replacement bridge. Traffic The Outerbridge Crossing carried 32,438,000 vehicles (both directions) in 2006, or approximately 90,000 each day. Tolls are collected in the eastbound direction only. In 2003, the Port Authority raised the speed limit for the three inner E-ZPass lanes at the toll plaza from , separating these lanes from the rest of the eight-lane toll plaza by a barrier. Two years later, the tollbooths adjacent to the 25 mph E-ZPass lanes were removed and overhead gantries were installed with electronic tag readers to permit E-ZPass vehicles to travel at in special high-speed lanes. Motorists using the high-speed E-ZPass lanes cannot use Exit 1 to Page Avenue, which is located immediately after the toll plaza. Tolls , the cash tolls going from New Jersey to New York are $16 for cars and motorcycles; there is no toll for passenger vehicles going from New York to New Jersey. New Jersey and New York-issued E-ZPass users are charged $11.75 for cars and $10.75 for motorcycles during off-peak hours, and $13.75 for cars and $12.75 for motorcycles during peak hours. Users with E-ZPass issued from agencies outside of New Jersey and New York are charged the cash rate. Tolls are only collected for eastbound traffic. Originally, tolls were collected in both directions. In August 1970, the toll was abolished for westbound drivers, and at the same time, eastbound drivers saw their tolls doubled. The tolls of eleven other New York‚ÄìNew Jersey and Hudson River crossings along a stretch, from the Outerbridge Crossing in the south to the Rip Van Winkle Bridge in the north, were also changed to south- or eastbound-only at that time. Open road tolling began on April 24, 2019. The tollbooths were dismantled, and drivers are no longer able to pay cash at the bridge. Instead, there are cameras mounted onto new overhead gantries located on the Staten Island side. A vehicle without E-ZPass has a picture taken of its license plate and a bill for the toll is mailed to its owner. For E-ZPass users, sensors detect their transponders wirelessly.

Le Guin. The only fantastic element of this novel is that it takes place in the imaginary Central European country of Orsinia, which is also the setting of her collection Orsinian Tales. In many ways, Malafrena reads like a 19th-century novel, with its many detailed characters, its political and romantic subplots, its lack of the supernatural, and its settings that range from the mansions of the aristocracy to slums and a prison. Malafrena is written for an adult audience, rather than children and young adults, the target readership of most of Le Guin's works in the period 1979-1994.Cadden, Mike. Ursula K. Le Guin Beyond Genre: Fiction for Children and Adults, (New York, NY: Routledge, 2005) page 114.  Plot summary  The story takes place from 1825 to 1830, when Orsinia is ruled by the Austrian Empire. The hero is Itale Sorde, the son of the owner of an estate on a lake called Malafrena in a valley of the same name. Itale leaves the estate, against his father's will, to engage in nationalistic and revolutionary politics in the capital.  Characters  *Itale Sorde: The protagonist of the story. *Laura Sorde: Itale's sister. *Guide Sorde: Itale's father. *Emanuel Sorde: Itale's uncle. *Eleonora: Itale's mother. *Tomas Brelavay: School friend and collaborator in Krasnoy. *Givan Frenin: School friend and collaborator in Krasnoy. *Count Orlant Valtorskar: Neighbor and family friend. *Piera Valtorskar: Neighbor and family friend. *Luisa Paludeskar: A young noble woman in Krasnoy. *Enrike Paludeskar: Luisa's brother. *Amadey Estenskar: A writer from Polana province.  Literary significance and criticism  Mike Cadden notes that Malafrena has not received as much critical attention as many of Le Guin's other works, primarily because the characters in the story do not connect well with one another.Cadden, Mike. Ursula K. Le Guin Beyond Genre: Fiction for Children and Adults, (New York, NY: Routledge, 2005) page 30. An imperceptible, omniscient author is used to tell the story, and Le Guin herself acknowledges one of the strongest influences on her Orsinian works is Russian literature.Cadden, Mike. Ursula K.

Its most common use is as one of several post-Hartree‚ÄìFock ab initio quantum chemistry methods in the field of computational chemistry, but it is also used in nuclear physics. Coupled cluster essentially takes the basic Hartree‚ÄìFock molecular orbital method and constructs multi-electron wavefunctions using the exponential cluster operator to account for electron correlation. Some of the most accurate calculations for small to medium-sized molecules use this method. The method was initially developed by Fritz Coester and Hermann K√ºmmel in the 1950s for studying nuclear-physics phenomena, but became more frequently used when in 1966 Ji≈ô√≠ ƒå√≠≈æek (and later together with Josef Paldus) reformulated the method for electron correlation in atoms and molecules. It is now one of the most prevalent methods in quantum chemistry that includes electronic correlation. CC theory is simply the perturbative variant of the many-electron theory (MET) of Oktay Sinanoƒülu, which is the exact (and variational) solution of the many-electron problem, so it was also called \\"coupled-pair MET (CPMET)\\". J. ƒå√≠≈æek used the correlation function of MET and used Goldstone-type perturbation theory to get the energy expression, while original MET was completely variational. ƒå√≠≈æek first developed the linear CPMET and then generalized it to full CPMET in the same work in 1966. He then also performed an application of it on the benzene molecule with O. Sinanoƒülu in the same year. Because MET is somewhat difficult to perform computationally, CC is simpler and thus, in today's computational chemistry, CC is the best variant of MET and gives highly accurate results in comparison to experiments. See also references therein.  Wavefunction ansatz  Coupled-cluster theory provides the exact solution to the time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation : H \\\\Psi\\\\rangle = E \\\\Psi\\\\rangle, where H is the Hamiltonian of the system, \\\\Psi\\\\rangle is the exact wavefunction, and E is the exact energy of the ground state. Coupled-cluster theory can also be used to obtain solutions for excited states using, for example, linear-response, equation-of-motion, state-universal multi-reference, or valence-universal multi-reference coupled cluster approaches. The wavefunction of the coupled- cluster theory is written as an exponential ansatz: : \\\\Psi\\\\rangle = e^T \\\\Phi_0\\\\rangle, where \\\\Phi_0\\\\rangle is the reference wave function, which is typically a Slater determinant constructed from Hartree‚ÄìFock molecular orbitals, though other wave functions such as configuration interaction, multi-configurational self-consistent field, or Brueckner orbitals can also be used. T is the cluster operator, which, when acting on \\\\Phi_0\\\\rangle, produces a linear combination of excited determinants from the reference wave function (see section below for greater detail). The choice of the exponential ansatz is opportune because (unlike other ansatzes, for example, configuration interaction) it guarantees the size extensivity of the solution. Size consistency in CC theory, also unlike other theories, does not depend on the size consistency of the reference wave function. This is easily seen, for example, in the single bond breaking of F2 when using a restricted Hartree‚ÄìFock (RHF) reference, which is not size-consistent, at the CCSDT (coupled cluster single-double-triple) level of theory, which provides an almost exact, full-CI-quality, potential-energy surface and does not dissociate the molecule into F‚àí and F+ ions, like the RHF wave function, but rather into two neutral F atoms. If one were to use, for example, the CCSD, or CCSD(T) levels of theory, they would not provide reasonable results for the bond breaking of F2, with the latter one approaches unphysical potential energy surfaces, though this is for reasons other than just size consistency. A criticism of the method is that the conventional implementation employing the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian (see below) is not variational, though there are bi-variational and quasi-variational approaches that have been developed since the first implementations of the theory. While the above ansatz for the wave function itself has no natural truncation, however, for other properties, such as energy, there is a natural truncation when examining expectation values, which has its basis in the linked- and connected-cluster theorems, and thus does not suffer from issues such as lack of size extensivity, like the variational configuration-interaction approach.  Cluster operator  The cluster operator is written in the form : T = T_1 + T_2 + T_3 + \\\\cdots, where T_1 is the operator of all single excitations, T_2 is the operator of all double excitations, and so forth. In the formalism of second quantization these excitation operators are expressed as : T_1 = \\\\sum_i \\\\sum_a t_a^i \\\\hat{a}^a \\\\hat{a}_i, : T_2 = \\\\frac{1}{4} \\\\sum_{i,j} \\\\sum_{a,b} t_{ab}^{ij} \\\\hat{a}^a \\\\hat{a}^b \\\\hat{a}_j \\\\hat{a}_i, and for the general n-fold cluster operator : T_n = \\\\frac{1}{(n!)^2} \\\\sum_{i_1,i_2,\\\\ldots,i_n} \\\\sum_{a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_n} t_{a_1,a_2,\\\\ldots,a_n}^{i_1,i_2,\\\\ldots,i_n} \\\\hat{a}^{a_1} \\\\hat{a}^{a_2} \\\\ldots \\\\hat{a}^{a_n} \\\\hat{a}_{i_n} \\\\ldots \\\\hat{a}_{i_2} \\\\hat{a}_{i_1}. In the above formulae \\\\hat{a}^a = \\\\hat{a}^\\\\dagger_a and \\\\hat{a}_i denote the creation and annihilation operators respectively, while i, j stand for occupied (hole) and a, b for unoccupied (particle) orbitals (states). The creation and annihilation operators in the coupled-cluster terms above are written in canonical form, where each term is in the normal order form, with respect to the Fermi vacuum \\\\Phi_0\\\\rangle. Being the one-particle cluster operator and the two-particle cluster operator, T_1 and T_2 convert the reference function \\\\Phi_0\\\\rangle into a linear combination of the singly and doubly excited Slater determinants respectively, if applied without the exponential (such as in CI, where a linear excitation operator is applied to the wave function). Applying the exponential cluster operator to the wave function, one can then generate more than doubly excited determinants due to the various powers of T_1 and T_2 that appear in the resulting expressions (see below). Solving for the unknown coefficients t_a^i and t_{ab}^{ij} is necessary for finding the approximate solution \\\\Psi\\\\rangle. The exponential operator e^T may be expanded as a Taylor series, and if we consider only the T_1 and T_2 cluster operators of T, we can write : e^T = 1 + T + \\\\frac{1}{2!} T^2 + \\\\cdots = 1 + T_1 + T_2 + \\\\frac{1}{2} T_1^2 + \\\\frac{1}{2} T_1 T_2 + \\\\frac{1}{2} T_2 T_1 + \\\\frac{1}{2} T_2^2 + \\\\cdots Though in practice this series is finite because the number of occupied molecular orbitals is finite, as is the number of excitations, it is still very large, to the extent that even modern-day massively parallel computers are inadequate, except for problems of a dozen or so electrons and very small basis sets, when considering all contributions to the cluster operator and not just T_1 and T_2. Often, as was done above, the cluster operator includes only singles and doubles (see CCSD below) as this offers a computationally affordable method that performs better than MP2 and CISD, but is not very accurate usually. For accurate results some form of triples (approximate or full) are needed, even near the equilibrium geometry (in the Franck‚ÄìCondon region), and especially when breaking single bonds or describing diradical species (these latter examples are often what is referred to as multi-reference problems, since more than one determinant has a significant contribution to the resulting wave function). For double-bond breaking and more complicated problems in chemistry, quadruple excitations often become important as well, though usually they have small contributions for most problems, and as such, the contribution of T_5, T_6 etc. to the operator T is typically small. Furthermore, if the highest excitation level in the T operator is n, : T = T_1 + ... + T_n, then Slater determinants for an N-electron system excited more than n () times may still contribute to the coupled-cluster wave function \\\\Psi\\\\rangle because of the non-linear nature of the exponential ansatz, and therefore, coupled cluster terminated at T_n usually recovers more correlation energy than CI with maximum n excitations.  Coupled-cluster equations  The Schr√∂dinger equation can be written, using the coupled-cluster wave function, as : H \\\\Psi_0\\\\rangle = H e^T \\\\Phi_0\\\\rangle = E e^T \\\\Phi_0\\\\rangle, where there are a total of q coefficients (t-amplitudes) to solve for. To obtain the q equations, first, we multiply the above Schr√∂dinger equation on the left by e^{-T} and then project onto the entire set of up to m-tuply excited determinants, where m is the highest-order excitation included in T that can be constructed from the reference wave function \\\\Phi_0\\\\rangle, denoted by \\\\Phi^*\\\\rangle. Individually, \\\\Phi_i^a\\\\rangle are singly excited determinants where the electron in orbital i has been excited to orbital a; \\\\Phi_{ij}^{ab}\\\\rangle are doubly excited determinants where the electron in orbital i has been excited to orbital a and the electron in orbital j has been excited to orbital b, etc. In this way we generate a set of coupled energy-independent non-linear algebraic equations needed to determine the t-amplitudes: : \\\\langle\\\\Phi_0 e^{-T} H e^T \\\\Phi_0\\\\rangle = E \\\\langle\\\\Phi_0\\\\Phi_0\\\\rangle = E, : \\\\langle\\\\Phi^* e^{-T} H e^T \\\\Phi_0\\\\rangle = E \\\\langle\\\\Phi^*\\\\Phi_0\\\\rangle = 0, the latter being the equations to be solved, and the former the equation for the evaluation of the energy. (Note that we have made use of e^{-T} e^T = 1, the identity operator, and also assume that orbitals are orthogonal, though this does not necessarily have to be true, e.g., valence bond orbitals can be used, and in such cases the last set of equations are not necessarily equal to zero.) Considering the basic CCSD method: : \\\\langle\\\\Phi_0 e^{-(T_1 + T_2)} H e^{(T_1 + T_2)} \\\\Phi_0\\\\rangle = E, : \\\\langle\\\\Phi_i^a e^{-(T_1 + T_2)} H e^{(T_1 + T_2)} \\\\Phi_0\\\\rangle = 0, : \\\\langle\\\\Phi_{ij}^{ab} e^{-(T_1 + T_2)} H e^{(T_1 + T_2)} \\\\Phi_0\\\\rangle = 0, in which the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian \\\\bar{H} can be explicitly written down using Hadamard's formula in Lie algebra, also called Hadamard's lemma (see also Baker‚ÄìCampbell‚ÄìHausdorff formula (BCH formula), though note that they are different, in that Hadamard's formula is a lemma of the BCH formula): : \\\\bar{H} = e^{-T} H e^{T} = H + [H, T] + \\\\frac{1}{2!} \\\\big H, T], T\\\\big] + \\\\dots = (H e^T)_C. The subscript C designates the connected part of the corresponding operator expression. The resulting similarity-transformed Hamiltonian is non-Hermitian, resulting in different left and right vectors (wave functions) for the same state of interest (this is what is often referred to in coupled-cluster theory as the biorthogonality of the solution, or wave function, though it also applies to other non-Hermitian theories as well). The resulting equations are a set of non-linear equations, which are solved in an iterative manner. Standard quantum-chemistry packages (GAMESS (US), NWChem, ACES II, etc.) solve the coupled-cluster equations using the Jacobi method and direct inversion of the iterative subspace (DIIS) extrapolation of the t-amplitudes to accelerate convergence.  Types of coupled-cluster methods  The classification of traditional coupled-cluster methods rests on the highest number of excitations allowed in the definition of T. The abbreviations for coupled-cluster methods usually begin with the letters \\"CC\\" (for \\"coupled cluster\\") followed by # S ‚Äì for single excitations (shortened to singles in coupled-cluster terminology), # D ‚Äì for double excitations (doubles), # T ‚Äì for triple excitations (triples), # Q ‚Äì for quadruple excitations (quadruples). Thus, the T operator in CCSDT has the form : T = T_1 + T_2 + T_3. Terms in round brackets indicate that these terms are calculated based on perturbation theory. For example, the CCSD(T) method means: # Coupled cluster with a full treatment singles and doubles. # An estimate to the connected triples contribution is calculated non-iteratively using many-body perturbation theory arguments.  General description of the theory  The complexity of equations and the corresponding computer codes, as well as the cost of the computation, increases sharply with the highest level of excitation. For many applications CCSD, while relatively inexpensive, does not provide sufficient accuracy except for the smallest systems (approximately 2 to 4 electrons), and often an approximate treatment of triples is needed. The most well known coupled-cluster method that provides an estimate of connected triples is CCSD(T), which provides a good description of closed-shell molecules near the equilibrium geometry, but breaks down in more complicated situations such as bond breaking and diradicals. Another popular method that makes up for the failings of the standard CCSD(T) approach is -CC(2,3), where the triples contribution to the energy is computed from the difference between the exact solution and the CCSD energy and is not based on perturbation-theory arguments. More complicated coupled-cluster methods such as CCSDT and CCSDTQ are used only for high-accuracy calculations of small molecules. The inclusion of all n levels of excitation for the n-electron system gives the exact solution of the Schr√∂dinger equation within the given basis set, within the Born‚ÄìOppenheimer approximation (although schemes have also been drawn up to work without the BO approximation). One possible improvement to the standard coupled-cluster approach is to add terms linear in the interelectronic distances through methods such as CCSD-R12. This improves the treatment of dynamical electron correlation by satisfying the Kato cusp condition and accelerates convergence with respect to the orbital basis set. Unfortunately, R12 methods invoke the resolution of the identity, which requires a relatively large basis set in order to be a good approximation. The coupled-cluster method described above is also known as the single-reference (SR) coupled-cluster method because the exponential ansatz involves only one reference function \\\\Phi_0\\\\rangle. The standard generalizations of the SR-CC method are the multi-reference (MR) approaches: state-universal coupled cluster (also known as Hilbert space coupled cluster), valence-universal coupled cluster (or Fock space coupled cluster) and state-selective coupled cluster (or state-specific coupled cluster).

Josef Paldus also wrote his first-hand account of the origins of coupled- cluster theory, its implementation, and exploitation in electronic wave- function determination; his account is primarily about the making of coupled- cluster theory rather than about the theory itself.  Relation to other theories = Configuration interaction  The Cj excitation operators defining the CI expansion of an N-electron system for the wave function \\\\Psi_0\\\\rangle, : \\\\Psi_0\\\\rangle = (1 + C) \\\\Phi_0\\\\rangle, : C = \\\\sum_{j=1}^N C_j, are related to the cluster operators T, since in the limit of including up to T_N in the cluster operator the CC theory must be equal to full CI, we obtain the following relationships : C_1 = T_1, : C_2 = T_2 + \\\\frac{1}{2} (T_1)^2, : C_3 = T_3 + T_1 T_2 + \\\\frac{1}{6} (T_1)^3, : C_4 = T_4 + \\\\frac{1}{2} (T_2)^2 + T_1 T_3 + \\\\frac{1}{2} (T_1)^2 T_2 + \\\\frac{1}{24} (T_1)^4, etc. For general relationships see J. Paldus, in Methods in Computational Molecular Physics, Vol. 293 of Nato Advanced Study Institute Series B: Physics, edited by S. Wilson and G. H. F. Diercksen (Plenum, New York, 1992), pp. 99‚Äì194.  Symmetry-adapted cluster  The symmetry-adapted cluster (SAC) approach determines the (spin- and) symmetry-adapted cluster operator : S = \\\\sum_I S_I by solving the following system of energy-dependent equations: : \\\\langle\\\\Phi (H - E_0) e^S \\\\Phi\\\\rangle = 0, : \\\\langle\\\\Phi_{i_1 \\\\ldots i_n}^{a_1 \\\\ldots a_n} (H - E_0) e^S \\\\Phi\\\\rangle = 0, : i_1 < \\\\cdots < i_n, \\\\quad a_1 < \\\\cdots where \\\\Phi_{i_1 \\\\ldots i_n}^{a_1 \\\\ldots a_n}\\\\rangle are the n-tuply excited determinants relative to \\\\Phi\\\\rangle (usually, in practical implementations, they are the spin- and symmetry-adapted configuration state functions), and M_s is the highest order of excitation included in the SAC operator. If all of the nonlinear terms in e^S are included, then the SAC equations become equivalent to the standard coupled- cluster equations of Ji≈ô√≠ ƒå√≠≈æek. This is due to the cancellation of the energy-dependent terms with the disconnected terms contributing to the product of H e^S, resulting in the same set of nonlinear energy-independent equations. Typically, all nonlinear terms, except \\\\tfrac{1}{2} S_2^2 are dropped, as higher-order nonlinear terms are usually small.  Use in nuclear physics  In nuclear physics, coupled cluster saw significantly less use than in quantum chemistry during the 1980s and 1990s. More powerful computers, as well as advances in theory (such as the inclusion of three-nucleon interactions), have spawned renewed interest in the method since then, and it has been successfully applied to neutron-rich and medium-mass nuclei. Coupled cluster is one of several ab initio methods in nuclear physics and is specifically suitable for nuclei having closed or nearly closed shells.

He was one of the founders, as well as the sole songwriter, of the band Bathory, which pioneered the black metal genre and is credited with creating the Viking metal style.Johannesson, Ika & Klingberg, Jon Jefferson. (2011) Blod Eld D√∂d - En svensk metalhistoria, Alfabeta Bokf√∂rlag AB, p. 51-68. A multi- instrumentalist, Quorthon wrote the music and lyrics on all of Bathory's albums and performed vocals and guitars.  Career  Quorthon formed Bathory in 1983 when he was 17 years old, after briefly playing in the Oi! band Stridskuk, which also featured drummer Johan \\"Jolle\\" Elv√©n and bass player Rickard \\"Ribban\\" Bergman, who later played on early Bathory demos and in the case of Bergman, albums. He recorded his early albums together with the help of his father B√∂rje Forsberg who was also the head of the Swedish record label Tyfon Grammofon that would go on to release most of Bathory's albums through the subsidiary Black Mark Production. The first album was recorded in the garage of schlager writer Peter Himmelstrand, dubbed Studio Heavenshore. During the mid-to-late 1980s, live performances by Bathory were rare. Albums from this period contributed to the then-burgeoning black metal subgenre, and rare photographs of the band helped in part to define its image. Beginning in the 1990s, Quorthon took full control of Bathory, choosing to forgo performing live in order to spend time recording music with hired musicians, as well changing style from the black metal of the 1980s to a slower, heavier style dubbed \\"Viking metal\\", due to its lyrics being focused on Norse mythology. From this point onward, he also played bass guitar on almost all of his albums, and mostly used a drum machine or a session drummer. Quorthon also personally paid for the production of Bathory's only music video, for the song \\"One Rode to Asa Bay\\", taken from their fifth studio album, Hammerheart. The video was shown on MTV's Headbanger's Ball, though Quorthon had not yet seen it at the time he was interviewed for the program. In 1993 Quorthon set Bathory aside and recorded and released two albums under the name \\"Quorthon\\". The first, called Album, was released in 1994. The final two solo releases emerged in 1997, Purity of Essence and the EP When Our Day Is Through. The albums released under the Quorthon moniker were more rock-oriented than Bathory's black/Viking metal style. While working on these albums he found new inspiration to continue composing music for Bathory. Bathory's next albums were in a retro-thrash metal style, before he veered towards his Viking metal style once again, especially on the Nordland saga.  Death  On 3 June 2004, Quorthon was found dead in his apartment in Stockholm, Sweden. The cause of his death was a congenital heart defect. He was 38 years old.

It is unsigned in and around Dallas, Texas. Its historic segment through South Dakota and Minnesota was decommissioned with the advent of I-29 but otherwise the route has been spared the decommissioning that has shortened other US Highways. The route has major freeway sections in Oklahoma City including the Broadway Extension connecting suburban Edmond to downtown Oklahoma City. Route description=Texas Looking south along US 77 in Milford, Texas The section between the Oklahoma‚ÄìTexas state line and Waco is mostly co-located with I-35 and the I-35E branch through Dallas, and where it is co-located, it is not signed. The two stretches in Texas that are not co-located are a stretch wholly within the city of Denton and a longer stretch from near Red Oak, to Hillsboro, the reason being that US 77 is a separate road between the two, serving the town of Waxahachie. As of 2004, US 77 Alternate has a northern terminus in Hallettsville, Texas. It rejoins US 77 at Refugio, Texas. While the main line of US 77 passes through Victoria, Alternate US 77 veers to the west to serve Yoakum and Cuero. The southern end extends from I-37 near Corpus Christi to Harlingen, where it merges with US 83 and runs through the cities of Harlingen, San Benito and Brownsville to its southern terminus at the United States/Mexico border. A section of US 77 located in the Giddings, Texas area is known as the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Highway. Another section of US 77, from I-37 to SH 44 in Nueces County, was redesignated I-69/US 77 in 2011. As of 2017, US 77 is being co-signed with I-35E as part of the reconstruction co-signed between Denton and I-635. Oklahoma In Oklahoma, US 77 runs north‚Äìsouth, paralleling I-35, connecting Texas to Kansas and running for through the central part of the state. It passes through many major cities, including Ardmore, Oklahoma City and Norman, Guthrie, and Ponca City. It has a freeway section, the Broadway Extension, connecting Oklahoma City to its northern suburb Edmond, in addition to sections that are co-flagged with I-35 and I-235.

From Nebraska to US 24 and from K-15 to Arkansas City, it is part of the National Highway System. Nebraska In Nebraska, US 77 is a major north‚Äìsouth artery connecting the capital city of Lincoln with outlying areas to the north and south. The highway is designated as the Homestead Expressway from Beatrice to I-80 at Lincoln. In Lincoln, US 77 becomes a full controlled-access expressway before it overlaps with I-80 for about . North of I-80, US 77 continues as an expressway to Wahoo, where it becomes a two-lane undivided road. It remains a two-lane highway except for two sections near Fremont, which are four-lane divided highways. The expressway north of Fremont is shared with US 275 and Nebraska Highway 91. US 275 and NE 91 separate from US 77 just south of Winslow, and US 77 continues north as a two-lane highway until it meets US 75 at Winnebago. The two highways run together to the junction of I=129 and US 20 at Dakota City, where US 75 breaks off and US 77 continues northward as a divided highway through South Sioux City before exiting the state via the Siouxland Veterans Memorial Bridge. Iowa US 77 barely enters Iowa. After crossing the Missouri River via the Veteran's Bridge at Sioux City, the highway ends at a diamond interchange with I-29. Its total length in Iowa is slightly more than . History US 77 previously extended north through South Dakota to Ortonville, Minnesota. It followed the current I-29 corridor up to the Toronto, South Dakota area, and then followed current South Dakota Highway 15 north to Milbank, South Dakota. After reaching Milbank, it traveled to the east, concurrently with US 12 to Ortonville, where it ended at an intersection with US 75\\\\. The segment between Milbank and Ortonville was decommissioned in 1966; the remaining South Dakota portion along with most of the highway's length in Iowa section was removed in October 1981.

Early life George Porteous was born in Douglas, Lanarkshire, Scotland on 7 April 1903. His family emigrated to Canada in 1910 and he attended secondary school in Saskatoon, going on to the University of Saskatchewan, where he was awarded BA in 1927. He began working for the YMCA as boys‚Äô work secretary in Saskatoon in 1922, later becoming an Army physical education instructor. At the outbreak of World War II he went with the 1st Canadian Division to England as a YMCA Auxiliary Service officer, returning later on to Canada to train others. War service In 1941 Porteous was posted with the Winnipeg Grenadiers to Hong Kong, to reinforce the British garrison. The regiment arrived just in time to be overwhelmed by invading Japanese forces, and Porteous was to spend a total of 44 months in one of the notorious prisoner of war camps, where he remained until the end of the war. In due course he was decorated as an MBE, Member of the Order of the British Empire, for his outstanding contribution in maintaining prisoner morale while imprisoned. Honours Porteous returned to Saskatoon after the war and was named executive director of the Saskatoon Community Chest. He was later awarded the Order of Canada in 1974 for dedication to community affairs, and was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of Saskatchewan, the Queen‚Äôs representative, on 3 March 1976, thus becoming that Province's 14th Lieutenant Governor. He died in office on 6 February 1978. Medical research An interesting insight into Porteous' experience is that from 1960 until his death in 1978 Porteous was an enthusiastic advocate of the medical benefits of niacin. Dr. Abram Hoffer had approached him to request that he recommend it to the senior citizens in the social housing development which Porteous administered. Hoffer believed large doses of niacin, up to six grams a day, could retard the development and even reverse senility, as it dilates the blood vessels, thus improving circulation. Porteous insisted he would not recommend anything to anyone which he had not first tried himself. For six months, he took the six grams a day and then recommended it to the senior citizens without reservation. As he told the Department of Veterans Affairs doctor on his next annual visit (he was on a 100% disability pension) that he had not felt as well since before the war; he could even touch his hands together above his head, not having been able to raise them above his shoulders before the treatment. He discovered that niacin had greatly relieved the severe arthritis and insomnia that had plagued him as a result of his wartime imprisonment and systematic starvation over a four-year period. He supported the use of this vitamin for all Canadian and US ex-prisoners of war suffering from similar symptoms.

The site, which included the Woolf Brothers and Volk Brothers department stores, was one of the busiest blocks in downtown Dallas. Adjacent blocks included the Neiman Marcus Building, Wilson Building, Titche-Goettinger Building and Mercantile National Bank Building. The entire block from Ervay to St. Paul was leveled to make way for the new tower. The original design as proposed by Johnson called for several office buildings, a hotel and a large shopping mall designed in an ornate classical style. MCorp Bank instead desired a more restrained office tower without any retail; the design for the banking hall was also scaled down.David Dillon. \\"PHILIP JOHNSON - The flamboyant architect has transformed skylines from New York to Houston.

Construction began in 1985 and the tower opened in 1987, with MCorp initially leasing of space after moving from the Mercantile National Bank Building. At time of completion it was the most legally- contested building on the Dallas skyline due to the economic downturn of the late 1980s and the savings and loan scandal. MCorp Bank collapsed shortly after the building's opening and the bank was dissolved by Bank One. Developers and financial backers sued over ownership of the tower. Other parties defaulted on loans, and the building went into foreclosure in 1991 and again in 1995, the two largest in city history.https://www.flickr.com/photos/fatguyinalittlecoat/3043650509/in/pool- dallasurbanhistory Without a lead tenant, the tower was remarketed into fully leasable class AA office space.

The setbacks carve a cross shape from the building's top section, but sheets of glass descending like a waterfall from the vaults continue the illusion to street level. * The first five floors contain a massive banking/stock exchange hall with a vaulted ceiling and skylight. * The building contains a 3 level underground parking garage and is connected to the Elm Street Garage, giving tenants 1,530 parking spaces. * Comerica Tower is a main hub in the Dallas Pedestrian Network and features several retail spaces below ground. * The east side of the building features a small plaza with a grid of trees and benches facing the Titche-Goettinger Building. * The building has been criticized heavily for its poor urban environment at street level. The lack of retail, block-long walls of polished granite and dark glass cause the tower to seem very formidable. The west side entrance plaza, located at one of the busiest corners in downtown Dallas, isolates the building from the street instead of acting like a true public space. At the time of opening, MCorp stated that the stolid exterior was intended. \\"We wanted a banking building, not an office building,' says MCorp chairman Gene Bishop. \\"We didn't want the block to be crowded.

Its members, the malacostracans, display a great diversity of body forms and include crabs, lobsters, crayfish, shrimp, krill, woodlice, amphipods, mantis shrimp and many other, less familiar animals. They are abundant in all marine environments and have colonised freshwater and terrestrial habitats. They are segmented animals, united by a common body plan comprising 20 body segments (rarely 21), and divided into a head, thorax, and abdomen. Etymology The name Malacostraca was coined by a French zoologist Pierre Andr√© Latreille in 1802. He was curator of the arthropod collection at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris. The name comes from the Greek roots (', meaning \\"soft\\") and (', meaning \\"shell\\"). The name is misleading, since the shell is only soft immediately after moulting, and is usually hard. Malacostracans are sometimes contrasted with entomostracans, a name applied to all crustaceans outside the Malacostraca, and named after the obsolete taxon Entomostraca. Description Leptostraca such as Nebalia bipes retain the primitive condition of having seven abdominal segments. The class Malacostraca includes about 40,000 species, and \\"arguably ... contains a greater diversity of body forms than any other class in the animal kingdom\\". Its members are characterised by the presence of three tagmata (specialized groupings of multiple segments) ‚Äì a five-segmented head, an eight-segmented thorax and an abdomen with six segments and a telson, except in the Leptostraca, which retain the ancestral condition of seven abdominal segments. Malacostracans have abdominal appendages, a fact that differentiates them from all other major crustacean taxa except Remipedia. Each body segment bears a pair of jointed appendages, although these may be lost secondarily. Tagmata The head bears two pairs of antennae, the first of which is often biramous (branching into two parts) and the second pair bear exopods (outer branches) which are often flattened into antennal scales known as scaphocerites. The mouthparts consist of pairs each of mandibles, maxillules (second pair of mouthparts) and maxillae. Usually a pair of stalked compound eyes is present, although in some taxa the eyes are unstalked, reduced or lost. Up to three thoracic segments may be fused with the head to form a cephalothorax; the associated appendages turn forward and are modified as maxillipeds (accessory mouthparts). A carapace may be absent, present or secondarily lost, and may cover the head, part or all of the thorax and some of the abdomen. It is variable in form and may be fused dorsally with some of the thoracic segments or occasionally be in two parts, hinged dorsally. Typically, each of the thoracic appendages is biramous and the endopods are the better developed of the branches, being used for crawling or grasping. Each endopod consist of seven articulating segments; the coxa, basis, ischium, merus, carpus, propodus and dactylus. In decapods, the claw is formed by the articulation of the dactylus against an outgrowth of the propodus. In some taxa, the exopods are lost and the appendages are uniramous. There is a clear demarcation between the thorax and the six or seven-segmented abdomen. In most taxa, each abdominal segment except the last carries a pair of biramous pleopods used for swimming, burrowing, gas exchange, creating a current or brooding eggs. The first and second abdominal pleopods may be modified in the male to form gonopods (accessory copulatory appendages). The appendages of the last segment are typically flattened into uropods, which together with the terminal telson, make up the \\"tail fan\\". It is the sudden flexion of this tail fan that provides the thrust for the rapid escape response of these crustaceans and the tail fan is also used in steering. In Leptostraca, the appendages on the telson instead form caudal rami (spine-like protrusions). Internal anatomy The digestive tract is straight and the foregut consists of a short oesophagus and a two-chambered stomach, the first part of which contains a gizzard-like \\"gastric mill\\" for grinding food. The walls of this have chitinous ridges, teeth and calcareous ossicles. The fine particles and soluble material are then moved into the midgut where chemical processing and absorption takes place in one or more pairs of large digestive caeca. The hindgut is concerned with water reclamation and the formation of faeces and the anus is situated at the base of the telson. Like other crustaceans, malacostracans have an open circulatory system in which the heart pumps blood into the hemocoel (body cavity) where it supplies the needs of the organs for oxygen and nutrients before diffusing back to the heart. The typical respiratory pigment in malacostracans is haemocyanin. Structures that function as kidneys are located near the base of the antennae. A brain exists in the form of ganglia close to the antennae, there are ganglia in each segment and a collection of major ganglia below the oesophagus. Sensory organs include compound eyes (often stalked), ocelli (simple eyes), statocysts and sensory bristles. The naupliar eye is a characteristic of the nauplius larva and consists of four cup-shaped ocelli facing in different directions and able to distinguish between light and darkness. Ecology Grapsus grapsus, a terrestrial crab Malacostracans live in a wide range of marine and freshwater habitats, and three orders have terrestrial members: Amphipoda (Talitridae), Isopoda (Oniscidea, the woodlice) and Decapoda (terrestrial hermit crabs, crabs of the families Ocypodidae, Gecarcinidae, and Grapsidae, and terrestrial crayfish). They are abundant in all marine ecosystems, and most species are scavengers, although some, such as the porcelain crabs, are filter feeders, and some, such as mantis shrimps, are carnivores. Life cycle Most species of malacostracans have distinct sexes (a phenomenon known as gonochorism), although a few species exhibit hermaphroditism. The female genital openings or gonopores are located on the sixth thoracic segment or its appendages, while the male gonopores are on the eighth segment or its appendages, or in a small number of species, on the seventh. The naupliar larval stages are often reduced and take place before hatching, but where they occur, a metamorphosis usually occurs between the larval and the adult forms. Primitive malacostracans have a free-swimming naupliar larval stage. Mating Mating behavior has been studied in the freshwater shrimp Caridina ensifera. Multiple paternity, common in the Malacostrica, also occurs in C. ensifera. Reproductive success of sires was found to correlate inversely with their genetic relatedness to the mother. This finding suggests that sperm competition and/or pre- and post-copulatory female choice occurs. Female choice may increase the fitness of progeny by avoiding inbreeding that can lead to expression of homozygous deleterious recessive mutations. Phylogenetics The monophyly of Malacostraca is widely accepted. This is supported by several common morphological traits which are present throughout the group and is confirmed by molecular studies. However, a number of problems make it difficult to determine the relationships between the orders of Malacostraca. These include differences in mutation rates in different lineages, different patterns of evolution being apparent in different sources of data, including convergent evolution, and long branch attraction. There is less agreement on the status of the subclass Phyllocarida with its single extant order, Leptostraca, depending on whether foliaceous (leaf-like) limbs have a single or multiple origin. Some authors advocate placing Phyllocarida in Phyllopoda, a group used in former classification systems, which would then include branchiopods, cephalocarids and leptostracans. A molecular study by American biologists Trisha Spears and Lawrence Abele concluded that phylogenetic evidence did not support the monophyly of this grouping, and that Phyllocarida should be regarded as a subclass of Malacostraca that had diverged from the main lineage at an early date. Subclass Phyllocarida Leptostraca is the only extant order of Phyllocarida, the other two orders, Archaeostraca and Hoplostraca being extinct. Leptostracans are thought to be the most primitive of the malacostracans and date back to the Cambrian period. They range in length from , most being suspension feeders though some are carnivores or scavengers. They have a two part carapace which encloses the head, the whole thorax and part of the abdomen and are the only malacostracans with seven abdominal segments. Three families are known with several genera and about twenty species. They are found worldwide from the intertidal zone to the deep ocean, all but one species being benthic (living on the seabed). Subclass Hoplocarida Squilla empusa, a mantis shrimp Stomatopoda is the only extant order of Hoplocarida, the other two orders, Aeschronectida and Archaeostomatopoda being extinct. Stomatopodans, commonly known as mantis shrimps, range in length from and are predators. They have a dorso-ventrally flattened body and a shield-like carapace and are armed with powerful, raptorial claws normally carried in a folded position. There are about 300 species, most living in tropical and subtropical seas although some live in temperate areas. They are benthic, mostly hiding in cracks and crevices or living in burrows, some emerging to forage while others are ambush predators. Subclass Eumalacostraca The Eumalocostraca contains the vast majority of the approximately 40,000 living species of malacostracans and consists of three superorders, Syncarida, Peracarida and Eucarida. Syncaridans are mostly small and found in freshwater and subterranean habitats. Peracaridans are characterised by having a marsupium in which they brood their young. They are found in marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats and include Amphipoda, Cumacea, Isopoda and Mysida. Eucarida includes lobsters, crabs, shrimps, prawns and krill. Fossil record The first malacostracans appeared sometime in the Cambrian, when animals belonging to the Phyllocarida appeared. Classification The following classification of living malacostracans is based on An Updated Classification of the Recent Crustacea (2001) by the American marine biologists Joel W. Martin, curator of crustaceans at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, and George E. Davies. Extinct orders have been added to this and are indicated by an obelisk (‚Ä†).

The word is a compound of (in this context: panel) and (building). Such buildings can and are most often found in housing development areas. Although are often considered to be typical of East Germany, the prefabricated construction method was used extensively in West Germany and elsewhere, particularly in public housing (see tower block). In English the building method is also called large panel system-building or LPS. History Prefabrication was pioneered in the Netherlands following World War I, based on construction methods developed in the United States. The first German use of plattenbau construction is what is now known as the Splanemann-Siedlung in Berlin's Lichtenberg district, constructed in 1926‚Äì1930. These two- and three-storey apartment houses were assembled of locally cast slabs, inspired by the Dutch Betondorp in Watergraafsmeer, a suburb of Amsterdam. In East Germany, Plattenbau areas have been designated as Neubaugebiet (\\"New development area\\"). Virtually all new residential buildings since the 1960s were built in this style, as it was a quick and relatively inexpensive way to curb the country's severe housing shortage, which had been caused by wartime bombing raids and the large influx of German refugees from further east. At the same time, many buildings from earlier eras had substantial drawbacks, such as coal heat, no hot running water, or bathrooms shared by multiple units. As these buildings fell into disrepair, many of their inhabitants moved into newer Plattenbau housing. Today, 'Plattenbau' are often no longer desirable, due in part to their rapid deterioration as a result of their cheap and quick construction methods, while older housing stock has undergone extensive renovation or been replaced with more modern dwelling units. There were several common plattenbau designs. The most common series was the P2, followed by the WBS 70, the WHH GT 18, and Q3A. The designs were flexible and could be built as towers or rows of apartments of various heights. West German Plattenbau in Munich-Neuperlach There have been projects with low rise \\"plattenbauten\\" such as the town of Bernau just north of Berlin. This town had an almost complete historic center of mainly wooden framed buildings within its preserved city walls. Most of these were torn down after 1975 and during the eighties to be replaced by 2‚Äì4 storey buildings constructed of prefabricated concrete slabs. This 'development' and 'modernization' is today regarded as disastrous, and an enormous cultural loss, with the town largely replaced by drab concrete buildings of exceeding mediocrity. To fit in with the medieval church and the almost complete city wall, the houses used rather small design units and decreased in height the farther away they were from the Church and the nearer they came to the city wall. A similar project was the Nikolaiviertel around the historic Nikolai church in Berlin's old centre. In the case of the Nikolaiviertel the buildings were made to look more historic. Plattenbau apartments were once considered highly desirable in East Germany, largely due to the lack of any other viable alternative. The main alternatives of the time were overcrowded, deteriorating prewar housing, often with wartime damage still visible, due to policies that chose not to repair the damaged housing stock. Since reunification a combination of decreasing population, renovation of older buildings, and construction of modern alternative housing has led to high vacancy rates, with some estimates placing the number of unoccupied units at around a million. Many plattenbau apartments were built in giant settlements, often on the edge of cities (such as Marzahn and Hellersdorf in Berlin and Halle-Neustadt), making them inconveniently located. Their inconvenient locations were likely also a factor in their rapid deterioration. However, despite the centrally located buildings of the International Building Exposition in Berlin, the neighbourhood today is not considered particularly desirable, and is characterised by deserted streets and apartment buildings isolated from one another in a lifeless garden. While some plattenbau apartments have been renovated to a high standard, some are being torn down, although a lack of funds means many have been left to become derelict, as without extensive renovation, the cheap and low-quality construction of the original buildings meant that after only a few years, they had become severely deteriorated. Because of the modular construction some are dismantled and moved to a new location. Eastern Berlin has many Plattenbauten: reminders of Eastern Bloc planned residential areas, with shops and schools in a ratio fixed to the number of residents. Berlin-based architect David Chipperfield has suggested that the plain appearance of Plattenbau housing does not promote gentrification, and may be a factor that helps preserve social continuity for local residents and neighborhoods.

In his book PiHKAL: A Chemical Love Story, Alexander Shulgin lists the dosage range as 10 to 30 mg. 2C-T-7 is generally taken orally, and produces psychedelic and entactogenic effects that last 8 to 15 hours. Up until Operation Web Tryp and three deaths, two of which involved the use of other drugs in addition to 2C-T-7, and one which involved an excessive insufflated dose, 2C-T-7 was sold commercially in Dutch and Japanese smartshops and online. It is known on the streets as Blue Mystic or 7th Heaven. There has been little real research done on this chemical other than Shulgin's comments in PiHKAL and a few small animal studies mostly aimed at detecting metabolites. Pharmacology The mechanism that produces the psychedelic and entactogenic effects of 2C-T-7 is most likely to result from action as a 5-HT2A serotonin receptor agonist in the brain, a mechanism of action shared by most currently-known hallucinogenic tryptamines and phenethylamines. Effects 2C-T-7 is psychedelic. In PiHKAL, Shulgin records that the hallucinations are unique, and that the chemical may cause muscle tension and an altered vocal quality. Deaths The Partnership for a Drug-Free America reports that 2C-T-7 can be lethal even in small doses; however, they provide no source for their claim and of the three known deaths of 2C-T-7 intoxicated individuals, all involved either excessive insufflated doses or the concomitant ingestion of other stimulants such as ephedrine and MDMA.

This reported dose was characterized as \\"excessive\\" by the US DEA. Legal status Around the year 2000, 2C-T-7 began to change from an obscure chemical to a drug used at parties and clubs in North America and Europe as it became available through a number of grey- market commercial vendors. This aroused the attention of the authorities, and many countries have since scheduled the chemical. Germany 2C-T-7 is scheduled in Germany.

Life and career Born Ruckstuhl in Breitenbach, Alsace, France, his family moved to St. Louis, Missouri, in 1855. He worked at a variety of unsatisfying jobs until his early twenties when an art exhibition in St. Louis inspired him to become a sculptor. He studied art locally, visited Paris and then worked for years as a toy store clerk to save enough to study in Paris for three years. In 1885, Ruckstull entered the Acad√©mie Julian, and studied under Gustave Boulanger, Camille Lef√®vre, Jean Dampt and Antonin Merci√©. He considered studying with Auguste Rodin, but claimed to be disgusted with his style. On returning to U.S. in 1892, Ruckstull opened a studio in New York City. His work Evening won the grand medal for sculpture at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. As a result of this national exposure, he was commissioned to make an equestrian statue of Major-General John F. Hartranft for the Pennsylvania State University. In 1893, Ruckstull was appointed to teach modeling and marble carving at the Metropolitan Museum of Art Schools in New York City.Finding aid for Schools of The Metropolitan Museum of Art Records (1879‚Äì1895). The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved 31 July 2014. He was also deeply involved with creating Confederate memorial sculpture, forging a sculptural iconography for the Southern ideology of the Lost Cause. Ruckstull was a founding member of the National Sculpture Society as well as the editor of the conservative magazine Art World, where he wrote under the pseudonym Petronius Arbiter, a reference to the Satyricon. In the spring of 1917, he wrote a manifesto inveighing against degenerate modernist art, where he attacked both the artworks and the artists, using racist tropes and the quasi- medical language of physiognomy to attack them. In 1925 he wrote the book Great Works of Art and What Makes Them Great, a collection of essays he had published previously, which has recently been reprinted. His sculpture was in the figurative Beaux-Arts style, with its realism, and detailed modeling. He and other prominent sculptors of the era such as Daniel Chester French championed the French style of studio system teaching, art societies, and exhibitions. Following the Armory Show of 1913, he continued to represent the old guard of academic sculpture, a perspective clearly expressed in his book. Ruckstull married in 1896 and had one son. He died in New York, four days after his 89th birthday, and was cremated.

As of 2010, it claimed branches in more than forty countries.. As of 2020, its president is Carlos Adelantado Pucha. New Acropolis has received criticisms for several decades, in particular about its alleged use of paramilitary structure and symbols, and the apparent influence of fascist models on them. Aims New Acropolis describes its founding principles as follows: According to the organization's 2018 assembly resolution, New Acropolis has \\"three lines of action\\": philosophy, culture and volunteering.  Teachings  The organization describes itself as a school of philosophy, which it defines as \\"a way of life [and] as a means of access to spiritual knowledge and collective and individual realization.\\" According to the organization's webpage, its official introduction program includes the philosophies of Buddhism, Tibet, China, Greece and Rome among others. The school also offers advanced studies in courses such as psychology, history of philosophy and symbology. An article published by the organization in The Parliamentary Review describes NA as an educational charity promoting the renewal of philosophy in the \\"classical tradition\\". Scholar of Western esotericism Antoine Faivre asserts that Jorge A. Livraga Rizzi wanted to create an \\"eclectic and rational approach\\" to Eastern and Western thought. In addition to the study of ancient sources, New Acropolis also tries to promote modern authors such as CG Jung, Mircea Eliade, Joseph Campbell, Gilbert Durand, Henry Corbin, Paul Ric≈ìur, Dane Rudhyar, Jean Chevalier, Jacob Boehm, Helena Petrovna Blavatsky and Edgar Morin. Among ancient authors it promotes in its literature are Pythagoras and Plato; it draws on Livraga's understanding of neoplatonism, Alexandrine hermeticism, renaissance philosophy, eastern philosophy (Hinduism and Tibetan Buddhism) as well. French writer Jean-Pierre Bayard describes New Acropolis as a school of philosophy focused on esotericism and symbolism. It is described by Clifton L. Holland as \\"a post- theosophical movement that combines elements from many sources: Theosophy, Esoteric thought, alchemy, astrology, and Eastern and Greek philosophy.\\" According to Peter B. Clarke, NA teaches a certain esoteric apocalypticism regarding the imminent Age of Aquarius which according to the group \\"will give rise to great pain and suffering at the outset\\". It has also been described as an spiritist group. Activities The organization reported in 2010 having around 10,000 members around the world, in more than forty countries. According to the organization, the governing board of the association is composed of a representative of each of its member associations, and it functions through a decentralized financial system. The organization's music competitions attract many participants, such as one in Peru which in 2018 attracted more than 6,000. The organization claimed that its 2018 commemoration of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, which took place in Mumbai, India, was endorsed by right-wing Indian Prime minister Narendra Modi, the Dalai Lama and Devendra Fadnavis. New Acropolis has been likewise promoting World Philosophy Day seminars around the world; its India branch was supported in this effort by UNESCO. Organization and structure According to 1976's Manual del Dirigente (Leader's Handbook) the organization's structure is pyramidal and hierarchical.Jorge Angel Livraga Rizzi (1976-09-01), Manual del Dirigente The highest level is the World Command, an office that once belonged to Livraga. Under the World Command is the Guardian of Seals, under it the Continental Commands, under these the Central Commands, followed by the National or Federal Councilors, the Unified Zone Commands and Branch Chiefs. The \\"Golden Ax\\" is used as a symbol given only to an elite of members known as \\"hachados\\" (ax holders) and this honor could only be given and taken away by the World Command. These hachados are proposed by the Central Commands due to their merits and are supposed to refrain from owning a fortune beyond their basic needs. The hachados can request retirement for reasons like age or health, and the organization should be responsible for their living in their final years. If the person retires as hachado can keep the honors but returns the ax, if the person status as hachado is revoked then the ax is return and destroyed. The handbook itself expresses in its page 3 that its content should be kept secret not only from the public but from every non-directive members of the organization. It also establishes that is valid for the leaders to hide their Acropolitan ideas, believes and concepts when speaking in public or adapt them to the listener's wishes, and that most of the symbols, salutes and customs of the organization should be kept secret as other political movements have used them in the past staining its image in the public eye. The Reglamento para miembros (Members‚Äô bylaws) of the organization establishes a series of norms for the participants including the obligation of at least 12 hours per month of voluntary work (although this can be increase if the person is sanctioned or if can't do the monthly payments), the prohibition of any kind of critic to the leaders and fellow members \\"to the former in any sense, to the later in their personal affairs\\", the requirement of the students to stand up anytime the teacher enters the room, the mandatory use of tie and jacket for men and skirts for women in all official events, and to refrain from any kind of immorality, among others. According to a former member in Mexico interviewed in 2014 by Vice, homosexuals are not allowed to be members of NA. New Acropolis in Medell√≠n, Colombia. Political ideology The organization has been accused of supporting neo-fascism and neo-Nazism. New Acropolis officially condemns Nazism, racism and political extremism, Professor Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke stated in 2003 that \\"the structure, organization and symbolism of the Nouvelle Acropole [New Acropolis] is clearly indebted to fascist models.\\" According to Jean-Marie Abgrall, \\"New Acropolis has borrowed elitist and Aryanist symbols and ideas.\\" As stated in 2010 by Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices : \\"The alleged use of paramilitary language, symbols, and forms of organization, along with more recent charges of brainwashing, have led to many criticisms of the New Acropolis in Europe, especially in France, since the mid-1970s.‚Äù The Theosophical Society, of which Livraga was a member before founding New Acropolis, officially denies any links to New Acropolis, saying that Livraga was expelled from the organization due to his connection with \\"extremism of the ultra right and Nazism\\". Cult status The French Commission on Cults (1995) as well as a Belgian parliamentary commission, have, in 1997, registered it as a cult in their respective countries, in an annexed blacklist to their report, along with 171 other associations. On May 27, 2005, the public cult blacklists were abandoned by the French government.La fin des listes noires (The end of blacklists), Le Point 23 June 2005 However Serge Blisko, director of the French Interministerial Mission for Monitoring and Combatting Cultic Deviances (MIVILUDES) said to Vice in 2014 that \\"the French government still considers New Acropolis a cult and it remains under surveillance\\".

MOM allows application modules to be distributed over heterogeneous platforms and reduces the complexity of developing applications that span multiple operating systems and network protocols. The middleware creates a distributed communications layer that insulates the application developer from the details of the various operating systems and network interfaces. APIs that extend across diverse platforms and networks are typically provided by MOM.Curry, Edward. 2004. \\"Message-Oriented Middleware\\". In Middleware for Communications, ed. Qusay H Mahmoud, 1-28. Chichester, England: John Wiley and Sons. . This middleware layer allows software components (applications, Enterprise JavaBeans, servlets, and other components) that have been developed independently and that run on different networked platforms to interact with one another. Applications distributed on different network nodes use the application interface to communicate. In addition, by providing an administrative interface, this new, virtual system of interconnected applications can be made reliable and secure. MOM provides software elements that reside in all communicating components of a client/server architecture and typically support asynchronous calls between the client and server applications. MOM reduces the involvement of application developers with the complexity of the master-slave nature of the client/server mechanism. Middleware categories *Remote Procedure Call or RPC-based middleware *Object Request Broker or ORB-based middleware *Message Oriented Middleware or MOM-based middleware All these models make it possible for one software component to affect the behavior of another component over a network. They are different in that RPC- and ORB-based middleware create systems of tightly coupled components, whereas MOM-based systems allow for a looser coupling of components. In an RPC- or ORB-based system, when one procedure calls another, it must wait for the called procedure to return before it can do anything else. In these synchronous messaging models, the middleware functions partly as a super-linker, locating the called procedure on a network and using network services to pass function or method parameters to the procedure and then to return results. Advantages Central reasons for using a message- based communications protocol include its ability to store (buffer), route, or transform messages while conveying them from senders to receivers. Another advantage of messaging provider mediated messaging between clients is that by adding an administrative interface, you can monitor and tune performance. Client applications are thus effectively relieved of every problem except that of sending, receiving, and processing messages. It is up to the code that implements the MOM system and up to the administrator to resolve issues like interoperability, reliability, security, scalability, and performance. Asynchronicity Using a MOM system, a client makes an API call to send a message to a destination managed by the provider. The call invokes provider services to route and deliver the message. Once it has sent the message, the client can continue to do other work, confident that the provider retains the message until a receiving client retrieves it. The message-based model, coupled with the mediation of the provider, makes it possible to create a system of loosely coupled components. MOM comprises a category of inter- application communication software that generally relies on asynchronous message-passing, as opposed to a request-response architecture. In asynchronous systems, message queues provide temporary storage when the destination program is busy or not connected. In addition, most asynchronous MOM systems provide persistent storage to back up the message queue. This means that the sender and receiver do not need to connect to the network at the same time (asynchronous delivery), and problems with intermittent connectivity are solved. It also means that should the receiver application fail for any reason, the senders can continue unaffected, as the messages they send will simply accumulate in the message queue for later processing when the receiver restarts. Routing Many message-oriented middleware implementations depend on a message queue system. Some implementations permit routing logic to be provided by the messaging layer itself, while others depend on client applications to provide routing information or allow for a mix of both paradigms. Some implementations make use of broadcast or multicast distribution paradigms. Transformation In a message-based middleware system, the message received at the destination need not be identical to the message originally sent. A MOM system with built-in intelligence can transform messages and route to match the requirements of the sender or of the recipient. In conjunction with the routing and broadcast/multicast facilities, one application can send a message in its own native format, and two or more other applications may each receive a copy of the message in their own native format. Many modern MOM systems provide sophisticated message transformation (or mapping) tools which allow programmers to specify transformation rules applicable to a simple GUI drag-and-drop operation. Disadvantages The primary disadvantage of many message-oriented middleware systems is that they require an extra component in the architecture, the message transfer agent (message broker). As with any system, adding another component can lead to reductions in performance and reliability, and can also make the system as a whole more difficult and expensive to maintain. In addition, many inter- application communications have an intrinsically synchronous aspect, with the sender specifically wanting to wait for a reply to a message before continuing (see real-time computing and near-real-time for extreme cases). Because message-based communication inherently functions asynchronously, it may not fit well in such situations. That said, most MOM systems have facilities to group a request and a response as a single pseudo-synchronous transaction. With a synchronous messaging system, the calling function does not return until the called function has finished its task. In a loosely coupled asynchronous system, the calling client can continue to load work upon the recipient until the resources needed to handle this work are depleted and the called component fails. Of course, these conditions can be minimized or avoided by monitoring performance and adjusting message flow, but this is work that is not needed with a synchronous messaging system. The important thing is to understand the advantages and liabilities of each kind of system. Each system is appropriate for different kinds of tasks. Sometimes, a combination of the two kinds of systems is required to obtain the desired behavior. Standards Historically, there was a lack of standards governing the use of message-oriented middleware that has caused problems. Most of the major vendors have their own implementations, each with its own application programming interface (API) and management tools. One of the long-standing standards for message oriented middleware is X/Open group's XATMI specification (Distributed Transaction Processing: The XATMI Specification) which standardizes API for interprocess communications. Known implementations for this API is ATR Baltic's Enduro/X middleware and Oracle's Tuxedo. The Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) is an approved OASIS1.0 Becomes OASIS Standard. AMQP (2012-10-31). Retrieved on 2014-05-23. and ISO standard that defines the protocol and formats used between participating application components, so implementations are interoperable. AMQP may be used with flexible routing schemes, including common messaging paradigms like point-to- point, fan-out, publish/subscribe, and request-response (note that these are intentionally omitted from v1.0 of the protocol standard itself, but rely on the particular implementation and/or underlying network protocol for routing). It also supports transaction management, queuing, distribution, security, management, clustering, federation and heterogeneous multi-platform support. Java applications that use AMQP are typically written in Java JMS. Other implementations provide APIs for C#, C++, PHP, Python, Ruby, and other languages. The High-Level Architecture (HLA IEEE 1516) is an IEEE and SISO standard for simulation interoperability. It defines a set of services, provided through an API in C++ or Java. The services offer publish/subscribe based information exchange, based on a modular Federation Object Model. There are also services for coordinated data exchange and time advance, based on logical simulation time, as well as synchronization points. Additional services provide transfer of ownership, data distribution optimizations and monitoring and management of participating Federates (systems). The MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is an ISO standard (ISO/IEC PRF 20922) supported by the OASIS organization. It provides a lightweight publish/subscribe reliable messaging transport protocol on top of TCP/IP suitable for communication in M2M/IoT contexts where a small code footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium. The Object Management Group's Data Distribution Service (DDS) provides message-oriented Publish/Subscribe (P/S) middleware standard that aims to enable scalable, real-time, dependable, high performance and interoperable data exchanges between publishers and subscribers.Data Distribution Service for Real-time Systems (DDS), Object Management Group, version 1.2, January 2007 The standard provides interfaces to C++, C++11, C, Ada, Java and Ruby. The eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is a communications protocol for message-oriented middleware based on XML (Extensible Markup Language). Designed to be extensible, the protocol has also been used for publish-subscribe systems, signalling for VoIP, video, file transfer, gaming, Internet of Things applications such as the smart grid, and social networking services. Unlike most instant messaging protocols, XMPP is defined in an open standard and uses an open systems approach of development and application, by which anyone may implement an XMPP service and interoperate with other organizations' implementations. Because XMPP is an open protocol, implementations can be developed using any software license; although many server, client, and library implementations are distributed as free and open-source software, numerous freeware and commercial software implementations also exist. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) formed an XMPP working group in 2002 to formalize the core protocols as an IETF instant messaging and presence technology. The XMPP Working group produced four specifications (RFC 3920, RFC 3921, RFC 3922, RFC 3923), which were approved as Proposed Standards in 2004. In 2011, RFC 3920 and RFC 3921 were superseded by RFC 6120 and RFC 6121 respectively, with RFC 6122 specifying the XMPP address format. In addition to these core protocols standardized at the IETF, the XMPP Standards Foundation (formerly the Jabber Software Foundation) is active in developing open XMPP extensions. XMPP-based software is deployed widely across the Internet, according to the XMPP Standards Foundation, and forms the basis for the Department of Defense (DoD) Unified Capabilities Framework. The Java EE programming environment provides a standard API called JMS (Java Message Service), which is implemented by most MOM vendors and aims to hide the particular MOM API implementations; however, JMS does not define the format of the messages that are exchanged, so JMS systems are not interoperable. A similar effort is with the actively evolving OpenMAMA project, which aims to provide a common API, particularly to C clients. However, at the moment (August 2012) it is primarily appropriate for distributing market-oriented data (e.g. stock quotes) over pub-sub middleware. Message queuing Message queues allow the exchange of information between distributed applications. A message queue can reside in memory or disk storage. Messages stay in the queue until the time they are processed by a service consumer. Through the message queue, the application can be implemented independently - they do not need to know each other's position, or continue to implement procedures to remove the need for waiting to receive this message.

Early life John Porteous was born at The Glen, Quair Water, near Traquair, in the Borders, the son of Stephen Porteous, a tailor of the Canongate, Edinburgh. Little is known of his early life, except that he soon found he was not suited to his father's calling. Having served in the Scots Brigade in the United Netherlands, in 1716 he became drill master to the Edinburgh force in anticipation of a Jacobite rising, and two years later was appointed as ensign to the City Guard, and was promoted in 1726 to the rank of captain. Porteous seems to have been an overbearing official, despised by the mob and the underclasses of Edinburgh society. Riot James Drummond On 14 April 1736, three convicted smugglers, Andrew Wilson, William Hall and George Robertson, were arrested, tried and condemned to death. Hall's sentence was commuted to transportation for life, while Wilson and Robertson awaited their fate. A few days before the execution, George Robertson managed to escape by widening the space between the window bars of his cell and, with the help of sympathetic supporters, eventually made his way to the Dutch Republic. The remaining convict, Andrew Wilson, was taken to be publicly hanged in the Grassmarket, Edinburgh, on 14 April 1736. His body was cut down against the wishes of the mob, and the ensuing riot was such that the hangman had to be placed in protective custody. As the situation worsened, for fear of an attempt to rescue the victims, the Lord Provost of Edinburgh instructed Captain Porteous to call out the entire guard and to furnish them with powder and shot. After the execution, the mob became violent and began to stone the City Guard. Accounts of events are confused, but what is certain is that Porteous instructed his men to fire above the heads of the crowd, but in so doing, they wounded people in the windows of the high tenement buildings opposite. The crowd became increasingly violent and, as panic set in, Captain Porteous ordered the guard to shoot into the mob, which led to the deaths of six people in all. Trial and appeal Porteous was arrested the same afternoon and charged with murder. He was tried at the High Court of Justiciary on 5 July 1736, where a majority of witnesses testified that Porteous had personally fired into the crowd on 14 April, although sixteen others said they had not seen him do so. Feelings were running high in Edinburgh and the jury unanimously found Porteous guilty of murder. He was sentenced to death, the execution was set to take place in the Grassmarket on 8 September 1736. Porteous was imprisoned in the Tolbooth prison, near St Giles church. Events in Scotland alarmed the government in London, and Sir Robert Walpole attempted to influence events by asking his representative in Edinburgh to become involved. But he had miscalculated, underestimating the depth of feeling in Scotland. A formal appeal was petitioned and the execution was deferred. Death A plaque marks the spot where the lynching took place However, public resentment at a possible reprieve was such that a plot to murder Captain Porteous was hatched, and when the authorities heard of this, it was decided to increase the guard at the Tolbooth prison. However, on the evening before this was due to happen, a large crowd of over four thousand gathered at Portsburgh, west of the city. Making their way across the Grassmarket to the Cowgate and up the High Street, the mob converged on the Tolbooth, where they were eventually able to overpower the guards. Porteous was dragged from his cell and up the Lawnmarket towards the West Bow and the Grassmarket, where he was lynched from a dyer's pole, using a rope taken from a local draper's shop. After a short while, he was dragged down and stripped of his nightgown and shirt, which was then wrapped around his head before he was hauled up again. However, the mob had not tied his hands and, as he struggled free, they broke his arm and shoulder, while another attempted to set light to his naked foot. He was taken down a further time and cruelly beaten before being hung up again. He died a short while later, just before midnight on 7 September 1736. The spot where Porteous died is today marked by a memorial plate in the Grassmarket. The site of the Tolbooth is marked by paving stones arranged in the form of a heart, \\"The Heart of Midlothian\\". Tour guides will say that, even today, passers-by will spit on the spot, a tradition originally intended to demonstrate their contempt for the hated Tolbooth. Porteous was buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh, on 9 September,Monuments and monumental inscriptions in Scotland: The Grampian Society, 1871 near the westmost wall of the original graveyard. For more than two hundred years, the grave was marked by a small square stone with the single letter P and the date 1736. In 1973, this was replaced with a headstone of Craigleith stone, bearing the inscription \\"John Porteous, a captain of the City Guard of Edinburgh, murdered September 7, 1736. All Passion Spent, 1973\\". Aftermath The events in Edinburgh heightened the sense of alarm in London, where the government was concerned about the threat to its management of Scotland. It was thought by Walpole, Queen Caroline and the Duke of Newcastle that Porteous had been unnecessarily sacrificed and there were even rumours that the conspiracy had involved the local city magistrates. Various Opposition proposals to disband the city guard and debar the Lord Provost were put forward, and these were the subject of much debate ‚Äì the Scottish MPs and the government strongly opposed these proposals for constitutional reasons, and nothing was ever done. Porteous's grave It was variously thought that Porteous' murder was carried out by friends of those who had been shot and killed, revenge by the smugglers, a Jacobite plot, or even a conspiracy by Presbyterian extremists. However, the organisation of events seems to imply a degree of planning, thought to be the work of James Maxwell, an Edinburgh journeyman carpenter, together with a small group of city tradesmen and journeymen. Despite a reward of ¬£200 offered by the government for information, those responsible for the murder of Porteous were never brought to justice. The events surrounding the Porteous Riots form part of the early chapters of the novel The Heart of Mid- Lothian by Sir Walter Scott (1818), where they are recorded in graphic detail. Porteous and golf John Porteous had been an early exponent of the game of golf. It is recorded that in 1724, \\"A solemn match of golf: between the Hon. Alexander Elphinstone and John Porteous became the first match to be reported in a newspaper. Both players were said to have exhibited great skill, and such was the interest in the match that it was attended by James, Duke of Hamilton and George, Earl of Morton, as well as a large crowd of spectators. The wager was twenty guineas, with Elphinstone winning the match.

The SFO is accountable to the Attorney General for England and Wales, and was established by the Criminal Justice Act 1987, an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1987 grants the SFO special compulsory powers to require any person (or business/bank) to provide any relevant documents (including confidential ones) and answer any relevant questions including ones about confidential matters. The SFO is the principal enforcer of the Bribery Act 2010, which has been designed to encourage good corporate governance and enhance the reputation of the City of London and the UK as a safe place to do business. Its jurisdiction does not extend to Scotland where fraud and corruption are investigated by Police Scotland through their Specialist Crime Division, and prosecutions are undertaken by the Economic Crime Unit of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service. History=Formation of the unit During the 1970s and early 1980s a series of financial scandals in the City of London destroyed the public's trust in the way serious or complex frauds were handled. In response to this the Government established the Fraud Trials Committee in 1983. This independent committee, under the chairmanship of Lord Roskill, considered how changes to the law and criminal proceedings could lead to more effective ways of fighting fraud. The committee report, commonly known as 'the Roskill Report'The Roskill Report 25 years on SFO blog 13 April 2011 was published in 1986. Its main recommendation was to set up a new, unified organisation responsible for detecting, investigating and prosecuting serious fraud cases. As a result, the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) and its unique powers were created by the Criminal Justice Act 1987. It opened for business in April 1988. The SFO also enforces the UK Bribery Act 2010.  List of directors  # John Wood CB (1988‚Äì1990) # Dame Barbara Mills QC (1990‚Äì1992) # George Staple CB QC (1992‚Äì1997) # Rosalind Wright CB QC (1997‚Äì2003) # Robert Wardle (2003‚Äì2008) # Richard Alderman (2008‚Äì2012) # Sir David Green CB QC (2012‚Äì2018) # Lisa Osofsky (2018‚Äì present) Al-Yamamah investigation The Al-Yamamah arms deal during the 1980s was a large scale aircraft and weapons deal between the UK and Saudi Arabia. It was extended throughout the 1990s and saw thousands of UK citizens living and working in Saudi Arabia representing ¬£40bn worth of business. BAE Systems Plc was the primary contractor. In 2004 the SFO began to investigate the contracts within the al-Yamamah deal on the grounds of suspected false accounting, but the investigation was controversially dropped in 2006. The decision was made following concerns about national securityBAE Systems Plc/Saudi Arabia SFO 14 December 2006 amidst reports that the Saudi Government would stop sharing counterterrorist information with the UK if the investigation continued. This drew criticism from number of sources, not least from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). A High Court review in 2008 ruled that the SFO had acted unlawfully by dropping the corruption investigationUK wrong to halt Saudi arms probe SFO 10 April 2008 but was later overturned on appeal by the SFO to the House of Lords. Comparison to New York In 2008, an official internal \\"Review of the Serious Fraud Office\\", which was conducted by a former senior New York City prosecutor, compared the SFO unfavourably with two of its counterparts in New York City: the offices of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the New York County District Attorney. It found that the American prosecutors obtained higher conviction rates in a shorter amount of time with fewer resources. It also found that the SFO had significantly lower conviction rates than elite divisions of the UK Crown Prosecution Service. It attributed the SFO's relatively poor performance to, among other things, failure to keep all court advocacy \\"in-house\\", failure to assign each case a single lawyer who managed it \\"from cradle to grave\\", failure to interview witnesses at an early stage, and failure to co-operate closely with the police. 2010s While Home Secretary, Theresa May expressed that she wanted the National Crime Agency (NCA) to absorb the SFO. While the SFO is supervised by the Attorney General's Office, the NCA is overseen by Home Office. From around 2005 to 2017, the SFO underwent a series of budget cuts. On 18 May 2017, the Tories released a manifesto pledging to dismantle the Serious Fraud Office and roll it into the NCA if they won the general elections in June 2017. The manifesto claimed that the incorporation would \\"strengthen Britain‚Äôs response to white collar crime by... improving intelligence sharing and bolstering the investigation of serious fraud, money laundering and financial crime.\\" Notable cases=Guinness share-trading fraud In 1986 there were rumours that the Guinness Brewery takeover of the Distillers Company was tainted by an unlawful share support operation which involved Guinness offering secret indemnities (from its own funds) against losses to people 'supporting' the bid which resulted in a dramatic rise in the price of Guinness shares. Having examined the bid, the SFO opened an investigation which led to the conviction in 1990 of the then chief executive of Guinness and three other defendants. BAE Systems weapons sales to Saudi Arabia Al Yamamah is the name of a series of a record arms sales by the United Kingdom to Saudi Arabia. In 2006, an investigation by the British Serious Fraud Office into the deal was discontinued after political pressure from the Saudi and British governments. BAE Systems radar sale to Tanzania In 1999 British Aerospace Defence Systems Ltd agreed a contract with the Government of Tanzania for the supply of a radar defence system. A local businessman in Tanzania was recruited to advise BAE on its negotiations with the Government on the radar contract. Between January 2000 and December 2005 around $12.4 million was paid to the local businessman's two companies. BAE has accepted that there was a high probability that part of this sum would be used to favour it in the contract negotiations with the Tanzanian Government. The payments were not subject to proper and adequate scrutiny or review and BAE Systems Plc was subsequently fined ¬£500,000 after admitting that it had failed to keep adequate accounting records of the defence contract with the Government of Tanzania. This outcome followed a settlement by BAE, as part of a global agreement reached in 2010 with the Serious Fraud Office and the US Department of Justice, concerning contracts in a number of countries. The settlement with the SFO relates to the Tanzanian contract. The terms of the settlement include an agreement by BAE to pay an ex-gratia sum (¬£30 million less any fine imposed by the Crown Court) for the benefit of the people of Tanzania. BAE was also ordered to pay ¬£225,000 costs to the SFO. Barclays emergency fundraising In June 2017, John Varley, Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris and Richard Boath were charged with offences regarding Barclays's raising of ¬£11.8 billion in emergency funds. The fraud was alleged to have taken place around the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008. Abbas Gokal & the BCCI The BCCI Bank was a Luxembourg-registered bank that collapsed in 1992. It was discovered by the bank's auditors, that the bank was running on loss for many years. It was reported that the bank was involved in drug- trafficking, money-laundering and phony loans. The key player in the collapse was Pakistani shipping magnate Abbas Gokal. It was discovered that Gokal's company, Gulf Shipping Lines, had gotten a US$1.2 billion unsecured loan from the bank. When the bank collapsed and the scandal emerged, Gokal escaped to Pakistan. It was hard to get him because the United Kingdom and Pakistan had no extradition treaty. Gokal was making a trip to America in 1994. When his plane stopped for re-fueling in Frankfurt, German police arrested him and extradited him to the United Kingdom. He was handed a 14-year sentence as a result of the SFO prosecution, the longest sentence handed out in a British court for fraud. Mykola Zlochevsky In April 2014, the SFO launched a money laundering investigation against Ukrainian oligarch Mykola Zlochevsky. Accounts of Burisma Holdings and its parent Brociti Investments, controlled by Zlochevsky, were frozen at the London branch of BNP Paribas. That money US$23 million was transferred as a result of complex transactions by a company controlled by a Ukrainian businessman Serhiy Kurchenko, a subject of the European Union restrictive measures. When the Ukrainian prosecutor general's office failed to provide documents needed for the investigation, a British court in January 2015 dropped the case and ordered to unfreeze the assets. Organisation As one of the Law Officers' Departments, the SFO reports to the Attorney General of the UK. The SFO is unique in that its role is to both investigate and prosecute. Its case teams are therefore made up of investigators, lawyers, law clerks and forensic accountants. The SFO employs around 500 people. The cost of running the SFO in the financial year 2010‚Äì11 was 64p for each member of the British public. Over 80 per cent of staff are specialist caseworkers. When deciding what action to take, lawyers in the SFO must bear in mind the Prosecutors Code. Activities and responsibilities The SFO is a specialist organisation that investigates only the most serious types of economic crime. As a result, a potential case must meet certain criteria before it is taken on. In deciding, the Director will take into account all the circumstances of the case and consider: * cases which undermine UK commercial/financial PLC in general and the City of London in particular; * cases where the actual or potential loss involved are high; * cases where actual or potential harm is significant; * cases where there is a very significant public interest element; and * new species of fraud The Serious Fraud Office's jurisdiction does not extend to Scotland where fraud and corruption are investigated by Police Scotland through their Specialist Crime Division, and prosecutions are undertaken by the Economic Crime Unit of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service. Fraud The SFO investigates and prosecutes fraud. The SFO prosecutes different types of fraud, including investment fraud. Among the types of investment fraud prosecuted are boiler room fraud (share scams), which is an operation, usually run from abroad, where scammers typically cold-call people and use hard-sell tactics to sell shares that prove worthless, are inflated in price, or don't exist. The SFO cites Vintage Wines of St Albans as an example of a successful boiler room fraud prosecution. The SFO also prosecutes the investment schemes called 'Ponzi' or pyramid schemes, which typically involves an investment offer which promises to provide an abnormally higher rate of return. In a Ponzi scheme, a single operator benefits, while in a pyramid scheme, many investors benefit from recruiting other investors. The SFO has cited the KF Concept case as an example of one of its successful ponzi scheme prosecutions, where a banker was jailed for 10 years for running an unauthorized investment business and defrauding investors of amounts over ¬£17 million. The SFO also prosecutes multiple types of corporate fraud. The SFO website as of 2013 outlined several types of fraud it classified as corporate, including asset stripping, which involved company directors taking company funds or assets of value while leaving behind the debts. Other types of prosecuted corporate fraud include fraudulent trading, where a company carries on a business for any fraudulent purposes. An example of a successful SFO prosecution for fraudulent trading is the InterGB group, the collective name for a number of companies that, between 1996 and 2000, extracted more than ¬£85 million from three financial institutions by submitting false invoices. The chairman of the group was jailed for seven years. Also prosecuted are share ramping. Also known as 'pump and dump' or 'book ramping', is where criminals influence the share price of a company and then take advantage of the price fluctuations. Publishing false information is also prosecuted as corporate crime. According to the SFO, this is usually done to mislead investors and creditors and to keep a failing company trading. Bribery and corruption According to the SFO, corruption is where the integrity of a person, Government, or company is manipulated and compromised for personal gain. SFO classifies and prosecutes two main types of corruption. It defines political corruption as the dysfunction of a political system or institution in which government officials, political officials or employees look for illegitimate personal gain through actions such as bribery, extortion, cronyism, patronage and embezzlement. It defines corporate corruption as where, for example, bribes are offered to agencies/ institutions/individuals in order to win a contract. It brought up Innospec Limited, manufacturers of a fuel additive, as an example of a successful prosecution for corporate corruption. Overseas assistance The SFO has a dedicated International Assistance team which regularly assists law enforcement agencies worldwide with their investigations. In 2010‚Äì11 the SFO assisted over 30 different jurisdictions. Victim support According to the SFO, victims are at the core of its strategy. They include any person, organisation, or Government both in the UK and abroad, which has suffered direct financial loss from the most serious and complex fraud, or corruption. The SFO tries to get justice for victims by recovering as much recompense as possible for victims. In April 2011, ¬£64 million of funds were, or were due to be returned to victims. The average jail sentence handed out in SFO cases was 56 months in 2010-11. For example, in 2011 three fraudsters running the online Xclusive ticket fraud (that failed to deliver tickets to the Beijing Olympics and various music festivals) each received prison sentences of up to eight years. The SFO started confiscation proceedings to recover money for victims.

Background and training Born in Le Creusot, France, Claudie Haigner√© studied medicine at the Facult√© de M√©decine (Paris-Cochin) and Facult√© des Sciences (Paris-VII). She went on to obtain certificates in biology and sports medicine (1981), aviation medicine and space medicine (1982), and rheumatology (1984). In 1986 she received a diploma in the biomechanics and physiology of movement (1986) and received her doctorates in rheumatology (1984) and neuroscience (1992). Space career Haigner√© (right) aboard the International Space Station. Out of 10,000 candidates, France's space center selected only six men, and one woman: Claudie Haigner√©. She first qualified as an engineer and emergency pilot to the Space Shuttle. She first served as a back-up crew member for the 1993 Mir Alta√Ør mission in which her future husband Jean-Pierre Haigner√© participated. The asteroid 135268 Haigner√© is named in their combined honour. In 1994, Claudie Haigner√© began training at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City, Russia for the Franco-Russian Cassiop√©e mission and learned Russian during her time there. On August 17, 1996, she became the first French woman to go to space as she and two Russian cosmonauts, commander Valery Korzun and flight engineer Aleksandr Kaleri, launched into space aboard the Soyuz TM-24 on the Russian-French Cassiop√©e mission. While on the mission, visited the Mir space station for 16 days and she conducted comprehensive experiments in the fields of physiology and development biology, fluid physics, and technology. In 1999, Haigner√© commanded a Soyuz capsule during reentry and became the first woman qualified to do so. As the flight engineer on Soyuz TM-33 in 2001, she became the first European woman to visit the International Space Station. After the mission, Claudie Haigner√© continued her involvement in space science by attending scientific workshops and conferences. She also contributed to data analysis and constructions for the scientific programs of future projects. She eventually retired from ESA on June 18, 2002.

It has been awarded the best global export credit agency for 2019. In 1920, UKEF had a maximum total exposure of just ¬£26mn. Today, its maximum commitment stands at ¬£50bn. It is also celebrating its 100th anniversary as the longest running export credit agency in the world. Activities ECGD derives its powers from the Export and Investment Guarantees Act 1991 and undertakes its activities in accordance with a specific consent from HM Treasury. ECGD was established in 1919 to promote UK exports lost during the submarine blockade of World War I. ECGD's aim is to benefit the UK economy by helping exporters of UK goods and services to win business, and UK firms to invest overseas, by providing guarantees, insurance and reinsurance against loss, taking into account HM Government's wider international policy agenda. ECGD is required by HM Government to operate on a slightly better than break-even basis, charging exporters premiums at levels that match the perceived risks and costs in each case. The largest part of ECGD's activities involves underwriting long term loans to support the sale of capital goods, principally for the export of aircraft, bridges, machinery and services; it helps UK companies take part in major overseas projects such as the construction of oil and gas pipelines and the upgrading of hospitals, airports and power stations. Support can be given for contracts as low as ¬£1,000, but some of the projects ECGD backs go well beyond the ¬£1 billion mark. As part of its risk management process, ECGD has to make a judgement on the ability of a country to meet its debt obligations. The department uses a ‚Äòproductive expenditure‚Äô test, undertaken in consultation with the Department for International Development, that makes sure that the countries defined as heavily indebted poor countries and those exclusively dependent on International Development Association financing only get official export credits from the UK for projects that help social and economic development without creating a new unsustainable debt burden. ECGD continues to check that the proposed borrowing is sustainable. Criticisms of ECGD The ECGD has been the subject of criticism by UK-based NGOs; The Corner House has claimed that the ECGD has in effect provided public subsidy for bribery; Campaign Against Arms Trade has argued that the ECGD provides excessive levels of support for arms sales; Jubilee Debt Campaign has argued that the cancellation of debts owed to the ECGD should not be counted towards UK Official Development Assistance figures; World Wide Fund for Nature argues that excessive greenhouse gases are emitted from ECGD-supported projects and that this is inconsistent with wider UK environmental policy. In recent years, ECGD has been heavily criticised for prioritising investment in fossil fuels over renewable energy. A Catholic Agency For Overseas Development report showed that from 2010 to 2017, an estimated 97% of ECGD energy-related support went to fossil fuel development, principally oil and gas exploration and production in upper-middle-income countries. Just 3% went to renewables. The Guardian reported that in the 2018‚Äì2019 financial year alone, ECGD committed nearly ¬£2 billion in support to fossil fuel projects across the world. A Parliamentary inquiry called on ECGD to stop funding fossil fuel projects by the end of 2021, citing that the scale of fossil fuel support violated the UK's obligations under the Paris Agreement. Weapons exports While in the early years of the decade the proportion of ECGD's business in support of weapons exports ranged from 30% to 50%, this has now declined to under 1% in 2009‚Äì10. ECGD seeks advice on arms sales from the United Kingdom Export Control Organisation (ECO), part of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. All applications are assessed, on a case-by-case basis, against the consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing criteria. The ECO's advice is not always followed by the government though. In February 2016, the head of the Export Control Organisation Edward Bell advised business secretary Sajid Javid that Britain should suspend arms sales to Saudi Arabia. This advice was not followed by the business secretary and prime minister. ECGD's anti bribery-and-corruption procedures ECGD aims to: * deter illegal payments, corrupt practices and money laundering by applicants for ECGD's support; and * ensure, as far as is practicable, that all transactions that ECGD supports do not place ECGD in breach of any UK or European legislation or place the UK in contravention of any international agreements to which the UK is a party. It does this through the public information it provides and the declarations in its application forms; it has some powers to make enquiries but these are limited. ECGD does not have a formal investigative capacity. Key aspects of ECGD's anti-bribery and corruption procedures are to: * Require applicants to provide copies of their codes of conduct and to confirm that they have applied them in tendering for the award of the contract for which ECGD's support is sought; * Obtain information with a view to ascertaining whether any improper payments involving agents have been made; * Inspect, if necessary, exporters' documents relating to winning contracts and making payments to agents; * Remind applicants of their obligations to comply with UK anti-corruption legislation; * Remind applicants that ECGD will refer all allegations of bribery, corruption or money laundering to the appropriate authorities; * Require applicants to declare that neither they nor any of their directors have admitted to, or been convicted of, engaging in any form of bribery or corruption; * Require applicants to disclose whether they, or anyone acting on their behalf, is under charge in a UK court for bribery of a foreign public official; * Require each applicant to make reasonable enquiries concerning any of its subsidiary companies, agents or consortium partners who, in each case, are involved in the contract for which ECGD's support is sought and to confirm that, on the basis of those reasonable enquiries, the applicant has no cause to believe that any of those parties, or any of their directors, has admitted to, or been convicted of, engaging in any corrupt activity; and * Require each applicant to confirm that neither the applicant nor anyone acting on the applicant's behalf has engaged in corrupt activity in relation to the contract for which ECGD's support is sought.

It works in over 100 countries: promoting a wider knowledge of the United Kingdom and the English language (and the Welsh language in Argentinahttps://wales.britishcouncil.org/en/programmes/education/welsh- language-project); encouraging cultural, scientific, technological and educational co-operation with the United Kingdom. The British Council is governed by a Royal Charter. It is also a public corporation and an executive nondepartmental public body (NDPB), sponsored by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Its headquarters are near Trafalgar Square. Its Chairman is Stevie Spring, its CEO is Sir Ciar√°n Devane and its Chief Operating Officer is Andy Williams. History *1934: British Foreign Office officials created the \\"British Committee for Relations with Other Countries\\" to support English education abroad, promote British culture and fight the rise of fascism. The name quickly became British Council for Relations with Other Countries. *1936: The organisation's name was officially shortened to the British Council. *1938: The British Council opens its first four offices in Bucharest (Romania), Cairo (Egypt), Lisbon (Portugal) and Warsaw (Poland).\\"About us\\", British Council, Portugal. the offices in Portugal are currently the oldest in continuous operation in the world. *1940: King George VI granted the British Council a Royal Charter for promoting \\"a wider knowledge of [the United Kingdom] and the English language abroad and developing closer cultural relations between [the UK] and other countries\\". *1942: The British Council undertook a promotion of British culture overseas. The music section of the project was a recording of significant recent compositions by British composers: E.J. Moeran's Symphony in G minor was the first work to be recorded under this initiative, followed by recordings of Walton's Belshazzar's Feast, Bliss's Piano Concerto, Bax's Third Symphony, and Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius.Foreman, Lewis, & Susan Foreman, London: A Musical Gazetteer, Yale University Press, 2005: p. 15. British Council in alt= *1944: In August, after the liberation of Paris, Austin Gill was sent by the council to reestablish the Paris office, which soon had tours by the Old Vic company, Julian Huxley and T. S. Eliot. *1946: The British Council collected handicraft products from crafts that were being practised in the British Countryside for an ‚ÄòExhibition of Rural Handicrafts from Great Britain‚Äô that travelled to Australia and New Zealand. The majority of the collection was sold to the Museum of English Rural Life in 1960 and 1961. *2007: The Russian Foreign Ministry ordered the British Council to close its offices outside Moscow. The Ministry alleged that it had violated Russian tax regulations, a move that British officials claimed was a retaliation over the British expulsion of Russian diplomats allegedly involved with the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko. This caused the British Council to cease carrying out all English-language examinations in Russia from January 2008. In early 2009, a Russian arbitration court ruled that the majority of the tax claims, valued at $6.6 million, were unjustified. *2011: On 19 August, a group of armed men attacked the British Council office in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, killing at least 12 people ‚Äì none of them British ‚Äì and temporarily took over the compound. All the attackers were killed in counter-attacks by forces guarding the compound. The British Council office was relocated to the British Embassy compound, as the British Council compound was destroyed in the suicide attack. *2013: The British Council in Tripoli, Libya, was targeted by a car bomb on the morning of 23 April. Diplomatic sources were reported as saying that \\"the bombers were foiled as they were preparing to park a rigged vehicle in front of the compound gate\\". The attempted attack was simultaneous with the attack on the French Embassy in Tripoli on the same day that injured two French security guards, one severely, and wounded several residents in neighbouring houses. A jihadist group calling itself the Mujahedeen Brigade was suspected possibly linked to Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb.  Organisation  The British Council is a charity governed by Royal Charter. It is also a public corporation and an executive nondepartmental public body (NDPB), sponsored by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Its headquarters are off Trafalgar Square, London.

Controversies = Expenses  Conservative MP Mark Lancaster, now Lord Commissioner of HM Treasury, the then Speaker of the House of Commons Michael Martin, and other MPs were involved in rows over expenses incurred on undisclosed taxpayer-funded British Council trips. In June 2010, the British Council's then Chief Executive, Martin Davidson, faced press criticism for expenses claimed in apparent breach of the British Council's own internal rules for overnight stays in London.  Israel and Palestine  The British Council has been a primary partner of the Palestine Festival of Literature since the Festival's beginning in 2008. In 2009, the Israeli police, acting on a court order, closed down the venue scheduled to host the Festival's closing event since there was Palestinian Authority involvement, but the British Council stepped in and the evening was relocated to its grounds. The British Council supports the festival, also known as PalFest. A controversial issue arose in 2012, because PalFest's website states that they endorse the \\"2004 Palestinian call for the academic and cultural boycott of Israel\\". Susanna Nicklin, the council's director of literature said in response: \\"The British Council is a non-political organisation, and we believe that international cultural exchange makes a powerful contribution to a more peaceful, tolerant and prosperous world. Therefore, the British Council does not support cultural or academic boycotts.\\"British Council: no support for boycott aims of Palestinian festival  Dissident Chinese writers  In April 2012, the British Council faced a storm of protest over the exclusion of dissident Chinese writers from The London Book Fair in 2012. Critics included English PEN and journalist Nick Cohen writing in The Observer, as well as Alastair Niven, a former Literature Director of The British Council itself.Cohen, Nick, \\"The British Council brings more shame on us\\", The Observer, 15 April 2012.Lea, Richard, \\"Is the London Book Fair supporting Chinese censorship?\\" The Guardian, 13 April 2012.\\"The British Council is wrong in its attitude to China\\", The Observer, 22 April 2012. Cuts In March 2007, the British Council announced its \\"intention to increase its investment in the Middle East, North Africa and Central and Southern Asia\\". In June 2007, MPs were told of further closures in Tel Aviv and East Jerusalem (where there had been a British Council Library since 1946). The British Council libraries in AthensAthens library, Hansard, 27 June 2007. and in BelgradeNew Profile are also to close. Similarly in India, the British Council Libraries at Bhopal and Trivandrum were closed despite protests from library users as part of the Council's policy to \\"reduce its physical presence\\" in the country and to divert funds to mega projects in the fields of culture, education, science and research. British Council libraries and offices have also been closed in a number of other countries judged by the British Council to be of little strategic or commercial importance, as it refocused its activities on China and the Persian Gulf area. Council offices were closed in Lesotho, Swaziland, Ecuador and provincial L√§nder in Germany in 2000‚Äì2001 ‚Äì as well as Belarus ‚Äì prompting Parliamentary criticism. Subsequent promises by British Council Chair Neil Kinnock to a conference in EdinburghNeil Kinnock at the Edinburgh Festival of Politics (from about 36‚Äì42 minutes into the streaming video clip and the question/answer from about 62 minutes in) that the Belarus closure would hopefully prove to be just a \\"temporary\\" withdrawal proved illusory. The British Council office in Peru also closed in September 2006 as part of a rethink of its strategy in Latin America. In Italy British Council closed its offices in Turin and Bologna, and reduced the size of offices in Milan and Rome (with the closure of the library in the latter).Lords Hansard text, English-language advisory services in Peru were moved first to Rio de Janeiro in Brazil then repatriated back to London HQ.

Charles Arnold-Baker, author of the Companion to British History said of the British Council's shift in priorities: \\"This whole policy is misconstrued from top to bottom.

In its evidence to this committee, the British Council had argued that \\"UK degrees are highly valued by international students for their global recognition. International students adopt an essentially utilitarian view of higher education which is likely to increasingly involve consideration of value for money, including opting for programmes at least partly delivered offshore\\". As their preferred marketing 'model', the British Council gave the example of India where their UK India Education and Research InitiativeUK India Education and Research Initiative is being 'championed' by British multinational oil companies such as BP and Shell, the pharmaceutical giant GSK and arms company BAE Systems.BAe Systems investigation Boston Globe, 27 June 2007. Criticism of British Council marketing efforts in this area have also come from Scotland where The Sunday Herald obtained documents under the Freedom of Information Act showing that the British Council's Marketing Co-ordinator in the USA had been referring to the University of Stirling as 'The University of Sterling' (sic) and also documenting 'tensions' between Scottish Executive civil servants and British Council in India and China over overseas promotion of universities in Scotland where education is a devolved responsibility. The Sunday Herald reported that these turf wars were undermining the Scottish Executive's key Fresh Talent policy.\\"Feuds and turf wars put Fresh Talent flagship plan in jeopardy\\", The Sunday Herald, 30 October 2005. Some of the activities of the British Council were examined in 2007/08 by the National Audit Office (NAO). The NAO's report, The British Council: Achieving Impact, concluded \\"that the British Council's performance is strong and valued by its customers and stakeholders\\".\\"The British Council: Achieving Impact\\", National Audit Office, 9 June 2008. It also concluded, however, that its English classes are elitist and have unfair advantages over commercial providers, as well as questioning thousands of unanswered phone-calls and e-mails to British Council offices. As part of its examination of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Annual Report, the Foreign Affairs Committee spends an hour each year examining witnesses from the British Council but even this level of scrutiny is undermined by a Commons ruling exempting MPs from the requirement to declare overseas trips paid for by The British Council. Two members of the Public Accounts Committee (Nigel Griffiths MP and Ian Davidson MP) were office-bearers in the British Council Associate Parliamentary Group.Britishcouncil.org Nigel Griffiths MP was Vice- Chair of this British Council lobby group until stepping down as an MP. In 2008 the British Council was called before the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) following earlier publication of a National Audit Office report. The subsequent PAC report confirmed that Nigel Griffiths MP ‚Äì Vice Chair of The British Council Associate Parliamentary Group ‚Äì was part of the small number of PAC members who approved this report on the British Council despite not having been recorded as being present during the evidence session ‚Äì in June 2008 ‚Äì where the British Council's Chief Executive was cross-examined. Mr Griffiths had earlier travelled to Russia and spoke favourably of British Council activities there in January 1998 around the time that their man in St Petersburg (Stephen Kinnock) was expelled. In April 2009 the British Council was told to clean up its act by the Information Commissioner after losing staff data that included details of their trade union affiliations and lying about the encryption status of the computer disc lost. Following the accusations made against the British Council in Russia (see above) Trevor Royle, the experienced Diplomatic Editor of The Sunday Herald quoted a 'British diplomatic source' admitting: \\"There is a widespread assumption that The British Council is a wing of our Secret Intelligence Services, however minor. Officially it is no such thing but there are connections. Why should it be otherwise because all information is invaluable? After all, the British Council also deals with trade missions and inevitably that involves low-grade intelligence-gathering.\\"SundayHerald.com In 2005, along with the Alliance fran√ßaise, the Societ√† Dante Alighieri, the Goethe-Institut, the Instituto Cervantes, and the Instituto Cam√µes, the British Council shared in the Prince of Asturias Award for the outstanding achievements of Western Europe's national cultural agencies in communications and the humanities. At the time of this joint award the full extent of The British Council's closure policies in Europe was not yet public knowledge.  In literature  Royle also goes on to note that the novel The Russia House by John Le Carr√© (former consular official David Cornwell) opens with a reference to The British Council. The organisation's \\"first ever audio fair for the teaching of the English language and the spread of British culture\\" is \\"grinding to its excruciating end\\" and one of its officials is packing away his stuff when he is approached by an attractive Russian woman to undertake clandestine delivery of a manuscript which she claims is a novel to an English publisher who she says is 'her friend'! It is also featured in one of the scenes in Graham Greene's The Third Man ‚Äì the character Crabbin, played by Wilfrid Hyde-White in the film, worked for The British Council. In 1946, the writer George Orwell advised serious authors not to work for it as a day-job arguing that \\"the effort [of writing] is too much to make if one has already squandered one's energies on semi- creative work such as teaching, broadcasting or composing propaganda for bodies such as the British Council\\".\\"Horizon Questionnaire: The Cost of Letters\\", in Horizon, 1946 In her autobiography, Dame Stella Rimington, the first woman head of MI5, mentions working for British Council in India prior to joining the British Intelligence Services.Rimington, Stella: Open secrets.

In the six Olivia Manning novels that make up The Balkan Trilogy and The Levant Trilogy, Guy Pringle is an employee of the British Council, and Council politics make up several of the plot points. The books portray Eastern Europe and the Middle East in the opening years of World War Two.  Burma  The role of British Council in Burma in 1947 came under scrutiny with release of classified documents to a BBC investigation by journalist Feargal Keane into the role of dissident British colonial officials in the assassination of the then Burmese independence leader Aung San (father of Aung San Suu Kyi). The BBC programme quoted from a 1948 document sent by the Chief of Police in Rangoon to the British Ambassador stating their belief that there had been British involvement in the assassination of Aung San and his Cabinet for which one of his political opponents was hanged and that \\"the go-between\\" had been a British Council official named in the programme.  Libya  In August 2011 a journalist from The Irish Times discovered a certificate dated 2007 issued by the British Council in Tripoli to a daughter of President Gadaffi who had previously been said to have been killed in a US raid on Gadaffi's residence in 1986.

It is responsible for protecting public health in relation to food in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It is led by a board appointed to act in the public interest. Its headquarters are in London, with offices in York, Birmingham, Wales and Northern Ireland. The agency had a national office in Scotland until the formation of Food Standards Scotland in April 2015. History The Agency was created in 2001 based on a report by Professor James, issued after several high-profile outbreaks and deaths from foodborne illness. It was felt that it was inappropriate to have one government department, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, responsible for both the health of the farming and food processing industries, and for food safety. Uniquely for a UK Government department, the Food Standards Act gave the Agency the statutory right to publish the advice it gives to Ministers, and as a signal of its independence it declared that it would invariably do so. From its inception, the Agency declared that it would take no decisions about food policy except in open board meetings accessible to the public. Since 2003, these meetings have been webcast live, enabling consumers to see the decision-making process in action. Each meeting concludes with a question and answer session in which web viewers can question the board or its executive directly. In 2006, the Wine Standards Board merged with the FSA, bringing with it responsibility for enforcing the EU wine regime in the UK. Formerly an executive agency of the FSA, the Meat Hygiene Service merged with the FSA in April 2010 to form a new operations group with responsibility for the delivery of official controls. Certain aspects of food labelling regulations in England were transferred from the Food Standards Agency to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) on 1 September 2010. In England, the Agency retains responsibility for food safety-related labelling issues, whereas the devolved Food Standards Agency offices in Wales and Northern Ireland are still responsible for all labelling and standards policy. Nutrition policy, including nutrition labelling, in England and Wales was transferred from the Food Standards Agency to the Department of Health and Social Care in England and to the Welsh Government's Department of Health and Social Services on 1 October 2010. On the establishment of Public Health England in 2013, the nutrition policy team ‚Äì led by Alison Tedstone ‚Äì transferred there. The Food Standards Agency offices in Scotland and Northern Ireland retained their responsibilities for nutrition policy. Plans to create a new food standards body in Scotland were announced by Ministers in June 2012, and in January 2015 this body was established through primary legislation. Food Standards Scotland took over from the FSA on 1 April 2015 as the public body responsible for food safety, food standards, nutrition, food labelling and meat inspection in Scotland. Chair of the Food Standards Agency Sir John Krebs was the first Chair of the Food Standards Agency, until 2005. Dame Deirdre Hutton was Chair between 2005 and July 2009, followed by Jeff Rooker until July 2013. Tim Bennett, the former Deputy Chair, was appointed as interim Chair whilst a permanent appointment was made. Heather Hancock was appointed the new Chair on 1 April 2016, for a three-year term, and reappointed for a further three year term from 1 April 2019. The Agency is advised by a number of independent expert committees, including: the Science Council, the Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food, the Committee on Toxicity, the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes and the Advisory Committee on Social Sciences. Events=Recalls and contamination In February 2005, the agency announced the discovery of the dye Sudan I in Worcester sauce, prompting a mass product recall of over 400 products that used the sauce as a flavouring. On 31 March 2006, it published its \\"Survey of benzene levels in soft drinks\\", which tested 150 products and found that four contained benzene levels above the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for drinking water. The Agency asked for these to be removed from sale. The Food Standards Agency also imposed restrictions on the sheep trade because of the consequences of the 1986 Chernobyl catastrophe which were repealed in March 2012. Children's advertising The FSA pushed for stricter rules on TV advertising to children of foods high in salt, sugar and fat and devised a nutritional profiling system to measure the balance of benefit and detriment in individual food products. In 2007, the UK TV regulator Ofcom introduced restrictions on advertising of products that scored poorly under the scheme. Food poisoning In June 2002, and re-released in June 2006, the FSA conducted an advertising campaign on British television, highlighting the danger of food poisoning caused by barbecues. The advert, intended to shock viewers, shows sausages sizzling on a barbecue, looking to the viewer as if they are cooked. However, when a pair of tongs pick up one of these sausages, it falls apart, and reveals pink, uncooked meat in the middle. To emphasize the risk of diarrhoea and vomiting caused by food poisoning, the song \\"When Will I See You Again\\" by The Three Degrees is played in the background.http://www.food.gov.uk - FSA website Dean Review In 2005, Brenda Dean carried out an independent review of the Food Standards Agency. The report made 22 recommendations, all of which were accepted by the Food Standards Agency board. Dean concluded: > My overwhelming impression, having undertaken this Review, is of an > organisation that has been extremely conscious of the importance of > fulfilling the very serious responsibilities of changing both the perception > and the reality of food safety in the UK. It has done well in taking forward > the experiences, good and bad, of the previous regime, to begin building its > own reputation. Most stakeholders agreed that the Agency has made > significant progress towards improving food safety, gaining public > confidence in food safety, and creating a modern culture in which it is the > norm for procedures, information, consultation and decision-making to be in > the public domain and to involve external stakeholders. There was > overwhelming support for the Agency‚Äôs policy of basing decisions on > scientific evidence, and for this policy to be maintained and developed > further. The vast majority of stakeholders believe the Agency to be > independent and to act independently, with general recognition that > decisions are based on scientific evidence. There was general support for > the Agency amongst all stakeholder groups, both in terms of the objectives > of the Agency, and the way in which the Agency has approached and undertaken > its responsibilities. One principal criticism, identified in the report, was (Recommendation 20): > It is clear that many stakeholders believe the Agency has already made > policy decisions on GM foods and organic foods and is not open to further > debate. The Agency must address the perceptions of these stakeholders who > have now formed views of the Agency founded on their belief that the basis > upon which the Agency‚Äôs policy decisions were made was flawed. Food Hygiene Rating Scheme (FHRS) A food hygiene rating scheme has been deployed by the Food Standards Agency for all food businesses. Ratings are available at the business premises and online. Following a meeting in Cardiff, the FSA plans to make audit reports as widely available as possible for the public. According to Terence Collins, FSA‚Äôs Director of communication, the reason behind this decision is to make ratings simple and easily understood for every single business. Apart from Scotland which is under a very simple Food Hygiene Information Scheme, the FSA‚Äôs Food Hygiene Rating Scheme will be tested throughout United Kingdom. As a result, ratings will range from 0 (improvement urgently needed) to 5 (very good), and may be displayed on a certificate. This information will also be made available online. Rating primary meat processing plants is the next step forward for the FSA, as meat audit are currently only available through Freedom of Information requests. The local authority in Rutland is believed to the only one which has not accepted the scheme.

It is composed mostly of Archean and Proterozoic gneisses and greenstone which have undergone numerous deformations through tectonic activity. It contains the oldest rocks of the European continent with a thickness of 250-300 km. The Baltic Shield is divided into five provinces: the Svecofennian and Sveconorwegian (or Southwestern gneiss) provinces in Fennoscandia, and the Karelian, Belomorian and Kola provinces in Russia. The latter three are divided further into several blocks and complexes and contain the oldest of the rocks, at 2500-3100 Ma (million years) old. The youngest rocks belong to the Sveconorwegian province, at 900-1700 Ma old. Thought to be formerly part of an ancient continent, the Baltic Shield grew in size through collisions with neighbouring crustal fragments. The mountains created by this tectonic processes have since been eroded to their bases, the region being largely flat today. Through five successive Pleistocene glaciations and subsequent retreats, the Baltic Shield has been scoured clean of its overlying sediments, leaving expansive areas (most within Scandinavia) exposed. It is therefore of importance to geophysicists studying the geologic history and dynamics of eastern Europe. The scouring and compression of the Baltic Shield by glacial movements created the area's many lakes and streams, the land retaining only a thin layer of sandy sediment collected in depressions and eskers. Most soil consists of moraine, a grayish yellow mixture of sand and rocks, with a thin layer of humus on top. Vast forests, featuring almost exclusively the three species pine, spruce and birch, dominate the landscape, clearly demarcating its boundaries. The soil is acidic and has next to no carbonates such as limestone. The scouring by the ancient glaciers and the acidity of the soil have destroyed all palaentologically interesting materials, such as fossils. The Baltic Shield yields important industrial minerals and ores, such as those of iron, nickel, copper and platinum group metals. Because of its similarity to the Canadian Shield and cratons of southern Africa and Western Australia, the Baltic Shield had long been a suspected source of diamonds and gold. Currently, the Central Lapland Greenstone Belt in the north is considered to be an unexplored area that has the potential to hold exploitable gold deposits. Recent exploration has revealed a significant number of diamond-bearing kimberlites in the Kola Peninsula, and (possibly extensive) deposits of gold in Finland.

Earth Surface Processes and Landforms. 22: 297‚Äì306. The southern coast of Finland, √Öland and the Stockholm archipelago were subject to considerable glacial erosion in the form of scraping during the Quaternary.Kleman, J.; Stroeven, A.P.; Lundqvist, Jan (2008). \\"Patterns of Quaternary ice sheet erosion and deposition in Fennoscandia and a theoretical framework for explanation\\". Geomorphology. 97 (1‚Äì2): 73‚Äì90. The Quaternary ice ages resulted in the glacier's erosion of irregularly distributed weak rock, weathered rock mantles, and loose materials. When the ice masses retreated, eroded depressions turned into the many lakes seen now in Finland and Sweden.Lindberg, Johan (April 4, 2016). \\"berggrund och ytformer\\".

Personal life N√¶ss was born in Germany in 1937 to German physician August Oskar German Raab (1901‚Äì1993) and Kirsten \\"Kiki\\" Dekke N√¶ss (1907‚Äì2001), a Norwegian national whose brother was philosopher and mountaineer Arne N√¶ss. N√¶ss' family lived in Germany during World War II. His parents divorced after the war, and N√¶ss moved to Norway with his mother where they both took her maiden name N√¶ss. In 1964, N√¶ss moved to New York to work for his uncle Erling Dekke N√¶ss, a shipping magnate and businessman. He started his own business in London in 1968 where he was successful in shipping and oil, and in real estate. He would go on to make a few bad investments in the 1990s in Pyramid scheme Global Money Games. His biggest success turned out to be an investment in an old IT business, Tandberg Data, and various real estate investments around the world. He had built up his shipping empire to be reputedly worth some 600 million by the year 2000. He spent his last years in Switzerland. In 1966 he married Filippa Kumlin d'Orey of Sweden and together they had son Christoffer and two daughters, Katinka and folk/pop singer Leona Naess. After they divorced, he had a relationship with Norwegian actress Mari Maurstad. In 1985, N√¶ss met American singer Diana Ross on a trip to the Bahamas. He and Ross married in 1985 and had two sons, Ross Arne N√¶ss (born October 7, 1987) and Evan Olav N√¶ss (born August 26, 1988). Through his marriage, he gained three stepdaughters, Rhonda Ross Kendrick (Ross's daughter with Motown founder Berry Gordy), Chudney Ross, and Tracee Ellis Ross; the latter two being Ross's daughters from her first marriage to music executive Robert Ellis Silberstein. The couple divorced in 1999. N√¶ss spent his remaining five years with Norwegian-born Camilla Astrup; they had two sons, Nicklas and Louis. Mountaineering By age 19, N√¶ss had already made twenty first ascents of Norwegian mountains. He then concentrated on a career in the shipping industry, starting out with his uncle Erling Dekke N√¶ss in 1964 in New York. In the seventies he returned to mountain climbing; in 1985 he led the first Norwegian expedition to Mount Everest. Also participating was British mountaineer Chris Bonington. When asked, during a late-1990s television interview, about the risks of mountaineering, N√¶ss replied \\"If I hadn't liked risks, I would rather have played tennis or golf.\\" Death N√¶ss was staying with his friend Johann Rupert on 13 January 2004 when he died in a climbing accident while descending from a peak on Rupert's estate in the Groot Drakenstein mountains near the town of Franschhoek outside Cape Town, South Africa. According to police reports, N√¶ss' anchoring equipment loosened from the porous mountainside, leading to a 103m fall. He was 66 years old. In May 2004, N√¶ss was posthumously awarded the Laureus Lifetime Achievement Award.

Grifo, considered illegitimate by Pepin and Carloman, was besieged in Laon by his half-brothers, captured, and imprisoned in a monastery. On his escape in 747, his maternal great-uncle Duke Odilo of Bavaria provided support and assistance to Grifo, but when Odilo died a year later and Grifo attempted to seize the duchy of Bavaria for himself, Pepin, who had become sole major domo of the Frankish (Merovingian) Empire upon Carloman's resignation and retreat into a monastery, took decisive action by invading Bavaria and installing Odilo's infant son, Tassilo III, as duke under Frankish overlordship.

It is typically used as an honorary title for someone who is formally equal to other members of their group but is accorded unofficial respect, traditionally owing to their seniority in office.Hutchinson Encyclopedia. \\"Primus inter pares\\" . 2007. Hosted at Tiscali. Historically, the princeps senatus of the Roman Senate was such a figure and initially bore only the distinction that he was allowed to speak first during debate. Also, Constantine the Great was given the role of primus inter pares. However, the term is also often used ironically or self-deprecatingly by leaders with much higher status as a form of respect, camaraderie or propaganda. After the fall of the Republic, Roman emperors initially referred to themselves only as princeps despite having power of life and death over their \\"fellow citizens\\". Various modern figures such as the chair of the United States Federal Reserve System, the prime minister of parliamentary countries, the federal president of Switzerland, the chief justice of the United States, the chief justice of the Philippines, the archbishop of Canterbury of the Anglican Communion and the ecumenical patriarch of the Eastern Orthodox Church fall under both senses: bearing higher status and various additional powers while remaining still merely equal to their peers in important senses.  National use =China In the People's Republic of China, during the collective leadership of the Politburo Standing Committee which Deng Xiaoping put into place following the death of Chairman Mao Zedong, the term \\"first among equals\\" was often used to describe China's paramount leader. This has fallen out of favour since the consolidation of power under the current core leader, General Secretary Xi Jinping. Commonwealth usagePrime minister or premier= In the federal Commonwealth realms, Canada and Australia, in which Queen Elizabeth II is head of state as constitutional monarch, a governor-general is appointed by the Queen-in-Council to represent the Queen during her absence. The governor- general typically appoints the leader of the political party holding at least a plurality of seats in the elected legislature to be prime minister, whose relationship with the other ministers of the Crown is officially that of a primus inter pares, or \\"first among equals\\". Albeit, in recent times there has been a tendency for \\"Presidentialisation\\" of the system, with increasing power being held in the Prime Minister's Office (Australia) or the Office of the Prime Minister (Canada). This is also done at the provincial or state level wherein the lieutenant governors of the Canadian provinces or governors of the Australian states as Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council appoints the leader of the provincial or state political party holding at least a plurality of seats in the elected provincial or state legislature to be provincial premier or state premier. =Viceroys in Canada and Australia= As federations in Canada, lieutenant-governors represent the Canadian monarch in each of the provinces, thus, acting as the \\"heads of state\\" in the provinces. Unlike in Australia with the governors of the Australian states, the lieutenant-governors in Canada are not appointed by the Queen-in-Council, but by the governor general on the advice of the prime minister of Canada known as the Governor-in- Council. Similarly, in Australia, there are governors to represent the Australian monarch in each of the states of Australia that comprise the federal Commonwealth of Australia, making them \\"head of state\\" in each of their own states. In each case, these several governors or lieutenant- governors are not envisaged as subordinate to the governor general ‚Äì the governor-general of Australia and the governor general of Canada ‚Äì as a federal viceroy ‚Äì is \\"first among equals\\".Government House Germany Mayors of German city states have traditionally acted as primus inter pares. In Hamburg, L√ºbeck and Bremen, which had been Free Imperial Cities from the times of the Holy Roman Empire, the government was called Senate. The mayor was one senator amongst many, often referred to as president of the Senate rather than mayor. This ended in L√ºbeck with the incorporation into Prussia in 1937. While in a constitutional reform in 1996, the mayor of Hamburg was given broad powers to shape the politics of the Senate of Hamburg, thus, ending his status as primus inter pares. However, in the city state Free Hanseatic City of Bremen which was created after the Second World War, the mayor has had a similar role in the Senate of Bremen. The same was true until 1995 for the governing mayor of Berlin among his colleagues within the Senate of Berlin. Japan Starting with the Meiji Constitution of 1885, as part of the \\"Cabinet System Act\\", and lasting until the revision of the modern constitution in 1947, the prime minister of Japan was considered to be of the same rank as the other ministers who formed the Cabinet. During this time, the prime minister was referred to as \\"ÂêåËº©‰∏≠„ÅÆÈ¶ñÂ∏≠\\" d≈çhai-ch≈´ no shuseki (\\"chief among peers\\"). Netherlands The prime minister of the Netherlands (officially, the \\"minister-president\\") is the chairman of the Council of Ministers and active executive authority of the Dutch government. Although formally no special powers are assigned, the prime minister functions as the \\"face\\" of the cabinet of the Netherlands. Usually, the prime minister is also minister of General Affairs. Until 1945, the position of head of the Council of Ministers officially switched between the ministers, although practices differed throughout history. In 1945, the position was formally instituted. Although not formally necessary, the prime minister in practice is the leader of the largest party in the majority coalition in the House of Representatives, the lower house of parliament. Switzerland In Switzerland the seven-member Federal Council constitutes the government. Each year, the Federal Assembly elects a president of the Confederation. By convention, the positions of President and Vice President rotate annually, each Councillor thus becoming Vice President and then President every seven years while in office. The president is not the Swiss head of state, but he or she is the highest-ranking Swiss official. He or she presides over Council meetings and carries out certain representative functions that, in other countries, are the business of the head of state. In urgent situations where a Council decision cannot be made in time, the president is empowered to act on behalf of the whole Council. Apart from that, though, the president is a primus inter pares, having no power above and beyond the other six councillors. United Kingdom The term \\"prime minister\\" can be compared to \\"primary minister\\" or \\"first minister\\". Because of this, the prime ministers of many countries are traditionally considered to be \\"first among equals\\" ‚Äì they are the chairman or \\"head\\" of a Cabinet rather than holding an office that is de jure superior to that of ministers. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom has frequently been described as \\"first among equals\\". In the UK, the executive is the Cabinet, and during Hanoverian times a minister had the role of informing the monarch about proposed legislation in the House of Commons and other matters. In modern times, however, although the phrase is still occasionally used, it understates the powers of the prime minister, which now include many broad, exclusive, executive powers over which cabinet members have little influence. First Among Equals is the title of a popular political novel (1984) by Jeffrey Archer, about the careers and private lives of several men vying to become British Prime Minister. It was later adapted into a ten-part miniseries, produced by Granada Television. Countries and jurisdictions that have adapted the British parliamentary system (such as Canada and Australia) would have the same use for the phrase. United States The phrase \\"first among equals\\" has also been used to describe the Chief Justice of the United States. The Chief Justice has considerable administrative powers, and can assign the writing of decisions in cases in which they are in the majority, but has no direct control over the decisions of their colleagues on the Supreme Court of the United States.  Chairpersons  In many private parliamentary bodies, such as clubs, boards, educational faculty, and committees, the officer or member who holds the position of chair or chairman is often regarded as a \\"first among equals\\". That is, while most rules of order will grant the chair special powers within the context of a meeting, the position of chair is usually temporary, rotating, and powerless in other contexts, making the occupant merely a temporary leader required to instil order. This is the case for mayors under a council‚Äìmanager government, as the \\"mayor\\" has the same vote as all other council members and cannot override them, although their opinion may have more sway among other members.  Religion = Eastern Orthodox Church  The phrase \\"first among equals\\" is also used to describe the role of the patriarch of Constantinople, who, as the \\"ecumenical patriarch\\", is the first among all the bishops of the Eastern Orthodox Church. He has no direct jurisdiction over the other patriarchs or the other autocephalous Orthodox churches and cannot interfere in the election of bishops in autocephalous churches, but he alone enjoys the right of convening extraordinary synods consisting of them or their delegates to deal with ad hoc situations, and he has also convened well-attended pan-Orthodox Synods in the last forty years. His title is an acknowledgement of his historic significance and of his privilege to serve as primary spokesman for the Eastern Orthodox Communion. His moral authority is highly respected. The Eastern Orthodox Church also uses the term \\"first among equals\\" in regard to the bishop of Rome during the first thousand years of Christianity.Timothy Ware, The Orthodox Church (Oxford: Penguin, 1993), 214‚Äì17. Whereas the patriarch of Constantinople is now considered first among the Orthodox patriarchs, the Orthodox Church considers the bishop of Rome (regarded as the \\"patriarch of the West\\") the \\"first among equals\\" in the Pentarchy of the patriarchal sees according to the ancient, first millennial order (or \\"taxis\\" in Greek) of Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem, established after Constantinople became the eastern capital of the Byzantine Empire.Ecclesiological and Canonical Consequences of the Sacramental Nature of the Church: Ecclesial Communion, Conciliarity and Authority (The Ravenna Document), Joint International Commission for the Theological Dialogue between the Roman Catholic and the Orthodox Church, 13 October 2007, n. 35. The bishop of Rome no longer holds this distinction in the Orthodox Church because, following the East‚ÄìWest Schism, he is no longer in communion with the Orthodox Church. The canons relative to the universal primacy of honor of the patriarch of Constantinople are the 9th canon of the synod of Antioch and the 28th canon of the Council of Chalcedon.  Catholic Church  The Latin and Eastern Catholic Churches consider the pope (bishop of Rome) to be the single Vicar of Christ, successor of Saint Peter, and leader of all their bishops (Patriarchs included), in Apostolic succession to the apostles. As such, the Catholic Church does not see the pope merely as being \\"first among equals\\", but as actually holding an office with supreme authority in canon law over all other bishops. This jurisdictional claim was one of the main causes of the East-West Schism in the Church, which became formal in 1054. The Dean of the College of Cardinals in the Catholic Church is generally considered to be the first among equal Prince of the Church in the College, which is the pope's highest-ranking council and elects as conclave (where an age limit applies) the papal successor, generally from its ranks. Various episcopal sees were granted or claim the title of primate (usually of a past or present political entity), which grants such a primas (usually a metropolitan archbishopric, often in a former/present capital) precedence over all other sees in its circumscription, outranking (other) metropolitan sees, but the incumbent primates can be trumped by personal ranks, as they rank below cardinals. More commonly, dioceses are geographically grouped in an ecclesiastical province, where only one holds the rank of metropolitan archbishop, which outranks his colleagues, who are therefore called his suffragans, even if these include (fairly rarely) another archbishop.  Anglican Communion  In the Anglican Communion, the archbishop of Canterbury is considered to be \\"first among equals\\" in his presidency over the Communion. The senior bishop of the seven diocesan bishops of the Scottish Episcopal Church bears the truncated title primus from primus inter pares. Leading bishops or primates in other Anglican 'national' churches are often said to be primus inter pares within their provinces (e.g. Church of Ireland), while the (first) primatial see of Canterbury remains primus among them. Based on the antiquity with which ecumenical councils have conceded some kind of universal primacy to the bishops of Rome, participants in Anglican‚ÄìCatholic dialogues have acknowledged for decades that the pope would properly serve as the titular leader of a reunited church; the Anglicans typically have in mind an honorary (non-jurisdictional) primacy such as the phrase \\"primus inter pares\\" implies. In one example of such acknowledgement, the International Anglican-Catholic Commission for Unity and Mission, in its 2007 agreed statement Growing Together in Unity and Mission, \\"urge[s] Anglicans and Catholics to explore together how the ministry of the Bishop of Rome might be offered and received in order to assist our Communions to grow towards full, ecclesial communion\\". Presbyterianism The Moderator of the General Assembly in a Presbyterian church is similarly designated as a primus inter pares. This concept holds also for the Moderators of each Synod, Presbytery, and Kirk Session. As all elders are ordained ‚Äì some for teaching and some for ruling ‚Äì none sit in higher status, but all are equal behind the one and only head of the church Jesus Christ.Westminster Confession of Faith Chapter XXV, article vi Church of Sweden In the Lutheran Church of Sweden, the archbishop of Uppsala is considered primus inter pares.  See also  * Animal Farm, a George Orwell dystopian novel published in 1945, where the motto 'All are equal, but some are more equal than others' is a variant on this theme.

A gastrolith, also called a stomach stone or gizzard stone, is a rock held inside a gastrointestinal tract. Gastroliths in some species are retained in the muscular gizzard and used to grind food in animals lacking suitable grinding teeth. In other species the rocks are ingested and pass through the digestive system and are frequently replaced. The grain size depends upon the size of the animal and the gastrolith's role in digestion. Other species use gastroliths as ballast. Particles ranging in size from sand to cobble have been documented. Etymology Gastrolith comes from the Greek Œ≥Œ±œÉœÑŒÆœÅ (gastƒìr), meaning \\"stomach\\", and ŒªŒØŒ∏ŒøœÇ (lithos), meaning \\"stone\\". Occurrence Gastroliths from Jurassic strata near Starr Springs, Utah. Axolotl seek out and swallow gravel to create gastroliths (as visible in this x-ray of a living animal) Among living vertebrates, gastroliths are common among crocodiles, alligators, herbivorous birds, seals and sea lions. Domestic fowl require access to grit. Stones swallowed by ostriches can exceed a length of . Amphibians such as the Axolotl are also known to deliberately ingest rocks that are presumed to be gastroliths.Kulbisky et al The axolotl as an animal model for the comparison of 3-D ultrasound with plain film radiography rrr in Medicine and Biology, July 1999 Volume 25, Issue 6, Pages 969‚Äì975Wings, O A review of gastrolith function with implications for fossil vertebrates and a revised classification Acta Palaeontologica Polonica 52 (1): 1‚Äì16 Apparent microgastroliths have also been found in frog tadpoles.Wickramasinghe, DD et al Ontogenetic changes in diet and intestinal morphology in semi-terrestrial tadpoles of Nannophrys ceylonensis (Dicroglossidae) Copeia, Vol2007, Iss 4 (Dec 2007) Ingestion of silt and gravel by tadpoles of various anuran (frog) species has been observed to improve buoyancy control.Rondeau, et al Larval Anurans Adjust Buoyancy in Response to Substrate Ingestion Copeia: February 2005, Vol. 2005, No. 1, pp. 188-195. Some extinct animals such as sauropod dinosaurs appear to have used stones to grind tough plant matter. A rare example of this is the Early Cretaceous theropod Caudipteryx zoui from northeastern China, which was discovered with a series of small stones, interpreted as gastroliths, in the area of its skeleton that would have corresponded with its abdominal region. Aquatic animals, such as plesiosaurs, may have used them as ballast, to help balance themselves or to decrease their buoyancy, as crocodiles do. While some fossil gastroliths are rounded and polished, many stones in living birds are not polished at all. Gastroliths associated with dinosaur fossils can weigh several kilograms. Gastroliths in paleontology=History of discovery In 1906, George Reber Weiland reported the presence of worn and polished quartz pebbles associated with the remains of plesiosaurs and sauropod dinosaurs and interpreted these stones as gastroliths.Wieland, G. R., 1906, Dinosaurian gastroliths: Science, v. 23, p. 819-821. In 1907, Barnum Brown found gravel in close association with the fossil remains of the duck-billed hadrosaur Claosaurus and interpreted it as gastroliths. Brown was among the first paleontologist to recognize that dinosaurs used gastroliths in their digestive systems to aid in the grinding of food.Brown, B. 1907. Gastroliths. Science 25(636): 392. This interpretation, however, has been regarded as unconvincing by other paleontologists over the years. In 1932, Friedrich von Huene found stones in Late Triassic sediments, in association with the fossil remains of the prosauropod Sellosaurus and interpreted them as gastroliths.Huene, F. von. 1932. Die fossile Reptil-Ordnung Saurischia, ihre Entwicklung und Geschichte. Monographien f√ºr Geologie und Pal√§ontologie (1) 4: 1‚Äì361. In 1934, the Howe Quarry, a fossil location in northwestern Wyoming also yielded dinosaur bones with their associated gastroliths. In 1942, William Lee Stokes recognized the presence of gastroliths in the remains of sauropod dinosaurs recovered from Late Jurassic strata. Identification A left Geologists usually require several pieces of evidence before they will accept that a rock was used by a dinosaur to aid its digestion. First, the stone must be unlike the rock found in its geological vicinity. Secondly, it should be rounded and polished, because inside a dinosaur's gizzard any genuine gastrolith would have been acted upon by other stones and fibrous materials in a process similar to the action of a rock tumbler. Lastly, the stone must be found with the fossils of the dinosaur which ingested it. It is this last criterion that causes trouble in identification, as smooth stones found without context can (possibly erroneously in some cases) be dismissed as having been polished by water or wind. Christopher H. Whittle (1988,9) pioneered scanning electron microscope analysis of wear patterns on gastroliths. Wings (2003) found that ostrich gastroliths would be deposited outside the skeleton if the carcass was deposited in an aquatic environment for as little as a few days following death. He concludes that this is likely to hold true for all birds (with the possible exception of moa) due to their air-filled bones which would cause a carcass deposited in water to float for the time it needs to rot sufficiently to allow gastroliths to escape. Gastroliths can be distinguished from stream- or beach-rounded rocks by several criteria: gastroliths are highly polished on the higher surfaces, with little or no polish in depressions or crevices, often strongly resembling the surface of worn animal teeth. Stream- or beach-worn rocks, particularly in a high-impact environment, show less polishing on higher surfaces, often with many small pits or cracks on these higher surfaces. Finally, highly polished gastroliths often show long microscopic rilles, presumably caused by contact with stomach acid. Since most gastroliths were scattered when the animal died and many entered a stream or beach environment, some gastroliths show a mixture of these wear features. Others were undoubtedly swallowed by other dinosaurs and highly polished gastroliths may have been swallowed repeatedly. None of the gastroliths examined in a 2001 study of Cedarosaurus gastroliths had the \\"soapy\\" texture popularly used to distinguish gastroliths from other types of clast. The researchers dismissed using a soapy texture to identify gastroliths as \\"unreliable\\". Gastroliths tended to be universally dull, although the colors represented were varied including black, dark brown, purplish red and grey-blue. Reflectance values greater than 50% are very diagnostic for identifying gastroliths. Clasts from beaches and streams tended to have reflectance values of less than 35%. Less than ten percent of beach clasts have reflectance values lying between 50 and 80%. Psittacosaurus fossil with gastroliths in its stomach region, American Museum of Natural History The American Museum of Natural History Photograph # 311488 demonstrates an articulated skeleton of a Psittacosaurus mongoliensis, from the Ondai Sair Formation, Lower Cretaceous Period of Mongolia, showing a collection of about 40 gastroliths inside the rib cage, about midway between shoulder and pelvis. Geologic distributionJurassic= Gastroliths have sometimes been called Morrison stones because they are often found in the Morrison Formation (named after the town of Morrison, west of Denver, Colorado), a late Jurassic formation roughly 150 million years old. Some gastroliths are made of petrified wood. Most known instances of preserved sauropod gastroliths are from Jurassic animals. =Cretaceous= The Early Cretaceous Cedar Mountain Formation of Central Utah is full of highly polished red and black cherts, which may partly represent gastroliths. The cherts may themselves contain fossils of ancient animals, such as corals. These stones do not appear to be associated with stream deposits and are rarely more than fist-sized, which is consistent with the idea that they are gastroliths. Sauropod gastroliths Most known instances of preserved sauropod gastroliths are from Jurassic animals. The largest known gastroliths found in association with sauropod skeletons are approximately 10 centimeters in length.Martin, A.J. (2006). Introduction to the Study of Dinosaurs. Second Edition. Oxford, Blackwell Publishing. 560 pp. . =Cedarosaurus weiskopfae= In 2001 Frank Sanders, Kim Manley, and Kenneth Carpenter published a study on 115 gastroliths discovered in association with a Cedarosaurus specimen. The stones were identified as gastroliths on the basis of their tight spatial distribution, partial matrix support, and an edge-on orientation indicative of their being deposited while the carcass still had soft tissue. Their high surface reflectance values are consistent with other known dinosaur gastroliths. Nearly all of the Cedarosaurus gastroliths were found within a .06 m volume of space in the gut region of the skeleton. The total mass of the gastroliths themselves was . Most were less than in volume. The least massive clast was and the most was , with most of them being toward the smaller end of that range. The clasts tended to be close to spherical in shape, although the largest specimens were also the most irregular. The largest gastroliths contributed the most to the total surface area of the set. Some gastroliths were so large and irregularly shaped that they may have been difficult to swallow. The gastroliths were mostly composed of chert, with some sandstone, siltstone, and quartzite clasts also included. Since some of the most irregular gastroliths are also the largest, it is unlikely that they were ingested by accident. Cedarosaurus may have found irregular clasts to be attractive potential gastroliths or was not selective about shape. The clasts were generally of dull coloration, suggesting that color was not a major factor for the sauropod's decision making. The high surface area to volume ratio of the largest clasts suggests that the gastroliths may have broken down ingested plant material by grinding or crushing it The sandstone clasts tended to be fragile and some broke in the process of collection. The sandstone gastroliths may have been rendered fragile after deposition by loss of cement caused by the external chemical environment. If the clasts had been that fragile while the animal was alive, they probably rolled and tumbled in the digestive tract. If they were more robust, they could have served as part of a ball-mill system. Migration Paleontologists are researching new methods of identifying gastroliths that have been found disassociated from animal remains, because of the important information they can provide. If the validity of such gastroliths can be verified, it may be possible to trace gastrolithic rocks back to their original sources. This may provide important information on how dinosaurs migrated. Because the number of suspected gastroliths is large, they could provide significant new insights into the lives and behaviour of dinosaurs.

Retrieved on 11 October 2012. \\"Herzog & de Meuron Basel Ltd. Rheinschanze 6 4056 Basel, Switzerland\\" or Herzog & de Meuron Architekten, BSA/SIA/ETH (HdM), is a Swiss architecture firm with its head office in Basel, Switzerland. The careers of founders and senior partners Jacques Herzog (born 19 April 1950) and Pierre de Meuron (born 8 May 1950) closely paralleled one another, with both attending the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich. They are perhaps best known for their conversion of the giant Bankside Power Station in London to the new home of Tate Modern. Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron have been visiting professors at the Harvard University Graduate School of Design since 1994 and professors at ETH Z√ºrich since 1999. History Jacques Herzog Herzog & de Meuron was founded in Basel in 1978. In 2001, Herzog & de Meuron were awarded the Pritzker Prize, the highest of honours in architecture. Jury chairman J. Carter Brown commented, \\"One is hard put to think of any architects in history that have addressed the integument of architecture with greater imagination and virtuosity.\\" This was in reference to HdM's innovative use of exterior materials and treatments, such as silkscreened glass. Architecture critic and Pritzker juror Ada Louise Huxtable summarized HdM's approach concisely: \\"They refine the traditions of modernism to elemental simplicity, while transforming materials and surfaces through the exploration of new treatments and techniques.\\" In 2006, The New York Times Magazine called them \\"one of the most admired architecture firms in the world.\\" Style HdM's early works were reductivist pieces of modernity that registered on the same level as the minimalist art of Donald Judd. However, their recent work at Prada Tokyo, the Barcelona Forum Building and the Beijing National Stadium for the 2008 Olympic Games, suggest a changing attitude. subscription required The shapes and forms of some of the works suggest art glass and objects d'art that one would see on a coffee table, like an art deco ashtray or quirky container for chocolates - a building becomes a blown-up version of desk art because the computer can do it, mimic the plasticity of the medium, and make it possible as a feat of engineering. HdM's commitment of articulation through materiality is a common thread through all their projects. Their formal gestures have generally progressed from the purist simplicity of rectangular forms to more complex and dynamic geometries. The architects often cite Joseph Beuys as an enduring artistic inspiration and collaborate with different artists on each architectural project. Their success can be attributed to their skills in revealing unfamiliar or unknown relationships by utilizing innovative materials. Ethics Herzog & de Meuron has faced criticism for their vision on migrant workers in Beijing during the construction of the Beijing National Stadium. In a July 2008 interview with German magazine Der Spiegel, Jacques Herzog was criticised for not having done more to ensure the conditions under which migrant workers constructed the stadium by the interviewer, to which Jacques Herzog responded that the influence of the architect on the construction process is declining rapidly. On the other hand, some scholars such as Deyan Sudjic have stated that the very building of the stadium sent a signal from the Western architecture firm to the Chinese government to change societal norms. However, others have argued that this statement would go with any stadium design, decreasing the potential of the signal.

The musical follows the lives of the performers, stagehands and dock workers on the Cotton Blossom, a Mississippi River show boat, over 40 years from 1887 to 1927. Its themes include racial prejudice and tragic, enduring love. The musical contributed such classic songs as \\"Ol' Man River\\", \\"Make Believe\\", and \\"Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man\\". The musical was first produced in 1927 by Florenz Ziegfeld. The premiere of Show Boat on Broadway was an important event in the history of American musical theatre. It \\"was a radical departure in musical storytelling, marrying spectacle with seriousness\\", compared with the trivial and unrealistic operettas, light musical comedies and \\"Follies\\"-type musical revues that defined Broadway in the 1890s and early 20th century. According to The Complete Book of Light Opera: > Here we come to a completely new genre ‚Äì the musical play as distinguished > from musical comedy. Now ‚Ä¶ the play was the thing, and everything else was > subservient to that play. Now ‚Ä¶ came complete integration of song, humor and > production numbers into a single and inextricable artistic entity.\\"American > Musical Theatre: An Introduction\\" , theatrehistory.com, republished from The > Complete Book of Light Opera. Mark Lubbock. New York: Appleton-Century- > Crofts, 1962, pp. 753‚Äì56, accessed December 3, 2008 The quality of Show Boat was recognized immediately by critics, and it is frequently revived. Awards did not exist for Broadway shows in 1927, when the show premiered, or in 1932 when its first revival was staged. Late 20th- century revivals of Show Boat have won both the Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical (1995) and the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Musical Revival (1991).\\"Olivier Winners, 1991\\" olivierawards.com, accessed August 10, 2012 Background In doing research for her proposed novel Show Boat, writer Edna Ferber spent five days on the James Adams Floating Palace Theatre in Bath, North Carolina, gathering material about a disappearing American entertainment venue, the river showboat. In a few weeks, she gained what she called a \\"treasure trove of show-boat material, human, touching, true\\". Ferber researched these American showboats for months prior to her stay on the Floating Palace Theatre. Jerome Kern was impressed by the novel and, hoping to adapt it as a musical, asked the critic Alexander Woollcott to introduce him to Ferber in October 1926. Woollcott introduced them that evening during the intermission of Kern's latest musical, Criss Cross.Block, pp. 22‚Äì23 Ferber was at first shocked that anyone would want to adapt Show Boat as a musical. After being assured by Kern that he did not want to adapt it as the typical frivolous \\"girlie\\" show of the 1920s, she granted him and his collaborator Oscar Hammerstein II the rights to set her novel to music. After composing most of the first-act songs, Kern and Hammerstein auditioned their material for producer Florenz Ziegfeld, thinking that he was the person to create the elaborate production they felt necessary for Ferber's sprawling work.Kantor and Maslon, pp. 112‚Äì19 Ziegfeld was impressed with the show and agreed to produce it, writing the next day, \\"This is the best musical comedy I have ever been fortunate to get a hold of; I am thrilled to produce it, this show is the opportunity of my life...\\"Show Boat, with its serious and dramatic nature, was considered an unusual choice for Ziegfeld, who was best known for revues such as the Ziegfeld Follies. Though Ziegfeld anticipated opening his new theatre on Sixth Avenue with Show Boat, the epic nature of the work required an unusually long gestation period and extensive changes during out-of-town tryouts. Impatient with Kern and Hammerstein and worried about the serious tone of the musical (he strongly disliked the songs Ol' Man River and Mis'ry's Comin' Around), Ziegfeld decided to open his theatre in February 1927 with Rio Rita, a musical by Kern's collaborator Guy Bolton. When Rio Rita proved to be a success, Show Boat's Broadway opening was delayed until Rita could be moved to another theatre.Bloom and Vlastnik, pp. 290‚Äì93 Synopsis Note: Although the basic plot of Show Boat has always remained the same, over the years revisions and alterations were made by the creators, and over time by subsequent producers and directors. Some of these revisions were for length and some for convenience, as when a different actor played a certain role and was unable to perform a specialty piece written for the role's creator. Some have been made to reflect contemporary sensitivities toward race, gender and other social issues. ;Act I In 1887, the show boat Cotton Blossom arrives at the river dock in Natchez, Mississippi. The Reconstruction era had ended a decade earlier, and white-dominated Southern legislatures have imposed racial segregation and Jim Crow rules. The boat's owner, Cap'n Andy Hawks, introduces his actors to the crowd on the levee. A fistfight breaks out between Steve Baker, the leading man of the troupe, and Pete, a rough engineer who had been making passes at Steve's wife, the leading lady Julie La Verne. Steve knocks Pete down, and Pete swears revenge, suggesting he knows a dark secret about Julie. Cap'n Andy pretends to the shocked crowd that the fight was a preview of one of the melodramas to be performed. The troupe exits with the showboat band, and the crowd follows. A handsome riverboat gambler, Gaylord Ravenal, appears on the levee and is taken with eighteen-year-old Magnolia (\\"Nolie\\") Hawks, an aspiring performer and the daughter of Cap'n Andy and his wife Parthenia Ann (Parthy). Magnolia is likewise smitten with Ravenal (\\"Make Believe\\"). She seeks advice from Joe, a black dock worker aboard the boat, who has returned from buying flour for his wife Queenie, the ship's cook. He replies that there are \\"lots like [Ravenal] on the river.\\" As Magnolia goes inside the boat to tell her friend Julie about the handsome stranger, Joe mutters that she ought to ask the river for advice. He and the other dock workers reflect on the wisdom and indifference of \\"Ol' Man River\\", who doesn't seem to care what the world's troubles are, but \\"jes' keeps rollin' along\\". Magnolia finds Julie inside and announces that she's in love. Julie cautions her that this stranger could be just a \\"no-account river fellow\\". Magnolia says that if she found out he was \\"no-account\\", she'd stop loving him. Julie warns her that it's not that easy to stop loving someone, explaining that she'll always love Steve, singing a few lines of \\"Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man\\". Queenie overhears ‚Äì she is surprised that Julie knows that song as she has only heard \\"colored folks\\" sing it. Magnolia remarks that Julie sings it all the time, and when Queenie asks if she can sing the entire song, Julie obliges. During the rehearsal for that evening, Julie and Steve learn that the town sheriff is coming to arrest them. Steve takes out a large pocket knife and makes a cut on the back of her hand, sucking the blood and swallowing it. Pete returns with the sheriff, who insists the show cannot proceed because Julie is a mulatto who has been passing as white and local law prohibits mixed marriages. Julie admits that her mother was black, but Steve tells the sheriff that he also has \\"black blood\\" in him, so their marriage is legal in Mississippi. The troupe backs him up, boosted by the ship's pilot Windy McClain, a longtime friend of the sheriff. The couple have escaped the charge of miscegenation, but they still have to leave the show boat; identified as black, they can no longer perform for the segregated white audience. Cap'n Andy fires Pete, but in spite of his sympathy for Julie and Steve, he cannot violate the law for them. Ravenal returns and asks for passage on the boat. Andy hires him as the new leading man and assigns his daughter Magnolia as the new leading lady, over her mother's objections. As Magnolia and Ravenal begin to rehearse their roles and in the process, kiss for the first time (infuriating Parthy), Joe reprises the last few lines of \\"Ol' Man River\\". Weeks later, Magnolia and Ravenal have been a hit with the crowds and have fallen in love. As the levee workers hum \\"Ol' Man River\\" in the background, he proposes to Magnolia, and she accepts. The couple joyously sings \\"You Are Love\\". They make plans to marry the next day while Parthy, who disapproves, is out of town. Parthy has discovered that Ravenal once killed a man and arrives with the Sheriff to interrupt the wedding festivities. The group learns that Ravenal was acquitted of murder. Cap'n Andy calls Parthy \\"narrow-minded\\" and defends Ravenal by announcing that he also once killed a man. Parthy faints, but the ceremony proceeds. ;Act II Six years have passed, and it is 1893. Ravenal and Magnolia have moved to Chicago, where they make a precarious living from Ravenal's gambling. At first they are rich and enjoying the good life (\\"Why Do I Love You?\\") By 1903, they have a daughter, Kim, and after years of varying income, they are broke and rent a room in a boarding house. Depressed over his inability to support his family, Ravenal abandons Magnolia and Kim. Frank and Ellie, two former actors from the showboat, learn that Magnolia is living in the rooms they want to rent. The old friends seek a singing job for Magnolia at the Trocadero, the club where they are doing a New Year's show. Julie is working there. She has fallen into drinking after having been abandoned by Steve. At a rehearsal, she tries out the new song \\"Bill.\\" She appears to be thinking of Steve and sings it with great emotion. From her dressing-room, she hears Magnolia singing \\"Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man\\" for her audition, the song which Julie taught her years ago. Julie secretly quits her job so that Magnolia can fill it, without learning of her sacrifice. Ravenal visits his daughter Kim at the convent where she goes to school to say goodbye before leaving her forever (\\"Make Believe\\" (reprise)). On New Year's Eve, Andy and Parthy go to Chicago for a surprise visit to their daughter Magnolia. He goes to the Trocadero without his wife, and sees Magnolia overcome with emotion and nearly booed off stage. Andy rallies the crowd by starting a sing- along of the standard, \\"After the Ball\\". Magnolia becomes a great musical star. More than 20 years pass, and it is 1927. An aged Joe on the Cotton Blossom sings a reprise of \\"Ol' Man River\\". Cap'n Andy has a chance meeting with Ravenal and arranges his reunion with Magnolia. Andy knows that Magnolia is retiring and returning to the Cotton Blossom with Kim, who has become a Broadway star. Kim gives her admirers a taste of her performing abilities by singing an updated, Charleston version of \\"Why Do I Love You?\\" Ravenal sings a reprise of \\"You Are Love\\" to the offstage Magnolia. Although he is uncertain about asking her to take him back, Magnolia, who has never stopped loving him, greets him warmly and does. As the happy couple walks up the boat's gangplank, Joe and the cast sing the last verse of \\"Ol' Man River\\". ;Plot variants in 1951 film The 1951 MGM film changed the final scenes of the story, as well as many small details. It reconciles Ravenal and Magnolia a few years after they separate, rather than 23. When Ravenal leaves Magnolia in Chicago, she is pregnant. By a chance meeting with Julie, Ravenal learns that Magnolia gave birth to his daughter. He returns to her and sees the child Kim playing. Magnolia sees them together and takes him back, and the family returns to the show boat. Joe and the chorus start singing \\"Ol' Man River\\" as the scenes unfold, then the paddlewheel starts turning in tempo with the music, as the ship heads down river. Julie is shown, viewing from a distance. She had watched the scene from the shadows.

During previews, two songs, \\"Mis'ry's Comin' Aroun\\" and \\"Let's Start the New Year\\", were cut from the show. \\"Mis'ry's Comin' Aroun\\" was published in the complete vocal scoreBlock, p. 24. and fragments of it are also heard in the scoring, notably in the original 1927 overture and in the miscegenation scene. The song \\"Be Happy, Too\\" was also cut after the Washington, D.C., tryout\\"Be Happy, Too\\", Ovrtur.com, accessed January 16, 2016 \\"Let's Start the New Year\\" was performed in the 1989 Paper Mill Playhouse production. Two songs, \\"Till Good Luck Comes My Way\\" (sung by Ravenal) and \\"Hey Feller!\\" (sung by Queenie), were written mainly to cover scenery changes. They were discarded beginning with the 1946 revival, although \\"Till Good Luck\\" was included in the 1993 Harold Prince revival of the show. The comedy song, \\"I Might Fall Back On You,\\" was also cut beginning in 1946. It was restored in the 1951 film version and several stage productions since the 1980s. On record, \\"Hey Feller!\\" appears only on the 1988 EMI album. Kern and Hammerstein wrote two new songs for revivals and three more for the 1936 film version. The Harold Fielding production in London in the early 1970s claimed to use the entire original score, but it omitted \\"Hey, Feller!\\" and \\"In Dahomey\\", among others. This cast album broke ground in being the first two-LP version of Show Boat ever released. The score also includes four songs not originally written for Show Boat: \\"Bill\\" was originally written by Kern and P. G. Wodehouse in 1917 and was reworked by Hammerstein for Show Boat. Two other songs not by Kern and Hammerstein, \\"Goodbye, My Lady Love\\" by Joseph E. Howard and \\"After the Ball\\" by Charles K. Harris, were included by the authors for historical atmosphere and are included in revivals. The New Year's Eve scene features an instrumental version of \\"There'll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight\\". Some of the following numbers have been cut or revised in subsequent productions, as noted below (the songs \\"Ol' Man River\\", \\"Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man\\", and \\"Bill\\" have been included in every stage and film production of Show Boat): * Overture ‚Äì The original overture, used in all stage productions up to 1946 (and heard on the three-disc EMI/Angel CD for the first time in nearly 50 years), is based chiefly on the deleted song \\"Mis'ry's Comin' Round\\", as Kern wanted to save this song in some form. The song was restored in the Harold Prince 1994 revival of the show. The overture also contains fragments of \\"Ol' Man River\\", \\"Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man\\", and a faster arrangement of \\"Why Do I Love You?\\" The overtures for the 1946 revival and the 1966 Lincoln Center revival consist of medleys of songs from the show. All three overtures were arranged by the show's orchestrator, Robert Russell Bennett, who orchestrated most of Kern's later shows. * \\"Cotton Blossom\\" ‚Äì This number is performed in all the stage productions, and shorter versions were used in the 1936 and 1951 film versions.Raymond Knapp. The American Musical, 2005: Princeton University Press. It was not used in the 1929 film version. * \\"Where's the Mate for Me?\\" ‚Äì Ravenal's first song; heard in all stage versions, partially sung in the 1936 film version, and sung complete in the 1951 film version. Not sung in the 1929 film version. * \\"Make Believe\\" ‚Äì Performed in all stage versions, and in the 1936 and 1951 film versions, but not the 1929 film version. * \\"Life Upon the Wicked Stage\\" ‚Äì This comic song is usually included in stage versions but is heard in the 1936 film only in the orchestral score. Not included in the 1929 film, it is sung and danced in the 1951 film version. * \\"Till Good Luck Comes My Way\\" ‚Äì Kern and Hammerstein cut it from the 1946 revival, but it was reinstated in the 1971 London stage revival. It is performed instrumentally in the 1936 film and is omitted altogether in the 1929 and 1951 films. * \\"I Might Fall Back on You\\" ‚Äì This was usually cut after 1946, but it has been reinstated in revivals beginning in 1966. It was absent from the 1929 and 1936 films but included in the 1951 film. * \\"C'mon Folks (Queenie's Ballyhoo)\\" ‚Äì Always included in the show, it was sung in the prologue to the 1929 film version, It was omitted from the 1936 film and performed instrumentally in the 1951 film. * \\"Olio Dance\\" ‚Äì This is rarely performed now, since it was composed simply to cover a change of scenery. It is an orchestral piece that partially uses the melody of \\"I Might Fall Back on You\\" and can be heard on the EMI 3-CD album (as \\"Villain Dance\\"). The 1936 film substituted the new Kern-Hammerstein number \\"Gallivantin' Around\\", performed as an olio by Irene Dunne (as Magnolia) in blackface. It was omitted from the 1989 PBS Paper Mill Playhouse production. Some modern productions move the song \\"I Might Fall Back on You\\" to this spot. * \\"You Are Love\\" ‚Äì Kern considered this popular waltz to be the score's weakest song: he tried unsuccessfully to eliminate it from the 1936 film version. It has never been cut from any stage production. It was shortened, and the introductory section was omitted, in both the 1936 and the 1951 films. It was not performed in the 1929 film. * \\"Act I Finale\\" ‚Äì This was shortened in the 1936 film and omitted from the 1929 and 1951 films. Its midsection, banjo-dominant, buck- and-wing dance theme became a repeating motif in the 1951 film, played onstage during the backstage miscegenation scene, and later as a soft-shoe dance for Cap'n Andy and granddaughter Kim. * \\"At the Chicago World's Fair\\" ‚Äì Used in all stage productions except for the Harold Prince 1994 revival, it was omitted from all the film versions, but an instrumental version was performed in the 1936 film. * \\"Why Do I Love You?\\" ‚Äì Used in all stage versions, this number was sung during the exit music to the 1929 film; it was performed only as background music for the 1936 film and was sung in the 1951 film version. In the 1994 Hal Prince revival, it was sung by Parthy. * \\"In Dahomey\\" ‚Äì This was cut from the score after the 1946 Broadway production and has not been revived as it is viewed as racially offensive as well as unnecessary to the plot. It is sung at the Chicago World's Fair by a group of supposedly African natives. They chant in a supposed African language before breaking into modern English, singing about how glad they are to return to their apartments after the day's performance. It was not used in any film version of the show but was included in the complete 1988 EMI recording and in a 1993 studio recording on the Jay label of the 1946 score. * \\"Goodbye, My Lady Love\\" ‚Äì This is used only in American productions. It is included in the 1936 film, but not in the 1929 or 1951 films. * \\"After the Ball\\" ‚Äì Performed in all stage productions and in both the 1936 and 1951 films, but not the 1929 one. * \\"Hey, Feller\\" ‚Äì Used in nearly all stage productions up until 1946, and sung in the prologue to the 1929 film. Not used in the 1936 film, but used as background score in the 1951 film during the opening post-credits scene as the show boat arrives. Additional numbers have been included in films and revivals as follows: * \\"Mis'ry's Comin' Round\\" ‚Äì Though this was cut from the original production, Kern ensured that it was published in the complete vocal score. The 1988 album reinstated it, and it was also included in the 1994 Hal Prince revival. * \\"Let's Start the New Year\\" ‚Äì Cut from the original production but performed in the 1989 Paper Mill Playhouse production. * \\"I Have The Room Above Her\\" is a romantic duet written by Kern and Hammerstein for Ravenal and Magnolia in the 1936 film. It was included in the 1994 Broadway revival. * \\"Gallivantin' Around\\" is a cakewalk-style number written by Kern and Hammerstein for Magnolia for the 1936 film. * \\"Ah Still Suits Me\\" is a comic duet written by Kern and Hammerstein for the 1936 film and sung by the characters Joe and Queenie (Paul Robeson and Hattie McDaniel). The number was also included in the 1989 Paper Mill Playhouse production. * \\"Nobody Else But Me\\" was written by Kern and Hammerstein for the 1946 Broadway revival, to be sung in the spot where Kim usually sings a reprise of \\"Why Do I Love You\\". This was the last song written by Kern; he died shortly before the 1946 production opened. In the 1971 London stage revival, the song was sung by Julie, in a new scene written especially for that production. It is not sung in any film version of the show but was frequently heard in stage revivals up until about the 1980s. * \\"Dandies on Parade\\" is a dance number arranged for the 1994 Broadway production by David Krane, largely from Kern's music. Principal roles *Cap'n Andy Hawks, the owner and captain of the Cotton Blossom show boat. He is the husband of Parthy Ann, and the father of Magnolia. *Magnolia Hawks, the daughter of Parthy and Cap'n Andy. She marries Gaylord Ravenal and becomes the mother of Kim. *Gaylord Ravenal, a handsome river boat gambler. Later, the husband of Magnolia and father of Kim. *Julie La Verne, the leading lady of the troupe and the wife of Steve. *Steve Baker, the leading man of the Cotton Blossom and protective husband of Julie. *Parthy Ann Hawks, the stern wife of Cap'n Andy. *Pete, the tough engineer of the Cotton Blossom who tries to flirt with Julie. *Joe, a dock worker on the boat, and the husband of Queenie. *Queenie, the ship's cook and the wife of Joe. *Frank Schultz, a performer on the boat who often plays the villain characters. He is married to Ellie. *Ellie, a singer and dancer in an act with her husband Frank. *Kim, the daughter of Magnolia and Gaylord. *Windy McClain, the pilot of the Cotton Blossom. Production history=Original 1927 production Scene from the original Broadway production Ziegfeld previewed the show in a pre-Broadway tour from November 15 to December 19, 1927. The locations included the National Theatre in Washington, D.C., the Nixon Theatre in Pittsburgh, the Ohio Theatre in Cleveland, and the Erlanger Theatre in Philadelphia.Vancheri, Barbara. \\"'Show Boat' continues successful voyage\\". Post-Gazette, August 23, 1998. Retrieved January 6, 2006.Kreuger, Miles (1977). Show Boat: The Story of a Classic American Musical. New York: Oxford University Press. pp. 226‚Äì27. The show opened on Broadway at the Ziegfeld Theatre on December 27, 1927. The critics were immediately enthusiastic, and the show was a great popular success, running a year and a half, for a total of 572 performances. The production was staged by Oscar Hammerstein II.Zeke Colvan was officially credited as director of the production, but in his 1977 book Show Boat: The History of a Classic American Musical, musical historian Miles Kreuger says that when he interviewed Oscar Hammerstein II months before the latter's death, the always modest Hammerstein admitted that now that Colvan was dead, he could finally state that it was he (Hammerstein) who had directed the original production of the show, and that Colvan had actually served as stage manager. Choreography for the show was by Sammy Lee. The original cast included Norma Terris as Magnolia Hawks and her daughter Kim (as an adult), Howard Marsh as Gaylord Ravenal, Helen Morgan as Julie LaVerne, Jules Bledsoe as Joe, Charles Winninger as Cap'n Andy Hawks, Edna May Oliver as Parthy Ann Hawks, Sammy White as Frank Schultz, Eva Puck as Ellie May Chipley, and Tess Gardella as Queenie. The orchestrator was Robert Russell Bennett, and the conductor was Victor Baravalle. The scenic design for the original production was by Joseph Urban, who had worked with Ziegfeld for many years in his Follies and had designed the elaborate new Ziegfeld Theatre itself. Costumes were designed by John Harkrider. In his opening night review for the New York Times, Brooks Atkinson called the book's adaptation \\"intelligently made\\", and the production one of \\"unimpeachable skill and taste\\". He termed Terris \\"a revelation\\"; Winninger \\"extraordinarily persuasive and convincing\\"; and Bledsoe's singing \\"remarkably effective\\". Paul Robeson The character Joe, the stevedore who sings \\"Ol' Man River\\", was expanded from the novel and written specifically by Kern and Hammerstein for Paul Robeson, already a noted actor and singer. Although he is the actor most identified with the role and the song, he was unavailable for the original production due to its opening delay. Jules Bledsoe premiered the part. Robeson played Joe in four notable productions of Show Boat: the 1928 London premier production, the 1932 Broadway revival, the 1936 film version and a 1940 stage revival in Los Angeles. Reviewing the 1932 Broadway revival, the critic Brooks Atkinson described Robeson's performance: \\"Mr. Robeson has a touch of genius. It is not merely his voice, which is one of the richest organs on the stage. It is his understanding that gives 'Old Man River' an epic lift. When he sings...you realize that Jerome Kern's spiritual has reached its final expression.\\" American revivals and 1936 film Opening title from the 1936 film version. After closing at the Ziegfeld Theatre in 1929, the original production toured extensively. The national company is notable for including Irene Dunne as Magnolia. Hattie McDaniel played Queenie in a 1933 West Coast production, joined by tenor Allan Jones as Ravenal.\\"Show Boat\\", Criterion Collection, Accessed November 27, 2012 Dunne was soon offered a contract by RKO Studios and appeared in the 1936 Universal Studios film adaptation of Show Boat, as did Jones as Ravenal, McDaniel as Queenie and Robeson as Joe. The film also featured Winninger (Cap'n Andy), Morgan (Julie), White (Frank), and Francis X. Mahoney (Rubberface) recreating their original Broadway stage roles.Show Boat, IMDB.com, Accessed November 27, 2012 Show Boat was revived by Ziegfeld on Broadway in 1932 at the Casino Theatre with most of the original cast, but with Paul Robeson as JoeAdvertisement for Show Boat 1932, Global Performing Arts Database, accessed April 29, 2010 and Dennis King as Ravenal. In 1946, a major new Broadway revival was produced by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II at the show's original home, the Ziegfeld Theatre. The 1946 revival featured a revised score and new song by Kern and Hammerstein, and a new overture and orchestrations by Robert Russell Bennett. The show was directed by Hammerstein and Hassard Short and featured Jan Clayton (Magnolia), Charles Fredricks (Ravenal), Carol Bruce (Julie), Kenneth Spencer (Joe), Helen Dowdy (Queenie), and Buddy Ebsen (Frank). The successful production ran for 418 performances and then toured extensively. Kern, however, died just weeks before the January 5, 1946 opening, making it the last show he worked on. Additional New York revivals were produced in 1948 and 1954 at the New York City Center. The Music Theater of Lincoln Center company produced Show Boat in 1966 at the New York State Theater in a new production. It starred Barbara Cook (Magnolia), Constance Towers (Julie), Stephen Douglass (Ravenal), David Wayne (Cap'n Andy), Margaret Hamilton (Parthy) and William Warfield (Joe). It was produced by Richard Rodgers, and Robert Russell Bennett once again provided a new overture and revised orchestrations. 1983 brought a production at the Kennedy Center, Washington, D.C., that starred Mickey Rooney as Cap'n Andy, and another at the Uris Theatre in New York. The latter revival was presented by Douglas Urbanski and starred Donald O'Connor as Cap'n Andy. In 1989 the Paper Mill Playhouse of Millburn, New Jersey, mounted a production which was noted for its intention to restore the show in accordance with the creators' original intentions. The production restored part of the original 1927 overture and one number discarded from the show after the Broadway opening, as well as the song Ah Still Suits Me, written by Kern and Hammerstein for the 1936 film version. It was directed by Robert Johanson and starred Eddie Bracken as Cap'n Andy. The Paper Mill production was preserved on videotape and broadcast on PBS. Livent Inc. presented the most recent major production of Show Boat on Broadway in 1994. Produced and directed by Harold Prince, it premiered in Toronto, Ontario, in 1993 prior to opening in New York on October 2, 1994, at the George Gershwin Theatre. It ran for 947 performances, Broadway's longest-running Show Boat to date. This production went on tour, playing at the Kennedy Center; and it was also staged in London and Melbourne, Australia. Prince's production revived interest in the show by tightening the book, dropping and adding songs cut in various productions, and highlighting its racial elements. Perhaps the most notable change in the score was Prince's transforming \\"Why Do I Love You?\\" from a duet between Magnolia and Ravenal to a lullaby sung by Parthy Ann to Magnolia's baby girl. The change was partly to accommodate the song's being performed by stage actress Elaine Stritch. The love duet for Magnolia and Ravenal, \\"I Have the Room Above Her\\", originally written by Kern and Hammerstein for the 1936 film, was added to the production. Two new mime and dance \\"Montages\\" in Act 2 depicted the passage of time through changing styles of dance and music. London productions The original London West End production of Show Boat opened May 3, 1928, at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and featured among the cast, Cedric Hardwicke as Capt. Andy, Edith Day as Magnolia, Paul Robeson as Joe, and Alberta Hunter as Queenie. Mabel Mercer, later famed as a cabaret singer, was in the chorus. Other West End presentations include a 1971 production at the Adelphi Theatre, which ran for 909 performances. The Hal Prince production ran at the Prince Edward Theatre in 1998,\\"'Show Boat', Prince Edward Theatre, 1998\\" albemarle-london.com, accessed August 10, 2012 and was nominated for the Olivier Award, Outstanding Musical Production (1999).\\"Olivier Winners 1999\\" olivierawards.com, accessed August 10, 2012 Other notable revivals in England have included the joint Opera North/Royal Shakespeare Company production of 1989, which ran at the London Palladium in 1990, and the 2006 production directed by Francesca Zambello, presented by Raymond Gubbay at London's Royal Albert Hall. It was the first fully staged musical production in the history of that venue. A production was transferred from Sheffield's Crucible Theatre to London's New London Theatre with previews beginning on April 9, 2016, and an official opening on April 25, 2016. It was directed by Daniel Evans using the Goodspeed Musicals version of the show. The cast included Gina Beck as Magnolia, Lucy Briers as Parthy Ann and Malcolm Sinclair as Cap'n Andy.\\"West End transfer for critically acclaimed Show Boat\\", Best of Theatre, February 11, 2016Billington, Michael. \\"Show Boat: the classic musical still shipshape after all these years\\", The Guardian, April 26, 2016 Despite very favorable reviews, the show closed at the end of August 2016.\\"Despite five-star reviews, Show Boat closes five months early on 27 Aug\\", StageFaves.com, May 10, 2016 Adaptations=Film and television Show Boat has been adapted for film three times, and for television once. French poster from the 1951 MGM film version of \\"Show Boat\\" * 1929 Show Boat. Universal. Released in silent and partial sound versions. Not a film version of the musical; its plot is based on the original Edna Ferber novel. Immediately after the silent film was completed, a prologue with some music from the show was filmed and added to a part-talkie version of the same film, which was released with two sound sequences. * 1936 Show Boat. Universal. Directed by James Whale. A mostly faithful film version of the show, featuring four members of the original Broadway cast. Screenplay by Oscar Hammerstein II; music arrangements by Robert Russell Bennett; music direction and conducting by Victor Baraville. * 1946 Till the Clouds Roll By. MGM. In this fictionalized film biography of composer Jerome Kern (played by Robert Walker), Show Boat's 1927 opening night on Broadway is depicted in a lavishly staged fifteen-minute medley of six of the show's songs. The number features Kathryn Grayson, Tony Martin, Lena Horne, Virginia O'Brien, Caleb Peterson, and William Halligan as, respectively, Magnolia, Ravenal, Julie, Ellie, Joe, and Cap'n Andy. * 1951 Show Boat. MGM. Somewhat revised Technicolor film version. Follows the basic storyline and contains many songs from the show but makes many changes in the details of plot and character. The most financially successful and frequently revived of the three film versions. * 1989 A live performance by the Paper Mill Playhouse was videotaped for television and shown on Great Performances on PBS. It contains more of the songs (and fewer cuts) than any of the film versions. It includes the choral number \\"Let's Start the New Year\\", which was dropped from the show before its Broadway opening, and \\"Ah Still Suits Me\\", a song written by Kern and Hammerstein for the 1936 film version of the show. Radio Show Boat was adapted for live radio at least seven times. Due to network censorship rules, many of the radio productions eliminated the miscegenation aspect of the plot. Notable exceptions were the 1940 Cavalcade of America broadcast and the 1952 Lux Radio Theatre broadcast. * The Campbell Playhouse (CBS Radio, March 31, 1939). Directed and introduced by Orson Welles. This was a non-musical version of the story that was based more closely on Edna Ferber's novel than on the musical. From the original stage cast Helen Morgan repeated her portrayal of Julie, here singing one song not from the musical. Welles portrayed Cap'n Andy, Margaret Sullavan was Magnolia, and author Edna Ferber made her acting debut as Parthy. This version made Julie into an illegal alien who must be deported. * Cavalcade of America (NBC Radio, May 28, 1940). A half-hour dramatization with Jeanette Nolan, John McIntire, Agnes Moorehead and the Ken Christy Chorus. Although brief, it was remarkably faithful to the original show. * Lux Radio Theatre (CBS, June 1940). Introduced and produced by Cecil B. DeMille, it featured Irene Dunne, Allan Jones, and Charles Winninger, all of whom were in the 1936 film version. In this condensed version some songs from the show were sung, but Julie was played by a non-singing Gloria Holden. This version made the biracial Julie a single woman. Only a few lines of Ol' Man River were heard, sung by a chorus. While supposedly based on the 1936 film, this production used the ending of the original show, which the film did not use. * Radio Hall of Fame (1944). This production featured Kathryn Grayson, playing Magnolia for the first time. Also in the cast were Allan Jones as Ravenal, Helen Forrest as Julie, Charles Winninger as Cap'n Andy, Ernest Whitman as Joe, and Elvia Allman as Parthy. * The Railroad Hour (ABC Radio, 1950). Condensed to a half-hour, this version featured singers Dorothy Kirsten, Gordon MacRae, and Lucille Norman. \\"Ol' Man River\\" was sung by MacRae instead of by an African-American singer. Explanation of Julie and Steve's departure went completely unmentioned in this version. * Lux Radio Theatre (CBS, February 1952). A radio version of the 1951 MGM film featuring Kathryn Grayson, Ava Gardner, Howard Keel, and William Warfield from the film's cast. Jay C. Flippen portrayed Cap'n Andy. This version was extremely faithful to the 1951 film adaptation. * In 2011, a two- part version was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in the Classic Serial spot. Solely based on the novel by Edna Ferber, it was dramatized by Moya O'Shea, and was produced and directed by Tracey Neale. It starred Samantha Spiro as Magnolia, Ryan McCluskey as Ravenal, Nonso Anozie as Joe, Tracy Ifeachor as Queenie, Laurel Lefkow as Parthy, Morgan Deare as Cap'n Andy and Lysette Anthony as Kim. Original music was by Neil Brand.\\"'Show Boat', Episode 1 of 2, 20 Feb 2011 and 26 Feb 2011\\" bbc.co.uk, accessed Febriaru 21, 2011 * On June 16, 2012, a revival of the musical by Lyric Opera of Chicago was broadcast by WFMT-Radio of Chicago. This production of Show Boat reinstated the songs Mis'ry's Comin' Round, Till Good Luck Comes My Way and Hey, Feller!. It marked the first time a virtually complete version of Show Boat had ever been broadcast on radio. Concert hall * In 1941, the Cleveland Orchestra, under the direction of Artur Rodzi≈Ñski, premiered the orchestral work Show Boat: A Scenario for Orchestra , a 22-minute orchestral work weaving together many themes from the show. Rodzi≈Ñski and the orchestra recorded it that same yearhttps://archive.org/details/KernShowBoat-AScenarioForOrchestra and there have been several modern recordings of the work since, notably one by John Mauceri and the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra. Selected recordings Lena Horne as Julie LaVerne in a scene from Show Boat in Till the Clouds Roll By (1946) * 1928 ‚Äì original London cast album, with the show's original orchestrations. This was released in England on 78 rpm records years before being sold in the United States. Because the U.S. had not yet begun making original cast albums of Broadway shows, the 1927 Broadway cast as a whole was never recorded performing the songs, although Jules Bledsoe, Helen Morgan, and Tess Gardella did record individual numbers from it. The cast on the 1928 London album included Edith Day, Howett Worster, Marie Burke and Alberta Hunter. Due to contractual restrictions, cast member Paul Robeson was replaced on the album as Joe by his understudy, baritone Norris Smith. But that same year, Robeson, with the same chorus that accompanied him in the show, did record \\"Ol' Man River\\" in its original orchestration. That recording was later released separately. His rendition appears on the EMI CD \\"Paul Robeson Sings 'Ol' Man River' and Other Favorites\\". * 1932 ‚Äì studio cast recording on 78rpm by Brunswick Records. Later re-released by Columbia Records on 78rpm, 33-1/3rpm and briefly on CD. This recording featured Helen Morgan, Paul Robeson, James Melton, Frank Munn, and Countess Olga Albani, and was issued in conjunction with the 1932 revival of the show, although it was not strictly an \\"original cast\\" album of that revival. The orchestra was conducted by Victor Young, and the original orchestrations and vocal arrangements were not used. * 1946 ‚Äì Broadway revival cast recording. Issued on 78rpm, LP and CD. The 78-RPM and LP versions were issued by Columbia, the CD by Sony. This was the first American recording of Show Boat which used the cast, conductor, and orchestrations of a major Broadway revival of the show. (Robert Russell Bennett's orchestrations for this revival thoroughly modified his original 1927 orchestrations.) Jan Clayton, Carol Bruce, Charles Fredericks, Kenneth Spencer, and Colette Lyons were featured. Buddy Ebsen also appeared in the revival, but not on the album. Includes the new song \\"Nobody Else But Me\\". * 1951 ‚Äì MGM Records soundtrack album, with cast members of the 1951 film version. The first film soundtrack of Show Boat to be issued on records. Appeared both on 45rpm and 33-1/3rpm, later on CD in a much expanded edition. Actress Ava Gardner, whose singing voice was replaced by Annette Warren's in the film, is heard singing on this album. The expanded version on CD contains both Warren's and Gardner's vocal tracks. This marked the recording debut of William Warfield, who played Joe and sang \\"Ol' Man River\\" in the film. Orchestrations were by Conrad Salinger, Robert Franklyn, and Alexander Courage. * 1956 ‚Äì RCA Victor studio cast album conducted by Lehman Engel. This album featured more of the score on one LP than had been previously recorded. It featured a white singer, famed American baritone Robert Merrill, as both Joe and Gaylord Ravenal. Other singers included Patrice Munsel as Magnolia and Rise Stevens as Julie. Issued on CD in 2009, but omitting Frank and Ellie's numbers, which had been sung on the LP version by Janet Pavek and Kevin Scott.https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002QEXN0M The original orchestrations were not used. * 1958 ‚Äì RCA Victor studio cast album. The first Show Boat in stereo, this recording starred Howard Keel (singing \\"Ol' Man River\\" as well as Gaylord Ravenal's songs), Anne Jeffreys, and Gogi Grant, and did not use the original orchestrations. It was issued on CD in 2010. * 1959 ‚Äì EMI British studio cast album. It featured Marlys Walters as Magnolia, Don McKay as Ravenal, Shirley Bassey as Julie, Dora Bryan as Ellie, and Inia Te Wiata singing \\"Ol' Man River\\". * 1962 ‚Äì Columbia studio cast album. Starring Barbara Cook, John Raitt, Anita Darian, and William Warfield, this was the first \\"Show Boat\\" recording issued on CD. Although Robert Russell Bennett was uncredited, this used several of his orchestrations for the 1946 revival of the show, together with some modifications. * 1966 ‚Äì Lincoln Center cast album. Issued by RCA Victor, it featured Cook, Constance Towers, Stephen Douglass, and William Warfield. Robert Russell Bennett's orchestrations were modified even further. Also available on CD. * 1971 ‚Äì London revival cast album. Jazz singer Cleo Laine, soprano Lorna Dallas, tenor Andre Jobin, and bass-baritone Thomas Carey were the leads. It used completely new orchestrations bearing almost no resemblance to Robert Russell Bennett's. This was the first 2-LP album of Show Boat. It included more of the score than had been previously put on records. Issued later on CD. * 1988 ‚Äì EMI studio cast album. This is a three-CD set which, for the first time, contained the entire score of the show, with the authentic 1927 orchestrations, uncensored lyrics, and vocal arrangements. The cast includes Frederica von Stade, Jerry Hadley, Teresa Stratas, Karla Burns, Bruce Hubbard, and Paige O'Hara. The album is conducted by John McGlinn. * 1993 ‚Äì Toronto revival cast recording, starring Rebecca Luker, Mark Jacoby, Lonette McKee, Robert Morse, Elaine Stritch and Michel Bell (as Joe). There have been many other studio cast recordings of Show Boat in addition to those mentioned above. The soundtrack of the 1936 film version has appeared on a so-called \\"bootleg\\" CD label called Xeno. Racial issues=Integration Show Boat boldly portrayed racial issues and was the first racially integrated musical, in that both black and white performers appeared and sang on stage together.Despite its technical correctness, that Show Boat deserves this title has been disputed by some. See note No. 5 and corresponding text Ziegfeld's Follies featured solo African American performers such as Bert Williams, but would not have included a black woman in the chorus. Show Boat was structured with two choruses ‚Äì a black chorus and a white chorus. One commentator noted that \\"Hammerstein uses the African-American chorus as essentially a Greek chorus, providing clear commentary on the proceedings, whereas the white choruses sing of the not- quite-real.\\"Keeling, Richard (a.k.a. musickna) (December 8, 2005). Music ‚Äì \\"Show Boat\\". Blogger.com. Retrieved January 2, 2006 In Show Boat Jerome Kern used the AABA-chorus form exclusively in songs sung by African American characters (Ole Man River, Can't Help Lovin' dat Man), a form that later would be regarded as typical of 'white' popular music.Appen, Ralf von / Frei- Hauenschild, Markus \\"AABA, Refrain, Chorus, Bridge, Prechorus ‚Äî Song Forms and their Historical Development\\".

Show Boat was the first Broadway musical to seriously depict an interracial marriage, as in Ferber's original novel, and to feature a character of mixed race who was \\"passing\\" for white. (Although the musical comedy Whoopee! (1930), starring Eddie Cantor, supposedly depicted a romance between a mixed-blood Native American man and a white woman, the man turns out to be white.Whoopee!, ibdb.com, Accessed November 27, 2012) Language and stereotypesThe word \\"nigger\\"= The show has generated controversy for the subject matter of interracial marriage, the historical portrayal of blacks working as laborers and servants in the 19th-century South, and the use of the word niggers in the lyrics (this is the first word in the opening chorus of the show). Originally the show opened with the black chorus onstage singing: ::Niggers all work on the Mississippi, ::Niggers all work while the white folks play. ::Loadin' up boats wid de bales of cotton, ::Gittin' no rest till de Judgment Day.Hammerstein, Oscar II (1927). Cotton Blossom Lyrics from Show Boat In subsequent productions, \\"niggers\\" has been changed to \\"colored folk\\", to \\"darkies\\", and in one choice, \\"Here we all\\", as in \\"Here we all work on the Mississippi. Here we all work while the white folks play.\\" In the 1966 Lincoln Center production of the show, produced two years after the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed, this section of the opening chorus was omitted rather than having words changed. The 1971 London revival used \\"Here we all work on the Mississippi\\". The 1988 CD for EMI restored the original 1927 lyric, while the Harold Prince revival chose \\"colored folk\\". The Paper Mill Playhouse production, videotaped and telecast by PBS in 1989, used the word \\"nigger\\" when said by an unsympathetic character, but otherwise used the word \\"Negro\\". Many critics believe that Kern and Hammerstein wrote the opening chorus to give a sympathetic voice to an oppressed people, and that they intended its use in an ironic way, as it had so often been used in a derogatory way. They wanted to alert the audience to the realities of racism: > 'Show Boat begins with the singing of that most reprehensible word ‚Äì nigger > ‚Äì yet this is no coon song... [it] immediately establishes race as one of > the central themes of the play. This is a protest song, more ironic than > angry perhaps, but a protest nonetheless. In the singers' hands, the word > nigger has a sardonic tone... in the very opening, Hammerstein has > established the gulf between the races, the privilege accorded the white > folks and denied the black, and a flavor of the contempt built into the very > language that whites used about African Americans. This is a very effective > scene.... These are not caricature roles; they are wise, if uneducated, > people capable of seeing and feeling more than some of the white folk around > them. > The racial situations in the play provoke thoughts of how hard it must have > been to be black in the South.

A montage in the second act showed time passing using the revolving door of the Palmer House in Chicago, with newspaper headlines being shown in quick succession, and snippets of slow motion to highlight a specific moment, accompanied by brief snippets of Ol' Man River. African-American dancers were seen performing a specific dance, and this would change to a scene showing white dancers performing the same dance. This was meant to illustrate how white performers \\"appropriated\\" the music and dancing styles of African Americans. Earlier productions of Show Boat, even the 1927 stage original and the 1936 film version, did not go this far in social commentary. During the production in Toronto, many black community leaders and their supporters expressed opposition to the show, protesting in front of the theatre, \\"shouting insults and waving placards reading SHOW BOAT SPREADS LIES AND HATE and SHOW BOAT = CULTURAL GENOCIDE\\".Henry, William A. III (November 1, 1993) Various theatre critics in New York, however, commented that Prince highlighted racial inequality in his production as to show its injustice, as well as to show the historical suffering of blacks. A critic noted that he included \\"an absolutely beautiful piece of music cut from the original production and from the movie [\\"Mis'ry's Comin' Round\\"] ... a haunting gospel melody sung by the black chorus. The addition of this number is so successful because it salutes the dignity and the pure talent of the black workers and allows them to shine for a brief moment on the center stage of the showboat\\". Analysis Many commentators, both black and non-black, view the show as an outdated and stereotypical commentary on race relations that portrays blacks in a negative or inferior position. Douglass K.

Before being president of Slovenia, he was the 13th President of the Presidency of SR Slovenia from 10 May 1990 to 23 December 1991. Kuƒçan also served as the 7th President of the League of Communists of Slovenia from May 1986 until December 1989. Early life and political beginnings Kuƒçan, one of five children, was born in a Lutheran teachers' family. He was raised in the village of Kri≈æevci, located in the largely agrarian border region of Prekmurje in the Drava Banovina of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (present-day Slovenia). His father Koloman Kuƒçan (1911‚Äì1944) died during World War II. Kuƒçan's family spent World War II in occupied Serbia, where over 58,000 other Slovenians were resettled from Slovenia by the Nazis. He later studied law at the University of Ljubljana and soon became involved in the Communist political organizations of the time. In 1968, he became the president of the Slovenian Youth Association, then secretary of the Socialist Alliance of the Working People of Slovenia (a central organization, created to unite all civil society associations under one roof) between 1974 and 1978. He rose to speaker of the National Assembly in 1978, and in 1982 he became representative for the Slovenian Communists in the League of Communists of Yugoslavia's Central Committee in Belgrade. In May 1986, he became the leader of the League of Communists of Slovenia. At that time, liberal and democratic sentiment started to grow in Slovenia, as opposed to the political atmosphere of Belgrade and Serbia under Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá. Advocating in favour of human rights and European democratic values and principles, Kuƒçan, his party and Slovenia faced increasingly severe political confrontations with Belgrade and Serbia.Communism O Nationalism!, TIME Magazine, October 24, 1988 On 23 January 1990, Kuƒçan and the Slovenian delegation left the Party Congress. This was one of the factors that eventually led to the collapse of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, one of the pillars of the political system of the Socialist Yugoslavia. Political career Kuƒçan with Vladimir Putin in 2002 Slovenia was the first of the federal units of Yugoslavia to introduce multi-party democracy and the first multi-party elections were held in April 1990. Kuƒçan was elected President of the Presidency, then a collective body, in 1990, in a ballot against the DEMOS candidate Jo≈æe Puƒçnik. Kuƒçan strongly opposed the preservation of Yugoslavia through violent means. After the concept of a loose confederation had failed to gain support by the republics of Yugoslavia, Kuƒçan favoured a controlled process of non-violent disassociation that would enable the collaboration of the former Yugoslav nations on a new, different basis. Slovenia declared its independence on 25 June 1991. In his speech on the occasion, Kuƒçan ended with the words: \\"Today dreams are allowed, tomorrow is a new day.\\" On June 26, Yugoslav army embarked on troop movements that later escalated into the Ten-Day War. At the peace talks began at Brioni, with the European Community as a mediator, the Army started its withdrawal from Slovenia. Kuƒçan represented Slovenia at the peace conference on former Yugoslavia in the Hague and Brussels which concluded that the former Yugoslav nations were free to determine their future as independent states. On May 22, 1992 Kuƒçan represented Slovenia as it became a new member of the United Nations. After the independence and the international recognition of Slovenia, Kuƒçan was elected as the first President of Slovenia in 1992 with the support of the citizens list. He won another five-year term in 1997-2002, running again as an independent and again winning the majority in the first round. His presidency ended in December 2002. He was succeeded as President by Janez Drnov≈°ek. In March 2003 Slovenia held two referendums on joining the EU and NATO. Milan Kuƒçan took an active part in campaigning for these memberships, in order for Slovenia to achieve the goals it had set upon its independence. In May 2004, Slovenia became a full member of both the EU and NATO. Kuƒçan at the 2010 state commemoration of the Reformation day with Danilo T√ºrk and Borut Pahor Since November 2004, Kuƒçan has been a member of the Club of Madrid,The Club of Madrid an association of former democratic statesmen that works to strengthen democratic governance. He chairs the International Collegium together with Michel Rocard, former French Prime Minister. Since 2004 he is the chairman of Forum 21, a Slovene left-wing think-tank reflecting on issues of relevance for the future development of Slovenia and its position in a global society. Kuƒçan is also a Member of the European Council on Tolerance and Reconciliation, a not-for-profit organization established in 2008 to monitor tolerance in Europe and make recommendations on fighting xenophobia and intolerance on the continent.

It is the largest marathon in the world, with 53,508 finishers in 2019 and 98,247 applicants for the 2017 race. Along with the Boston Marathon, it is among the pre-eminent long-distance annual running events in the United States and is one of the World Marathon Majors. The race is organized by New York Road Runners and has been run every year since 1970, with the exception of 2012, when it was cancelled due to the landfall of Hurricane Sandy, and 2020, when it was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The race is held on the first Sunday of November and attracts professional competitors and amateurs from all over the world. Because of the popularity of the race, participation is chosen largely by a lottery system. Guaranteed entry to the marathon can be gained by satisfying the requirements of the 9+1 program or the 9+$1K program (where NYRR members run in nine sponsored races and either volunteer at another event or donate $1,000 to support NYRR programs for young athletes), having completed 15 or more previous NYC Marathons, or meeting time qualification standards. In addition, runners can gain an entry by joining a team to raise funds for one of a number of charities. History Paula Radcliffe, the victor of the women's division in the 2007 NYC Marathon. The first New York City Marathon was held on September 13, 1970, organized by New York Road Runners presidents Fred Lebow and Vincent Chiappetta, with 127 competitors running several loops around the Park Drive of Central Park. Only about 100 spectators watched Gary Muhrcke win the race in 2:31:38. In fact, a total of only 55 runners crossed the finish line.\\"History of the New York City Marathon\\", New York City Marathon website, retrieved November 2, 2018. Over the years, the marathon grew larger and larger. To celebrate the U.S. bicentennial in 1976, city auditor George Spitz proposed that the race traverse all five boroughs. With the support of Manhattan Borough President Percy Sutton, the men convinced Mayor Abraham Beame and, eventually, race director Fred Lebow. The race was a huge success, and what was intended as a one-time celebration, became the annual course. Dick Traum became the first person to complete a marathon with a prosthetic leg when he finished the 1976 New York City Marathon. The marathon grew in popularity two years later when Norwegian Grete Waitz broke the women's world record, finishing in 2:32:30. She went on to win the race an unprecedented nine times. An official wheelchair and handcycle division was introduced in 2000, and starting in 2002, the elite women are given a 35-minute head start before the elite men and rest of the field. Beginning in 1976, the race was run in late October and continued to be held in late October until 1986, when the race day was moved to November. The earliest race day was the marathon's first; the latest date in the season of the marathon was November 14, 1993. The hottest year for the race was 1979, when the race day of October 21 reached 80 ¬∞F (27 ¬∞C). The coldest race was in 1995, when the race day of November 12 only reached 43 ¬∞F (6 ¬∞C), with a strong wind chill. The New York City Marathon has now become the largest marathon anywhere in the world. Each year nearly two million spectators line the course. Prior to 2013, the marathon was broadcast live in the New York area on WNBC, and on Universal Sports for the entire country, However, in 2013, WABC-TV and ESPN announced they would begin broadcasting the New York City Marathon. The Marathon can also be watched online.  Course = Initial course  The race was founded by Fred Lebow. Ted Corbitt helped plan the course of the New York City Marathon. . The initial course of 1970 consisted of repeated racing around Central Park. As per Ted Corbitt, who measured the original course: > The final measurements of the original New York City Marathon course, > Manhattan‚Äôs Central Park, were done the evening of September 8, 1970, after > work and training day, using the Calibrated Bicycle Method of Measuring. The > course consisted of a start-up, out and back loop of 0.79 mile, from W. 67th > St. and Central Park West, near the Tavern-on-the-Green Restaurant, up to > the 72nd St. and the West Drive intersection and return to the Tavern-on-the > Green followed by a loop of 1.695 miles; then four 5.935 mile loops, > totaling 26.225 miles (11 yards over distance), ending at the Tavern-on-the > Green Restaurant.  Five borough course  Course of the New York City Marathon 2013; this is similar to the courses used in previous years. From 1976, the course covers all five boroughs of New York City. It begins on Staten Island, in Fort Wadsworth, near the approach to the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge. The bridge, which normally carries only vehicular traffic, is closed for the event. Runners use both sides of the upper level of the bridge and the westbound side of the lower level. In the opening minutes of the race, the bridge is filled with runners, creating a dramatic spectacle that is closely associated with the event. After descending the bridge, the course winds through Brooklyn, mostly along Fourth Avenue and Bedford Avenue, for approximately the next . Runners pass through a variety of neighborhoods, including: Bay Ridge, Sunset Park, Park Slope, Bedford‚ÄìStuyvesant, Williamsburg, and Greenpoint. At , runners cross the Pulaski Bridge, marking the halfway point of the race and the entrance into Long Island City in Queens. After about in Queens, runners cross the East River via the Queensboro (59th Street) Bridge into Manhattan. It is at this point in the race when many runners begin to tire, as the climb up the bridge is considered one of the most difficult points in the marathon. Reaching Manhattan after about , the race proceeds north on First Avenue, then crosses into The Bronx via the Willis Avenue Bridge. The race is only in The Bronx for one mile before returning to Manhattan as the course follows East 138th St. before crossing the Madison Avenue Bridge. It then proceeds south through Harlem down Fifth Avenue and into Central Park at East 90th St. At the southern end of the park, the race proceeds west along 59th St./Central Park South, where thousands of spectators cheer runners on during the last mile. At Columbus Circle, the race reenters the park and finishes beside Tavern on the Green. The time limit for this course is 8¬Ω hours from the 10:10 a.m. start.  Corrals and timing  In 2008, the race initiated a corral system. Professional women runners were given a separate, earlier start and the balance of the runners began in three staggered starts. The official times are those recorded by a computer chip attached to the back of the runner's bib number, which calculates when a runner crosses the start and when she crosses the finish, known as \\"net time\\" (as opposed to \\"gun time\\"). Runners also pass timing mats at 5 km intervals along the course, and e-mail notifications can be received by people following runners during the race to track their progress. Although the marathon publicity material uses miles, the timing mats are at 5 km intervals to accommodate the publishing of splits and also enabling potential world records for 20 km, 30 km and other sub-marathon distances to be recorded.  Different initial routes  Although there are three different routes taken through Bay Ridge and up Fourth Avenue in Brooklyn, all the routes eventually merge at Lafayette Avenue in Brooklyn at Mile 8, and the distance covered by the runners are the same. A runner's bib will have a color (green, orange, or blue) showing the initial route that they are assigned to, with each color having its own start village and corrals in the staging area.https://web.archive.org/web/20191014193345/https://www.nyrr.org/tcsnycmarathon/race- day/the-start Past marathons Thousands of runners on Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge.  1970s 1970= On September 13, 1970, Gary Muhrcke wins the first New York City Marathon held in Central Park in 2:31:38. 127 runners started the race and 55 finished. Nina Kuscsik, the sole woman entrant in the race, dropped out at 15 miles due to illness. =1974= On September 29, 1974, Norbert Sander and Kathrine Switzer became the only New York City residents to win the New York City Marathon, Sander winning in 2:26:30 and Switzer the women's division in 3:07:29. Future four-time NYC Marathon champion Bill Rodgers placed fifth in 2:36:00 out of 259 finishers (250 men, 9 women). =1976= After being run in Central Park from 1970 to 1975, this edition of the marathon traverses all five boroughs for the first time. There was 2,090 entrants and 1,549 finishers. Bill Rodgers, who finished 40th in the 1976 Olympic Games marathon in 2:25:14, comes back to win the NYC Marathon in a course record 2:10:10. He beat 1976 Olympic marathon silver medalist Frank Shorter who finished second by more than three minutes, Shorter clocking 2:13:12. Forty-one year old Miki Gorman is the first woman in 2:39:11, also a course record. =1977= Bill Rodgers and Miki Gorman repeat as the top male and female finishers from the year before, Rodgers winning in 2:11:28 and Gorman in 2:43:10. =1978= Bill Rodgers wins his third consecutive New York City Marathon in 2:12:12 on a warm day. Grete Waitz, the Norwegian long- distance runner, sets a new course record for women at 2:32:30 and wins her first New York Marathon. Waitz goes on to win 9 New York Marathons, the most course wins in any category to date. She is widely acknowledged for having made a significant contribution to promote marathon and long-distance running for women. The New York Road Runners club annually sponsors \\"Grete's Great Gallop,\\" a 10 kilometer race around the Central Park loop, in her honor. =1979= For the first time in NYC Marathon history, over 10,000 runners (10,477) complete the race. Bill Rodgers wins his fourth and last New York City Marathon on another warm day in 2:11:42, the temperature topping out at 80 degrees, overtaking Kirk Pfeffer who led for the first 23 1/2 miles of the race. Grete Waitz again won the women's race with a finish time of 2:27:33, becoming the first woman ever to break 2:30. In a normally trivial mistake, Rosie Ruiz was accidentally given a finish time of 2:56:29. This qualified her for the 1980 Boston Marathon, where she crossed the finish line with a record time of 2:31:56. It was quickly determined that she had not run the entire course in either race, igniting the best-known scandal in the history of modern distance running. New York Marathon chief Fred Lebow rescinded Ruiz's time after determining she had not finished the 1979 race, and officials in Boston quickly followed suit.\\"Rosie Ruiz Pulls The Ultimate Prank\\", The Boston Globe, April 22, 1980.  1980s 1980= Alberto Salazar, an NCAA cross-country champion, wins the 1980 New York City Marathon in 2:09:41. At the time this was the fastest marathon debut by an American. His performance was also a course record. He would defend his title in 1981 and 1982. Grete Waitz won her third straight NYC Marathon in 2:25:42, also setting the course record in the women's division. =1981= Alberto Salazar's 2:08:13 was initially considered to be a world's best in the marathon, but the mark was later rescinded by The Athletics Congress, now known as USA Track & Field, when the course was measured to be short by approximately . Salazar remarked in 1985 that he would continue to believe that he ran a full marathon, since the lack of crowd control forced him to run wide during his turns. He has also suggested that a change in how courses were measured after the 1981 race attributed to the discrepancy in the course length. =1983= The national television audience was treated to a thrilling race as England's Geoff Smith held a lead through the last half of the race. He was caught at the 26 mile mark in Central Park by 1972 Olympic 1500 metres bronze medalist Rod Dixon from New Zealand, who won by just 9 seconds. Dixon had been as far as 2 and a half minutes behind with 10 km to go, but steadily loomed over Smith's shoulder. The result was also one of the great \\"Thrill of Victory/Agony of Defeat\\" photos of all time as Dixon stood at the finish line celebrating with a collapsed and defeated Smith on the ground behind him. =1984= Orlando Pizzolato struggled to victory in this year's marathon on a hot day, stopping six times due to heat cramps, but still winning by over a minute in 2:14:53. This is the slowest winning time since 1976 when the New York City Marathon became a world class event. Grete Waitz won her sixth NYC Marathon in 2:29:30. =1985= Orlando Pizzolato and Grete Waitz repeated as the men's and women's winners. Pizzolato won in easier fashion than in 1984, winning in 2:11:34. Waitz won her seventh NYC Marathon in 2:28:06. =1986= This year's marathon was held in November (November 2) for the first time and has been ever since. Gianni Poli of Italy won in 2:11:06, the third year in a row the men's winner was from Italy. Grete Waitz won for the eighth time in 2:28:06. =1987= Ibrahim Hussein of Kenya won the NYC Marathon in 2:11:01, the first man from Africa to do so. Priscilla Welch of Great Britain won in 2:30:17, as Grete Waitz did not compete this year. =1988= Steve Jones of the United Kingdom wins this years event in 2:08:20, the first man from this nation to do so. Grete Waitz wins her ninth and last NYC Marathon in 2:28:07.  1990s 1990= On a warm November day (November 4) that hit 73 degrees, Douglas Wakiihuri of Kenya wins this year's event in 2:12:39. Since 1976 when the marathon became a world class event, his winning performance is the second slowest to date (Orlando Pizzolato ran 2:14:53 on a hot day in the 1984 NYC Marathon). Wanda Panfil of Poland is the top woman in 2:30:45. She is the only woman to date from Poland to win this event. Grete Waitz, attempting to win her 10th NYC Marathon, finishes fourth in 2:34:34 and then retires from competitive distance running at age 37. =1992= Grete Waitz completed her last New York Marathon with her friend and race co- founder, Fred Lebow, in celebration of Lebow's 60th birthday. Lebow had been diagnosed with brain cancer and died two years later in 1994. They both completed the race with a time of 5:32:35. Waitz would herself succumb to cancer in 2011 after what she called the toughest fight of her life. The men's winner of this year's marathon was Willie Mtolo of South Africa in 2:09:29. Lisa Ondieki of Australia was the women's winner in 2:24:40, a course record that would last for nine years. =1994= During the 1994 event, Germ√°n Silva recovered from a wrong turn seven-tenths of a mile before the finish that put him temporarily in second place 40 yards behind Benjam√≠n Paredes. He ran a 5:15 final mile, including the detour, to beat Paredes and win the event by two seconds with a time of 2:11:21. The incident earned him the nickname \\"Wrong Way Silva\\" =1995= To date, this event was the coldest NYC Marathon ever (1979 was the warmest, topping out at 80 degrees). The temperature at race time was 40 degrees and only went up a few degrees as the race progressed. Wind gusts between 30-45 mph produced a wind chill factor in the upper 20s. Both male and female winners repeated their 1994 victories. Germ√°n Silva of Mexico was victorious in 2:11:00. Tegla Loroupe of Kenya followed suit, also repeating as women's champion in 2:28:06. Loroupe the year prior was the first woman from Africa to win the NYC Marathon. =1997= The total number of finishers exceeds 30,000 (30,427) for the first time.

Tesfaye Jifar of Ethiopia set a then course record of 2:07:43, a mark that would stand until Geoffrey Mutai broke that record in 2011. On the women's side, Margaret Okayo of Kenya won, setting a then course record of 2:24:21. She would set the course record two years later that still stands. =2003= A record 34,729 people participated in the race. The top male finisher was Martin Lel of Kenya in a time of 2:10:30. The top female finisher was Margaret Okayo of Kenya in time of 2:22:31, breaking her previous course record of 2:24:21 set in 2001. In recent years, runners from Kenya have dominated the event. The top Americans were Matt Downin (2:18:48) and Sylvia Mosqueda (2:33:10), both from California. Rapper P.Diddy also ran for charity and raised $2,000,000 for the New York City Education system. =2004= The top female finisher was Britain's Paula Radcliffe in a time of 2:23:10, beating Kenya's Susan Chepkemei by 4 seconds, the closest finish up to that time. The top male was Hendrik Ramaala of South Africa with a time of 2:09:28. The top Americans were Meb Keflezighi (2nd, 2:09:53) from California and Jenny Crain (15th, 2:41:06), from Wisconsin. =2005= In the closest finish in New York City Marathon history, Paul Tergat of Kenya barely outsprinted Hendrick Ramaala of South Africa in the final meters of the race for a time of 2:09:30, beating Ramaala by one second.

However, there were very few elite American marathoners participating in 2007 because they competed the day before at the 2008 USA Men's Olympic Marathon Trials, which was held in conjunction with the New York City Marathon on some of the same course, three loops of which Trials were in Central Park. Martin Lel from Kenya won the men's race in a time of 2:09:04, completing an impressive double of the 2007 London and New York Marathons.

This was the first marathon in history with more than 40,000 official finishers, as 43,660 crossed the finish, 5,053 more than the previous best at the 2008 edition of this race.  2010s 2010= Women lead pack at mile 17 in Manhattan The 2010 New York City Marathon was held on November 7. Gebregziabher Gebremariam of Ethiopia, in his first-ever marathon, won the race after breaking away from his last rival, Emmanuel Mutai of Kenya, in the 25th mile to finish in a time of 2:08:14. The race featured 37-year-old world record holder Haile Gebrselassie, who ran with a bad knee and dropped out of the race at the 16th mile. Afterwards, he announced his retirement, but later reversed this decision. Edna Kiplagat won the women's title with a time of 2 hours, 28 minutes, 20 seconds, ahead of American Shalane Flanagan. The total number of official finishers, 44,829 (28,757 men and 16,072 women) was a new world record for a marathon race. =2011= Lead women in Brooklyn The 2011 Marathon was held on November 6. The men's event was won by Geoffrey Mutai of Kenya in a time of 2:05:05, breaking the 10-year-old course record. Second- place runner Emmanuel Mutai, also of Kenya, and third-place runner Tsegaye Kebede of Ethiopia also beat the previous record for the event, with times of 2:06:28 and 2:07:14, respectively. Geoffrey Mutai, who won the Boston Marathon earlier in the year, became the first man to win both races in course-record time in the same year. Firehiwot Dado of Ethiopia won the women's race in a time of 2:23:15, her first major marathon victory. Coming second, 4 seconds behind the leader originally from Ethiopia, but now living in the Bronx, was Bizunesh Deba with a time of 2:23:19.Top Female finishers . NYC Marathon.

Former CART champion Alex Zanardi won the handcycle class. = 2012 = The 2012 marathon was scheduled for November 4, 2012. Organizers planned to hold the event despite the Effects of Hurricane Sandy in New York the week before. On November 2, 2012, the marathon was cancelled; Mayor Michael Bloomberg explained that: \\"While holding the race would not require diverting resources from the recovery effort, it is clear that it has become the source of controversy and division... We would not want a cloud to hang over the race or its participants, and so we have decided to cancel it.\\" Three days earlier, Bloomberg said the marathon would take place. That declaration started a debate on whether to hold the race with thousands of residents still without electricity, public transportation, and other basic needs. Proponents for going ahead said that the event would give an economic and morale boost to the city, while opponents said the resources (such as food, water, and police) were better used elsewhere. Some of the entrants ended up helping with cleanup efforts. Others chose to congregate and run an informal \\"Shadow Marathon\\" in Central Park. Controversy over the cancellation of the Marathon, the timing of the announcement and the repercussions of the decision, including criticism of New York Road Runners CEO Mary Wittenberg, continued well after the 2012 race was meant to have taken place. As a resolution, all who were registered to run the 2012 race were offered three options: a refund; guaranteed, non- complimentary entry to the New York City Marathon in 2013, 2014, or 2015; or guaranteed, non-complimentary entry to the NYC Half 2013. =2013= Entering the Queensboro Bridge The 2013 New York City Marathon was run November 3, 2013.

Duplicating their London Marathon wins from April 2013, Tsegaye Kebede and Priscah Jeptoo each won $500,000 for their season-wide efforts. After the 2012 cancellation, Geoffrey Mutai returned to become the first repeat winner in 15 years (after John Kagwe in 1997-1998). Under windy conditions, his 2:08:24 was more than 3 minutes slower than in 2011. Mutai broke away around mile 22 to win by almost a minute over Ethiopian Tsegaye Kebede, who had finished third two years earlier. Jeptoo spotted Buzunesh Deba, an Ethiopian runner who has lived in the Bronx since 2009, three and a half minutes at the half-marathon mark, but came back to pass her in the 24th mile. =2014= Lead women in Greenpoint, Brooklyn The 2014 New York City Marathon was run on Sunday, November 2, 2014.

Offshore broadcasters are usually unlicenced but transmissions are legal in international waters. This is in contrast to unlicenced broadcasting on land or within a nation's territorial waters, which is usually unlawful. History The claimed first wireless broadcast of music and speech for the purpose of entertainment was transmitted from a Royal Navy craft, HMS Andromeda, in 1907. The broadcast was organized by a Lieutenant Quentin Crauford using the callsign QFP while the ship was anchored off Chatham in the Thames Estuary, England. However, the majority of offshore broadcasters have been unlicenced stations using seaborne broadcasting as a means to circumvent national broadcasting regulations, for example the practice has been used by broadcasting organizations like the Voice of America as a means of circumventing national broadcasting regulations of other nations. Unlicenced offshore commercial stations have operated off the coasts of Belgium, Denmark, Israel, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, The United Kingdom, Yugoslavia and the United States. By the late 1920s, the \\"UK government concluded that radio was such a powerful means of mass communication that it would have to be in state control\\", and gave the publicly funded BBC a monopoly on broadcasting. Because of rigid governmental controls and programming mostly consisting of serious music and highbrow issues, much of the UK population began to turn to radio stations from abroad, such as Radio Lyon, Radio Normandy, Radio Athlone, Radio Mediterranee and Radio Luxembourg, especially on Sundays, when the BBC did not carry any entertainment programmes. However, English-speaking broadcast hours were limited and parts of the UK were unable to receive most stations properly during the daytime. The earliest attempt to establish an offshore broadcaster in England occurred in 1928, when Associated Newspapers (owners of the Daily Mail) acquired the yacht Ceto and installed radio equipment. Unfortunately, the apparatus could not operate properly on board, the signal being heavily affected by the climate conditions. The transmitter was then replaced by Siemens loudspeakers and the Ceto toured England \\"broadcasting\\" gramophone records interspersed by advertising. Unauthorized offshore broadcasting stations operating from ships or fixed platforms in the coastal waters of the North Sea first appeared in 1958. There were as many as eleven such stations in the mid-1960s.HORACE B. ROBERTSON, JR. THE SUPPRESSION OF PIRATE RADIO BROADCASTING: A TEST CASE OF THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM FOR CONTROL OF ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE NATIONAL TERRITORY One of the most popular offshore radio broadcasts in Europe came from Radio Caroline, which developed out both of the strict broadcasting regulations in England in the 1960s as well as the fact the major labels had left little to no airtime to less established acts.Robert Chapman, Selling the Sixties: The Pirates and Pop Music Radio London: :Routledge, 1992 The Radio Caroline name was used to broadcast from international waters, using five different ships of three different owners, from 1964 to 1990. Radio Caroline was the brainchild of Ronan O'Rahilly, who dreamed up a way to air music by \\"unestablished\\" rock and roll artistshttp://www.radiocaroline.co.uk/#history_part_2.html Other well- known stations of the period were Radio Atlanta, Radio London, Radio 270 (broadcasting of the coast of Filey, Yorkshire) Radio 390, Radio Scotland, Radio Northsea International and Radio City. Most offshore broadcast is usually associated with European unlicenced radio stations; the trend never caught on as much in the United States as most organizations that could afford an offshore broadcasting boat would instead buy a legal station. Still, there were a few American offshore stations that made a lasting impression. The first station to broadcast in the U.S. from international waters was RXKR off of the coast of California.Yoder, Andrew R. Pirate Radio: The Incredible Saga of America's Underground, Illegal Broadcasters. Solana Beach, CA: HighText, 1996. Print. and broadcast from May 1933 until August 1933. It was operated from a cargo carrier named the S.S. City of Panama, a ship that was actually supposed to be advertising tourism in Panama to Americans from California. The operators of the ship actually broadcast popular music and advertisements, fooling the Panamanian government and eventually being shut down at the request of the U.S. Department of State.http://www.broadcasting- fleet.com/panama.htm Suppression Unlicenced Radio and TV Noordzee since August 1964 used REM island offshore platform for broadcasting aimed at the Netherlands. On December 12, 1964, a law, which split the North Sea into continental sections was passed in the Netherlands. The sea bed under REM Island, to which the structure was attached, was declared Dutch territory. Five days later, Royal Marines boarded the platform and ended the broadcasting. The Council of Europe in 1965 passed the \\"European Agreement for the Prevention of Broadcasts transmitted from Stations outside National Territories\\" to address this loophole, although some member states were slow to implement this in national law. Radio broadcasts from ships that are unauthorized under the laws of the recipient may cause radio frequencies to be unusable. This can be potentially detrimental to certain emergency and security services. The 1965 agreement was an attempt to resolve this by treaty.Oppenheim's International Law (Vol.I) (9th Edition) - Peace, 9th edition edited by Jennings, Sir Robert; Watts, Sir Arthur (19th June 2008), Part 2, Ch.6, Radio Communication and the High Seas.

He is most widely known for his long career with CBS, first for his \\"On the Road\\" segments on The CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite, and later as the first anchor of CBS News Sunday Morning, a position he held for fifteen years. Kuralt's \\"On the Road\\" segments were recognized twice with personal Peabody Awards. The first, awarded in 1968, cited those segments as heartwarming and \\"nostalgic vignettes\\"; in 1975, the award was for his work as a U.S. \\"bicentennial historian\\"; his work \\"capture[d] the individuality of the people, the dynamic growth inherent in the area, and ... the rich heritage of this great nation.\\" He shared in a third Peabody awarded to CBS News Sunday Morning. Early life and career Kuralt was born in Wilmington, North Carolina. As a boy, he won a children's sports writing contest for a local newspaper by writing about a dog that got loose on the field during a baseball game. Charles' father, Wallace H. Kuralt. Sr., moved his family to Charlotte in 1945, when he became Director of Public Welfare in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. Their house off Sharon Road, then 10 miles south of the city, was the only structure in the area. During the years he lived in that house, Kuralt became one of the youngest radio announcers in the country. Later, at Charlotte's Central High School, Kuralt was voted \\"Most Likely to Succeed.\\" In 1948, he was named one of four National Voice of Democracy winners at age 14, where he won a $500 scholarship. After graduation from Central High School in 1951, he attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he became editor of The Daily Tar Heel and joined St. Anthony Hall. While there, he appeared in a starring role in a radio program called American Adventure: A Study of Man in The New World in the episode titled \\"Hearth Fire\\", which aired on August 4, 1955. It is a telling of the advent of TVA's building lakes written by John Ehle and directed by John Clayton. After graduating from UNC, Kuralt worked as a reporter for the Charlotte News in his home state, where he wrote \\"Charles Kuralt's People,\\" a column that won him an Ernie Pyle Award. He moved to CBS in 1957 as a writer, where he became well known as the host of the Eyewitness to History series. He traveled around the world as a journalist for the network, including stints as CBS's Chief Latin American Correspondent and then as Chief West Coast Correspondent. In 1967, Kuralt and a CBS camera crew accompanied Ralph Plaisted in his first attempt to reach the North Pole by snowmobile, which resulted in the documentary To the Top of the World and his book of the same name. \\"On the Road\\" Kuralt was said to have tired of what he considered the excessive rivalry between reporters on the hard news beats: > \\"I didn't like the competitiveness or the deadline pressure,\\" he told the > Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, upon his induction into their Hall of > Fame. \\"I was sure that Dick Valeriani of NBC was sneaking around behind my > back -- and of course, he was! -- getting stories that would make me look > bad the next day. Even though I covered news for a long time, I was always > hoping I could get back to something like my little column on the Charlotte > News.\\" When he finally persuaded CBS to let him try out just such an idea for three months, it turned into a quarter-century project. \\"On the Road\\" became a regular feature on The CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite in 1967. Kuralt hit the road in a motor home (he wore out six before he was through) with a small crew and avoided the interstates in favor of the nation's back roads in search of America's people and their doings. He said, \\"Interstate highways allow you to drive coast to coast, without seeing anything\\". According to Thomas Steinbeck, the older son of John Steinbeck, the inspiration for \\"On the Road\\" was Steinbeck's Travels with Charley (whose title was initially considered as the name of Kuralt's feature). During his career, he won three Peabody awards and ten Emmy awards for journalism. He also won a George Polk Award in 1980 for National Television Reporting. CBS Sunday Morning anchor On January 28, 1979, CBS launched CBS News Sunday Morning with Kuralt as host. On October 27, 1980, he was added as host of the weekday broadcasts of CBS' Morning show as well, joined with Diane Sawyer as weekday co-host on September 28, 1981. Kuralt left the weekday broadcasts in March 1982, but continued to anchor the popular Sunday morning program until April 3, 1994, when he retired after 15 years as host and was succeeded by Charles Osgood. Retirement and death At age 60, Kuralt surprised many by retiring from CBS News. At the time, he was the longest tenured on-air personality in the News Division. However, he hinted that his retirement might not be complete. In 1995, he narrated the TLC documentary The Revolutionary War, and in early 1997, he signed on to host a syndicated, thrice-weekly, ninety-second broadcast, \\"An American Moment,\\" presenting what CNN called \\"slices of Americana.\\" Then, Kuralt also agreed to host a CBS cable broadcast show, I Remember, designed as a weekly, hour-long review of significant news from the three previous decades. He was hospitalized and died of complications from systemic lupus erythematosus at the age of 62 at New York‚ÄìPresbyterian Hospital. One of Kuralt's books was titled North Carolina Is My Home. Kuralt's younger brother Wallace, who died in December 2003, was also well-known in his home state, having been the owner of The Intimate Bookshop on Franklin Street in Chapel Hill for many years. In addition, a portion of land along the Roanoke, Tar, Neuse, Cape Fear Ecosystem, so named for the rivers that flow into the Albemarle, Currituck, and Pamlico Sounds, has been named for Kuralt, honoring his having given as much time to nature and wildlife as to people in his \\"On the Road\\" and Sunday Morning stories. Gravestones of Charles Bishop Kuralt and Petie Baird Kuralt at the Old Chapel Hill Cemetery By request in his will, Kuralt was buried on the UNC grounds in Old Chapel Hill Cemetery. The university uses a Kuralt speech in its television commercials, and it displays many of his awards and a re-creation of his office in its Journalism School. Accolades * 1994: Paul White Award, Radio Television Digital News Association * 1996: Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism Posthumous controversy Two years after his death, Kuralt's decades-long companionship with a Montana woman named Patricia Shannon was made public. Kuralt apparently had a second, \\"shadow\\" family with Shannon while his wife lived in New York City and his daughters from a previous marriage lived on the eastern seaboard. Shannon asserted that the house in Montana had been willed to her, a position upheld by the Montana Supreme Court. According to court testimony, Kuralt had met Shannon while doing a story on Pat Baker Park39¬∞32'50.1\\"N 119¬∞47'41.9\\"W in Reno, Nevada, which Shannon had promoted and volunteered to build in 1968. The park was in a low-income area of Reno that had no parks until Shannon promoted her plan. Kuralt mentions Pat Shannon and the building of the park--but not the nature of their relationship together-- in his autobiography.

He subsequently became notorious for his escape from prison in 1965, living as a fugitive for 36 years, and for his various publicity stunts while in exile. In 2001, he returned to the United Kingdom and spent several years in prison, where his health rapidly declined. Biggs was released from prison on compassionate grounds in August 2009 and died in a nursing home in December 2013. Early life Biggs was born in Stockwell, Lambeth, London, on 8 August 1929. As a child during the Second World War, he was evacuated to Flitwick, Bedfordshire, and then Cornwall. Career In 1947, at age 18, Biggs enlisted in the Royal Air Force. He was dishonourably discharged for desertion two years later, after breaking into a local chemist shop. One month after that, he was convicted of stealing a car and sentenced to prison. On his release, he took part in a failed robbery attempt of a bookmaker office in Lambeth, South London. During his incarceration in HMP Wandsworth, he met Bruce Reynolds. After his third prison sentence, Biggs tried to go straight and trained as a carpenter. In February 1960, he married 21-year-old Charmian (Brent) Powell in Swanage, the daughter of a primary school headmaster. They had three sons together. Great Train Robbery Biggs, who needed money to fund a deposit on the purchase of a house for his family, happened to be working on the house of a train driver who was about to retire. The driver has been variously identified as \\"Stan Agate\\", or because of his age, \\"Old Pete\\" or \\"Pop\\". His real name is unknown, since he was never caught. He was the one who introduced Biggs to the train robbery plot. Reynolds gave Biggs the job of arranging for Agate to move the train after it had been waylaid. On the night of the hold up, Biggs told his wife he was off logging with Reynolds in Wiltshire. The gang then stopped the mail train from Glasgow to London in the early hours of 8 August 1963, which was Biggs's 34th birthday.Life and Crimes of Ronnie Biggs: from Brazil to Belmarsh August 2009, The Guardian. Retrieved March 2011 Stan Agate was unable to operate the main line diesel-electric locomotive because he had only driven shunting locomotives on the Southern Region. Therefore, the driver of the intercepted train, Jack Mills, was coshed with an iron bar and forced to move the engine and mail carriages forward to a nearby bridge over a roadway, which had been chosen as the unloading point. Biggs's main task had been to get Agate to move the train and when it became obvious that the two were useless in that regard, they were banished to a waiting vehicle while the train was looted. Having unloaded 120 of the 128 mailbags from the train within Reynolds' allotted timetable, and returned to their hideout at Leatherslade Farm, various sources show that the robbery yielded the participants ¬£2.6 million (equivalent to ¬£49 million in 2017); Biggs's share was ¬£147,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). With their timetable brought forward due to the police investigation closing in, Biggs returned home on the following Friday, with his stash in two canvas bags. After an accomplice failed to carry out his instructions to burn down Leatherslade Farm to destroy any evidence there, Biggs's fingerprints were found on a ketchup bottle by Metropolitan Police investigators. Three weeks later, he was arrested in South London, along with 11 other members of the gang. In 1964, nine of the 15-strong gang, including Biggs, were jailed for the crime. Most received sentences of 30 years. Escape and abscondment Biggs served 15 months before escaping from Wandsworth Prison on 8 July 1965, scaling the wall with a rope ladder and dropping onto a waiting removal van. He fled to Brussels by boat then sent a note to his wife to join him in Paris where he had acquired new identity papers and was undergoing plastic surgery. During his time in prison, Charmian had started an extramarital relationship and was pregnant by the time of his escape to the Continent. Choosing to support her husband, she had an illegal abortion in London and then travelled with their two sons to Paris to join Biggs. Australia In 1966, Biggs fled to Sydney, where he lived for several months before moving to the seaside suburb of Glenelg in Adelaide, South Australia. By the time Biggs and his family arrived in 1966, they had spent all but ¬£7,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ) of his ¬£147,000 share of the train robbery proceeds: ¬£40,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ) on plastic surgery in Paris; ¬£55,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ) paid as a package deal to get him out of the UK to Australia; and the rest on legal fees and expenses. In 1967, just after their third child was born, Biggs received an anonymous letter from Britain telling him that Interpol suspected that he was in Australia and that he should move. In May 1967, the family moved to Melbourne, where he rented a house in the suburb of Blackburn North while his wife Charmian and their three sons lived in Doncaster East. Biggs had a number of jobs in Melbourne before undertaking set construction work at the GTV Channel 9 Television City studios. In October 1969, a newspaper report by a Reuters correspondent revealed that Biggs was living in Melbourne and claimed that police were closing in on him. The story led the evening news bulletin at Channel 9 and Biggs fled his home, staying with family friends in the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne. Five months later, he fled on a passenger liner from the Port of Melbourne, using the altered passport of a friend; his wife and sons remained in Australia. Twenty days later, the ship berthed in Panama and within two weeks Biggs had flown to Brazil. Following disclosure of Biggs's fathering a child in Brazil, Charmian agreed to a divorce in 1974, which was completed in 1976. Allowed by authorities to remain in Australia, she reverted to her maiden name of Brent and sold her story for ¬£40,000 to an Australian media group to enable her to purchase the rented house that the family had lived in at the time of Biggs's flight to Brazil. Charmian later undertook a degree and became an editor, publisher and journalist. Her sons‚Äîwho later visited Biggs a few times in Brazil‚Äîlive anonymously. In 2012 Charmian acted as a consultant on the five-part ITV Studios docu-drama Mrs Biggs‚Äîin which she was played by actor Sheridan Smith‚Äîwhich recounts the couple's time from first meeting to Biggs's flight to Brazil. Rio de Janeiro In 1970, when Biggs arrived in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil did not have an extradition treaty with the United Kingdom. In 1971, Biggs's eldest son, Nicholas, aged 10, died in a car crash in Melbourne.Mrs Biggs In 1974, Daily Express reporter Colin MacKenzie received information suggesting that Biggs was in Rio de Janeiro; a team consisting of MacKenzie, photographer Bill Lovelace and reporter Michael O'Flaherty confirmed this and broke the story. Scotland Yard detective Jack Slipper arrived soon afterwards, but Biggs could not be extradited because his girlfriend, nightclub dancer Raimunda de Castro, was pregnant. Brazilian law at the time did not allow a parent of a Brazilian child to be extradited.UK asks for extradition of Ronnie Biggs 30 October 1997, BBC. Retrieved August 2011 During 1974, in Rio, Biggs, an avid jazz fan, collaborated with Bruce Henri (an American double bass player), Jaime Shields, and Aureo de Souza to record Mailbag Blues, a musical narrative of his life that he intended to use as a movie soundtrack. This album was left undiscovered until it was finally released in 2004 by whatmusic.com. In April 1977 Biggs attended an informal drinks party on board the Royal Navy frigate , which was in Rio for a courtesy visit, but he was not arrested. Though in Brazil he was safe from extradition, Biggs's status as a known criminal meant he could not work, visit bars or be away from home after 10:00 p.m. To provide an income, Biggs's family hosted barbecues at his home in Rio, where tourists could meet Biggs and hear him recount his involvement in the robbery, which, in fact, was minor. Biggs was even visited by former footballer Stanley Matthews, whom Biggs afterwards invited to his apartment after hearing that he was in Rio. \\"We had tea on the small balcony at the rear of his home, and one of the first things he asked was, 'How are Charlton Athletic doing?' It turned out he had supported Charlton from being a small boy and had often seen me play at The Valley.\\"Matthews, Stanley. The Way It Was: My Autobiography, Headline, 2000 () Around this time, \\"Ronnie Biggs\\" mugs, coffee cups and T-shirts also appeared throughout Rio. Biggs recorded vocals on two songs for The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle, Julien Temple's film about the Sex Pistols. The basic tracks for \\"No One is Innocent\\" (a.k.a. \\"The Biggest Blow (A Punk Prayer)\\"/\\"Cosh The Driver\\") and \\"Belsen Was a Gas\\" were recorded with guitarist Steve Jones and drummer Paul Cook at a studio in Brazil shortly after the Sex Pistols' final performance, with overdubs added in an English studio at a later date. \\"No One is Innocent\\" was released as a single in the UK on 30 June 1978 and reached number 7 in the UK Singles Chart. The sleeve showed a British actor dressed as Nazi leader Martin Bormann playing bass with the group. Bruce, the robbery mastermind In March 1981, Biggs was kidnapped by a gang of British ex- soldiers. The boat they took him aboard suffered mechanical problems off Barbados, and the stranded kidnappers and Biggs were rescued by the Barbados coastguard and towed into port in Barbados. The kidnappers hoped to collect a reward from the British police; however, like Brazil, Barbados was found to have had no valid extradition treaty with the United Kingdom (a fact which chess player David Levy claimed to have paid lawyers to unearth) and Biggs was sent back to Brazil. In February 2006, Channel 4 aired a documentary featuring dramatisations of the attempted kidnapping and interviews with John Miller, the ex-British Army soldier who carried it out. The team was headed by security consultant Patrick King. In the documentary, King claimed that the kidnapping may have been a deniable operation. The ITN reporter Desmond Hamill paid to accompany Biggs on the private Learjet returning him to Brazil and secured an exclusive interview as well as convincing Biggs to kiss the tarmac upon landing.Daily Telegraph Obituary. Retrieved 3 May 2013 The kidnapping attempt was the subject of the film Prisoner of Rio (1988), which was co- written by Biggs. In the film Biggs was played by Paul Freeman. Biggs's son by de Castro, Michael Biggs, eventually became a member of the children's programme and music band Turma do Bal√£o M√°gico, bringing a new source of income to his father. In a short time, however, the band faded into obscurity and dissolved, leaving father and son in financial difficulty again. In 1991, Biggs sang vocals for the songs \\"Police on My Back\\" and \\"Carnival in Rio\\" by German punk band Die Toten Hosen. In 1993, Biggs sang on three tracks for the album Bajo Otra Bandera by Argentinian punk band Pilsen. In 1997 the UK and Brazil ratified an extradition treaty. Two months later, the UK Government made a formal request to the Brazilian government for Biggs's extradition. Biggs had stated that he would no longer oppose extradition. English lawyer Nigel Sangster QC travelled to Brazil to advise Biggs. The extradition request was rejected by the Brazilian Supreme Court, giving Biggs the right to live in Brazil for the rest of his life. Return to the United Kingdom In 2001 Biggs announced to The Sun newspaper that he would be willing to return to the UK. Imprisonment Having 28 years of his sentence left to serve, Biggs was aware that he would be detained upon arrival in Britain. His trip back to Britain on a private jet was paid for by The Sun newspaper, which reportedly paid Michael Biggs ¬£20,000 plus other expenses in return for exclusive rights to the news story. Biggs arrived on 7 May 2001, whereupon he was immediately arrested and re-imprisoned. His son Michael said in a press release that, contrary to some press reports, Biggs did not return to the UK simply to receive health care which was not available in Brazil, and he had friends who would have contributed to such expenses, but that it was his desire to \\"walk into a Margate pub as an Englishman and buy a pint of bitter\\". John Mills, son of train driver Jack Mills, was unforgiving: \\"I deeply resent those, including Biggs, who have made money from my father's death. Biggs should serve his punishment.\\"Kim Sengupta \\"After 36 years on the run, Biggs is back where he belongs: in jail\\", The Independent, 8 May 2001 Mills never fully recovered from his injuries sustained during the robbery. He died of an unrelated cause (leukaemia) in 1970. On 14 November 2001, Biggs petitioned Governor Hynd of HMP Belmarsh for early release on compassionate grounds based on his poor health. He had been treated four times at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, London, in less than six months. His health was deteriorating rapidly, and he asked to be released into the care of his son for his remaining days. The application was denied. On 10 August 2005, it was reported that Biggs had contracted MRSA. His representatives, seeking for his release on grounds of compassion, said that their client's death was likely to be imminent. On 26 October 2005, Home Secretary Charles Clarke declined his appeal, stating that his illness was not terminal. Home Office compassion policy is to release prisoners with three months left to live. Biggs was claimed by his son Michael to need a tube for feeding and to have \\"difficulty\\" speaking. On 4 July 2007, Biggs was moved from Belmarsh Prison to Norwich Prison on compassionate grounds. In December, Biggs issued a further appeal, from Norwich Prison, asking to be released from jail to die with his family: \\"I am an old man, and often wonder if I truly deserve the extent of my punishment. I have accepted it, and only want freedom to die with my family and not in jail. I hope Mr. Straw decides to allow me to do that. I have been in jail for a long time, and I want to die a free man. I am sorry for what happened. It has not been an easy ride over the years. Even in Brazil, I was a prisoner of my own making. There is no honour to being known as a Great Train Robber. My life has been wasted.\\" In January 2009, after a series of strokes that were said to have rendered him unable to speak or walk, it was claimed in the press that Biggs was to be released in August and would die a \\"free man\\". His son Michael had also claimed that the Parole Board might bring the release date forward to July. On 13 February that year, it was reported that Biggs had been taken to hospital from his cell at Norwich Prison, suffering from pneumonia. This was confirmed the following day by his son Michael, who said Biggs had serious pneumonia but was stable. News of his condition prompted fresh calls from his son Michael for his release on compassionate grounds. On 23 April, the Parole Board recommended that Biggs be released on 4 July, having served a third of his 30-year sentence. However, on 1 July, Straw did not accept the Parole Board's recommendation and refused parole, stating that Biggs was 'wholly unrepentant'. On 28 July, Biggs was readmitted to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital with pneumonia. He had been admitted to the same hospital a month earlier, with a chest infection and a fractured hip, but returned to prison on 17 July. His son Michael said, in one of his frequent news releases: \\"It's the worst he's ever been. The doctors have just told me to rush there.\\"Train Robber Biggs has Pneumonia BBC. 28 July 2009 On 30 July, it was claimed by representatives of Biggs that he had been given \\"permission\\" to challenge the decision to refuse him parole. However, the Home Office stated only that an application for the early release on compassionate grounds of a prisoner at HMP Norwich had been received by the public protection casework section in the National Offender Management Service.Biggs to Challenge Parole Refusal BBC Online 30 July 2009 Biggs was released from custody on 6 August, two days before his 80th birthday, on 'compassionate grounds'. Later life Following his release from prison, Biggs's health improved, leading to suggestions that he might soon be moved from hospital to a nursing home. In response to claims that Biggs's state of health had been faked, his lawyer stated, \\"This man is going to die, there is going to be no Lazarus coming back from the dead, he is ill, he is seriously ill.\\" However, Biggs himself stated, \\"I've got a bit of living to do yet. I might even surprise them all by lasting until Christmas, that would be fantastic.\\" On 29 May 2010, Biggs was again admitted to hospital in London after complaining of chest pain. He underwent tests at Barnet Hospital. His son Michael stated, \\"he's conscious but he's in a lot of pain\\".Biggs Admitted to Hospital after complaining of a chest pain, BBC News, 29 May 2010 In August 2010, it was claimed by the Sunday Mirror that Biggs would be attending a gala dinner where he would be collecting a lifetime achievement award for his services to crime.Great Train Robber Ronnie Biggs is given a lifetime achievement award for CRIME , Mirror, 1 August 2010 On 10 February 2011, Biggs was admitted to Barnet Hospital with another suspected stroke.

He was unable to speak and used a word board to communicate with the press. On 12 January 2012, ITV Studios announced it had commissioned a five-part drama, Mrs Biggs, to be based around the life of Biggs's wife Charmian, played by Sheridan Smith and Biggs by Daniel Mays. Charmian Biggs acted as a consultant on the series and travelled to Britain from Australia to visit Biggs in February 2012, just before filming for Mrs Biggs.Page 18/19 of the ITV press packThe two Mrs Biggs.

In July 2013, The Great Train Robbery 50th Anniversary: 1963‚Äì2013 was published, with input from Biggs and Reynolds. Death On 18 December 2013, aged 84, Biggs died at the Carlton Court Care Home in Barnet, north London, where he was being cared for. His death coincidentally occurred hours before the first broadcast of a two-part BBC television series The Great Train Robbery, in which Biggs was portrayed by actor Jack Gordon. Biggs's body was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 3 January 2014. The coffin was covered with the Union Flag, the flag of Brazil and a Charlton Athletic scarf. An honour guard of British Hells Angels escorted his hearse to the crematorium.

Because rabbits do not possess the same allergy-causing qualities as many other animals, their wool is an important alternative. There are at least 11 distinct breeds of Angora rabbit, four of which are currently recognized by the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA): English Angora, French Angora, Giant Angora and Satin Angora. Others include German Angora, Chinese Angora, Finnish Angora, Japanese Angora, Korean Angora, Russian Angora, St Lucian Angora and Swiss Angora. History The Angora is said to have originated in Ankara (historically known as Angora), in present-day Turkey, and is known to have been brought to France in 1723. The Angora rabbit became a popular pet of the French royalty in the mid-18th century, and Angoras had spread to other parts of Europe by the end of that century. In the United States garments made of Angora-rabbit wool have been popular ever since they first arrived in the early 20th century. But only during World War II did domestic production expand to meet the demand for more than 120,000 pounds a year. This valuable, soft silky fiber aroused much interest, and quickly people became enamoured with the production process.Hardy, T. M. P., & Dolnick, E. H. (1948). Angora rabbit wool production. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Dept. of Agriculture. The author of Domestic Rabbits & Their Histories: Breeds of the World, Bob D. Whitman, suggests that the Angora breed could date back ten centuries: \\"it has been written that the indigenous Trelicians, which were small and frail people, first bred the Angora rabbit in the southern Carpathian mountains around the 6th century.\\" This information has not been substantiated and Whitman himself acknowledges that \\"we will never know for sure\\". Angora-rabbit wool \\"[S]he earned her living by knitting rabbit-wool mittens and muffatees\\". Original text with this illustration from 290px 210px 210px Angoras are bred mainly for their wool, which is silky and soft. At only 14‚Äì16 microns in diameter, it is similar to cashmere in fineness and softness to the touch.Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. \\"Profiles of 15 of the world's major plant and animal fibres\\", Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Italy, 2009. A healthy adult Angora's wool will grow approximately per month. Regular grooming is necessary to prevent the fiber from matting and felting on the rabbit, which causes discomfort and can lead to pain and even infection. Angora wool is harvested (plucked or shorn) every three to four months throughout the year. The coat needs to be monitored after 6 months of regrowth since it may tend to \\"die\\" and easily mat. Angora wool may be gathered periodically by hand- plucking the hairs within the coat that are being naturally shed. A full harvesting is done by shearing the coat with clippers or small scissors, often while the rabbit sits atop a groomer's turntable. Shearing typically starts at the head, moving across the shoulders to the tail. The rabbit is then flipped and the underside shorn from tail to chin. Between and of wool may be harvested from a Giant Angora. Health=Wool block Because of the length and abundance of their hair, Angora rabbits are particularly susceptible to wool block, a potentially lethal blockage of the digestive tract. All rabbits ingest some of their wool when they groom themselves, but their digestive system is not able to pass that foreign matter. The length of Angora hairs compounds the risk of impaction, which can lead to death. Clipping or plucking an Angora's wool every 90‚Äì120 days is necessary to prevent wool block. Wool mites Cheyletiella parasitovorax is a skin parasite commonly found in Angora rabbits. Signs of infestation are flaky skin patches and fur loss. Wool mites reduce fiber yields and the resulting skin flakes are detrimental to the fiber quality. Wool mites may be treated with ivermectin or with carbaryl powder. Angora rabbit breeds alt= The iconic long coat of the Angora is the result of a rabbit gene referred to as l (i.e., lowercase \\"L\\"). This \\"Angora gene\\" is present in all Angora breeds. It has also sometimes been utilized in the development of other rabbit breeds or other breeds' new varieties. \\"Dwarf Wooly\\" breeds including American Fuzzy Lop, Lion Head and Jersey Woolie are now recognized in the U.S. by ARBA. Belgium and France have their own Dwarf Wooly breeds. There is also a rare Mini English Angora breed in New Zealand. English Angora * Weight: . * ARBA-recognized varieties: Agouti, Broken, Pointed White, Ruby-eyed White, Self, and Shaded 220px Before 1939 there was one breed of \\"Angora Wooler\\". In 1939 ARBA reclassified 'Angora Wooler' as English Type and French Type. In 1944 ARBA officially separated Angora rabbits into two breeds: English Angora and French Angora. Rabbits of the Angora breed are adorned with \\"fur\\", growths of wool on the ears and the entire face except above the nose, and front feet, along with their thick body, and wool. They are gentle in nature, but they are not recommended for those who do not groom their animals. Their wool is very dense and needs to be groomed twice a week. This is the smallest Angora rabbit of the four ARBA-recognized breeds. This breed is more common as a pet because of the facial features that give it a puppy or teddy-bear look. If the texture of the wool is correct, the maintenance is relatively easy; if the texture of the rabbit is cottony, it requires a great deal of maintenance. Beginning spinners may find the wool challenging. The English Angora can be bred to have broken colors‚Äîi.e., white with black spots‚Äîbut this is not accepted by ARBA standards and would lead to a disqualification when showing the rabbit. When an English Angora rabbit is shown, the toenails should also be only one color, the ears could be folded over at the tips and the furnishings on the face may cover their eyes. The English Angora is the only one of the Angora breeds that has hair covering its eyes. French Angora 150px * Weight: . * ARBA- recognized varieties: Agouti, Broken, Pointed White, Self, Shaded, Ticked, and Wide Band This breed has a dense undercoat. If the texture is correct it requires less maintenance than other Angora breeds. Small ear tufts are allowed but not usually preferred by breeders. ARBA recognizes the same colors as with English Angora, plus broken. They are shown at ARBA shows using the types 'white' and 'colored' (broken being a colored). As with other ARBA-shown rabbits, toenails should also be only one color. The French Angora is one of the large Angora breeds at 7.5 to 10 lbs, with a commercial body type. It differs from the English, Giant and German Angora in that it possesses a clean (hairless) face and front feet with only minor tufting on the rear legs. The color of a French Angora is determined by the color of its head, feet and tail (all the same color). This variety of angora fibre has smooth silky texture. Beginning spinners may find Angora wool a challenge. Desirable characteristics of the fibre include its texture, warmth, light weight and pure white color. It is used for sweaters, mittens, baby clothes and millinery.

The International Association of German Angora Rabbit Breeders (IAGARB) maintains a breed standard for the German Angora. Giant Angora * Weight: Minimum * ARBA-recognized varieties: Ruby-eyed White 300px The Giant Angora is the largest of the ARBA-recognized Angora breeds. It was originally developed to be an efficient commercial producer that could be sustained on 16‚Äì18% protein pellets plus hay, and live in the standard sized, all-wire cages. Because ARBA wouldn't allow German Angoras to be shown, their body type being considered too similar to other Angora breeds, Louise Walsh of Taunton, Massachusetts, created a new breed. She used German Angoras, French Lops and Flemish Giants to develop a completely different 'commercial' body type. ARBA officially recognized the Giant Angora in 1988. Its coat includes three types of wool: soft underwool, awn fluff and awn hair. The awn-type wool exists only in the Giant and German Angora breeds. The Giant Angora has furnishings on the face and ears. Many people confuse the German with the Giant Angora, but it is their body type that differs. The only color variety ARBA currently recognizes for the Giant Angora is the Ruby-eyed White (REW), a color that indicates the genetic absence of pigment (albino). The Giant Angora produces more wool than the French, Satin or English Angoras. The Giant Angora is the only 6-class animal in the Angora breed. It should have a commercial-type body with a very dense coat of wool. The head should be oval in appearance, that is broad across the forehead and slightly narrower at the muzzle. The Giant Angora should have forehead tufts (head trimmings) and cheek furnishings. The head trimmings should be noticeable, but does have lighter trimmings than bucks. The ears should be lightly fringed and well tasseled. The Giant Angora is also the only breed of angora that is shown only as a ruby-eyed white. A Black color variety of the Giant Angora is in development but has not been sanctioned by ARBA.Summary on the description of a Giant Angora, American Rabbit Breeders Association, Standards, spring 2012. The Giant Angora coat contains three fiber types for its texture. The underwool should be the most dominant over the other two types of hair. It should be medium-fine, soft and delicately waved and have a gentle shine. Beginning spinners may find Angora wool a challenge. The Awn Fluff has a guard hair tip and is a stronger, wavy wool. The Awn Fluff is found between the underwool and Awn Hair. The Awn Hair, also known as guard hair, is the third type of fiber. The Awn Hair is a strong straight hair that protrudes above the wool and must be present and evident. The classification of the Giant Angora is different from the other three breeds owing to it being a 6-class animal. The junior buck and junior doe must be under 6 months of age and have a minimum weight of 4 ¬æ pounds. The intermediate buck and intermediate doe are 6‚Äì8 months of age. The senior buck and senior doe are 8 months of age or over. The senior buck must weigh at least 9 ¬Ω pounds. The senior doe must weigh at least 10 pounds. When Giant Angoras are judged the majority of the points are based on the wool, which includes density, texture and length. The points for 'general type' include the body type, head, ears, eyes, feet, legs and tail. Like many other 'giant' breeds of rabbit, the Giant Angora grows slowly. A doe usually takes more than a year to reach maturity (size and weight). A buck can take up to 1.5 years to mature (size and weight).

In addition to the sheen (for which the Satin is known), true red and copper pigments emerged in the new rabbits. In all 'satinized' coats, the hair shaft has a semi-transparent outer shell that reflects light, resulting in deep color, high luster and an extremely soft and silky texture to the hairs. The Satin Angora (like the French Angora) has no furnishings on the face, ears or feet. The Satin does not produce as much wool as other Angora breeds, but this trait is being improved upon through selective breeding. While more difficult to keep groomed than the Giant or French Angora, the Satin is less difficult than the English Angora. Because of the soft texture of the wool and the lower guard-hair count in the coat, matting occurs more readily. Daily combing is therefore recommended. Satin Angora wool is said to be stronger for spinning than other Angora varieties, but because of its slipperiness it can be more difficult to spin.

He was the 6th Imam and founder of the Ja'fari school of jurisprudence according to Twelver and Isma'ili Shi'ites. To Sunnis, he is a major figure in the Hanafi and Maliki schools of Sunni jurisprudence and was a teacher of the Sunni scholars Abu Hanifah and Malik ibn Anas, a transmitter of hadiths, therefore a prominent jurist, According to Gleaves, most sources give 702 as the year of his birth, but there are some which give 699 and others which give 705. and a mystic to Sufis. Despite his wide-ranging attributions in a number religious disciplines, no works penned by Ja'far himself remain extant. Al- Sadiq was born in either 700 or 702 CE. He inherited the position of imam from his father in his mid-thirties. As a Shi‚Äôa Imam, al-Sadiq stayed out of the political conflicts that embroiled the region, evading the many requests for support that he received from rebels. He was the victim of some harassment by the Abbasid caliphs, and was eventually, according to Shi‚Äôa Muslims, poisoned at the orders of the Caliph Al-Mansur. In addition to his connection with Sunni schools of Sunni jurisprudence, he was a significant figure in the formulation of Shia doctrine. The traditions recorded from al-Sadiq are said to be more numerous than all hadiths recorded from all other Shia imams combined. As the founder of Ja'fari jurisprudence, al-Sadiq also elaborated the doctrine of Nass (divinely inspired designation of each Imam by the previous Imam) and Ismah (the infallibility of the imams), as well as that of Taqiyyah. The question of succession after al-Sadiq's death was the cause of division among Shi‚Äôa who considered his eldest son, Isma'il (who had reportedly died before his father) to be the next Imam, and those who believed his third son Musa al-Kadhim was the imam. The first group became known as the Ismailis and the second, larger, group was named Ja'fari or the Twelvers. Birth and early life Ja'far al-Sadiq was born in Medina either in 17th of Rabi-al-Awwal 83 AH (702 AD) or 80/699‚Äì700.\\"Hazrat Imam Jafar Sadiq (A.S.)\\". www.14masoomeen.org. He was a descendant of Ali ibn Abu Talib and Fatimah bint Muhammad through Hussain ibn Ali on the side of his father, Muhammad al-Baqir, and of Abu Bakr through Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr on the side of his mother, Umm Farwah bint al-Qasim. Al-Sadiq was the first of the Shi'ite Imams to be descended from both Abu Bakr, the first ruler of the Rashidun Caliphate, and Ali, the first Imam. During the first fourteen years of his life, he lived alongside his grandfather Zayn al-Abedin, and witnessed the latter's withdrawal from politics. He also noted the respect that the famous jurists of Medina held toward Zayn al-Abedin in spite of his few followers. In his mother's house, al-Sadiq also interacted with his grandfather Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr, who was respected by the people of Medina as a famous traditionalist. During this period, Umayyad power was at its climax, and the childhood of al-Sadiq was coincided with the growing interest of the people of Medina in prophetic science and interpretations of the Quran. Imamate Al- Sadiq was thirty-four or thirty-seven when he inherited the position of Imamah or Imamate upon the death of his father Muhammad al-Baqir. He held the Imamate for 28 years, longer than any other Shi'ite Imam. His Imamate was a crucial period in Islamic history for both political and doctrinal areas. Prior to al- Sadiq, the majority of Shi'ites had preferred the revolutionary politics of Zaid (his uncle) to the mystical quietism of his father and grandfather. Zaid had claimed that the position of an Imam was conditional on his appearing publicly to claim his rights. Al-Sadiq, on the other hand, elaborated the doctrine of Imamate, which says \\"Imamate is not a matter of human choice or self-assertion,\\" but that each Imam possesses a unique  øIlm () which qualifies him for the position. This knowledge was argued to have been passed down from the Islamic prophet Muhammad through the line of Ali ibn Abi Talib's immediate descendants. The doctrine of Nass or \\"divinely inspired designation of each imam by the previous imam\\", therefore, was completed by al-Sadiq. In spite of being designated as the Imam, al-Sadiq would not lay claim to the Caliphate during his lifetime. Under the Umayyad rulers Al-Sadiq's Imamate extended over the latter half of the Umayyad Caliphate, which was marked by many revolts (mostly by Shi'ite movements), and eventually the violent overthrow of the Umayyad Caliphate by the Abbasids, descendants of Muhammad's uncle Al-'Abbas. Al-Sadiq maintained his father's policy of quietism, and played no part in the numerous rebellions. He stayed out of the uprising of Zaydits who gathered around his uncle Zayd, who had the support Mu'tazilites and the traditionalists of Medina and Kufa. Al-Sadiq also did not support the rebellion led by his cousin, Muhammad al-Nafs al-Zakiyyah, who was inspired by Kaysanites. Al-Sadiq also played no part in the Abbasid rebellion against the Umayyads. His response to a message requesting help from Abu Muslim, the Khorasani leader of an uprising against the Umayyads, became famous. Al-Sadiq asked for a lamp and burned Abu Muslim's letter, saying to the envoy who brought it, \\"Tell your master what you have seen.\\" In burning Ab√ª Muslim's letter he had also said, \\"This man is not one of my men, this time is not mine.\\" Al-Sadiq also evaded requests for assistance to other claims to the throne, without advancing his own claims. He had said that even though he, as the designated Imam, was the true leader of the Ummah, he would not press his claim to the caliphate. This conscious position of neutrality was likely why Ja'far was tolerated by the Umayyad court for so long. This position also gave rise to the legal precedent of Taqiyyah. Under the Abbasid rulers The end of the Umayyad dynasty and beginning of the Abbasid was a period during which central authority was weak, allowing al-Sadiq to teach freely in a school which trained about four thousand students. A school of this size was unusual for religious teachers at this time.John B. Taylor, \\"Ja øfar al-SƒÅdiq, Spiritual Forebear of the Sufis,\\" Islamic Culture40/2, April 1966, pp. 97‚Äì113. Among these were Ab≈´ ·∏§anƒ´fah and Malik ibn Anas, founders of two major Sunni schools of law, the Hanafiyah and the Malikiyah.Phyllis G. Jestice, Holy People of the World: A Cross-cultural Encyclopedia, Volume 1, p 415. Ludwig W. Adamec, Historical Dictionary of Islam, p 12. Umar F. Abd-Allah, MƒÅlik and Medina: Islamic Legal Reasoning in the Formative Period, p 44. Wasil ibn Ata, founder of Mu\`tazila school, was also among his pupils. After the Abbasid revolution had overthrown the Umayyad caliphate, it turned against Shi'ite groups who had previously been its allies against the Umayyads. The new Abbasid rulers, who had risen to power on the basis of their descent from Muhammad's uncle Al-'Abbas, were suspicious of al-Sadiq, because Shi'ites had always believed that leadership of the Ummah was a position issued by divine order, and which was given to each imam by the previous imam. In addition, al- Sadiq had a large following, both among scholars and among those who believed him to be the imam. During rule of Al-Mansur, al-Sadiq was summoned to Baghdad, along with some other prominent men from Medina, in order for the Caliph to keep a close watch on them. Al-Sadiq, however, asked the Caliph to excuse him from going there by reciting a hadith which said that \\"the man who goes away to make a living will achieve his purpose, but he who sticks to his family will prolong his life.\\" Al-Mansur reportedly accepted his request. After the defeat and death of his cousin Muhammad al-Nafs al-Zakiyyah in 762, however, al-Sadiq thought it advisable to obey Al-Mansur's summons. After a short stay in Baghdad, however, he convinced the Caliph that he was not a threat, and was allowed to return to Medina. Toward the end of his life, he was subject to some harassment by the Abbasid caliphs. The governor of Medina was instructed by the Caliph to burn down his house, an event which reportedly did al-Sadiq no harm. To cut his ties with his followers, Al-Sadiq was also watched closely and occasionally imprisoned. Through these trials, Al-Sadiq appears to have continued his scholarship and remained an influential teacher in his native Medina and beyond. Family life Al-Sadiq married Fatimah Al- Hasan, a descendant of his ancestor Al-Hasan ibn 'Ali, with whom he had two sons, Isma'il ibn Jafar (the sixth Isma'ili Imam) and Abdullah al-Aftah. Following his wife's death, al-Sadiq purchased a Berbery or Andalusian slave named ·∏§amƒ´dah KhƒÅt≈´n (), freed her, trained her as an Islamic scholar, and then married her. She bore him two more sons: Musa al-Kadhim (the seventh Twelver Imam), and Muhammad al-Dibaj. She was revered by the Shi'ites, especially by women, for her wisdom. She was known as Hamidah the Pure. Ja'far al-Sadiq used to send women to learn the tenets of Islam from her, said that \\"Hamidah is pure from every impurity like the ingot of pure gold.\\" Al-Sadiq also had a son called \\"Is-haq al-Mu'tamin\\", who reportedly married Sayyidah Nafisah bint Al-Hasan, a descendant of Al-Hasan ibn 'Ali. Death The historical tomb of Al-Baqi' was destroyed in 1926. Ja'far al-Sadiq was one of four Shi'ite imams buried here. Al-Sadiq was arrested several times by Umayyad and Abbasid caliphs Hisham, As-Saffah, and Al-Mansur. He was particularly seen as a threat by the newly minted Abbasids who felt challenge by his strong claim to the title of caliph. When he died in 25th of Shawwal or 15th Rajab 148/765 at the age of 64 or 65, many Shi'i sources suspected that he was poisoned at the behest of Mansur. Al-Sadiq's death led to uncertainty about the succession of the Imamate. He was buried in Medina, in the famous Jannatul Baqee' cemetery, and his tomb was a place of pilgrimage until 1926. It was then that the Wahhabis under the leadership of Ibn Saud, the founding King of Saudi Arabia, conquered Medina for the second time, and razed the tomb because of the prohibition of tombs by Muhammad, along with all other prominent Islamic shrines, with the exception of that of the Islamic prophet himself. According to Tabatabai upon hearing the news of al-Sadiq's death, Mansur wanted to put an end to the Imamate. Mansur reportedly wrote to the governor of Medina, commanding him to read the imam's testament, and to behead the person named in it as the future imam. However, the governor found that al- Sadiq had chosen four people rather than one: Mansur himself, the governor, the Imam's oldest son Abdullah al-Aftah, and Musa al-Kazim, his younger son. Succession The Shi'ite group had begun to split during the lifetime of al- Sadiq, when his eldest son Isma'il ibn Jafar reportedly predeceased him, in the presence of many witnesses. After the death of Ja'far al-Sadiq, his following fractured further, with the larger group, who came to be known as the Twelvers, following his younger son Musa al-Kadhim. Another group believed instead that Isma'il had been designated as the next Imam, and that since he had predeceased his father, the Imamate had passed to Isma'il's son Muhammad ibn Ismail and his descendants. This latter group became known as the Isma'ilis. Some Isma'ilis believe that Isma'il had not actually died, but would reappear as Mahdi, the rejuvenator of Islam in the Shi'ite doctrine. Still other groups accepted either Abdullah al-Aftah or Muhammad ibn Ja'far al-Sadiq (Al-Dibaj), both sons of the Ja'far al-Sadiq, as the imam. A final group believed that al-Sadiq had been the last imam, and that the lineage had not continued. After the death of Musa al-Kazim, the majority of his followers recognized his son Ali al-Ridha as the eighth imam, while others believed that al-Kazim had been the last imam. This latter group became known as the Waqifiyah. No major divisions occurred in Shiaism from the eighth to the twelfth imam, whom the majority of the Shia (Twelvers) considered to be Muhammad al-Mahdi. Among the sects which separated from the majority, only Zaidiyyah and Ismaili continue to exist today. Religious views Al-Sadiq religious views are recorded as authority in the writing of number of contradictory positions. The use of his name as an authority within the Sufi, scientific, Sunni legal, Ismaili and extremist writings shows his importance as a figure within the development of early Muslim thought. According to Ya'qubi it was customary for anyone who wanted to relate a tradition from him to say \\"the Learned One informed us\\". Malik ibn Anas, when quoting anything from al-Sadiq, would say \\"The Thiqa (truthful) Ja'far b. Muhammad himself told me that‚Ä¶\\" the same is reported from Abu Hanifa. The works attributed to him may be of dubious authenticity, but they do establish his name at least as indicating a mastery of learning generally, and the Islamic sciences in particular. Though most groups wished to recruit al-Sadiq's legacy for their own cause, the most extensive source for his teachings is to be found within the imami Shia tradition. For Twelver Shias Ja'far al-·π¢adiq is the sixth imam who established the Shiism as serious intellectual force in the late Umayyad and early Abbasid periods. According to Tabatabai the number of traditions left behind by al-Sadiq and his father were more than all the hadiths recorded from Muhammad and all the other Shia imams combined. Shia thought starting with Sayyid Haydar Amuli, and leading to Safavid philosophers like Mir Damad, Mulla Sadra and Qazi Sa‚Äôid Qumi continuing to the present day is based on Shia imam's tradition specially al-Sadiq. According to Sa'id Akhtar Rizvi, Al-Sadiq preached against slavery. Ja'fari school of law Shia jurisprudence became known as Ja'fari jurisprudence after Ja'far al-Sadiq, whose legal dicta were the most important source of Shia law. Like Sunni law, Ja'fari jurisprudence is based on the Quran and the Hadith, and also based on the consensus (Ijma). Unlike the Sunnis, Shias give more weight to reasoning ('Aql), while Sunnis only allow for a kind of analogical reasoning (Qiyas). Al-Sadiq is presented as one who denounces personal opinion (Ra æy) and analogical reasoning (qiƒÅs) of his contemporaries arguing that God's law is occasional and unpredictable, and that the servants' duty is not to embark on reasoning in order to discover the law, but to submit to the inscrutable will of God as revealed by the imam. In his book Maqbula Omar ibn ·∏§an·∫ìala (who was a disciple of al-Sadiq) asks the imam how legal disputes within the community should be solved, and whether one should take such cases to the ruler (Sultan) and his judges. Ja'far al-Sadiq replies in the negative saying that those who take their disputes to the rulers and their judges get only so·∏•t (unlawful decision). Instead al-Sadiq recommends an unofficial system of justice for the community, and that the disputants should turn to \\"those who relate our [i.e., the imams'] Hadiths\\". The reason for this is that the imams have \\"made such a one a judge (·∏•ƒÅkem) over you.\\" Importance outside Shi'ism=Sunni Islam  Ja'far was reportedly a companion or even teacher of Sunni Imam Abu Hanifah and Malik ibn Anas, who in turn was a teacher of Sunni Imam Ash- Shafi‚Äòi, who in turn was a teacher of Sunni Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal. Also, his daughter-in-law, Sayyidah Nafisah, was a teacher of Ash-Shafi'i. Thus all of the four great Imams of Sunni Fiqh are connected to Ja'far, whether directly or indirectly. In one hadith, Abu Hanifah once said about Imam Ja'far: \\"I have not seen anyone with more knowledge than Ja'far ibn Muhammad.\\" However, in another hadith, Abu Hanifah said: \\"I met with Zayd (Ja'far's uncle) and I never saw in his generation a person more knowledgeable, as quick a thinker, or more eloquent than he was.\\" Sufism See Also: Encyclopedia Iranica: JA øFAR AL-·π¢ƒÄDEQ iii. And Sufism Ja'far Al-Sadiq holds a special prominence among Sufi orders due to his claimed connections to some of Sufism's earliest theologians. He is elevated as an individual of great spiritual knowledge ('ilm) in many early works of Sufi literature, such as those by Abu Bakr KalƒÅbƒÅ·∏èi (d. 380/990) or later in the writings of Sufi poet Ab≈´ ·∏§amƒ´d bin Ab≈´ Bakr IbrƒÅhƒ´m A·π≠·π≠ƒÅr (d. 618/1221). 'Attar claims that Ja'far, more than the other Imams, was a spiritual forebear to Sufism when he says he, \\"spoke more than the other imams concerning the Path (·π≠ariqat).\\" 'Attar's attributed sayings of Al-Sadiq are full of Sufi specific terminology such as \\"He had passed away (fa'na: figuratively refers to the death of the ego)\\" and \\"window into the heart.\\" It is suspicious that these terms are absent from older collections of sayings attributed to Ja'far. It is also worth noting that some historical jurists and authors, such as Moqaddas Ardabili (d. 993/1585), saw Sufi claims of relation to al-Sadiq as a fabricated tie created to lend historical justification to the Sufis. While is as apparent in these writings that Ja'far al-sadiq was regarded as a founding figure in Sufism, the historical situation is more difficult to ascertain. Given his large following and established school (madrasa), he almost certainly was a teacher to \\"proto- sufis.\\" Perhaps, as claimed by 'Attar, this included Abu No øaym, SofyƒÅn ·πÆawri (d 161/776), a well known jurist and ascetic in his time. It is through Sofyan that one of the most repeated attributions to Ja'far's character reportedly comes. 'Attar relates: > \\"Sadiq was seen wearing a precious robe of silk. They said,'Son of the > Prophet of God, this is not in accord with the life of your holy family.' He > took that man by the hand and drew it into his sleeve which was clad in > coarse lint so that his hand was pricked. Sadiq said ‚ÄòThis is for God and > this is for men'\\" This verse shows us that Ja'far was viewed by Sufi sources as processing a humbleness and inner piety that was a cornerstone of malamatiyya thought. The malamatiyya were closely associated with the Sufis, and these two mystical traditions had, in many ways, been blended by the time of 'Attar. Whether these stories are any most than myth crafted by later generations is not something that can be conclusively determined. What can be said is that Sufi teachers often traced the source of their knowledge back to the teaching of Al-Sadiq and that perceived content of these teaching remain relevant to Sufi practice today =Theology= Ja'far al-Sadiq's view on theology is transmitted through Mufazzel who recorded his own questions and al-Sadiq's answers in a book known as Ketab al-Tawhid in which al-Sadiq gives proofs as the unity of God. This book is considered identical to the KetƒÅb al-ehlilaja which is a reply to Mufazzel's request from al-Sadiq for a refutation of those who deny God. Hesham ibn ·∏§akam (d. 179/796) is another famous student of the imam who proposed a number of doctrines that later became orthodox Shia theology, including the rational necessity of the divinely guided imam in every age to teach and lead God's community. Al-Sadiq is attributed with the statement: \\"Whoever claims that God has ordered evil, has lied about God. Whoever claims that both good and evil are attributed to him, has lied about God\\". This view which is accordance with that of Mu'tazilite doctrine seems to absolve God from the responsibility for evil in the world. Al-Sadiq says that God does not \\"order created beings to do something without providing for them a means of not doing it, though they do not do it, or not do it without God's permission\\". Al-Sadiq expressed a moderate view between compulsion (Jabr), and giving the choice to man (Tafviz), stating that God decreed some things absolutely, but left some others to human agency. This assertion was widely adopted afterwards and was called \\"al-amr bayn al-amrayn\\" which meant\\" neither predestination nor delegation but a position between the two.\\" Al-·π¢adiq's view therefore is recorded as supporting either position as it is reported in an exchange between him and an unknown interlocutor. The interlocutor asks if God forces his servants to do evil or whether he has delegated power to them. Al- Sadiq's answers negatively to both questions. When asked \\"What then?\\" he replies, \\"The blessings of your Lord are between these two\\". It is narrated in hadith that Ja'far al-Sadiq has said \\"We are the people well-grounded in knowledge and we are the ones who know how to interpret it.\\". =Tafsir= The works attributed to Jafar al-Sadiq in Tafsir (Quranic exegesis) are mostly described as the Sufi-mystical works such as \\"Tafsir al-Qor æƒÅn\\", \\"ManƒÅfe ø ·π£owar al-Qor æƒÅn\\" and \\"·∏¥awƒÅs√Çs√Ç al-Qor æƒÅn al-a ø·∫ìam\\". The attribution of these works to al-Sadiq, however, is suspected. In his books ·∏§aqƒÅ æeq al-tafsir and ZiƒÅdƒÅt ·∏§aqƒÅ æeq al-tafsir,  øAbd-al-Ra·∏•mƒÅn Solami cites al-·π¢adiq as one of his major (if not the major) source of knowledge concerning the meaning of Quranic verses. \\"KetƒÅb al-jafr\\", an early mystical commentary on the Quran (Tafsir), is also attributed to al-Sadiq. According to Ibn Khaldun, it was originally written on the skin of a young bull, allowing the imam to reveal the hidden meaning of the Quran. al-Sadiq is said to have proposed a fourfold model of Quran interpretation. He said that \\"The Book of God comprises four things: the statement set down, the implied purport, the hidden meanings, relating to the supra-sensible world, and the exalted spiritual doctrines.\\" He said that the plain meanings were for the common people; the hidden meanings for the elite; the implied meanings for the \\"friends of god;\\" and the \\"exalted spiritual doctrines\\" were the \\"province of the prophets.\\" He stated that Hadith, or traditional sayings of the Prophet, should be rejected if they contradicted the Quran. =Doctrine of Taqiyyah= Al-Sadiq adopted Taqiyyah as a defensive tool against the violence and threats that were directed against him and the Shias. Taqiyya was a form of religious dissimulation, or a legal dispensation whereby a believing individual can deny their faith while they are in fear or at risk of significant persecution. In other words, Taqiyya says that it is acceptable to hide one's true opinions if by revealing them, one puts oneself or others in danger. The doctrine was developed by al-Sadiq, and served to protect the Shias when Al-Mansur, the Abbasid caliph, conducted a brutal and oppressive campaign against Alids and their supporters. According to Moezzi, in the early sources Taqiyya means \\"the keeping or safeguarding of the secrets of the Imams' teaching.\\" \\"Divergence of traditions\\" is, therefore, sometimes justified by Shia imams as a result of the need for using Taqiyya. \\"He who is certain that we [the imams] proclaim only the truth (Al-Haqq), may he be satisfied with our teaching,\\" asserts al-Sadiq; \\"and if he hears us say something contradictory to what he heard earlier, he should know that we are acting only in his own interest.\\" Practicing Taqiyya also had an esoteric significance for those who believed that their teachings should not be comprehensible to ordinary Ulama, and so hid their more profound teachings. Thus Ja'far either distanced himself or did not get involved with the rebellions of his uncle Zayd and cousin Muhammad al-Nafs al-Zakiyya against the Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties, respectively. =Works= According to Haywood half a dozen religious works bear al-Sadiq's name as author, though none of them can be firmly described as being written by al-·π¢adiq. It is probable that al-Sadiq was an author who left the writing to his students. The alchemist, Geber, for example, suggested that some of his works are \\"little more than records of Ja øfar's teaching or summaries of hundreds of monographs written by him.\\" Ja'far Al-Sadiq is also cited in a wide range of historical sources, including al-Tabari, al-Yaqubi and Al-Masudi. Al-Dhahabi recognizes his contribution to Sunni tradition and Isma'ili scholars such as Qadi al- Nu'manMadelung, W., The Sources of IsmƒÅƒ´lƒ´ Law, The University of Chicago Press, Journal of Near Eastern Studies, Vol. 35, No. 1 (Jan., 1976), pp. 29‚Äì40 recorded his traditions in their work.Meri, Josef W. \\"Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia\\". Routledge, NY. 2005, p 409 KetƒÅb al-jafr is a commentary on the Quran which, according to Ibn Khaldun, was first written on the skin of a young bull, which allowed al-Sadiq to reveal the hidden meaning of the Quran. Various versions of his will, and a number of collections of legal dicta, are attributed to him as well. There are many reports attributed to him in the early Shia Hadith collections such as Muhammad ibn Ya'qub al- Kulayni's Kitab al-Kafi, where they are featured as central sources of Imami doctrine. \\"Al-haft wa'l-a·∫ìella\\" and \\"KetƒÅb al-·π£erƒÅ·π≠\\" which are containing \\"secret revelations\\" to Mofa≈º≈ºal are also attributed to al-Sadiq, and had an important role in the elaboration of the esoteric doctrine of the Nosayris, for whom al-·π¢adiq is an influential figure.

It is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service and is one of the largest prisons in the UK. History HM Prison Wandsworth from the air The prison was built in 1851, when it was known as Surrey House of Correction. It was designed according to the humane separate system principle: a number of corridors radiate from a central control point with each prisoner having toilet facilities. The toilets were subsequently removed to increase prison capacity and the prisoners had to engage in the humiliating process of \\"slopping out\\", until 1996. On 29 July 1879, Catherine Webb was executed for the murder and dismemberment of her mistress, Mrs. Thomas, at Richmond. The murder, which occurred in March, was for the purpose of stealing Mrs. Thomas‚Äò property and going to America with a man named Webb. The only witnesses to the execution were the sheriff, the surgeon and the chaplain. No reporters were permitted. The sheriff reported that Mrs. Webb met her death with dignity. The body was buried in a shallow grave on prison grounds and covered in lime. In 1930, inmate James Edward Spiers, serving a 10-year sentence for armed robbery, committed suicide in front of a group of Justices of the Peace who were there to witness his receiving 15 lashes, then a form of judicial corporal punishment. In 1951, Wandsworth was the holding prison for a national stock of the birch and the cat o' nine tails, implements for corporal punishment inflicted as a disciplinary penalty under the prison rules. PRO: HO 323/13. An example of a flogging with the \\"cat\\" carried out in Wandsworth Prison itself was reported in July 1954. On 8 July 1965, Ronnie Biggs escaped from the prison, where he was serving a 30-year sentence for his part in the Great Train Robbery. Two years later he fled to Brazil and remained on the run until 2001, when he returned to the UK. Execution site Wandsworth was the site of 135 executions, between 1878 and 1961. Built in 1878, the gallows was located near the A wing. In 1911 a new gallows was built between the E and F wings, and in 1938 a new facility was built at the E wing. Among those executed by hanging were: (in execution-year order) *George Henry Lamson (1852‚Äì1882) *George Chapman (1865‚Äì1903) *Alfred Edward Stratton (1882‚Äì1905) *Albert Ernest Stratton (1884‚Äì1905) *Joseph O'Sullivan (1897‚Äì1922) *Reginald Dunne (unknown‚Äì1922) *Jean-Pierre Vaquier (1879‚Äì1924) *Patrick Mahon (1890‚Äì1924) *Norman Thorne (1902‚Äì1925) *Del Fontaine (1904‚Äì1935) *George Johnson Armstrong (1902‚Äì1941) *Karel Richard Richter (1912‚Äì1941) *Gordon Cummins (1914‚Äì1942) *Duncan Scott-Ford (1921‚Äì1942) *August Sangret (1913‚Äì1943) *John Amery (1912‚Äì1945) *William Joyce (Lord Haw-Haw) (1906‚Äì1946) *John George Haigh (1909‚Äì1949) *Derek Bentley (1933‚Äì1953) *Alfred Charles Whiteway (executed 22 December 1953) *Guenther Podola (1929‚Äì1959) *Francis Forsyth (1942-1960) On 25 April 1951, a double execution took place at Wandsworth, when Edward Smith and Joseph Brown stood on the gallows together and were executed simultaneously. The final executions at Wandsworth were those of Francis Forsyth on 10 November 1960, Victor John Terry on 25 May 1961 and Henryk Niemasz on 8 September 1961 (Forsyth was one of just four 18-year-olds executed in a British prison in the twentieth century). With the exceptions of Scott-Ford, Joyce and Amery, who were convicted of treachery, all executions were for the crime of murder. The gallows were kept in full working order until 1993 and tested every six months. In 1994, they were dismantled and the condemned suite is now used as a tea room for the prison officers. The gallows' trapdoor and lever were sent to the Prison Service Museum in Rugby, Warwickshire. After this museum permanently closed in 2004, they were sent to the Galleries of Justice in Nottingham, where those and an execution box may be seen. Recent history Panorama of HMP Wandsworth from Heathfield Road In October 2009, gross misconduct charges were brought against managers of Wandsworth Prison, after an investigation found that prisoners had been temporarily transferred to HMP Pentonville before inspections. The transfers, which included vulnerable prisoners, were made in order to manipulate prison population figures. In March 2011, an unannounced follow-up inspection was conducted by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons, which found that \\"...Wandsworth compared badly with similar prisons facing similar challenges and we were concerned by what appeared to be unwillingness among some prison managers and staff to acknowledge and take responsibility for the problems the prison faced.\\" In May 2015 a prisoner was found dead in his cell, prompting a murder investigation. The prison today The prison has made good progress since the inspection in 2009 and has received praise from the MQPL Survey which was undertaken in March 2011, which demonstrated progress over the same survey results in 2009. Wandsworth Prison contains eight wings on two units. The smaller unit, containing three wings, was originally designed for women but is currently closed for refurbishment. It is planned to reopen as a Category C unit focusing on resettlement services. Education and training courses are offered at Wandsworth. Facilities at the prison include two gyms and a sports hall. The large prison chaplaincy offers chaplains from the Roman Catholic, Anglican, Methodist, Muslim, Jewish, Sikh, Hindu, Buddhist, Mormon and Jehovah's Witness faiths. A BBC investigation showed large scale drug abuse and cannabis openly being smoked and harder drugs found. There are allegations of staff corruption, even of staff bringing drugs into the prison.Inside Wandsworth prison: Drugs and tension BBC Wandsworth has lost its status as a reform prison. Glyn Travis of the Prison Officers Association said, \\"Wandsworth staff had bought into the reform process and worked well with the governor to implement the reforms. Now, the prison has lost its reform status and once again, staff and prisoners have been left high and dry as this government‚Äôs agenda seems to change at the drop of a hat.\\"HMP Wandsworth loses reform prison status The Guardian Wandsworth is the most overcrowded prison in England and body scanners were not used on visitors to prevent contraband being brought into the prison, allegedly due to shortage of staff. Peter Clarke said, \\"In essence, there were too many prisoners, many with drug- related or mental health issues, and with not enough to do.\\" Also, not all staff carried anti-ligature knives despite six suicides since 2015.X-ray body scanner not used at Wandsworth prison, report finds BBC Chris Atkins' book \\"A Bit of a Stretch: The Diaries of a Prisoner\\" describes ongoing poor conditions during his stay in 2016-2017 with many of the touted improvements merely being described on paper rather than in existence in the prison. He describes some of the changes that were attempted as part of the \\"Prison and Safety Reform (2016)\\" that were not successful.

In an interview with Ren√©e Montagne just before his final broadcast on NPR's Morning Edition, Kasell revealed that he knew he would be in radio at a young age. He said that he hid behind the radio to fool passers-by into thinking they were listening to the radio when they in fact were hearing the young Kasell. During his time at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Kasell helped launch local radio station WUNC with fellow student and future broadcaster Charles Kuralt. Kasell pursued a degree in English, but never graduated due to being drafted into the U.S. Army. After serving, he worked as an announcer and DJ at radio station WGBR in Goldsboro, North Carolina. He moved to Northern Virginia in 1965. Career After leaving North Carolina, Kasell first worked as an announcer and DJ at WPIK in Alexandria, Virginia. He would soon join the staff of all-news WAVA in Arlington, Virginia as a weekend news announcer, and eventually would advance to the position of news director. As news director, he hired Katie Couric, then a student at the University of Virginia, as an intern one summer, thus starting her career in news broadcasting. Kasell joined National Public Radio's staff as a news announcer for Weekend All Things Considered in 1975. He was the news announcer for NPR's Morning Edition from its inception in 1979 through 2009. On November 23, 2009, NPR announced that Kasell would retire from newscasting at the end of 2009. Kasell's final newscast aired on December 30, 2009. He continued to work for NPR through fundraising and visits to member stations. He also continued to appear as the official scorer of Wait Wait ... Don't Tell Me!  Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!  NPR launched its weekly news quiz Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! in 1998, with Kasell as official judge and scorekeeper. Kasell featured in several segments including \\"Who's Carl This Time?\\" and the \\"Listener Limerick Challenge.\\" Prior to October 21, 2017, listeners who won a game on the show could have Kasell record a greeting for their home answering machine or voice mail system. Because this prize has been such a long-standing tradition for the show, more than 2,000 people have had his voice on their answering machines, which he recorded even after he left the show. The current prize is to have any show panelist or staff member of the contestant's choice record the greeting, including Kasell until his death.Kasell speaking in Nashville, Tennessee, in 2009 During the August 7, 2010, broadcast of Wait Wait ... Don't Tell Me!, host Peter Sagal announced that Kasell had been voted into the National Radio Hall of Fame. For many years, Kasell was the announcer for the annual Kennedy Center Honors broadcast on CBS. On March 4, 2014, NPR announced that Kasell would be stepping down from his Wait Wait ... Don't Tell Me! duties. It was later announced that his last show would be May 17, 2014; subsequently he was credited on the air as \\"Scorekeeper Emeritus\\".  Retirement and death  Kasell's final show on Wait Wait ... Don't Tell Me! was recorded on May 15, 2014 and broadcast two days later. Stephen Colbert, Katie Couric, Tom Hanks, and President Barack Obama called in to the show to voice their appreciation for Kasell. In September 2014, Kasell published his memoir titled Wait Wait ... I'm Not Done Yet! Kasell died on April 17, 2018, from complications of Alzheimer's disease in Potomac, Maryland.

He is also known as Isma'il Al-√Éraj ibn Ja'far (ÿßÿ≥ŸÖÿßÿπŸäŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿßÿπÿ±ÿ¨ ÿßÿ®ŸÜ ÿ¨ÿπŸÅÿ± ÿßŸÑÿµÿßÿØŸÇ). Following Ja'far's death, the Shia community split between those who believed the Imamate was passed to Musa ibn Ja'far, who would become the Twelver Shia, and those who believed that the Imamate passed to Isma'il ibn Ja'far, who would become the Isma'ili branch named after Isma'il. Biography Isma'il was born in Shawwal 100 AH/719 AD He was the eldest son of Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq. His mother, Fatima bint al- Hussain'l-Athram bin al-Hasan bin Ali, was the first wife of Ja'far al-Sadiq. He was the brother of Abdullah al-Aftah. Isma'ili sources say that, after the age of seven, as his father's designated successor, Isma'il was kept apart from his siblings, limited in his contact with the public, with his father taking personal responsibility for his education. Given his father's reputation as a scholar and the number of distinguished students who sought out his tuition, Isma'il would have received excellent training. It is said that whenever Ja'far was ill and unable to fulfill his duties as Imam, he deputized Isma'il, although his role was restricted to the confines of the home. According to Daftary, Isma'il may have taken part in an anti-Abbasid plot in 755 and identified with the more activist, or militant Shi'a (some of whom split off as the Zaydis). He may have been summoned to the Caliph's court with others to face charges but was spared execution, unlike some of his fellow plotters. To protect him from persecution, his father sent him into hiding and publicly declared him deceased. The majority Twelver groups argue that Isma'il actually died during his father's Imamate in the year 138 AH/756 AD. In about 762, Isma'il may have left Medina for Basra, although this is disputed. He is said to have had a full grasp of the esoteric truth, the inner message of Islam. He was succeeded by his son, Muhammad, as the 8th Isma'ili Imam, who was about 22 at the time. Some Isma'ilis believe that Muhammad bin Isma'il became \\"hidden\\" and will return as the Mahdi, to establish universal peace and justice. According to Daftary, Isma'il may have led a revolt against the Abbasids in 815, \\"and died shortly afterwards\\" in Medina. He probably lived in \\"southwestern Persia ... from where he dispatched his own Dais to adjoining areas\\". Burial place According to some Isma'ili sources, Isma'il ibn Ja'far is buried in Salamiyah, a city located in Syria. Other sources point to Al-Baqi' Madina as his burial place. Twelver Shia's and Sunni Muslims sources have contradicted this, stating that he was buried in Al-Baqi' Medina, the holy Islamic city located in Hijaz. The Isma'ili‚ÄìTwelver schism The Isma'ili‚ÄìTwelver split occurred during and after Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq's lifetime. It was initially thought that Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq's elder son, Isma'il ibn Ja'far (either first or second eldest to his first wife, Fatima bint al-Hussain).Al-Hasan ibn Musa al-Nawbakhti. Kitab Firaq al-Shia. Tr. by Abbas Kadhim, Shi'a Sects 2007, p. 123. would be the next Imam, arguably found in both IsmƒÅ'ƒ´lƒ´ and Twelver sources. However, his untimely death prior to Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq's death, led to multiple splits and theories within the community.Al-Hasan ibn Musa al-Nawbakhti. Kitab Firaq al-Shia. Tr. by Abbas Kadhim, Shi'a Sects 2007, p. 122-142. What came to be known as Isma'ilis, are those who believed that the Imamate should remain within the line of Isma'il ibn Ja‚Äôfar. It was believed that the designation went to Isma'il ibn Ja'far, and therefore the Imamate should continue through his lineage. His early supporters initially theorized that Isma'il ibn Ja‚Äôfar‚Äôs death was staged, and he went into hiding out of fear for his life from the Abbasid Caliph al- Mans≈´r.Al-Hasan ibn Musa al-Nawbakhti. Kitab Firaq al-Shia. Tr. by Abbas Kadhim, Shi'a Sects 2007, p. 123.P. W. Ivanow, Ismaili Tradition Concerning the Rise of the Fatimids, 1941, p. 275-278 They refused to acknowledge his death, and some even claimed to have seen him after his funeral. However, most IsmƒÅ'ƒ´lƒ´s later accepted Isma'il ibn Ja‚Äôfar‚Äôs death, and instead followed his son Muhammad ibn Isma'il as the next Imam, since the Imamate could still be continued through Isma'il ibn Ja‚Äôfar‚Äôs lineage. On a theological level, Ismai'lis refuse to acknowledge Imams outside of the lineage of Ismail ibn Ja‚Äôfar due to the notion of na·π£·π£ (designation) and ‚Äòi»ôma (infallibility). Because Shi‚Äôas believe that the Imams are infallible and contain special knowledge of the Divine decree, it is inconceivable that Imam Ja'far al-SƒÅdiq would have incorrectly chosen Imam Isma'il ibn Ja‚Äôfar as his successor and then retract his original na·π£·π£. This would mean that Imam Ja'far al-SƒÅdiq either made a major mistake which would make him fallible, or later claims regarding other designations were forged narrations. Ithna-'Asharis, following the early death of Isma'il ibn Ja‚Äôfar acknowledged the designation of Imam Ja'far al-SƒÅdiq‚Äôs younger son, M≈´sƒÅ al-KƒÅ·∫ìim, from his slave-wife, ·∏§amƒ´da al- Barbariyya. Various hadith reports from the Twelver Shi‚Äôi collection contain narrations about the designation of Imam M≈´sƒÅ al-KƒÅ·∫ìim, along with his exceptional character and wisdom from an early age. Witnesses include some of Imam Jafar al-Sadiq‚Äôs sons, ‚ÄòAli and Is·∏•ƒÅq, who affirmed M≈´sƒÅ al-KƒÅ·∫ìim‚Äôs na·π£·π£.Shaykh al-Mufid. Kitab al-Irshad. Translated by Seyyid Hossein Nasr, p. 407 Other arguments made for Imam M≈´sƒÅ al-KƒÅ·∫ìim include the passing down of special objects that belonged to the Prophet, ‚ÄòAli and Fatima to the designated Imams.Shaykh al-Mufid. Kitab al-Irshad. Translated by Seyyid Hossein Nasr, p. 408 While the early followers (later Twelvers) of Imam Jafar al-Sadiq believed that Isma'il ibn Ja'far might have been the Imam due to his beloved status by his father, some argue that he was neither explicitly designated, nor meant to be, due to his early death. Another mainstream view also purports a ‚Äúchange‚Äù or ‚Äúabrogation‚Äù in the Divine Decree, known as badƒÅ‚Äô, in which God may abrogate a previous decree for something better.Ayoub, Mahmoud. Divine Preordination and Human Hope a Study of the Concept of BadƒÅ æ in ImƒÅmƒ´ Shƒ´ øƒ´ Tradition. Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 106, No. 4 (Oct. - Dec., 1986), pp. 623632. P 624 As a result, Imam Ja'far al- SƒÅdiq‚Äôs infallibility is not called into question. The Ithna-‚ÄòAsharis continued to follow the Imamate from M≈´sƒÅ al-KƒÅ·∫ìim‚Äôs lineage until their twelfth Imam went into Occultation. They await their twelfth Imam as the final Mahdi.

The soda has a sweet, fruity flavor that somewhat resembles its main ingredient, lemon verbena ( or in Spanish). Americans compare its flavor to bubblegum or cream soda. Sometimes categorized as a champagne cola, it has been described as \\"an acquired taste\\" whose \\"intense color alone is enough to drive away the uninitiated.\\" The Coca-Cola Company owns the Inca Kola trademark everywhere but in Peru. In Peru, the Inca Kola trademark is owned by , which since 1999 is a joint venture between The Coca-Cola Company and the Lindley family, former sole owners of and Inca Kola is a source of national pride and patriotism in Peru, a national icon. Inca Kola is available in parts of South America, North America and Europe, and while it has not enjoyed major success outside Peru, it can be found in Latin American specialty shops worldwide. Inca Kola is sold in bottles and with an Inca motif. History In 1910, in R√≠mac, one of Lima's oldest and most traditional neighborhoods, an immigrant English family began a small bottling company under their family name, Lindley. In 1928, the company was formally chartered in Peru as Corporaci√≥n Jos√© R. Lindley S.A., whereupon Joseph R. Lindley became its first General Manager. By the early 1930s, the company had a line of ten flavors of soda including Orange Squash, Lemon Squash, Champagne Kola, and Cola Rosada. In 1935, on the occasion of the 400th anniversary of Lima's founding, Lindley introduced what was to become its most noted product, Inca Kola, whose flavor was based on Lemon Verbena ( or ). He had experimented with various mixtures, other ingredients and levels of carbonation, until finally he came up with this combination of thirteen special plant-derived flavors. The company launched \\"Inca Kola\\" under the slogan \\"There is only one Inca Kola and it's like no other\\" (). By the mid-1940s, Inca Kola was a market leader in Lima due to an aggressive advertising campaign. Appealing to the Peruvian nationalism that was prevalent among the population, the company positioned Inca Kola as a traditional Peruvian drink, using national and indigenous iconography and images. This advertising campaign was very successful, and bottling volume expanded greatly. Inca Kola reached levels of 38% market penetration by 1970, eclipsing all other carbonated drinks in Peru and firmly establishing itself as \\"Peru's Drink\\" (). A common logo in the late 1970s and early 1980s featured the slogan \\"Made of National Flavor!\\" (), later changed to \\"The taste of Peru\\" (). On January 22, 2009, Inca Kola partnered with D'Onofrio, an iconic Peruvian ice cream brand owned by Nestl√©, to launch an Inca Kola flavored ice pop. In the United States, Inca Kola is manufactured by the Coca-Cola company and sold in supermarkets in bottles, cans, and individual bottles. Competition In 1995, Coca-Cola had 32% of the market share of soda sales in Peru while Inca Kola had 32.9%. Since that year, however, the market share for Inca Kola has increased due to some fast food chains including it in their menus. Bembos, a Peruvian fast-food chain, switched from serving Coca-Cola to Inca Kola in 1995. Due to popular demand, McDonald's also began to serve Inca Kola at its locations in Peru in 1995, before Coca-Cola owned the Inca Kola brand (at the time, the only place in the world where Coca-Cola agreed to such an arrangement). Lindley underwent corporate restructuring in 1997. The expansion resulted in a debt load that took a heavy toll, and Lindley lost almost $5 million in 1999. The company, looking for outside help, turned to the Coca-Cola Co., which acquired half of Inca Kola Per√∫ and one-fifth of Corporaci√≥n Jos√© R. Lindley S.A. for an undisclosed sum believed to have been about $200 million. Johnny Lindley Taboada, a grandson of the founder and chairman of Corporaci√≥n Jos√© R. Lindley S.A., became chairman of the joint venture between Coke and Inca Kola. Coca- Cola became the sole owner of the Inca Kola trademark everywhere outside Peru whereas inside Peru a joint-venture agreement was forged. To date, Ecuador and the United States (mostly New York and the rest of the Northeast) are two of the countries where Inca Kola is bottled by the Coca-Cola Company. During the time that the two giants were negotiating, various smaller companies began to emerge in Peru, selling drinks that competed both with Coca-Cola (Peru Cola, Cola Nacional, Inti Cola, Kola Real, etc.) and Inca Kola (Isaac Kola, Triple Kola, Concordia, Oro etc.). Their main selling point was the fact that Inca Kola was no longer a Peruvian company, having sold out to a foreign company, and therefore not deserving of their money. During 2004, Corporaci√≥n Jos√© R. Lindley S.A. started talks to buy out Embotelladora Latinoamericana S.A., a bottling business that had been bottling Inca Kola since 1973. They complained that the price of Inca Kola concentrate had increased sixfold since the merger with Coca-Cola. Consequently, they cancelled their contract to bottle Inca Kola in 2000. As a result, in early 2005 Corporaci√≥n Jos√© R. Lindley S.A. purchased two-thirds of Embotelladora Latinoamericana for $215 million. Corporaci√≥n Jos√© R. Lindley S.A. now bottles Inca Kola as well as all the Coca-Cola products using these bottling facilities, with a combined market share of around 60%.

After spending considerable time learning from Indian peasants and the pests present in their soil, he called these two his professors. He was a principal figure in the early organic movement. He is considered by many in the English-speaking world to have been, along with Rudolf Steiner and Eve Balfour, one of the key evangelists of ancient Indian techniques of organic agriculture. ebook Life Albert Howard was born at Bishop's Castle, Shropshire. He was the son of Richard Howard, a farmer, and Ann Howard, n√©e Kilvert. He was educated at Wrekin College, Royal College of Science, South Kensington, and as Foundation Scholar, at St. John's College, Cambridge. In 1896, he graduated in Natural Sciences at Cambridge, where he also obtained a Diploma of Agriculture in 1897. In 1899, he lectured in Agricultural Science at Harrison College, Barbados, and in 1899 and 1902, was a Mycologist and Agricultural Lecturer at the Imperial Department of Agriculture for the West Indies. From 1903‚Äì1905, he was Botanist to the South-Eastern Agricultural College, Wye; and from 1905‚Äì1924, he was Imperial Economic Botanist to the Government of India. In 1914, he was created a Companion of the Indian Empire (C.I.E.), and received a Silver Medal of the Royal Society of Arts in 1920. From 1924‚Äì1931, Howard was Director of the Institute of Plant Industry, Indore, and Agricultural Adviser to States in Central India and Rajputana. He was made a Fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society in 1928, and in 1930 received the Barclay Memorial Medal of that society. He was knighted in 1934, and made an Honourable Fellow of the Imperial College of Science in 1935. pdf version Howard worked in India as agricultural adviserRebecca Jones, Green Harvest: The History of Organic Farming and Gardening in Australia, Collingwood, Victoria: Csiro Publishing, 2010, p. 3 and was in charge of a government research farm at Indore. He worked together with Gabrielle Matthaei (1876‚Äì1930), and her sister Louise (1880‚Äì1969). He married Gabrielle in 1905. After her death, he married Louise in 1931. ebook Gabrielle was herself a professionally trained and competent botanist, and indeed the contribution of both women to organic farming is said to be underestimated. Howard observed and came to support traditional Indian farming practices over conventional agricultural science. Though he journeyed to India to teach Western agricultural techniques he found that the Indians could in fact teach him more. One important aspect he took notice of was the connection between healthy soil and the villages' healthy populations, livestock and crop. Patrick Holden, Director of the UK Soil Association quoted Howard as saying \\"the health of soil, plant, animal and man is one and indivisible.\\" He was president of the 13th session of the Indian Science Congress in 1926. Howard has been called the father of modern composting, for his refinement of a traditional Indian composting system into what is now known as the Indore method. He went on to document and develop organic farming techniques, and spread his knowledge through the UK-based Soil Association, and the Rodale Institute in the US. His 1940 book, An Agricultural Testament, is a classic organic farming text. He emphasizes the importance of maintaining humus, keeping water in the soil, and the role of mycorrhiza. It was his first book aimed at the general public, and is his best popularly known work. However his 1931 book The Waste Products of Agriculture, based on 26 years of studying improved crop production in Indian smallholdings, is considered by some as his most important scientific publication. His 1945 book Farming and Gardening for Health or Disease was also intended for a general audience, and was republished in 1947 as The Soil and Health: A Study of Organic Agriculture. Howard's work influenced and inspired many farmers and agricultural scientists who furthered the organic movement, including Lady Eve Balfour (the Haughley Experiment, The Living Soil) and J.I. Rodale (Rodale Institute). Howard advocated studying the forest in order to farm like the forest. He devoted the last half of his career to understanding that end, presaging those contemporary ecologists who advocate the understanding of the interface between ecology and agriculture. JSTOR citation for page accuracy Indeed, Howard is grouped, along with Rudolf Steiner, Sir Robert McCarrison and Richard St. Barbe Baker, as one of the key progenitors of the organic agriculture movement.Lotter, D.W. 2003.\\"Organic agriculture\\" J.

Notes a. The online reproduction of Howard's 1931 work refers to him as \\"Sir Albert Howard\\". However, this is an error. He was not knighted until 1934, and would not have been referred to as Sir. The error is an artifact of the manner in which Howard's name has passed into contemporary public knowledge, via his two most famous books An Agricultural Testament (first published 1940), and Soil and Health (first published 1945 under a different title, but known mostly by this 1947 title), by which time he was referred to as \\"Sir\\". Indeed, prior to the advent of the internet and the related information explosion, these were the only two works popularly known by all but the most dedicated researchers, with even less known about his life history, beyond brief synopses associated with the books, and replicated in various book descriptions.

Lewis enrolled in the U.S. Army Air Corps training program in meteorology in 1942 and later received his masters in the area a year later. As he left for military service in 1943, he was told by the university president Robert A. Millikan that he had a position as an instructor at Caltech when he returned. He served working mostly as a weather forecaster in Hawaii and Okinawa for four years. Lewis returned in 1946 and took his position at Caltech where his duties included helping in the laboratory for an introductory genetics course. He was promoted in 1956 to a professor and became the Thomas Hunt Morgan Professor of Biology in 1966.  Personal life  In 1946, Edward B. Lewis met Pamela Harrah (1925‚Äì2018). She was an accomplished artist, but also shared Lewis' interests in animal life. She had went to Stanford and studied genetics and later discovered the mutant Polycomb, that now is important in the understanding of gene regulation. They married and had three sons named Glenn, Hugh, and Keith. Pam developed an infection that caused her to have a visual and physical, partial unilateral paralysis, which limited her mobility. Lewis maintained a constant exercise routine in his day, as he started his mornings with breakfast and exercise, until he suffered from cancer. Lewis would normally have lunch with his faculty members at the Anthenaeum, then take a nap and return to the laboratory in the evening. The most constant part of his daily routine was that he would do most of his work at night. He also enjoyed playing the flute and would allow himself to have time to play the flute at night. In addition, Lewis appreciated other aspects of life even though they interrupted his typical schedule. Some other things he did with his time include: jogging, swimming, playing on the beach, playing chamber music with friends, going to see movies, and attending opera performances. Edward B. Lewis was a humble man who did not always receive attention for his works. Over time, his work with Drosophila became more appreciated and he began to attract more attention. Career and research Lewis in 1986 His Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning studies with Drosophila, (including the discovery1\\\\. Lewis E. A gene complex controlling segmentation in Drosophila. Nature. 1978;277(5688):565‚Äì570. doi:10.1038/276565a0. of the Drosophila Bithorax complex of homeotic genes, and elucidation of its function), founded the field of evolutionary developmental biology and laid the groundwork for our current understanding of the universal, evolutionarily conserved strategies controlling animal development. He is credited with development of the complementation test. His key publications in the fields of genetics, developmental biology, radiation and cancer are presented in the book Genes, Development and Cancer, which was released in 2004. During the 1950s, Lewis studied the effects of radiation from X-rays, nuclear fallout and other sources as possible causes of cancer. He reviewed medical records from survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as radiologists and patients exposed to X-rays. Lewis concluded that \\"health risks from radiation had been underestimated\\". Lewis published articles in Science and other journals and made a presentation to a Congressional committee on atomic energy in 1957. At the scientific level of the debate, the crucial question was whether the \\"threshold theory\\" was valid or whether, as Lewis insisted, the effects of radioactivity were \\"linear with no threshold\\", where every exposure to radiation had a long-term cumulative effect.Gerald H. Clarfield and William M. Wiecek (1984). Nuclear America: Military and Civilian Nuclear Power in the United States 1940‚Äì1980, Harper & Row, New York, p. 225. The issue of linearity versus threshold re-entered the debate on nuclear fallout in 1962, when Ernest Sternglass, a Pittsburgh physicist, argued that the linearity thesis was confirmed by the research of Alice Stewart.Gerald H. Clarfield and William M. Wiecek (1984). Nuclear America: Military and Civilian Nuclear Power in the United States 1940‚Äì1980, Harper & Row, New York, p. 228.

This interview was released on DVD in 2004 as \\"Conversations in Genetics: Volume 1, No. 3 ‚Äì Edward B. Lewis; An Oral History of Our Intellectual Heritage in Genetics\\" 67 min; Producer Rochelle Easton Esposito; The Genetics Society of America. Awards and honors Edward B. Lewis was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the Genetics Society of America, the American Philosophical Society, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was a foreign member of the Royal Society (London) and an honorary member of the Genetical Society of Great Britain. He was a recipient of the Thomas Hunt Morgan Medal (1983), the Gairdner Foundation International award (1987), the Wolf Foundation prize in medicine (1989), the Rosenstiel award (1990), the National Medal of Science (1990), the Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award (1991), and the Louisa Gross Horwitz prize (1992). He held honorary degrees from the University of Ume√•, Ume√•, Sweden and the University of Minnesota. Finally in 1995 he was awarded the Nobel Prize, which he shared with Christine N√ºsslein-Volhard and Eric Wieschaus.

It was headquartered in Dania Beach, Florida.Ostrowski, Jeff. \\"Codina, Swerdlow set sights on Sawgrass Mills.\\" South Florida Business Journal. Friday March 28, 1997. Retrieved on May 23, 2009.\\"World Airline Directory.\\" Flight International. March 22‚Äì28, 1995. 82. Retrieved on July 25, 2009. History The origins of Carnival Air Lines can be traced to 1984 when Pacific Interstate Airlines was founded in Las Vegas, Nevada. This airline flew charters between Las Vegas and Los Angeles. In 1985 the name was changed to Pacific Inter Air and then only two years later the name was changed to Bahamas Express. By this time the airline was flying out of airports in the East Coast of the US to Freeport in the Bahamas. Carnival Cruise Lines bought the company in 1988 and the airline's name was once again changed to Fun Air, but no planes were painted with that name and cruise ship passengers were flown by Majestic Air using a Boeing 727-100 jetliner. The final identity of Carnival Air Lines came to being in 1989 and the airline began flying from Miami, the Northeast USA and later on expanded to other destinations. The home base for Carnival Air Lines was Ft. Lauderdale, Fl. (See routes below). In 1992 Carnival Air Lines began a code-share agreement with Iberia Airlines of Spain to transport connecting passengers from Madrid to Los Angeles via Carnival's Miami Hub. The route was originally operated by a Boeing 737-400 but was replaced in 1994 with Carnival's first Airbus A300. In 1993 Carnival began operating its first wide-body aircraft by flying LanChile's Boeing 767 as part of the interchange agreement with the Chilean airline. The exclusive route was from Miami to New York's JFK airport. In 1995 when the agreement with LanChile was not renewed, another agreement was formed with LADECO of Chile to transport connecting passengers from Santiago to New York via Carnival's Miami Hub flying a Carnival Airbus A300 in LADECO's livery. In September 1997, Pan Am Corp., a holding company formed by the reincarnated Pan American Airways (1996‚Äì1998), bought Carnival Air Lines in an attempt to bolster its fleet and operations into a new airline based on the old Pan Am. Before the airlines could fully merge, the holding company and its two independently operated airlines, Pan Am and Carnival, filed for bankruptcy protection and ceased scheduled flight operations in February 1998. The operating certificate used for the first reincarnated Pan Am was abandoned in favor of the acquired Carnival operating certificate. Pan Am, now operating with the Carnival certificate, quickly resumed limited charter operations while new owner Guilford Transportation Industries of Massachusetts acquired certain assets of the bankrupt companies after court approval. The new company emerged from bankruptcy in June 1998 and discontinued the use of the Carnival Brand name for the Pan Am name and logo instead. Guilford ceased operating Pan Am and relinquished its original Carnival airworthiness certificate on November 1, 2004. Operations were transferred to Boston-Maine Airways, which resumed 727 service under the \\"Pan Am Clipper Connection\\" brand from February 17, 2005. Its IATA code was reassigned to Wataniya Airways.

Hammoudi, Hauf and M√∂nicks all returned to university to complete their studies. According to M√∂nicks (interviewed in the mid-1990s and June 2002 - January 2003., ) the quintet had already begun to perform under the name Kraftwerk some time after Tone Float had been recorded, but RCA had been keen for them to have a band name more appropriate to the English market, since the album was to be issued only in the UK, so the name Organisation was used.

Along with many other fish of the family Sparidae, it is also commonly known as porgy. Scup grow as large as 18 in (450 mm) and weigh 3 to 4 lb (2 kg), but they average 0.5‚Äì1.0 lb (0.25‚Äì0.50 kg). Scup can live up to 20 years; females can begin to reproduce at the age of two. Every year female scups lay approximately 7,000 eggs in sand and weed abundant areas. In the Middle Atlantic Bight, scup spawn along the inner continental shelf. Their larvae end up in inshore waters, along the coast and in estuarine areas. At two to three years of age, they mature. Scup winter along the mid and outer continental shelf. When the temperature warms in the spring, they migrate inshore.Scup, Stenotomus chrysops, Life History and Habitat Characteristics They are fished for by both commercial and recreational fishermen. The scup fishery is one of the oldest in the United States, with records dating back to 1800. Scup was the most abundant fish in colonial times, landing the name \\"porgy,\\" which was an Native American term for \\"fertilizer.\\"http://www.fishthelimits.com/porgy- fish/ Fishermen began using trawls in 1929, which increased catches dramatically. The species was termed overfished in 1996, and today there is evidence of a rebound. Today, scup are still caught primarily using an otter trawl. Many consumers like their light flavor and they are sometimes called panfish. Popular methods of cooking include but are not limited to frying, broiling, and baking. Management Scup are heavily fished commercially and recreationally. Management measures for the species generally include size limits, bag limits, fishing seasons, and equipment requirements. Scup are also managed through quotas that are separately regulated during the different seasons.Scup NOAA FishWatch. Retrieved 5 November 2012. In Massachusetts, management plans result in the distribution of 78% of the yearly permitted harvest of scups for commercial purposes, and 22% for recreational fishing.  Fishing  Since Scups are classified as anglers and tackle bait frantically, squid strips are the most common choice of bait because they stay intact and suspended on the hook after several strikes.

He led an unsuccessful revolt against the Umayyad Caliphate, in which he died. The event gave rise to the Zaidiyyah sect of Shia Islam, which holds him as the next Imam after Ali ibn Husayn. In contrast, his elder half-brother Muhammad al-Baqir is seen as the next Imam of the Twelver and Isma'ili Shias. Nevertheless, he is considered an important revolutionary figure by Shias and a martyr (shaheed) by all schools of Islam, Sunnis and Shias. The calling for revenge for his death, and for the brutal display of his body, contributed to the Abbasid Revolution. Zayd was a learned religious scholar. Various works are ascribed to him, including Musnad al-Imam Zayd (published by E. Grifinni as Corpus Iuris di Zaid b.  øAlƒ´, also known as Majmu ø al-Fiqh), possibly the earliest known work of Islamic law. However, the attribution is disputed; these likely represent early Kufan legal tradition. Birth Zayd was born in Medina in 695 CE. He was the son of Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin.Madelung, W. \\"Zayd b. Alƒ´ b. al-Husayn.\\" Encyclopaedia of Islam. Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2007. Brill Online. 13 September 2007 Ibn Qutaybah in his book \\"al-Ma'ƒÅrif\\", republished in 1934 in Egypt, writes (at page 73) that one of the wives of the 4th Shia Imam was from Sindh and that she was the mother of Zayd ibn Ali. A similar claim has also been made in the book \\"Zayd Shaheed\\" by Abd al-Razzaq al-Hasani, published in Najaf. Zayd's mother Jodha was known by Muslim chroniclers as Jayda al-Sindhi. Contemporary opinions Zayd was a revered and respected member of the Bayt (Household) of Muhammad. Scholars, Saints, Sufis and Imams alike, all spoke of him in respectful terms. When the ascetic Umayyad Caliph Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz was the Governor of Madinah during the reign of Al-Walid and Suleiman, he was an associate of Zayd ibn Ali. Zayd continued to correspond and advise him when he became the Khalifah.Amali al-Murshid bi-Illah al-Ithnyniyah It is worth mentioning that he is also the first narrator of Al-Sahifa As-Sajjadiyya of Imam Zainul-'Abidin. Several works of hadith, theology, and Qur'anic exegesis are attributed to him. The first work of Islamic jurisprudence Mujmu'-al-Fiqh is attributed to him. The only surviving hand-written manuscript of this work dating back to at least a thousand years is preserved in the pope's library, Bibliotheca Vaticana in Vatican City under \\"Vaticani arabi\\". Photocopies of this rare work are available in several libraries including the Library of the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom. In 2007, Sayyid Nafis Shah Al- Husayni obtained a copy of this work, and re-issued it from Lahore. He was an excellent orator and spent much of his life learning and educating others. It is said that his half-brother, Imam al-Baqir, wanted to test him on the Quranic knowledge, asking him various questions for which he received answers beyond his expectation, causing to him to remark, \\"For our father and mother's life! You are one of a kind. God grace your mother who gave you birth, she gave birth to a replica of your forefathers!\\"Narrated by Imam Abu Taleb in al- Amali, p 77 on the authority of Abu Hashem al-Rummani. This was also narrated by Imam al-Mansur billah 'Abdullah ibn Hamzah in al-'Aqd al-Thamin Al-Baqir also said: \\"No one of us was born to resemble 'Ali ibn Abi Talib more than he did.\\"Al-Anwar When describing Zayd, his nephew, Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq, said: \\"Among us he was the best read in the Holy Qur'an, and the most knowledgeable about religion, and the most caring towards family and relatives.\\"Article by Sayyid 'Ali ibn 'Ali Al-Zaidi, ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿßÿ±ŸäÿÆ ÿßŸÑÿµÿ∫Ÿäÿ± ÿπŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ¥Ÿäÿπÿ© ÿßŸÑŸäŸÖŸÜŸäŸäŸÜ (A short History of the Yemenite Shi'ites, 2005) Referencing: Religion & Faith Hence his title ·∏§alƒ´f Al-Qur æƒÅn (). Jafar Sadiq's love for his uncle Zayd was immense. Upon receiving and reading the letter of Zayd ibn Ali's death he broke down and cried uncontrollably, and proclaimed aloud: Imam Ali ar-Ridha said: In one hadith, the Sunni Imam Abu Hanifah once said about Imam Zayd, \\"I met with Zayd and I never saw in his generation a person more knowledgeable, as quick a thinker, or more eloquent than he was.\\" However, in another hadith, Abu Hanifah said: \\"I have not seen anyone with more knowledge than Ja'far ibn Muhammad.\\" Imam Abu Hanifah was reportedly a student of Imam Ja'far, like another great Imam of Sunni Fiqh, that is Malik ibn Anas. The Sufi scholar, Mujtahid and mystic, Sufyan al-Thawri, respected Imam Zayd's knowledge and character, saying \\"Zayd took the place of Imam Al-Husain. He was the most versed human concerning Allah's holy book. I affirm: women have not given birth to the likes of Zayd ... \\"Hidayat al-Raghibeen Al-Shaykh Al-Mufid the writer of the famous Shi'ah book Kitab al Irshad described him as, \\" ... a devout worshipper, pious, a jurist, God-fearing and brave.\\"Article by Sayyid 'Ali ibn 'Ali Al-Zaidi, ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿßÿ±ŸäÿÆ ÿßŸÑÿµÿ∫Ÿäÿ± ÿπŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ¥Ÿäÿπÿ© ÿßŸÑŸäŸÖŸÜŸäŸäŸÜ (A short History of the Yemenite Shi'ites, 2005) Referencing: al-Irshad, p. 403 Prophesy of martyrdom Imam al-Baqir narrated: > The Holy Prophet put his sacred hand on Al-Husayn bin Ali's back and said: > \\"O Husayn, it will not be long until a man will be born among your > descendants.

Yusuf ibn Umar al-Thaqafi, the Umayyad governor of Iraq, managed to bribe the inhabitants of Kufa which allowed him to break the insurgence, killing Zayd in the process. Shrines There are two shrines for Zayd, One is in Kafel, Iraq, the other is in Karak, Jordan. The shrine in Jordan is believed to be the final resting place of the head of Zayd ibn 'Ali ibn Al-Husayn.Article by Sayyid 'Ali ibn 'Ali Al-Zaidi, ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿßÿ±ŸäÿÆ ÿßŸÑÿµÿ∫Ÿäÿ± ÿπŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ¥Ÿäÿπÿ© ÿßŸÑŸäŸÖŸÜŸäŸäŸÜ (A short History of the Yemenite Shi'ites, 2005) Legacy All schools of Islam, Sunnis and Shias, regard Zayd as a righteous martyr against what was regarded as the corrupt leadership of an unjust Caliph. It is even reported that Mujtahid Imam Abu Hanifa, founder of the largest school of Sunni jurisprudence, gave financial support to Zayd's revolt, and called on others to join Zayd's rebellion. Zayd's rebellion inspired other revolts by members of his clan, especially in the Hejaz, the most famous among these being the revolt of Imam Muhammad al-Nafs al-Zakiyya al-Mahdi against the Abbasids in 762. Zaydis believe that he was a rightful Caliph, and their sect is named after him. It is believed that from him originated the word for Shi'ites, Rafida.

Various types of ice cream cones include wafer (or cake) cones, waffle cones, and sugar cones. Many styles of cones are made, including pretzel cones and chocolate-coated cones (inside). A variety of double wafer cone exists that allows two scoops of ice cream to be served side by side. Wafer cones are sometimes made with a flat bottom instead of a pointed, conical shape, enabling the ice cream and \\"cone\\" to stand upright on a surface without support. These types of wafer cones are often branded as \\"cups\\". History A sugar cone, with chocolate ice cream. Edible cones were mentioned in French cooking books as early as 1825, when Julien Archambault described how one could roll a cone from \\"little waffles\\".Julien Archambault, Le Cuisinier √©conome ou √âl√©mens nouveaux de cuisine, de p√¢tisserie et d'office, Librairie du commerce, Paris, 1825, page 346. Another printed reference to an edible cone is in Mrs A. B. Marshall's Cookery Book, written in 1888 by Agnes B. Marshall (1855‚Äì1905) of England. Her recipe for \\"Cornet with Cream\\" said that \\"the cornets were made with almonds and baked in the oven, not pressed between irons\\". Edible cones were patented by two entrepreneurs, both Italian, separately in the years 1902 and 1903. Antonio Valvona, an ice cream merchant from Manchester, UK, patented a biscuit cup producing machine in 1902, and in 1903, Italo Marchioni, an Italian ice cream salesman, filed for the patent of a machine which made ice cream containers. At the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904, a Syrian/Lebanese concessionaire named Arnold Fornachou was running an ice cream booth. When he ran short on paper cups, he noticed he was next to a waffle vendor by the name of Ernest Hamwi, who sold Fornachou some of his waffles. Fornachou rolled the waffles into cones to hold the ice cream - and this is believed by some (although there is much dispute) to be the moment where ice-cream cones became mainstream. Abe Doumar and the Doumar family can also claim credit for the ice cream cone. At the age of 16, Doumar began to sell paperweights and other items. One night, he bought a waffle from another vendor transplanted to Norfolk, Virginia from Ghent in Belgium, Leonidas Kestekid√®s. Doumar proceeded to roll up the waffle and place a scoop of ice cream on top. He then began selling the cones at the St. Louis Exposition. His \\"cones\\" were such a success that he designed a four-iron baking machine and had a foundry make it for him. At the Jamestown Exposition in 1907, he and his brothers sold nearly twenty-three thousand cones. After that, Abe bought a semiautomatic 36-iron machine, which produced 20 cones per minute and opened Doumar's Cone's and BBQ In in Norfolk, Virginia, which still operates at the same location over 100 years later.The Ocean View Nickel Tour - Part VII . Rkpuma.com. Retrieved on 2015-11-20.History  Doumar's. Doumars.com (2013-06-16). Retrieved on 2015-11-20. In 2008, the ice cream cone became the official state food of Missouri. Commercial cones  The earliest cones were rolled by hand, from hot and thin wafers, but in 1912, Frederick Bruckman, an inventor from Portland, Oregon, patented a machine for rolling ice cream cones. Page 1 of a September 1917 article in Western Confectioner, describing the creation of inventor-entrepreneur Frederick Bruckman's \\"Real Cake Ice Cream Cone Machine\\" Page 2 of article above He sold his company in 1928 to Nabisco, which is still producing ice cream cones as of 2017. Other ice-cream providers such as Ben & Jerry's make their own cones. Pre-filled cones In 1928, J. T. \\"Stubby\\" Parker of Fort Worth, Texas, created an ice cream cone that could be stored in a grocer's freezer, with the cone and the ice cream frozen together as one item. He formed The Drumstick Company in 1931 to market the product, and in 1991 the company was purchased by Nestl√©. In 1959, Spica, an Italian ice cream manufacturer based in Naples, invented a process whereby the inside of the waffle cone was insulated from the ice cream by a layer of oil, sugar and chocolate. Spica registered the name Cornetto in 1960. Initial sales were poor, but in 1976 Unilever bought out Spica and began a mass- marketing campaign throughout Europe. Cornetto is now one of the most popular ice creams in the world. In 1979, a patent for a new packaging design by David Weinstein led to easier transportation of commercial ice cream cones. Weinstein's design enabled the ice cream cone to be wrapped in a wax paper package. This made the cones more sanitary while also preventing the paper wrapper from falling off during transportation, or from becoming stuck to the cone.

It is also colloquially known as Trell√≥s (crazy) or Trell√≥vouno (crazy mountain); the latter originates from the French \\"tr√®s long\\" (very long) in awe of its winding length of 16km, as used by French travelers during the occupation of Greece by the Ottomans. In antiquity there was a sanctuary to Zeus Ombrios (Zeus the Rain God) on the summit with numerous offerings dating especially to the 8th-7th centuries BC; they are on the site of a military base and not currently accessible. There is also an ancient quarryman's hut on the western slopes of the mountain, one of two buildings in ancient Attica which preserves its roof. The height is at Evzonas and the length is between Athens and the Saronic Gulf and 6 to 7 km from east to west. In the ancient times, the highest point was known as Mega Ymittos and the southern Elattona (ŒïŒªŒ¨œÑœÑŒøŒΩŒ±) and Anydro Ymitto (ŒÜŒΩœÖŒ¥œÅŒø Œ•ŒºŒ∑œÑœÑœå) (today Mavrovouni (ŒúŒ±œÖœÅŒøŒ≤ŒøœçŒΩŒπ meaning black mountain) and Kontra (ŒöœåŒΩœÑœÅŒ±). It was noted for its thyme honey. Marble has been quarried since antiquity. The neighboring communities that surround the mountain are Athens (municipality), Zografou, Kaisariani, Vyronas, Ilissia (a region of Zografou), Ymittos, Ilioupoli, Argyroupoli, Elliniko, Glyfada, Voula and Vouliagmeni in the west, Varkiza, Vari, Markopoulo and Paiania to its east, and Papagou, Cholargos, Agia Paraskevi, Gerakas and Glyka Nera. Most of the forest is in the north, and much of the mountain is rocky, deforested, grassy and made out of limestone. Landscape at Hymettus Major campuses of the University of Athens and the National Technical University of Athens (collectively called \\"University Town\\") are located on the west-facing slope, between the Motorway 64, a ring road connected with the Motorway 6, and the urban sprawl of Athens. A transmitter park for several major TV and radio stations, along with military radar is located at the top of the mountain. Built up urban areas almost surround the entire mountain range. Access to the top of the mountain is restricted to authorized vehicles for maintenance of the towers. Almost all of Athens, its eastern suburbs and the new airport can be seen from the mountain top along with the mountains of Parnitha to its northwest, Penteli to its north and Aegaleo to its west. The valley areas that create the lowest passes are to the south and one further south. The mountain ranges features about six to seven landfills in the western part and another in the eastern part.

It is one of the most accurate spheres ever manufactured, deviating from a perfect sphere by no more than 40 atoms of thick¬≠ness. Only neutron stars and the single-crystal silicon spheres used in the Avogadro Project are thought to be smoother. Fused quartz or fused silica is glass consisting of silica in amorphous (non-crystalline) form. It differs from traditional glasses in containing no other ingredients, which are typically added to glass to lower the melt temperature. Fused silica, therefore, has high working and melting temperatures. Although the terms fused quartz and fused silica are used interchangeably, the optical and thermal properties of fused silica are superior to those of fused quartz and other types of glass due to its purity. For these reasons, it finds use in situations such as semiconductor fabrication and laboratory equipment. It transmits ultraviolet better than other glasses, so is used to make lenses and optics for the ultraviolet spectrum. The low coefficient of thermal expansion of fused quartz makes it a useful material for precision mirror substrates.  Manufacture  Fused quartz is produced by fusing (melting) high-purity silica sand, which consists of quartz crystals. There are four basic types of commercial silica glass: * Type I is produced by induction melting natural quartz in a vacuum or an inert atmosphere. * Type II is produced by fusing quartz crystal powder in a high-temperature flame. * Type III is produced by burning SiCl4 in a hydrogen-oxygen flame. * Type IV is produced by burning SiCl4 in a water vapor-free plasma flame. Quartz contains only silicon and oxygen, although commercial quartz glass often contains impurities. The most dominant impurities are aluminium and titanium.Chemical purity of fused quartz / fused silica, www.heraeus-quarzglas.com Fusion Melting is effected at approximately 1650 ¬∞C (3000 ¬∞F) using either an electrically heated furnace (electrically fused) or a gas/oxygen-fuelled furnace (flame-fused). Fused silica can be made from almost any silicon-rich chemical precursor, usually using a continuous process which involves flame oxidation of volatile silicon compounds to silicon dioxide, and thermal fusion of the resulting dust (although alternative processes are used). This results in a transparent glass with an ultra-high purity and improved optical transmission in the deep ultraviolet. One common method involves adding silicon tetrachloride to a hydrogen‚Äìoxygen flame, but this precursor results in environmentally unfriendly byproducts including chlorine and hydrochloric acid. Product quality Fused quartz is normally transparent. The material can, however, become translucent if small air bubbles are allowed to be trapped within. The water content (and therefore infrared transmission of fused quartz and fused silica) is determined by the manufacturing process. Flame-fused material always has a higher water content due to the combination of the hydrocarbons and oxygen fuelling the furnace, forming hydroxyl [OH] groups within the material. An IR grade material typically has an [OH] content below 10 ppm. Applications Most of the applications of fused silica exploit its wide transparency range, which extends from the UV to the near IR. Fused silica is the key starting material for optical fiber, used for telecommunications. Because of its strength and high melting point (compared to ordinary glass), fused silica is used as an envelope for halogen lamps and high-intensity discharge lamps, which must operate at a high envelope temperature to achieve their combination of high brightness and long life. Vacuum tubes with silica envelopes allowed for radiation cooling by incandescent anodes. Because of its strength, fused silica was used in deep diving vessels such as the bathysphere and benthoscope. Fused silica is also used to form the windows of manned spacecraft, including the Space Shuttle and International Space Station. The combination of strength, thermal stability, and UV transparency makes it an excellent substrate for projection masks for photolithography. An EPROM with fused quartz window in the top of the package Its UV transparency also finds uses in the semiconductor industry; an EPROM, or erasable programmable read only memory, is a type of memory chip that retains its data when its power supply is switched off, but which can be erased by exposure to strong ultraviolet light. EPROMs are recognizable by the transparent fused quartz window which sits on top of the package, through which the silicon chip is visible, and which permits exposure to UV light during erasing. Due to the thermal stability and composition, it is used in semiconductor fabrication furnaces. Fused quartz has nearly ideal properties for fabricating first surface mirrors such as those used in telescopes. The material behaves in a predictable way and allows the optical fabricator to put a very smooth polish onto the surface and produce the desired figure with fewer testing iterations. In some instances, a high-purity UV grade of fused quartz has been used to make several of the individual uncoated lens elements of special-purpose lenses including the Zeiss 105 mm f/4.3 UV Sonnar, a lens formerly made for the Hasselblad camera, and the Nikon UV-Nikkor 105 mm f/4.5 (presently sold as the Nikon PF10545MF-UV) lens. These lenses are used for UV photography, as the quartz glass has a lower extinction rate than lenses made with more common flint or crown glass formulas. Fused quartz can be metallised and etched for use as a substrate for high-precision microwave circuits, the thermal stability making it a good choice for narrowband filters and similar demanding applications. The lower dielectric constant than alumina allows higher impedance tracks or thinner substrates. Fused quartz is also the material used for modern glass instruments such as the glass harp and the verrophone, and is also used for new builds of the historical glass harmonica. Here, the superior strength and structure of fused quartz gives it a greater dynamic range and a clearer sound than the historically used lead crystal. Refractory material applications Fused silica as an industrial raw material is used to make various refractory shapes such as crucibles, trays, shrouds, and rollers for many high-temperature thermal processes including steelmaking, investment casting, and glass manufacture. Refractory shapes made from fused silica have excellent thermal shock resistance and are chemically inert to most elements and compounds, including virtually all acids, regardless of concentration, except hydrofluoric acid, which is very reactive even in fairly low concentrations. Translucent fused-silica tubes are commonly used to sheathe electric elements in room heaters, industrial furnaces, and other similar applications. Owing to its low mechanical damping at ordinary temperatures, it is used for high-Q resonators, in particular, for wine-glass resonator of hemispherical resonator gyro.An Overview of MEMS Inertial Sensing Technology, February 1, 2003 Quartz glassware is occasionally used in chemistry laboratories when standard borosilicate glass cannot withstand high temperatures or when high UV transmission is required. The cost of production is significantly higher, limiting its use; it is usually found as a single basic element, such as a tube in a furnace, or as a flask, the elements in direct exposure to the heat. Physical properties The extremely low coefficient of thermal expansion, about 5.5 ‚ãÖ 10‚àí7/K (20...320 ¬∞C), accounts for its remarkable ability to undergo large, rapid temperature changes without cracking (see thermal shock). Phosphorescence in fused quartz from an extremely intense pulse of UV light in a flashtube, centered at 170 nm Fused quartz is prone to phosphorescence and \\"solarisation\\" (purplish discoloration) under intense UV illumination, as is often seen in flashtubes. \\"UV grade\\" synthetic fused silica (sold under various tradenames including \\"HPFS\\", \\"Spectrosil\\", and \\"Suprasil\\") has a very low metallic impurity content making it transparent deeper into the ultraviolet. An optic with a thickness of 1 cm has a transmittance around 50% at a wavelength of 170 nm, which drops to only a few percent at 160 nm. However, its infrared transmission is limited by strong water absorptions at 2.2 Œºm and 2.7 Œºm. \\"Infrared grade\\" fused quartz (tradenames \\"Infrasil\\", \\"Vitreosil IR\\", and others), which is electrically fused, has a greater presence of metallic impurities, limiting its UV transmittance wavelength to around 250 nm, but a much lower water content, leading to excellent infrared transmission up to 3.6 Œºm wavelength. All grades of transparent fused quartz/fused silica have nearly identical mechanical properties. Phosphorescence of the quartz ignition tube of an air-gap flash Optical properties The optical dispersion of fused silica can be approximated by the following Sellmeier equation: :\\\\varepsilon=n^2=1+\\\\frac{0.6961663\\\\lambda^2}{\\\\lambda^2-0.0684043^2}+\\\\frac{0.4079426\\\\lambda^2}{\\\\lambda^2-0.1162414^2}+\\\\frac{0.8974794\\\\lambda^2}{\\\\lambda^2-9.896161^2}, where the wavelength \\\\lambda is measured in micrometers. This equation is valid between 0.21 and 3.71 ¬µm and at 20 ¬∞C. Its validity was confirmed for wavelengths up to 6.7 ¬µm. Experimental data for the real (refractive index) and imaginary (absorption index) parts of the complex refractive index of fused quartz reported in the literature over the spectral range from 30 nm to 1000 ¬µm have been reviewed by Kitamura et al. and are available online.

He is currently the assistant hitting coach for the Arizona Diamondbacks. Hinske played in the major leagues from 2002 to 2013 with the Toronto Blue Jays, Boston Red Sox, Tampa Bay Rays, Pittsburgh Pirates, New York Yankees, Atlanta Braves and Arizona Diamondbacks at third base, first base, left field, and right field. He won the AL Rookie of the Year Award with the Blue Jays. He has also been a coach for the Chicago Cubs and Los Angeles Angels. Playing career=Early career Born in Menasha, Wisconsin, Hinske played for Menasha High School where he broke many hitting records, in addition to playing football as a running back. After graduating in 1995, he went on to play for the University of Arkansas. In 1997, he played collegiate summer baseball for the Hyannis Mets of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Hinske was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the 17th round of the 1998 amateur draft, and was traded to the Oakland Athletics for Miguel Cairo in March 2001. Toronto Blue Jays On December 7, 2001, Toronto Blue Jays general manager J.P. Ricciardi acquired Hinske and reliever Justin Miller from the Athletics for Billy Koch, a move designed to bring youth and vitality to the team. Hinske was inserted in the everyday line-up in 2002, playing third base, and was a key contributor for the team, hitting predominantly in the second spot in the line-up. While criticized early for his sometimes shoddy defense, Hinske made up for his lapses with his bat, hitting 24 home runs, knocking in 84 runs, and scoring 99 runs. He is one of three rookies in Blue Jays history to hit 21 or more home runs, along with J.P. Arencibia (23 in 2011) and Rowdy Tellez (21 in 2019). He also led all AL third basemen in errors, with 22. He received wide recognition, winning both the MLB Rookie of the Year and The Sporting News Rookie of the Year awards. While playing with the Jays, Bushnell had an advertisement in The Globe and Mail stating Eric Hinske eats fish tonight as the Jays were playing the Florida Marlins. This advertisement gave Hinske the nickname \\"The Big Fish\\". Following Hinske's successful 2002 campaign, Ricciardi signed him to a five-year, $14,750,000 contract in March 2003. Hinske slumped through the early part of the 2003 season before he was finally diagnosed with a broken hamate bone in his right hand, after he had played the beginning of the season with the fracture. As a result, he was unable to match his numbers of the previous year, finishing with an average of .243, 12 home runs and 63 RBIs, Hinske finished fifth in the American League with 45 doubles. Hinske was still unable to return to his rookie form in 2004, finishing the year with a batting average of .248, with 15 home runs and 69 RBIs. A positive note for Hinske was that he had committed a career-low 7 errors at third base, and he led all third baseman in fielding percentage, with a .978 mark. After the 2004 season, the Blue Jays acquired Corey Koskie and Shea Hillenbrand, both third basemen, and Hinske was moved to first base for the 2005 season. He started strongly in 2005 with two home runs and 13 RBIs in his first eight games. Hinske finished April with four home runs and 17 RBIs, with a .289 average and a .482 slugging percentage. He finished the 2005 season with a .262 average, 15 home runs and 68 RBI, and a .430 slugging percentage. With the acquisitions of Lyle Overbay and Troy Glaus by Toronto in the 2005 offseason, there was little room for Hinske as a corner infielder, and he was shifted once more to right field in a platoon with Alex R√≠os for the 2006 season. Rios won the job after having a solid April. Though Hinske's primary position in 2006 was right field, he had also seen some spot duty at first and third base, due to either injuries suffered by his teammates during the game or for pinch-hitting purposes. On June 27, 2006, Rios was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a staph infection suffered after fouling a ball off his leg, thereby clearing the way for Hinske to see regular game action. In addition to Rios' injury, Hillenbrand's stormy departure from the team in July provided even more opportunity for increased playing time. Hinske is also quoted in a July 25, 2006, column on the Blue Jays' official website, criticizing the departed Hillenbrand, who was designated for assignment for, among other things, complaining about his lack of playing time: Boston Red Sox Hinske during his tenure with the Boston Red Sox in spring 2007. On August 17, 2006, Hinske was traded to the Boston Red Sox for a minor league player to be named later and cash considerations. His versatility helped the Red Sox, since they were greatly plagued by injuries in the second half of the season. He ended the season with a 10-game hitting streak. On May 17, 2007, Hinske had what could be his career highlight. In the 5th inning of a game against the Tigers, a ball was hit to right field (where Hinske was playing) and it appeared that the ball was out of reach. But he made a full- body diving catch, while also driving his face into the ground from the impact after making the catch. According to Red Sox color analyst, Jerry Remy, \\"Gosh, that's one of the best catches you'll see all season long (2007 season.) I didn't think he was gonna get to this.\\"Redsox.mlb.com article Later, in the bottom of the 7th inning, he would hit a home run into the Red Sox bullpen. Hinske home run at MLB.com Hinske hit below his career norms with a .204 batting average and a .733 OPS in the 115 games he appeared in with the Red Sox but received his first World Series ring with them in 2007. Tampa Bay Rays Hinske batting for the Tampa Bay Rays on April 24, 2008. On February 6, 2008, Hinske signed a minor-league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Tampa Bay Rays. He was added to the 40-man major league roster on March 29, and was the Rays opening-day right-fielder. In his Rays debut, Hinske homered to right field off Baltimore starter Jeremy Guthrie. On July 29, Hinske hit his 100th career home run off former Toronto Blue Jays teammate Roy Halladay. There was controversy as to whether or not it was an inside the park home run. It was later officially ruled a traditional home run, after it was thought to have hit an awning in center field. On the final day of the regular season, Hinske hit his 20th home run, drove in his 60th run, and stole his 10th base of the year. It was the first time he had hit twenty home runs since his rookie year of 2002, and the first time he had stolen ten bases or more since the 2004 season. Prior to game 4 of the World Series, Hinske was added to the Rays' roster, replacing the injured Cliff Floyd. In the fifth inning of Game 4, Hinske hit an estimated 410-foot pinch- hit home run to center field off Philadelphia starter Joe Blanton. In Game 5 of the 2008 World Series against the Philadelphia Phillies, Hinske was the last batter struck out by Brad Lidge before the Rays lost the series. Pittsburgh Pirates Hinske with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 2009. On January 30, 2009, Hinske signed a one-year deal with the Pittsburgh Pirates worth $1.5 million. He played 54 games for the team batting .255 while driving in 11 runs. New York Yankees In July, Hinske was traded from the Pirates to the New York Yankees in exchange for Eric Fryer and Casey Erickson. With New York he hit .226 with 7 home runs in 84 at-bats over 39 games. Hinske was included in the Yankees' postseason roster for the first round of the 2009 American League Division Series, and for the World Series. This marked his third straight World Series appearance with his third different team, all from the AL East. Additionally, the Yankees win gave him his second World Series ring. Atlanta Braves Hinske during his tenure with the Atlanta Braves On January 5, 2010, it was reported that Hinske signed a one-year deal worth $1.5 million with the Atlanta Braves. In his first Braves at-bat he hit a triple. He hit his first Home Run as a Brave on May 16, 2010. Over the season, he appeared in 131 games, hitting .256 with 11 home runs. He again made it to the postseason for the fourth straight year and hit a dramatic go-ahead, pinch hit, two-run home run in the eighth inning of game three of the NLDS against the San Francisco Giants, but the Braves ultimately lost that game and were eliminated in game four. On December 2, 2010 the Atlanta Braves signed Hinske to a 1-year deal with an option for 2012. Hinske earned himself the nickname \\"Big Damage\\" during the early part of the 2011 season for his dramatic home runs and reckless abandon in his fielding. He is also occasionally called \\"Big Diesel\\" by Braves announcers. On June 3, 2011, Hinske hit a go-ahead solo homer off Mets closer Francisco Rodriguez to help the Braves win 6-3. On May 11, 2012, Hinske was ejected by umpire Mike Muchlinski after Muchlinski ruled that Hinske had not checked his swing and was out on strikes. Arizona Diamondbacks According to a report on December 4, 2012, Hinske signed a 1-year deal with the Arizona Diamondbacks. After passing a physical, the contract became official on December 6, 2012. On June 14, 2013, Hinske was suspended for 5 games for an aggressive action during a Diamondbacks/Dodgers brawl on June 11, his suspension was later reduced to only one game. He was designated for assignment on June 28, 2013. Scouting and coaching Following the 2013 season, Hinske rejoined the Yankees, this time as a scout. He helped convince Brian McCann to sign with the Yankees. After a month as a Yankees' scout, Hinske was hired by the Chicago Cubs to be their first base coach on December 3, 2013. On October 9, 2014, he took up the position of assistant hitting coach within the same organization. In 2016 Hinske won his third World Series ring when the Cubs defeated the Indians in the 2016 World Series in seven games. He was hired by the Los Angeles Angels on October 23, 2017 to be their hitting coach. After one season, he was replaced by Jeremy Reed.https://www.latimes.com/sports/angels/la-sp-angles-hitting- coach-20181102-story.html Personal life Hinske was raised in Menasha, Wisconsin. He attended Menasha High School and played baseball, basketball and football for the Menasha Blue Jays, and lettered in all three sports. Hinske and wife Kathryn, have two daughters, Ava, who was born August 8, 2007, Dylan who was born February 9, 2010 and a son, Aiden Jase (A.J.) born October 31, 2013. Hinske enjoys listening to metal music, and his walk-up song was \\"Walk\\" by Pantera. Hinske has a large set of tattoos incorporating Japanese iconography that completely cover his back.

A pioneer of classic radio, she was one of the first women to create, write, produce and star in a long-running hit when she premiered her serial comedy-drama The Rise of the Goldbergs (1929), later known as The Goldbergs. Her career achievements included winning a Tony Award and an Emmy Award, both for Best Lead Actress. Life and career Berg was born Tillie Edelstein in 1899 in the East Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City, to Jacob and Diana Edelstein, natives of Russia and England, respectively. Berg's chronically unstable mother, Dinah, grieving over the death of her young son, experienced a series of nervous breakdowns and later died in a sanitarium. Tillie, who lived with her family on Lexington Avenue, married Lewis Berg in 1918; they had two children, Cherney (1922‚Äì2003) and Harriet (1926‚Äì2003). She learned theater while producing skits at her father's Catskills Mountains resort in Fleischmanns, New York.Shandler, Jeffrey. \\"Gertrude Berg\\", Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia House of Glass, heard on NBC in 1935. Berg played a hotel owner in this short-lived radio program. After the sugar factory where her husband worked burned down, she developed a semi-autobiographical skit, portraying a Jewish family in a Bronx tenement, into a radio show. Though the household had a typewriter, Berg wrote her script by hand, taking the pages this way to a long-awaited appointment at NBC. When the executive she was meeting with protested that he could not read what Berg had written, she read the script aloud to him. Her performance not only sold the idea for the radio program but also got Berg the job as the lead actress on the program she had written. Berg continued to write the show's scripts by hand in pencil for as long as the program was on the air. On November 20, 1929, a 15-minute episode of The Rise of the Goldbergs was first broadcast on the NBC radio network. She started at $75 a week. Less than two years later, in the heart of the Great Depression, she let the sponsor propose a salary and was told, \\"Mrs. Berg, we can't pay a cent over $2,000 a week.\\"Current Biography 1941, pg. 71 Berg's husband, Lewis‚Äîwho became a successful consulting engineer, though his job loss prompted her to write the initial radio script‚Äîrefused to be photographed with his wife for publicity purposes, as he felt this was infringing on her success. Berg working on television scripts by hand in pencil in 1950. Berg became inextricably identified as Molly Goldberg, the bighearted matriarch of her fictitious Bronx family who moved to Connecticut as a symbol of Jewish- American upward mobility. She wrote practically all the show's radio episodes (more than 5000) plus a Broadway adaptation, Me and Molly (1948). It took considerable convincing, but Berg finally prevailed upon CBS to let her bring The Goldbergs to television in 1949. Early episodes portrayed the Goldberg family openly and personally struggling to adapt to American life. Just as Berg stated in her autobiography, she chose to depict her Jewish grandfather's worship to America and the new world in her first radio broadcast show. Her characters Molly, Jake, Sammy and Rosie emphasized her day to day stories of Jewish immigration to America.Michele Hilmes, Radio Voices: American Broadcasting, 1922-1952 (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1998). Immigrant life and the Goldberg family struggle were familiar and relatable to many families during this point in American history. Radio seemed to lend a hand to new settlers and produced a common place to tie patriotism and families together. The program's victory is largely because of the familiar feelings of the American people portrayed in the program's scripts. The first season script was later published into a book form. Berg won the first ever Emmy Award for Lead Actress in a Comedy Series her debut year on the network‚Äîher twentieth consecutive year of playing the role‚Äîand the show stayed in production for five years. The Goldbergs ran into trouble in 1951, during the McCarthy Era. Co-star Philip Loeb (Molly's husband, patriarch Jake Goldberg) was one of the performers named in Red Channels: The Report of Communist Influence in Radio and Television and blacklisted as a result. The series was canceled as a result of Loeb's participation, and both networks and sponsors insisted Loeb be fired as a condition of the show returning to air, despite Berg's protests. Loeb resigned rather than cause Berg trouble. He reportedly received a generous severance package from the show, but it didn't prevent him from sinking into the depression that ultimately drove him to suicide in 1955.The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows (6th Ed.), by Tim Brooks and Earle Marsh, pg. 404 The Goldbergs returned a year after Loeb departed the show and continued until 1954, after which Berg also wrote and produced a syndicated film version. The show remained in syndicated reruns for another few years, after one year of production and 39 episodes (it aired on some stations as Molly). The series is currently seen on the Jewish Life Television (JLTV) cable network. Berg with orchids in the greenhouse of her summer home, 1954. Berg continued to make guest appearances on television in the 1950s and early 1960s. She appeared on The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom, a February 1958 episode of The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford, and was the \\"mystery guest'\\" on the series What's My Line in 1954 and 1960. In 1961, Berg made a last stab at television success in the Four Star Television situation comedy, Mrs. G. Goes to College (retitled The Gertrude Berg Show at midseason), playing a 62-year-old widow who enrolls in college. The series was cancelled after one season. Berg continued working in theatre through these years. In 1959, she won the Tony Award for Best Actress for her performance in A Majority of One. In 1961, Berg won the Sarah Siddons Award for her work in Chicago theatre. Berg also published a best-selling memoir, Molly and Me, in 1961. Berg was also a songwriter. Country music singer Patsy Cline sang Berg's composition \\"That Wonderful Someone\\" on Cline's 1957 debut album.

The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines them as certain classics of literature, philosophy, history, and science that are believed to contain the basic ideas of western culture. Over the years it has become customary for institutes of higher education to incorporate these readings into their curriculum.‚ÄúThe reason for the study of these classical texts is to both allow and encourage students to become familiar with some of the most revered authors throughout history. This helps to ensure that students and newly found scholars are equipped with a plethora of resources to utilize throughout their studies. The great books are used in conjunction with literary classes in higher education courses, but are often taught in separate subcategories designed for the tone of the intended learning environment. Mortimer Adler used 500 books, out of the list of 517 books within the conglomeration of mixed titles, to teach his pupils expanded literary knowledge past that of their current generation. While Adler stuck to the original list, with a few differences to some novels, many chose to omit many of these titles in order to suit an undergraduate class semester by allowing for only 130 books, such as Torrey Honors Institute. For more thorough literary criticisms, people such as Harold Bloom have comprised lists of volumes including up to 2400 books of differing natures.(2,400 books, Harold Bloom) Concept The great books are those that tradition, and various institutions and authorities, have regarded as constituting or best expressing the foundations of Western culture (the Western canon is a similar but broader designation); derivatively the term also refers to a curriculum or method of education based around a list of such books. Mortimer Adler lists three criteria for including a book on the list: * the book has contemporary significance; that is, it has relevance to the problems and issues of our times; * the book is inexhaustible; it can be read again and again with benefit; \\"This is an exacting criterion, an ideal that is fully attained by only a small number of the 511 works that we selected. It is approximated in varying degrees by the rest.\\" * the book is relevant to a large number of the great ideas and great issues that have occupied the minds of thinking individuals for the last 25 centuries.Adler, \\"Second Look\\", p. 142 Origin Thomas Jefferson, well known for his interest in higher education, frequently composed great books lists for his friends and correspondents, for example, for Peter Carr in 1785Thomas Jefferson to Peter Carr (An honest heart, a knowing head; Paris, 19 August 1785). In: Merril D. Peterson (ed.), Thomas Jefferson Works, 1984. (pp. 814‚Äì818) and again in 1787.Thomas Jefferson to Peter Carr (The homage to Reason; Paris, 10 August 1787). In: Merril D. Peterson (ed.), Thomas Jefferson Works, 1984. (pp. 900‚Äì906). In 1909, Harvard University published a 51-volume Great Books series, titled the Harvard Classics. These volumes are now in the public domain. The Great Books of the Western World came about as the result of a discussion among American academics and educators, starting in the 1920s and 1930s and begun by Prof. John Erskine of Columbia University, about how to improve the higher education system by returning it to the western liberal arts tradition of broad cross- disciplinary learning. These academics and educators included Robert Hutchins, Mortimer Adler, Stringfellow Barr, Scott Buchanan, Jacques Barzun, and Alexander Meiklejohn. The view among them was that the emphasis on narrow specialization in American colleges had harmed the quality of higher education by failing to expose students to the important products of Western civilization and thought. They were at odds both with much of the existing educational establishment and with contemporary educational theory, which caused educational theorists like Sidney Hook and John Dewey (see pragmatism) to disagree with the premise that there was crossover in education. Program The Great Books Program is a curriculum that makes use of this list of texts. The program is designed to teach students to focus solely on using primary sources for material, while leaving little room for secondary source material. It allows emphasis to be put on open discussion, rather than onlooking or overbearing guidance from a professor, facilitator, or tutor in order to further the drive to learn on one's own. This is further studied through the writing of academic papers based upon these principles so that more is discussed, but also completely researched and accurate. In 1920, Professor Erskine taught the first course based on the \\"Great Books\\" program, titled \\"General Honors\\", at Columbia University, and helped mould its core curriculum. The course, however, initially began to fail shortly after its introduction due to numerous disputes between senior faculty over the best way to conduct classes, as well as concerns about the rigour of said courses. This resulted in junior faculty, including Mark Van Doren and Mortimer Adler after 1923, teaching parts of the course. The course was discontinued in 1928, though later reinstated. Adler left for the University of Chicago in 1929, where he continued his work on the theme, and along with the University president, Robert M. Hutchins, held an annual seminar of great books. In 1937, when Mark Van Doren redesigned the course, it was already being taught at St. John's College, Annapolis, in addition to the University of Chicago. This course was later named Humanities A for freshmen, and then subsequently evolved into Literature Humanities. Survivors, however, include Columbia's Core Curriculum, the Common Core at Chicago, and the Core Curriculum at Boston University, each heavily focused on the \\"great books\\" of the Western canon. Modern day university and college Great Books Programs are inspired by the Great Books movement that began in the United States during the 1920s. The aim of such programs is a return to the Western Liberal Arts tradition in education, as a correction to the extreme disciplinary specializations common within the academy. The essential component of such programs is a high degree of engagement with whole primary texts, the Great Books. The curricula of Great Books programs often follow a canon of texts considered more or less essential to a student's education, such as Plato's Republic, or Dante's Divine Comedy. Such programs often focus exclusively on Western culture. Their employment of primary texts dictates an interdisciplinary approach, as most of the Great Books do not fall neatly under the prerogative of a single contemporary academic discipline. Great Books programs often include designated discussion groups as well as lectures, and have small class sizes. In general students in such programs receive an abnormally high degree of attention from their professors, as part of the overall aim of fostering a community of learning. There are only a few true \\"Great Books Programs\\" still in operation. These schools focus almost exclusively on the Great Books Curriculum throughout enrolment and do not offer classes analogous to those commonly offered at other colleges. The first, and most well known, of these schools is St. John's College in Annapolis and Santa Fe (program established in 1937); it was followed by Shimer College in Chicago, the Integral Program at Saint Mary's College of California (1955), Thomas Aquinas College in Santa Paula, California (est. 1971), Thomas More College of Liberal Arts in Merrimack, New Hampshire (est. 1978), and Magdalen College of the Liberal Arts in Warner, New Hampshire. More recent schools with this type of curriculum include New Saint Andrews College in Moscow, Idaho (est. 1994), Gutenberg College in Eugene, Oregon (est. 1994), Harrison Middleton University in Tempe, Arizona (est. 1998), Wyoming Catholic College in Lander, Wyoming (est. 2005), and Imago Dei College in Oak Glen, California (est. 2010). Fordham University's Honors Program at Rose Hill incorporates the Great Books curriculum into a rigorous first four semesters in the program. Loyola University Chicago's Honors Program combines a Great Books curriculum with additional elective classes on subjects not covered in traditional Western thought over a rigorous four year program . The University of Notre Dame's Program of Liberal Studies, established in 1950, is a highly regarded Great Books Program that operates as a separate institution within the College of Liberal Arts. Dharma Realm Buddhist University is the first Great Books school to offer curriculum combining Eastern and Western classics. The Center for the Study of the Great Ideas advances the Great Conversation found in the Great Books by providing Adler's guidance, and resource materials through both live and on-line seminars, educational and philosophical consultation, international presence on the Internet, access to the Center's library collection of books, essays, articles, journals and audio/video programs. Center programs are unique in that they do not replicate other existing programs either started or developed by Adler.  Universities  Over 100 institutions of higher learning in the United States, Canada, and Europe maintain some version of a Great Books Program as an option for students. Among these are: United States *American Public University System *Azusa Pacific University Honors College * Baylor University, Great Texts * Bethlehem College & Seminary, Omnia Program * Biola University, Torrey Honors Institute *Boston College * Boston University * Columbia University * Dharma Realm Buddhist University * East Carolina University Thomas Harriot College of Arts and Sciences * Faulkner University * Fordham University, Rose Hill, Honors Program * Franciscan University of Steubenville * George Fox University, Honors Program * Gutenberg College * Harrison Middleton University * Hillsdale College * Houston Baptist University, Honors College * Iona College * Magdalen College of the Liberal ArtsThe Newman Guide, \\"Northeast Catholic College\\" , Retrieved 5 November 2015 * Mercer University * Middlebury College * New York University, Gallatin Program, Liberal Studies Program * Palm Beach Atlantic University * Pepperdine University * Saint Anselm College * St. John's College * Saint Mary's College of California (Moraga), Integral Liberal Arts Program * Shimer College * Templeton Honors College at Eastern University * Thomas Aquinas College * Thomas More College of Liberal Arts * University of Chicago * University of Dallas * University of Michigan * University of Nevada, Las Vegas * University of Notre Dame *University of San Francisco, St. Ignatius Institute * University of Texas at Austin, Thomas Jefferson Center * University of West Florida, Kugelman Honors Program * Wilbur Wright College * Wyoming Catholic College * Xavier University (Cincinnati) Canada * The College of the Humanities at Carleton University, Ottawa * The Liberal Arts College at Concordia University, Montreal * Liberal Studies at Vancouver Island University * St. Thomas University (New Brunswick) * University of King's College (Foundation Year Programme) * The Arts One Program at the University of British Columbia * The Centre for Preparatory & Liberal Studies at George Brown College, Toronto Europe * Catholic University of Portugal * University of Beira Interior, Portugal Asia * Ashoka University (India) * Ateneo de Manila University (Philippines) * Shalem College (Israel) Controversy In contemporary scholarship, the Great Books curriculum was drawn into the popular debate about multiculturalism, traditional education, the \\"culture war,\\" and the role of the intellectual in American life. Many had issue with the lack of culture added to this list in both the first and second editions due to its lack of diversity in ethnic origin, as many Hispanic and African American documents were overlooked because they did not meet the ideals, of the Great ideas that the chosen texts had to meet a total of 25 of at the least, to be considered as Great books. Much of this debate centered on reactions to the publication of The Closing of the American Mind in 1987 by Allan Bloom.John Searle, \\"The Storm Over the University,\\" The New York Review of Books, December 6, 1990 In his book, Allan Bloom suggested that the shortcomings of teaching the methods of the Great books is that it focuses primarily on historical reading without allowing for point of view of the reader in today‚Äôs day in age. He argued that this limited the ability for our knowledge to grow, given that no perspective was given in regards to the advancement of civilization past the date of these books. Series The Great Books of the Western World is a hardcover 60-volume collection (originally 54 volumes) of the books on the Great Books list (517 individual works). A prominent feature of the collection is a two-volume Syntopicon (meaning \\"a collection of topics\\") that includes essays written by Mortimer Adler on 102 \\"great ideas.\\" Following each essay is an extensive outline of the idea with page references to relevant passages throughout the collection. The collection is available from Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Inc., which owns the copyright. Shortly after Adler retired from the Great Books Foundation in 1989, a second edition (1990) of the Great Books of the Western World was published; it included more Hispanic and female authors and, for the first time, works by black authors. During his tenure as president of the Foundation, Adler had resisted such additions.

Adler bequeathed these films to the Center for the Study of the Great Ideas, where they are available for purchase. In 1993 and 1994, The Learning Channel created a series of one-hour programs discussing many of the Great Books of history and their impact on the world.

New York, 268 U.S. 652 (1925), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court holding that the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution had extended the First Amendment's provisions protecting freedom of speech and freedom of the press to apply to the governments of U.S. states. Along with Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad Co. v. City of Chicago (1897), it was one of the first major cases involving the incorporation of the Bill of Rights. It was also one of a series of Supreme Court cases that defined the scope of the First Amendment's protection of free speech and established the standard to which a state or the federal government would be held when it criminalized speech or writing. The case arose from the conviction under New York state law of Socialist politician and journalist Benjamin Gitlow for the publication of a \\"left wing manifesto\\" in 1919. In a majority opinion joined by six other justices, Associate Justice Edward Terry Sanford upheld the conviction under the bad tendency test, writing that government may suppress or punish speech that directly advocates the unlawful overthrow of the government. Associate Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. dissented, arguing that state and federal governments should only be permitted to limit free speech under the \\"clear and present danger\\" test that he had previously laid out in Schenck v. United States (1919). In his majority opinion, Sanford laid out the grounds for incorporation of freedom of speech and freedom of the press, holding that they were among the rights protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Later Supreme Court cases such as De Jonge v. Oregon (1937) would incorporate other provisions of the Bill of Rights on the same basis as Gitlow. Background New York's Criminal Anarchy Law was passed in 1902 following the assassination of President William McKinley by an anarchist in Buffalo, New York, in September 1901. Under the Criminal Anarchy Law, people seen as activists supporting the destruction of American government through revolutionary means could be arrested in an attempt to prevent American Bolsheviks from gaining a national following. Following the Red Scare of 1919‚Äì20, a variety of leftists, either anarchists, sympathizers with the Bolshevik Revolution, labor activists, or members of a communist or socialist party, were convicted for violating the Espionage Act of 1917 and Sedition Act of 1918 on the basis of their writings or statements. Benjamin Gitlow, a member of the Socialist Party of America, who had served in the New York State Assembly, was charged with criminal anarchy under New York's Criminal Anarchy Law of 1902 for publishing in July 1919 a document called \\"Left Wing Manifesto\\" in The Revolutionary Age, a newspaper for which he served as business manager. His trial lasted from January 22 to February 5, 1920. His defense contended that the Manifesto represented historical analysis rather than advocacy. Moreover, he claimed that he should not be arrested for his writing since the manifesto's distribution was not the inciting incident for any actions against the government. The prosecution refuted Gitlow's claim, stating, \\"Prosecutions have been for the use of words or printed arguments urging actions which if carried out by the reader or hearer would have resulted in the commission of a crime.\\" The prosecution claimed that the Manifesto's intent was to convince American readers to commit crimes, and that in itself should be punishable by law. It took the jury three hours to convict Gitlow on February 11, 1920 and sentenced to 5 to 10 years in prison. He served more than two years at Sing Sing prison before his motion to appeal was granted and he was released on bail. State courts of appeal upheld his conviction.New York Times: \\"Gitlow Goes Back to Serve his Term,\\" November 10, 1925, accessed June 17, 2012 Gitlow was the first major First Amendment case that the American Civil Liberties Union argued before the Supreme Court. The Court had to consider whether it could review a challenge to a state law on the basis that it violated the federal constitution. If it determined that such a challenge lay within the scope of its authority, then it had to review the application of the law to the case at hand, the specific violation of the statute. Decision=Free speech The Supreme Court upheld Gitlow's conviction 7‚Äì2, with Louis Brandeis and Oliver W. Holmes dissenting on the grounds that even \\"indefinite\\" advocacy of overthrowing government should be protected speech. The Court upheld Gitlow's conviction on the basis that the government may suppress or punish speech that directly advocates the unlawful overthrow of the government and it upheld the constitutionality of the state statute at issue, which made it a crime to advocate the duty, need, or appropriateness of overthrowing government by force or violence. Justice Edward Terry Sanford's majority opinion attempted to define more clearly the \\"clear and present danger\\" test developed a few years earlier in Schenck v. United States.. He embraced \\"the bad tendency test\\" found in Shaffer v. United States, which held that a \\"State may punish utterances endangering the foundations of government and threatening its overthrow by unlawful means\\" because such speech clearly \\"present[s] a sufficient danger to the public peace and to the security of the State.\\" According to Sanford, a \\"single revolutionary spark may kindle a fire that, smoldering for a time, may burst into a sweeping and destructive conflagration.\\" He said the Manifesto contained \\"the language of direct incitement\\" and was not \\"the expression of philosophical abstraction.\\" In his dissent, Holmes, the author of Schenck's clear and present danger test, wrote that he believed it was still the appropriate test to employ in judging the limits of freedom of expression. Joined by Brandeis, he argued that Gitlow presented no present danger because only a small minority of people shared the views presented in the manifesto and because it directed an uprising at some \\"indefinite time in the future.\\" Moreover, he responded to Sanford's kindling metaphor by refuting the claim that the Manifesto is an example of \\"incitement.\\" Holmes states, \\"Every idea is an incitement. It offers itself for belief and if believed it is acted on unless some other belief outweighs it or some failure of energy stifles the movement at its birth. The only difference between an expression of opinion and an incitement in the narrower sense is the speaker's enthusiasm for the result. Eloquence may set fire to reason, but, whatever may be thought of the redundant discourse before us, it had no chance of starting a present conflagration.\\" Incorporation The Supreme Court previously held, in Barron v. Baltimore, that the Constitution's Bill of Rights applied only to the federal government, that states were free to enforce statutes that restricted the rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights, and that the federal courts could not interfere with the enforcement of such statutes.. Gitlow v. New York partly reversed that precedent and began a trend toward its near complete reversal. The Supreme Court now holds that almost every provision of the Bill of Rights applies to both the federal government and the states, with the exception of the Eighth Amendment's excessive bail and fine provision, the Third and Seventh Amendments, and the Fifth Amendment's grand jury provision.Encyclopedia of American Civil Rights and Liberties: Revised and Expanded The Supreme Court relied on the \\"due process clause\\" of the Fourteenth Amendment, which prohibits a state from depriving \\"any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\\" The Court stated that \\"For present purposes we may and do assume that\\" the rights of freedom of speech and freedom of the press were \\"among the fundamental personal rights and 'liberties' protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from impairment by the states\\". Aftermath On November 9, 1925, Gitlow surrendered to New York Authorities for transportation back to Sing Sing Prison to finish his sentence. On December 11, 1925, New York Gov. Al Smith pardoned him, saying that while Gitlow had been \\"properly and legally convicted\\", he needed to consider \\"whether or not he has been sufficiently punished for a political crime.\\" He concluded that \\"no additional punishment would act as a deterrent to those who would preach an erroneous doctrine of Government.\\" Gitlow was later briefly elected General Secretary of the American Communist Party in 1929. The Court used the doctrine first enunciated in Gitlow in other cases, such as De Jonge v. Oregon,. Wolf v. Colorado,. and Gideon v. Wainwright,. to extend the reach of the Bill of Rights. Constitutional scholars refer to this as the \\"incorporation doctrine,\\" meaning that the Supreme Court has identified rights specified in the Bill of Rights and incorporated them into the liberties covered by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Recently, the Supreme Court ruled in McDonald v. Chicago that the 2nd Amendment Right to \\"...keep and bear arms,\\" for lawful purposes such as self-defense is both a fundamental and individual right of all law-abiding Citizens over 21 years of age and of sound mind as self-defense is the \\"central component\\" of the 2nd Amendment, and these Rights are \\"fully applicable\\" in all of the 50 States..

A downed animal, one that is unable to stand, is not necessarily a downer.  Causes  The animal's inability to stand may be caused by illness or injury. In nearly all cases it is considered by most farmers to be both humane and cost-effective to kill the animal when it becomes a downer, rather than keeping it alive and unhealthy. Once killed, and depending on how the animal became a downer and how it was killed, the animal may then be incinerated, buried, rendered, or slaughtered. Because of mad cow disease, the slaughter of downer cattle is a topic of great concern. There are many possible reasons for an animal staying down, including: *Mastitis *Metritis *Hypomagnesaemia *Hypocalcaemia *Ketosis *Dystocia **Nerve damage **Pelvic fracture *Long bone fracture *Neurological disease Use of certain animal feed additives has been linked to downers such as the use of ractopamine in pigs.  Situations in different countries =United States A longstanding issue is whether these animals are treated humanely or inhumanely by shippers, stockyards, and packers while they are being moved or held for slaughter. Legislation periodically is introduced in Congress to outlaw the sale or transfer of such animals, but livestock producer groups (who generally agree that livestock markets should not accept severely disabled animals) have long contended that their voluntary efforts to end harmful practices have already proven successful. The 2002 farm bill (P.L. 107-171, Sec. 10815) required the USDA to investigate and submit a report on nonambulatory livestock, and to issue and enforce regulations, if deemed necessary, to provide for their humane treatment.CRS Report for Congress: Agriculture: A Glossary of Terms, Programs, and Laws, 2005 Edition ‚Äì Order Code 97-905 Different jurisdictions have different rules about what can be done with a downer cow. In some jurisdictions the cow may be slaughtered without question. In others, downer cattle may not be slaughtered even if the cause is a physical injury. In the United States, meat inspection is usually an interstate commerce issue, and is regulated by the Federal Meat Inspection Act. Now all livestock auction barns are not allowed to take sick or downer cows because of the rulings that originated with the BSE \\"mad cow\\" crisis. Canada In Canada, transportation of animals is federally regulated. The Health of Animals RegulationsHealth of Animals state that an animal has to be fit for the intended journey and that a non-ambulatory animal cannot be transported because transport would cause additional suffering. The Canadian authority responsible for the welfare of animals that are transported is the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.Transportation of Animals Program: Compromised Animals Policy Mad cow disease and downers The downer issue took on another dimension when bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), which often makes infected cattle downers, was found in two North American cows in 2003. Many experts believe that nonambulatory cattle are at higher risk of harboring BSE. As a result, on December 30, 2003 the USDA announced an immediate ban on the slaughter of downer cattle for human food use.USDA Announces Proposed Rule for Requirements of the Disposition of Downer Cattle - USDA (2008-08-27) At issue is how to monitor the hundreds of thousands of U.S. downer cattle (annual estimate) if they are no longer presented for observation and testing at meat packing plants; also at issue is what to do with their remains, and whether they have any non-food value.CRS Report for Congress: Agriculture: A Glossary of Terms, Programs, and Laws, 2005 Edition ‚Äì Order Code 97-905 See also *Becky Sandstedt References * https://web.archive.org/web/20120621001651/http://www.fsis.usda.gov/News_%26_Events/NR_071207_01/index.asp Category:Livestock Category:Bovine diseases Category:Cruelty to animals de:Merzvieh ","title":"Downer (animal)"},{"id":"430049","text":"David Yonggi Cho (born 14 February 1936 as Paul Yungi Cho) is a South Korean Christian minister. With his mother-in-law Choi Ja-shil, he is cofounder and eternal leader of the Yoido Full Gospel Church (Assemblies of God), the world's largest congregation, with a claimed membership of 830,000 (). Early life Cho was born on February 14, 1936, in Ulju-gun, now part of Ulsan metropolitan city. The son of Cho Doo-chun and Kim Bok-sun, Cho was the eldest of five brothers and four sisters. He graduated from middle school with honours. Because his father's sock and glove business went bankrupt, he could not afford high school or university tuition. Subsequently, he enrolled in an inexpensive technical high school to learn a trade. At the same time, he began frequenting an American army base near his school, and learned English from soldiers whom he befriended. He mastered English quickly, and became an interpreter for the commander of the army base, and also for the principal of his school. Raised initially as a Buddhist, Cho converted to Christianity at the age of 17, after a beautiful girl visited him telling him about Jesus Christ, before he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. Sensing God calling him to the ministry, Cho began working as an interpreter for the American evangelist Ken Tize. In 1956, he received a scholarship to study theology at Full Gospel Bible College in Seoul. While there, he met Choi Ja-shil, who became his mother-in-law and a close ministerial associate. He graduated in March 1958. Wider ministry Cho has spent more than 44 years emphasizing the importance of cell group ministry, which he believes is the key to church growth, as well as team ministry. In November 1976, Cho founded Church Growth International, an organization dedicated to teaching the principles of evangelism and church growth to pastors all over the world. In January 1986, he led the way in establishing the Elim Welfare Town, a facility for the elderly, the young, the homeless, and the unemployed. The latter would be given training and a choice of four occupations. In 1988, he founded newspaper company, Kukmin Ilbo. He was Chairman of the World Assemblies of God Fellowship from 1992 to 2000, and has served as Chairman of the Korean Christian Leaders Association since November 1998. He has also served as Chairman of the Good People charity organization since February 1999. In 2008, Cho retired, with Young Hoon Lee succeeding him as senior pastor. Controversies In March, 2011, Cho again became a subject of controversy when he reportedly made comments suggesting that the 2011 T≈çhoku tsunami \\"could be a warning from God to Japan, which has become an increasingly materialistic, secular and idol-worshiping country.\\" However, as the context of the interview was distorted, a text of apology was announced by The News Mission.Kyunghyang Shinmun, 14 March 2011. . In September 2011, 29 church elders out of 1,500 filed a lawsuit by South Korean prosecutors. The prosecutors began an investigation of Cho's alleged embezzlement of 23 billion won ($20 million USD) from the Yoido Full Gospel Church's funds. A national broadcaster, MBC, released a documentary that claimed the money had been used to buy properties for Bethesda University in Anaheim, California, United States, which Cho founded. In 2014, Cho was convicted for embezzling $12 million USD in church funds that he bought from his son Cho Jong-Un.

Catholicism was first introduced during the late Joseon Dynasty period by Confucian scholars who encountered it in China. In 1603, Yi Gwang-jeong, Korean diplomat, returned from Beijing carrying several theological books written by Matteo Ricci, an Italian Jesuit missionary to China.KIM Han-sik, 'The Influence of Christianity', Korean Journal XXIII, 12, December 1983, p. 5. He began disseminating the information in the books, and the first seeds of Christianity were sown. In 1758, King Yeongjo of Joseon officially outlawed Catholicism as an \\"evil practice.\\" Catholicism was reintroduced in 1785 by Yi Seung-hun and since then French and Chinese Catholic priests were invited by the Korean Christians. Joseon royalty saw the new religion as a subversive influence and persecuted its earliest followers in Korea, culminating in the Catholic Persecution of 1866, in which 8,000 Catholics across the country were killed, including nine French missionary priests. The opening of Korea to the outside world in the late nineteenth century brought religious toleration for the remaining Catholics and also introduced Protestantism via American missionaries, beginning in 1884. The first Protestant church in Korea was established by Seo Sang-ryun and the first Protestant missionary to enter Korea was Horace Newton Allen, both events occurring in 1884. Horace Allen was a North Presbyterian missionary who became an American diplomat. He served in Korea until 1905, by which time he had been joined by many others.Kim, Sang-Hwan (1996). The impact of early Presbyterian missionary preaching (1884‚Äì1920) on the preaching of the Korean church (M.A. thesis), Wilfrid Laurier University The growth of both denominations was gradual before 1945. In that year, approximately 2% of the population was Christian. Rapid growth ensued after the war, when Korea was freed from Japanese occupation by the Allies: by 1991, 18.4% of the population (8.0 million) was Protestant, and 6.7% (2.5 million) was Catholic.Korean Overseas Information Service, A Handbook of Korea (1993) p, 132 The Catholic Church has increased its membership by 70% in the ten years leading up to 2007. Numerous unorthodox sects, such as the Unification Church founded in 1954 by Sun Myung Moon, have also developed in Korea. The influence on education has been decisive, as Christian missionaries started 293 schools and 40 universities including three of the top five academic institutions. Christianity was associated with more widespread education and Western modernization.James H. Grayson, Korea: A Religious History (2002) p 169. Catholicism and Protestantism are seen as the religion of the middle class, youth, intellectuals, and urbanites, and has been central to South Korea's pursuit of modernity and westernization after the end of World War II and the liberation of Korea. In the early 21st century, however, the growth of Protestantism has slowed, perhaps due to scandals involving church leadership, fundamentalism and conflict among various sects. Some analysts also attribute this to overly zealous missionary work.S. S. Moon, \\"The Protestant missionary movement in Korea: Current growth and development.\\" International Bulletin of Missionary Research 32.2 (2008) pp: 59+. Meanwhile, Eastern Orthodoxy, accounts for about four thousand adherents in South Korea, or 0.005% of the total population. As of 2010, 29% of the South Korean population is Christian. The government put the number of Protestant churches at 17,000 and Catholic churches at 3000. Totaling there are 20,000 Churches. Cultural significance Professor James H. Grayson from the School of East Asian Studies at University of Sheffield states that Protestantism has been a dynamic force in Korean life, and had a positive influence on other religions. Catholics and Buddhists had to compete for loyalty and attention, and it inspired numerous smaller sects. They adopted many of the methods pioneered by the Protestants. The influence on higher education in Korea has been decisive as the Christians started 293 schools and 40 universities including 3 of the top 5 academic institution. Sukman argues that since 1945, Catholicism and Protestantism has been widely seen by Koreans as the religion of the middle class, youth, intellectuals, urbanites, and modernizers. It has been a powerful force supporting South Korea's pursuit of modernity and westernization, and opposition to the old Japanese colonialism and Communism of North Korea. Prior to the Korean War (1950‚Äì1953), two-thirds of Korean Christians lived in the North, but most later fled to the South. It is not known exactly how many Christians remain in North Korea today. There is uncertainty about the exact number in South Korea. By the end of the 1960s, there were an estimated half a million Catholics and one million Protestants in South Korea, but during the \\"Conversion Boom\\" period ending in the 1980s, the number of Catholics and Protestants increased faster here than in any other country. The 2005 South Korean census showed 29.2 percent of the population identifying as Christian, up from 26.3 percent ten years previously.figures from the 2005 census Figures from the 1995 census Catholicism is by far the largest Christian denomination in South Korea; and they also tend to be better educated than most other religious groups in South Korea, in the sense that they have a high number of college graduates (50.4%) and post-graduate degrees (11.6%) per capita. The Presbyterian Church has the highest number of members of any Protestant denomination in South Korea, with close to 20,000 churches affiliated with the two largest Presbyterian denominations in the country., http://www.gapck.org The Orthodox Christianity under the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople is a small minority religion in South Korea with about 4,000 official members in 2013. South Korea provides the world's second-largest number of Christian missionaries, surpassed only by the United States. GMS, the missionary body of the \\"Hapdong\\" General Assembly of Presbyterian Church of Korea, is the single largest missionary organization in South Korea. South Korean missionaries have been serving in 10/40 Window nations, which are more hostile to Westerners. In 2000, there were 10,646 South Korean Protestant missionaries in 156 countries, along with an undisclosed number of Catholic missionaries. According to a 2004 article, \\"South Korea dispatched more than 12,000 missionaries to over 160 countries in comparison to about 46,000 American and 6,000 British missionaries, according to missionary organizations in South Korea and the West\\". According to a 2007 article, \\"Korea has 16,000 missionaries working overseas, second only to the US\\". In 1980, South Korea sent 93 missionaries and by 2009, some 20,000 Korean missionaries. Aaron Tan, director of the Hong Kong architectural firm called Research Architecture Design, described the night scene of Seoul as \\"full of glowing Christian crosses\\". Growth of Christianity Christian share of South Korea's population Appeal in the North Christianity, especially Catholicism and Protestantism, had a special appeal to Koreans in the North. Between 1440 and 1560, there were migrations to the northern provinces, which were designed to strengthen the border. This created a society of mixed backgrounds without an aristocracy and without long-standing religious institutions. However, it did have a strong and ambitious merchant class, as well as a strong military tradition. Local elites gained administrative positions and adopted Confucian literati lifestyles but were not easy to attain high-level positions. During Japanese colonial rule from 1910 to 1945, the North became the more industrial region of Korea. The area was highly receptive to Catholic and Protestant missionaries in the late nineteenth century, who brought Western knowledge, and established hospitals and Western-style medical care, schools, and a window to the wider world. The middle-class elites sent their sons to the Catholic or Protestant schools. In turn the sons became strong nationalists who considered the United States a rallying point in opposition to Japanese colonial imperialism. In a reversal of previous Southern dominance, the North produced many influential figures in Korean history. After 1945, North Korea's Soviet-influenced state policy of atheism as a major facet of Juche caused most Christians to flee to South Korea in pursuit of religious freedom. Academic sympathy Matteo Ricci's books, which he created to use Chinese ideograms and concepts to introduce Catholicism, provoked academic controversy when Yi Gwang-jeong brought them into Korea. Academics remained critical of the new thought for many years. Early in the 17th century, Yi Su-gwang, a court scholar, and Yu Mong-in, a cabinet minister, wrote highly critical commentaries on Ricci's works. During the next two centuries, academic criticism of Catholic beliefs continued, as it overturned Confucian veneration of elders and tradition. Some scholars, however, were more sympathetic to Catholicism. Members of the Silhak (Ïã§Ìïô; \\"practical learning\\") school believed in social structure based on merit rather than birth (see class discrimination), and were therefore often opposed by the mainstream academic establishment. Silhak scholars perceived Catholicism as providing an ideological basis for their beliefs and were therefore attracted to what they saw as the egalitarian values of Catholicism.KIM Han-sik, \\"The Influence of Christianity\\", Korean Journal XXIII, 12, December 1983, pp. 6‚Äì7. When Catholicism was finally established in Korea in the 18th century, there was already a substantial body of educated opinion sympathetic to it, which was crucial to the spread of the Catholic faith in the 1790s.KIM Han-sik, 'The Influence of Christianity', Korean Journal XXIII, 12, December 1983, p. 6. An 1801 study indicated that 55% of all Catholics had family ties to the Silhak school.KIM Ok-hy, 'Women in the History of Catholicism in Korea', Korean Journal XXIV, 8, August 1984, p. 30. Lay leadership As a result of the influence of the Silhak school, Catholicism in Korea began as an indigenous lay movement rather than being imposed by a foreign missionaries. The first Catholic prayer-house was founded in 1784 at Seoul by Yi Seung-hun, a diplomat who had been baptized in Beijing.CHOI Suk-Woo, pp. 5‚Äì6. In 1786, Yi proceeded to establish a hierarchy of lay-priests.Unification Board, The Identity of the Korean People, Seoul, 1983, pp. 132‚Äì136. Although the Vatican ruled in 1789 that the appointment of lay-priests violated Canon law, in Korea indigenous lay-workers rather than foreign prelates carried Catholicism to many. Since Christianity began as largely a grassroots effort in Korea, it spread more quickly through the population. Hangul, literacy and education Hangul, a phonemic Korean alphabet invented around 1446 by scholars in the court of Sejong the Great,Merit Students Encyclopedia, Vol. 10, New York and London, 1980, p. 440. was little used for several centuries because of the perceived cultural superiority of Classical Chinese (a position similar to that of Latin in Europe). However, the Catholic Church became the first Korean religious organization to officially adopt Hangul as its primary script. Bishop Sim√©on- Fran√ßois Berneux mandated that all Catholic children be taught to read it.CHO Kwang, 'The Meaning of Catholicism in Korean History', Korean Journal XXIV, 8, August 1984, pp. 20‚Äì21. Christian literature printed for use in Korea, including that used by the network of schools established by Christian missionaries, mostly used the Korean language and the easily learned Hangul script. This combination of factors resulted in a rise in the overall literacy rate, and enabled Christian teachings to spread beyond the elite, who mostly used Chinese. As early as the 1780s, portions of the Gospels were published in Hangul; doctrinal books such as the \\"Jugyo Yoji\\" (Ï£ºÍµêÏöîÏßÄ) appeared in the 1790s and a Catholic hymnal was printed around 1800. John Ross, a Scottish Presbyterian missionary based in Shenyang, completed his translation of the New Testament into Korean in 1887,John Ross (1842‚Äì1915), Scottish Presbyterian Missionary in Manchuria and Protestant leaders began a mass distribution effort. In addition, they established numerous schools, the first modern educational institutions in Korea.Andrew C. Nah, A Panorama of 5000 Years: Korean History, Seoul, 1983, p. 81. The Methodist Paichai School for boys was founded in 1885, and the Methodist Ewha School for girls (later to become Ewha Womans University) followed in 1886. These, and similar schools established soon afterward, helped the expansion of Protestantism among the common people. Protestants surpassed Catholics as the largest Christian group in Korea. Female literacy rose sharply, since women had previously been excluded from the educational system.CHO Kwang, pp. 20‚Äì21. Christianity under Japanese occupation, 1910-1945 Christianity grew steadily, with the Catholic population reaching 147,000, and the Protestants 168,000 by the mid-1930s. The stronghold for both groups was the North. From 1910 to 1945 the Japanese occupied all of the country, taking over its rule under a treaty forced on Korea. The Japanese-controlled police made systematic efforts to minimize the influence of the missionaries; this reduced conversions during the years 1911‚Äì1919. The idealistic pronouncements of United States President Woodrow Wilson about self-determination of nations contributed to the rapid growth of Korean nationalism in the 1920s, but disillusionment set in after the movement failed to achieve meaningful reform. In 1924, Protestants founded the Korean National Christian Council to coordinate activities and divided the country into regions assigned to specific Protestant denominations for oversight. Korean Protestants also founded overseas missions to Koreans in China. By 1937, the Presbyterian Church of Korea was largely independent of financial support from the United States; in 1934 the Methodist Church became autonomous and elected a Korean bishop. The most active missionaries among the Catholics were the Maryknoll order, which opened the Maryknoll School of Nursing in Pusan in 1964; it is now the Catholic University of Pusan.Kenneth Scott Latourette, Christianity in a Revolutionary Age: Vol. 5: The Twentieth Century outside Europe (1962), pp 414-5 Korean nationalism Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception at the Myeongdong Cathedral. One of the most important factors leading to widespread acceptance of Christianity in Korea was the identification that many Christians forged with the cause of Korean nationalism during the Japanese occupation (1910‚Äì1945). During this period, Japan undertook a systematic campaign of cultural assimilation. There was an emphasis on Showa, so the Koreans would revere the Japanese emperor. In 1938, Japan prohibited the use of the Korean language in government, schools and businesses and even at home. The distinctly Korean nature of the church was reinforced during those years by the allegiance to the nation that was demonstrated by many Christians. While South Korea's constitution guarantees freedom of religion and separation of church and state, the government has been sympathetic to Christianity. It considers the religion to provide some ideological protection against their Communist neighbor. On 1 March 1919, an assembly of 33 religious and professional leaders, known as the \\"March 1 Movement\\", passed a Declaration of independence. Although organized by leaders of the Chondogyo religion, 15 of the 33 signatories were Protestants, including figures such as Gil Seon-ju. The Japanese imprisoned many in the movement. Also in 1919, the predominantly Catholic pro-independence movement called \\"Ulmindan\\"CHOI Suk-woo, p. 10. was founded. A China-based Korean government-in-exile was at one time led by Syngman Rhee, a Methodist.Encyclopedia Americana, Vol. 23, Danbury, Conn., 1988, p. 464. Christianity was linked even more with the patriotic cause when some Christians refused to participate in worship of the Japanese Emperor, which was required by law in the 1930s.CHO Kwang, p. 11. Although this refusal was motivated by theological rather than political convictions, the consequent imprisonment of many Christians strongly identified their faith, in the eyes of many Koreans, with the cause of Korean nationalism and resistance to the Japanese occupation. Especially the independence of Korea and the Korean War periods featured a further increase in Marian devotion among many Catholics that because Catholics thought the Blessed Virgin Mary who is patron saint of Korea helped Koreans against Japanese imperialism and communism. Both the date of Liberation Day in 1945 and the date of the establishment of the South Korean government in 1948 also overlap with the feast day of the Assumption of Mary. Minjung theology The Christian concept of individual worth has found expression in a lengthy struggle for human rights and democracy in Korea. In recent years, this struggle has taken the form of Minjung theology. Minjung theology is based on the \\"image of God\\" concept expressed in Genesis 1:26‚Äì27, but also incorporates the traditional Korean feeling of han, a word that has no exact English translation, but that denotes a sense of inconsolable pain and utter helplessness. Minjung theology depicts commoners in Korean history as the rightful masters of their own destiny. Two of the country's best known political leaders, Kim Young-sam, a Presbyterian, and Kim Dae-jung, a Roman Catholic, subscribe to Minjung theology.Michael Lee, 'Korean Churches Pursue Social and Political Justice', in Brian Heavy (Ed.), Accent III, 3 Auckland, May 1988, pp. 19‚Äì20. Both men spent decades opposing military governments in South Korea and were frequently imprisoned as a result, and both also served terms as President of the Republic after democracy was restored in 1988. One manifestation of Minjung theology in the final years of the Park Chung-hee regime (1961‚Äì1979) was the rise of several Christian social missions, such as the Catholic Farmers Movement and the Protestant Urban Industrial Mission, which campaigned for better wages and working conditions for laborers. The military government imprisoned many of their leaders because it considered the movement a threat to social stability, and their struggle coincided with a period of unrest which culminated in the assassination of President Park on 26 October 1979.Keesing's Contemporary Archives, London, 25 April 1980, p. 30216. Social change Many Korean Christians believe that their values have had a positive effect on various social relationships. Traditional Korean society was hierarchically arranged according to Confucian principles under the semi-divine emperor. Women had no social rights,CHO Kwang, pp. 16‚Äì18. children were totally subservient to their parents,CHO Kwang, pp. 18‚Äì19. and individuals had no rights except as defined by the overall social system. This structure was challenged by the Christian teaching that all human beings are created in the image of God and thus that every one of them is equal and has essential worth.KIM Han-sik, pp. 11‚Äì12. According to Kim Han-sik, this concept also supported the idea of property being owned by individuals rather than by families (or by the heads of families). Christians regarded the emperor as a mere man who was as much under God's authority as were his subjects,CHOI Suk-woo, p. 7. and Christian values favored the social emancipation of women and children. The church permitted the remarriage of widows (as taught by the apostle Paul, not traditionally allowed in East Asian societies), prohibited concubinage and polygamy, and forbade cruelty to or desertion of wives. Christian parents were taught to regard their children as gifts from God, and were required to educate them.CHO Kwang, pp. 16‚Äì19. Arranged child marriages and the neglect of daughters (who were often regarded as less desirable than sons in Asian culture) were prohibited. Economic growth South Korea's rapid economic growth in the 1960s and 1970s is usually credited to the policy of export-oriented industrialization led by Park Chung-hee to indigenous cultural values and work ethic, a strong alliance with the United States, and the infusion of foreign capital. Many South Korean Christians view their religion as a factor in the country's dramatic economic growth over the past three decades, believing that its success and prosperity are indications of God's blessing. A 2003 study by economists Robert J. Barro and Rachel McCleary suggests that societies with high levels of belief in heaven and high levels of church attendance exhibit high rates of economic growth. Barro and McCleary's model has been influential in subsequent scholarship and, to some observers, it supports the belief that Christianity has played a major role in South Korea's economic success. The study has been criticised by scholars such as Durlauf, Kortellos and Tan (2006). There is a tendency to build megachurches since 2000, that leads some churches to financial debt. World Mission and Evangelization \\"In the 1960s the church reached out to people who were oppressed, such as prostitutes and new industrial laborers. As the Korean economy was burgeoning, the issue of the industrial labor force came to the fore as one of the most important areas of evangelization work. Churches established industrial chaplaincies among the workers within factories. In addition, with military service mandatory for men in South Korea, the part the chaplain's corps in the armed forces became equally important. Many soldiers converted to Christianity during their military service.\\" Korean is now second only to the United States in terms of commissioned missionaries (30,000). The denomination with the highest number of missionaries is Presbyterian Church in Korea (Hapdong) with about 3,000 missionaries. Political and social issues There have been various political and social criticisms in the Korean Christian scene since President Lee Myung-bak came into power. The South Korean government proposed to restrict South Korean citizens working for missionary works in the Middle East. Professor Son Bong-ho of Goshin University criticized the president for partaking in a national-level Christian prayers' gathering on March 2011 that signaled a potential danger of the strong Protestant influence in the secular South Korean politics. Increasing acts of hostility by Protestant Christians against Buddhism, have drawn strong criticism and backlash against Protestant churches by the South Korean public and has contributed in Protestantism's growing decline in Korea. Seoul Free Lunch Referendum Former Mayor of Seoul, Oh Se-hoon, proposed a referendum in Seoul on 24 August 2011. Pastors of multiple churches in Seoul were found to involve unlawfully with the lay people about the referendum and later being penalized by the Seoul Metropolitan election Commission (ÏÑúÏö∏ÏãúÏÑ†Í±∞Í¥ÄÎ¶¨ÏúÑÏõêÌöå).ÎåÄÌòïÍµêÌöå Î™©ÏÇ¨ Îì± Ï£ºÎØºÌà¨ÌëúÎ≤ï ÏúÑÎ∞ò Ï°∞ÏÇ¨ (Ï¢ÖÌï©) 2011-08-23 Yonhap News October 2011 by-election A Christian group in Seoul had been indicted by the Seoul Metropolitan election Commission for sending politically motivated emails to the laypeople in order to vote for the conservative candidate, Na Kyung-won, before the 2011 South Korean by- elections. Creationism In South Korea, Christian groups have been involved in the promotion of creationism, especially the Korea Association for Creation Research (KACR) which advocates creation following the Book of Genesis, and the Society for Textbook Revise (STR), an alternative translation Committee to Revise Evolution In Textbook (CREIT). It's an independent offshoot of the KACR, and has distanced itself from the KACR doctrine. In early 2008, Seoul Land, a leading amusement park, hosted a \\"creation science\\" exhibit, organized by KACR, which was visited by over 116,000 visitors in three months, and , the park is in talks to create a year-long exhibition. In 2012, following pressure from STR, the Ministry of Education announced that many high-school textbooks would be revised to remove certain examples of evolution, such as of the horse and the dinosaur Archaeopteryx. The changes were limited to removal or revision of certain examplescomment by Joonghwan Jeon, scientist quoted in Nature article which were the subject of some debate; also, STR plans to submit further petitions to remove evolution of humans and the adaptation of finch beaks, with the end goal of diminishing the role of Darwinian evolution in teaching. This attempt was eventually denied by South Korean government in September of the year. Religious conflict Fundamentalist Protestant antagonism against Buddhism has been a major issue for religious cooperation in South Korea, especially during the 1990s to late 2000s. Acts of vandalism against Buddhist amenities and \\"regular praying for the destruction of all Buddhist temples\\"New York Times: \\"Religious peace under threat in South Korea\\" by Choe Sang-Hun 14 October 2008 have drawn criticism. Buddhist statues have been considered as idols, attacked and decapitated. Arrests are hard to enforce, as the perpetrators work by stealth at night.Harry L. Wells, Korean Temple Burnings and Vandalism: The Response of the Society for Buddhist-Christian Studies. Buddhist-Christian Studies, Vol. 20, 2000, pp. 239-240; http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/buddhist- christian_studies/v020/20.1wells.html Such acts, which are supported by some Protestant leaders,Tedesco, F. (1997). ‚ÄúQuestions for Buddhist and Christian Cooperation in Korea.‚Äù Buddhist-Christian Studies, 17, p. 181. have led to South Koreans having an increasingly negative outlook on Protestantism and being critical of church groups involved, with many Protestants leaving their churches in recent years. In contrast, relations between South Korean Catholics and Buddhists and other faiths has remained largely cooperative, partly due to the syncretism of many Buddhist and Confucian customs and philosophies into South Korean Catholicism, most notably the practice of jesa. Pope Francis' visit 346x346px Pope Francis accepted an invitation to visit South Korea in August 2014. The four-day visit (14‚Äì18 August) culminated with a Papal Mass at Myeongdong Cathedral, the seat of the Archdiocese of Seoul on 18 August. During a mass on 16 August, the Pope beatified 124 Korean Catholic martyrs. An invitation for North Korea's Catholics to attend was declined, due to South Korea's refusal to withdraw from military exercises which it had planned with the United States.

He is the longest-serving member of the British folk rock band Fairport Convention and has been bassist with a number of folk and rock groups including the Ian Campbell Folk Group and Jethro Tull. History=Early career David Pegg was born on 2 November 1947, at Acocks Green, Birmingham, England. He began to learn guitar when 14 or 15, inspired by The Shadows, and played in a school band at Yardley Grammar School. After leaving school he worked as an insurance clerk for about a year while playing in a part-time bands the Crawdaddys and The Roy Everett Blues Band, who supported several performers from the Birmingham beat scene of the time, including the Spencer Davis Group and The Moody Blues. In 1966 he auditioned for The Uglys, featuring Steve Gibbons and was beaten to the position by friend and guitarist Roger Hill, but was offered the job of bass guitarist and switched instruments. The Uglys cut one single before Pegg and Hill left to form a blues trio, The Exception, with singer Alan Eastwood. At this period he played with Robert Plant and in his next band, The Way of Life, the drummer was John Bonham, later both went to form Led Zeppelin. In 1967 he joined the Ian Campbell Folk Group, where he switched to stand-up bass, learnt to play the mandolin and acquired his affection for folk music. It was also where he came to the attention of local folk guitarist Ralph McTell and former Campbell Group and future Fairport Convention member Dave Swarbrick. By early 1969 he had moved back to electric bass with The Beast, with Cozy Powell and Dave Clempson, before the latter left for Colosseum. Soon after this he joined the Birmingham band Dave Peace Quartet, and played bass on their electric blues album \\"Good Morning Mr Blues\\" released on SAGA FID 2155. One week after seeing Fairport for the first time on his twenty-first birthday he was called by Swarbrick to audition for the band after the departure of Ashley Hutchings, who was soon to found Steeleye Span. Fairport Convention 1969‚Äì1979 Pegg joined Fairport Convention towards the end of 1969 and formed a strong playing partnership with drummer Dave Mattacks and good relationships with the other members. Although Hutchings had been a solid and melodic bass player, Pegg played with greater virtuosity, complexity and energy. Ashley Hutchings credits Pegg with being the musician who began the technique of playing jigs and reels on the bass, rather than just a supportive bass line, which was subsequently adopted by most British folk rock and even folk punk bassists.Fairport Convention, The Cropredy Box (Woodworm, WR3CD026, 1998) disk 2. All this was obvious on the 1970 tour of Britain and America (including support for Jethro Tull), recordings from which surfaced on the Live at the L.A. Troubadour album (1977). His first album with the group, Full House (1970), showed more technically accomplished playing from the band, showing Pegg's musical influence on the group. On joining the band Pegg had moved his family from Birmingham and into the former pub, the Angel in Hadham, Hertfordshire along with other group members and their families. This became the theme for the title track of the next album Angel Delight (1971), for which Pegg received his first writing credit. On the next album Babbacombe Lee, a folk-rock opera masterminded by Swarbrick, he played a much greater role, contributing to seven of the fifteen tracks. The next album Rosie contained three of his contributions, including the song Peggy's Pub a statement of a lifelong ambition. In 1971 when Simon Nicol and Dave Mattacks left the band, Pegg and Swarbrick were the only remaining members and, as a succession of personnel came (or returned) and left again over the next five years, their partnership kept the band running. Some of these performers, like Sandy Denny and her husband Trevor Lucas, were acknowledged songwriters and as a result, although he still made contributions and took part in collaborations, Pegg's song-writing took a back seat to his instrumental and organisational skills. After the financial disaster that followed the Rising for the Moon (1975) tour, which prompted Denny, Lucas and Jerry Donahue to quit the band, Pegg became increasingly determined for the group to take control of their finances and direction and took over a larger responsibility. Pegg and Swarbrick renewed contact with Nicol in 1975 forming a low key trio, Three Desperate Mortgages, which toured student venues across Britain. With only Pegg, Swarbrick and replacement drummer Bruce Rowland left, they persuaded Nicol to rejoin the band during the Gottle O'Geer album sessions. The remaining quartet signed up with Vertigo, and produced two albums, The Bonny Bunch of Roses (1977) and Tipplers Tales (1978). Although well crafted these albums did not sell well and Vertigo bought them out of their contract. With Swarbrick suffering acute hearing problems and with no recording contract the group decided to disband and played a final concert at Cropredy in Oxfordshire on 4 August 1979, close to where Pegg lived. While with Fairport, Pegg had played on a variety of albums for other performers. Among them were: Nick Drake's Bryter Layter (1970); John Martin's Solid Air (1973) and One World (1977), as well as work for current and ex-Fairporters, including several albums for Dave Swarbrick, on Sandy Denny's Like an Old Fashioned Waltz (1973) and Rendezvous (1977) and Richard Thompson's Pour Down Like Silver (1975). He appeared on three Ralph McTell albums, including Streets (1973), and Slide Aside the Screen (1976), which Pegg also produced. Woodworm and Jethro Tull 1980‚Äì1985 Although Fairport had disbanded they continued to play annual reunions at Cropredy, supplemented by New Year's gigs in minor locations and occasional larger European festivals. Because no record label was interested in putting out recordings of the Cropredy concerts, Pegg and his wife Christine established their own label, Woodworm Records. They released the final concert as the album Farewell, Farewell (1979) and subsequent recordings were issued as 'official bootlegs'. He had already established a small recording studio in his house and with the money from the end of the record deal with Vertigo, he was able to develop this and it was eventually moved to a nearby converted chapel. The result was that Pegg had his own recording facility and record label. Artists like Steve Ashley began to record albums there from 1979. The Peggs established a mailing list of fans of the band, keeping interest in Fairport alive and, particularly Christine, took over the organization of the Cropredy Festival, which grew in size every year to reach about 18,000 attendees by the mid-1980s. In 1979 Ian Anderson invited Pegg to stand in for the ailing John Glascock on the Jethro Tull Stormwatch tour. After Glascock's death, Pegg was invited to join the band, still one of the biggest in the world, and it provided paid employment for Pegg for the next fifteen years. Pegg happened to join at a turning point for Jethro Tull. His first recording was intended as a solo album for Anderson, involving only Martin Barre from the band. The album, A (1980) was in stark contrast to the medieval and folk music inspired previous work, depending heavily on synthesizers for its sound. At this time all the other longstanding members left the band and the recording was put out as a Jethro Tull album. Pegg coped with this, and subsequent changes of style. The next album, Broadsword and the Beast (1982) had a heavier sound and more medieval theme and Pegg joined the band on stage in pseudo-medieval costume beside a Viking ship. In 1983 Pegg recorded his first solo album, The Cocktail Cowboy Goes It Alone (1983). After the next Tull album, Under Wraps (1984), Anderson's vocal problems forced him to retire from touring for three years and Pegg had more time to pursue other projects. Reforming Fairport 1985‚Äì1995 In 1981 Pegg joined Ralph McTell and ex-Fairport members Richard Thompson and Dave Mattacks in the GPs (an abbreviation for the 'Grazed Pontiffs', after a comment by Dave Mattacks following the attempted assassination of the Pope). The aim was for a pub band, playing a few originals and blues, rock n' roll, soul and country standards. They only gave six performances, including the Fairport reunion festival in 1981 (at Broughton Castle, Oxfordshire), which Woodworm Records released a recording of the performance as Saturday Rolling Around (1991). In the 1980s he also appeared on several recordings by other folk artists, including Murray Head and Dick Gaughan, besides those by Fairport and ex- Fairport members Simon Nicol and Richard Thompson. In 1985 Pegg, Nicol and Mattacks were also free and the trio decided to make an album of new material for the band to play at the Cropredy Festival, using the Woodworm studio and label. The result was Gladys' Leap (1985), which was generally well received in the music and national press, but caused some tension with Swarbrick who refused to play any of the new material at the 1985 Cropredy Festival. Nevertheless, the decision to reform the band, without Swarbrick, was taken by the other three remaining members. Ric Sanders was invited to join, along with guitarist, composer, arranger and multi-instrumentalist Maartin Allcock. Pegg was now in two major bands at the same time. The reformed Fairport produced an instrumental album Expletive Delighted (1986), mainly designed to showcase the virtuosity of Sanders and Allcock. In 1987 Jethro Tull produced their first album for three years, Crest of a Knave, to which Pegg contributed and this was to be followed by an American tour, on which Anderson invited Fairport to support Jethro Tull. Needing an album to promote, Pegg negotiated financial support from Island Records and Fairport put together In Real Time (1987). This was presented as a live album, but was actually a studio recording (albeit with all the songs recorded \\"as live\\" with all the musicians playing at the same time) with dubbed audience reactions. Although the tour was musically rewarding, it was unproductive financially and Pegg, being in both bands, left the stage with one band to return after a few minutes with the other, and the process was inevitably exhausting. Pegg played on three more Jethro Tull studio albums: Rock Island (1989), Catfish Rising (1991) and Roots to Branches (1995). In the same period he contributed to three studio albums by Fairport Convention: Red and Gold (1989) the Five Seasons (1990) and Jewel in the Crown (1995). Fairport's popularity and the scale of their tours were growing throughout this period and the strain of undertaking two jobs, plus his other commitments, was becoming too much and he decided to leave Tull and focus on Fairport. Focusing on Fairport 1995‚Äìpresent Richard Thompson (pictured at left) at Fairport's Cropredy Convention, 2005 Part of the result of this change was a higher output of albums for Fairport Convention, with five studio albums from the acoustic Old New Borrowed Blue (1996) to Over the Next Hill (2004), beside four live albums and compilations. Pegg also released his second solo album Birthday Party (1998), which combined recordings from a celebratory concert for his fiftieth birthday at Dudley Town Hall with studio recordings. In 1998, Pegg formed The Dylan Project, a Bob Dylan tribute band with Simon Nicol, PJ Wright, Steve Gibbons, and Gerry Conway. In 2006, Nicol was replaced by Birmingham keyboard player Phil Bond. They tour annually in the autumn and have produced two studio albums and a live album recorded at Cropredy Festival. In 2004 Pegg and his wife Christine divorced. The Woodworm studio was sold, and a new record label, Matty Grooves was established for the band and the group as a whole now organises the Cropredy Festival, now called Fairport's Cropredy Convention. Pegg also formed Peggy & PJ, a duo with guitarist PJ Wright, who had been lead guitar with the Steve Gibbons Band, touring smaller venues and producing an album Galileo's Apology in 2007, a collection of pop and folk-rock songs and instrumentals. Pegg also had a second 'birthday bash' at Birmingham Town Hall, released as Dave Pegg's 60th Birthday Bash (2008). In 2007 a retrospective of Pegg's career was launched. A Box of Pegg's contained four CDs, summarizing his work with Fairport Convention, Crawdaddy, Richard Thompson, Mike Heron, Steve Ashley, Jethro Tull, The Ian Campbell Folk Group and others. From 2010 to 2013 he appeared in France with the Breton band Red Cardell. Pegg lives in Banbury, Oxfordshire. He has a daughter, Stephanie, who works as a PR consultant: his son, Matt Pegg, is a bassist who has played with Procol Harum and Francis Dunnery. Public recognition In 2002 Dave Pegg shared with other Fairport Convention members a 'Lifetime Achievement Award' at the 2002 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards.

Minnesota, 283 U.S. 697 (1931), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court under which prior restraint on publication was found to violate freedom of the press as protected under the First Amendment. This principle was applied to free speech generally in subsequent jurisprudence. The Court ruled that a Minnesota law that targeted publishers of \\"malicious\\" or \\"scandalous\\" newspapers violated the First Amendment to the United States Constitution (as applied through the Fourteenth Amendment).. Legal scholar and columnist Anthony Lewis called Near the Court's \\"first great press case\\". It was later a key precedent in New York Times Co. v. United States (1971), in which the Court ruled against the Nixon administration's attempt to enjoin publication of the Pentagon Papers.. Background of the case The October 15, 1927 edition of The Saturday Press In 1927, Jay M. Near, who has been described as \\"anti-Catholic, anti-Semitic, anti-black, and anti-labor\\"By Fred W. Friendly in Minnesota Rag: Corruption, Yellow Journalism, and the Case That Saved Freedom of the Press, his book on the case. began publishing The Saturday Press in Minneapolis with Howard A. Guilford, a former mayoral candidate who had been convicted of criminal libel. The paper claimed that Jewish gangs were \\"practically ruling\\" the city along with the police chief, Frank W. Brunskill, who was accused of graft. Among the paper's other targets were mayor George E. Leach, Hennepin County attorney and future three-term governor Floyd B. Olson, and the members of the grand jury of Hennepin County, who, the paper claimed, were either incompetent or willfully failing to investigate and prosecute known criminal activity. Shortly after the first issue was distributed, Guilford was shot and hospitalized, where a further attempt on his life was made. At least one of the stories printed in The Saturday Press led to a successful prosecution of a gangster called Big Mose Barnett who had intimidated a local dry cleaner by destroying his customers' clothing. First trial court proceeding Olson filed a complaint against Near and Guilford under the Public Nuisance Law of 1925.The law was passed to suppress Ripsaw, a newspaper first published in 1917 by a self-proclaimed Christian reformer in Duluth, Minnesota who criticized local business and politics. The city was at the heart of the \\"Iron Range\\", a region integral to the nation's steel interests, and so the paper's editorial attacks on local leaders eventually motivated members of the Minnesota Legislature from Duluth to pass the law. Ripsaw was the first target to be prosecuted under the new law, but its publisher died before his first day in court. Also known as the \\"Minnesota Gag Law\\", it provided permanent injunctions against those who created a \\"public nuisance,\\" by publishing, selling, or distributing a \\"malicious, scandalous and defamatory newspaper.\\" Olson claimed that the allegations raised against him and the other named public officials in all nine issues published between September 24, 1927, and November 19, 1927, as well as the paper's overall anti-Semitic tone, constituted a violation of this law. On November 22, 1927, Judge Matthias Baldwin of the Hennepin County District Court issued a temporary injunction that barred the defendants from editing, publishing, or circulating The Saturday Press or any other publication containing similar material. This injunction was granted without notice to either defendant on an ex parte hearing between Olson and the judge, and was to extend until the hearing on the judge's order for the defendants to show cause as to why they should not be permanently enjoined from publishing their paper. The hearing was held December 9, and future Minneapolis mayor Thomas Latimer argued that the defendants' activities were protected by the U.S. and Minnesota constitutions and demurred to the complaint. Judge Baldwin denied the demurrer and was affirmed by the Minnesota Supreme Court on appeal. First Minnesota Supreme Court decision The State Supreme Court wrote that a scandalous publication \\"annoys, injures and endangers the comfort and repose of a considerable number of persons,\\" and so constituted a nuisance just as surely as \\"places where intoxicating liquor is illegally sold,\\" \\"houses of prostitution,\\" \\"dogs,\\" \\"malicious fences\\" \\"itinerant carnivals,\\" \\"lotteries,\\" and \\"noxious weeds.\\" The court considered that a newspaper may also endanger safety, because \\"scandalous material\\" tended to disturb the peace and provoke assaults. The court cited previous Minnesota decisions that upheld the right of the state to enjoin the publication of \\"details of execution of criminals\\" and the teaching of \\"things injurious to society.\\" Restricting the publication of a newspaper based on its harmful content accordingly fell within the legitimate power of \\"the people speaking through their representatives\\" to preserve \\"public morals\\" and the \\"public welfare.\\" The court stated that it had to give heavy deference to such decisions, because \\"it is the prerogative of the legislature to determine not only what the public interests require but also the measures necessary to protect such interests.\\" Regarding Near and Guilford's defense of freedom of the press under article 1, section 3 of the Minnesota Constitution, the State Supreme Court did not believe that the right was intended to protect the publishing of \\"scandalous material\\", but that it only provided \\"a shield for the honest, careful and conscientious press,\\" not the \\"defamer and the scandalmonger.\\" Instead, \\"he who uses the press is responsible for its abuse.\\" The court also ruled that the state constitution's due process clause did not extend any additional protection. The trial court's decision after remand The case then returned to the Hennepin County District Court, and Near and Guilford renewed their objection to the constitutionality of the Public Nuisance Law. Judge Baldwin again overruled their objection. Only the verified complaint that Olson had filed and the newspaper issues themselves were entered as evidence, and the defendants did not try to argue that the Saturday Press did not fit the definition under the statute, or that their published stories were in fact true. Baldwin ruled that the newspapers contained nothing but scandalous and defamatory material, and permanently enjoined the defendants \\"from producing, editing, publishing, circulating, having in their possession, selling or giving away any publication whatsoever which is a malicious, scandalous or defamatory newspaper, as defined by law,\\" and also \\"from further conducting said nuisance under the name and title of said 'The Saturday Press or any other name or title.\\"The description of the proceedings after remand were found in the brief of the Minnesota attorney general to the U.S. Supreme Court, which offered a more detailed description though did not appear to contradict Near's account in his own brief. The order granting and describing the permanent injunction was quoted in the U.S. Supreme Court's opinion. Second Minnesota Supreme Court decision On appeal once again, the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that its first decision left little question as to the constitutionality of the statute, both under the defendants' state constitutional challenge and a new argument based on due process under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The defendants also argued that the trial court's injunction went too far because it effectively prevented them from operating any newspaper, but their appeal did not request a modification of the order. The court in any case disagreed with their interpretation of the order's scope, stating that it did allow them to publish a newspaper, so long as it was operated \\"in harmony with the public welfare.\\" Only Near appealed from this decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, thanks to last-minute financial help from Col. Robert R. McCormick, the publisher of the Chicago Tribune. A quotation from the U.S. Supreme Court's decision written by Hughes is engraved in the lobby of the Tribune today. The Court's decision The U.S. Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, reversed the decision of the Minnesota Supreme Court and ruled that the Public Nuisance Law of 1925 was unconstitutional. The U.S. Supreme Court held that, except in rare cases, censorship is unconstitutional. The Court held: > For these reasons we hold the statute, so far as it authorized the > proceedings in this action under clause (b) [723] of section one, to be an > infringement of the liberty of the press guaranteed by the Fourteenth > Amendment. We should add that this decision rests upon the operation and > effect of the statute, without regard to the question of the truth of the > charges contained in the particular periodical. The fact that the public > officers named in this case, and those associated with the charges of > official dereliction, may be deemed to be impeccable cannot affect the > conclusion that the statute imposes an unconstitutional restraint upon > publication. Note that the paragraph above cites the Fourteenth Amendment and not the First Amendment. This is because the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the First and makes it applicable to the States. As literally written, the First Amendment applies to Congress and the federal government, not the states. This case strengthened the notion that a prior restraint of the press violates the First Amendment. However, it left a loophole which would be used later for other prior restraint cases, citing certain circumstances in which prior restraint could potentially be used: > The objection has also been made that the principle as to immunity from > previous restraint is stated too broadly, if every such restraint is deemed > to be prohibited. That is undoubtedly true; the protection even as to > previous restraint is not absolutely unlimited. But the limitation has been > recognized only in exceptional cases. 'When a nation is at war many things > that might be said in time of peace are such a hindrance to its effort that > their utterance will not be endured so long as men fight and that no Court > could regard them as protected by any constitutional right.' (Schenck v. > United States, 1919). No one would question but that a government might > prevent actual obstruction to its recruiting service or the publication of > the sailing dates of transports or the number and location of troops. On > similar grounds, the primary requirements of decency may be enforced against > obscene publications. The security of the community life may be protected > against incitements to acts of violence and the overthrow by force of > orderly government. Hughes (Ct): \\"...the fact that liberty of press may be abused does not make any less necessary the immunity of the press from prior restraint ... a more serious evil would result if officials could determine which stories can be published ...\\" Subsequent developments Guilford later joined the staff of the Twin City Reporter. He continued to draw the ire of organized crime in Minneapolis and was shot and killed on September 6, 1934. The Court closed off one of the few outlets remaining to censor the press under Near in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964), which seriously limited the grounds upon which a public official could sue for libel. Statements made regarding their official conduct were only actionable if made with \\"actual malice\\", meaning a knowing or reckless disregard for the truth.. Hustler Magazine v. Falwell (1988) excluded parodies from even this limited standard, as they included no actionable statements of fact. Hustler made clear this protection extended beyond merely defamation suits to cover other torts such as intentional infliction of emotional distress.. Basic case law resulting from this case No prior restraint of the content of news by the government is allowed unless it reveals crucial military information, contains obscenity, or may directly incite \\"acts of violence\\".

It sought to bind the King to certain laws regarding the treatment of nobles, church officials, and individuals. The nineteenth-century historians Frederick Maitland and Frederick Pollock considered it a landmark document in English legal history and a forerunner of Magna Carta. The document addressed abuses of royal power by his predecessor William II (his brother William Rufus), as perceived by the nobility, specifically the over-taxation of the barons, the abuse of vacant sees, and the practices of simony and pluralism. The Charter of Liberties was generally ignored by monarchs, until in 1213 Archbishop Langton reminded the nobles that their liberties had been guaranteed over a century prior in Henry I's Charter of Liberties. Background Henry I of England was forced to make concessions to the barons in the Charter of Liberties when he assumed the throne in 1100. Henry I of England, nicknamed Beauclerk, was the fourth and youngest son of William I (William the Conqueror) by his queen Matilda of Flanders. The name Beauclerk was given because Henry was well educated, being able to read and write Latin, and possessed a knowledge of English law and natural history. He had received 5,000 pounds of silver from his father, but no land holdings. He used this to purchase a district in the Cotentin Peninsula in Normandy for 3,000 pounds from his brother Robert of Normandy. Robert had been left the Duchy of Normandy by their father, but needed money. Various political intrigues occurred in France, which led to the imprisonment of Henry for two years by his brother William II, then King of England. In 1096, Robert left Normandy for the First Crusade. Henry swore fealty to William, who took over Normandy in Robert's absence. William was killed in a hunting accident on 2 August 1100. (Henry was present on this hunting trip.) With William dead and Robert absent, Henry claimed the English crown. Henry was immediately faced with three political problems. (1) The earls and barons did not accept him. (2) There was antagonism from the Church, especially Archbishop Anselm of Canterbury. (3) The native Anglo-Saxon population was not receptive to the new king.J. M. Lappenberg, History of England Under the Angevin Kings, Vol. 1 (1887) Henry made concessions to the Church and reconciled with Anselm. He married Edith, the daughter of King Malcolm III of Scotland, who was of mixed Anglo-Scots heritage, and so garnered great favor with the Anglo-Saxons. She changed her name to the Norman Mathilda. However, the choice displeased the barons and earls. Henry needed to mollify the nobles and secure his throne. William II of England, the son of William the Conqueror and brother of Henry Beauclerk, had issued a charter in 1093, when he was ill and fearing death. The text of this charter has been lost to history. It is believed to have freed prisoners, forgiven debts, and assured that holy and good laws would be maintained. Whatever promises William made, he quickly broke after he recovered his health.Eadmer, Historia novella, pp. 31-32 Henry went further. He negotiated with the leading barons and earls, making various concessions to them. When all sides were agreed, the agreement was issued as the Charter of Liberties. Plummer (ed.), The Peterborough Chronicle (1882-1889 Eadmer (ed. Rule), Historia novorum (Rolls Series, 1884) William of Malmesbury, Gesta regum and Historia novella (Rolls Series, 1887-1889)Henry of Huntingdon (ed. Arnold), Historia Anglorum (Rolls Series, 1879) Freeman, E. A. History of the Norman Conquest, vol. V. Summary  The Charter was issued from the Norman Chapel in the Tower of London in 1100. After a traditional greeting, the Charter of Liberties contained fourteen declarations, summarized as follows: Henry, king of the English, to Bishop Samson and Urso de Abetot and all his barons and faithful, both French and English, of Worcestershire, [copies were sent to all the shires] greeting. Aftermath William II of England was killed in a hunting accident, allowing his brother, Henry I of England to assume the throne in 1100. William I had been a great admirer of the laws of Edward the Confessor. He had reformed many laws in an effort to make the law of Edward the common law of England while establishing a strong Norman rule and custom. During the entire Norman period, there was little legislation. Henry began his reign with the Charter of Liberties,Charters of Liberties (Statutes of the Realm, vol. I), p.1; Select Charters, Liebermann, Trans. R. Hist. Soc. viii. 21 sending a strong message: he was returning to his father's ways, which were viewed with great nostalgia. The perceived abuses of William II were to be abolished. The corruption and larceny of reliefs, wardships, marriages, murder fines and so forth, was to end. Debts and past offences were to be forgiven. The demesne lands and military tenants were to be freed from the danegeld of Danelaw. Above all, the ‚Äúlaga Eadwardii‚Äù Law of Edward the Confessor, as amended by William I, would be restored. The proclamation was made with the assumption that the barons would make the same concessions to their tenants as the king had promised to them. Plucknett is of the opinion that this good will probably did flow down the feudal chain. The Charter was not legislation, but rather a promise to return to the law, as it existed in the time of William I, before it had been corrupted by William II. The promises made in the Charter could not be enforced. There is ample evidence that Henry I ignored them. The Pipe Rolls which came thirty-one years into Henry's reign indicate he had extended the power of the crown well beyond the limits set in the Charter. The establishment of the Exchequer, ostensibly to end corruption and fraud in the taking and holding of taxes, in reality, led to greater power of the crown. The direction of its chief minister, Bishop Roger of Salisbury, evolved the law for tenants in chief which became the harshest and most severe in Europe.Pipe Roll of 31 Henry I This occurred silently, and placed precedent upon precedent. Early in his reign, Henry issued a writ declaring the county and hundred courts should be held as in the days of Edward the Confessor. These had the result of bringing the ancient traditional tribunals in accordance with newer Norman methods.The writ is recorded in Select Charters; Felix Liebermann, Quadripartitus, p. 165. Chroniclers of the age state that Henry legislated about theft, restored capital punishment (which had been suspended for a great many crimes by William II), and harshly treated utterers of bad money and rapacious exactions of his courtiers. He made his roving court and army the terror of every neighborhood. Henry made the measure of his own arm the standard ell. The drowning of his son, William, in the loss of the White Ship in 1120, led to the end of the Norman dynasty. Stephen of England claimed the throne in 1135. He was the last Norman king. His conflict with Henry's daughter Matilda led to The Anarchy. The sinking of the White Ship in 1120, drowning Henry's heir, William, effectively marked the end of the Norman era in England. Plucknett describes the Charter of Liberties as a forerunner to legislation in later years. There was no legislation as such either under the Saxons or the Normans. The Charter was a great concession, born of political need. Large portions of the charter were a withdrawal of practices which were of questionable legality, and corrosive politically. Various feudal dues, instead of being arbitrary and ad hoc, were declared to be reduced to reasonable limits. The Charter led to an obscure decree of Stephen (1135-1154), the statutum decretum that established where there was no son, daughters would inherit. This was remarkable in its day, and pre-dated the reforms of Henry II of England. The problems with the Church had been brewing for some time. William I had tried to invest bishops with his temporal seal. Pope Gregory VII in 1075 had prohibited lay investiture, holding the Church was independent of the state. A long struggle ensued. This was still going on when Henry I assumed the throne and entered into open conflict with Anselm. This conflict was moderated and ameliorated by the canon lawyer Ivo of Chartres. It was agreed that Henry could observe the selection of bishops, without interference. This accord was extended to all of Europe by 1122. The Concordat of Worms in 1122 did not last, but only changed the nature of tension between Church and State, which exists to this day. The government of Henry I at Westminster became exquisitely effective. The mechanism of Norman government needed a strong hand. Stephen was not up to it. Henry's death was viewed as a great tragedy for several centuries: During the reign of Stephen, Henry I came to be known as the \\"Lion of Justice\\".Dahmus, Joseph. The Middle Ages, A Popular History, p.290. Doubleday, 1968 The Charter of Liberties was a precedent for Magna Carta (Great Charter) of 1215, at the end of the reign of John of England.

A valve stem is a self-contained valve which opens to admit gas to a chamber (such as air to inflate a tire), and is then automatically closed and kept sealed by the pressure in the chamber, or a spring, or both, to prevent the gas from escaping. They are most commonly used on automobile, motorcycle, and bicycle tires, but also for many other applications. Schrader Schrader valve stem Schrader valves consist of a valve stem into which a poppet valve is threaded with a spring attached. They are used on virtually all automobile and motorbike tires, and on wider rimmed bicycle tires. In addition to tires, Schrader valves of varying diameters are used in refrigeration and air conditioning systems, plumbing, engine fuel injection, suspension systems, and SCUBA regulators, allowing the user to remove and attach a hose while in use. The Schrader valves in the fuel injector rail of many automobiles is used as a quick and easy point to check fuel pressure or connect an injector cleaner cartridge. Presta Presta valve stem Presta valves (also called Sclaverand valves or French valves) are normally only used on bicycles. The stem has a narrower diameter (nominally 6 mm) than the thinnest (nominally 8 mm) Schrader type, and so the bore of the hole in the rim through which the stem passes can be smaller. Has a locknut that needs to be opened to inflate/deflate. Dunlop (or Woods) Dunlop (or Woods) valve stem Dunlop valves, (also called Woods valves or English valves) were once popular in Great Britain. They are still widely used on bicycle tires in many countries, especially on low to medium priced bicycles. They can be pumped up with a Presta pump.Sheldon Brown's Bicycle Glossary Others Regina Valve stem Many other valves exist that are used only in certain regions or for limited purposes. For example, the \\"Regina Valve\\" is a valve very much similar to the Presta and mostly being used in Italy. Invisible tire valves are different in design from traditional tire valves. An inflator stem is not used; instead, a removable cap on a valve stem embedded in the tire rim is fitted, with only the cap visible. When inflating the tire, the cap is first removed, typically with a coin, and then a \\"portable\\" dedicated inflator stem is screwed onto the valve stem. Through the inflator the tire is inflated as usual.

Jones came up with the band's name as he, McDonald and Dennis Elliott were British, while Gramm, Al Greenwood and Ed Gagliardi were American.Billboard. p. 26. April 19, 1986. Their biggest hit single, \\"I Want to Know What Love Is\\", topped the United Kingdom and United States charts among others. Another one of their hit singles, \\"Waiting for a Girl Like You\\", peaked at number two on the US chart for a record-setting 10 weeks. They are one of the world's best-selling bands of all time with worldwide sales of more than 80 million records, including 37.5 million records in the US. Current band members are Kelly Hansen (frontman and percussion); Mick Jones (lead and rhythm guitar, keyboard, backing and lead vocals); Thom Gimbel (rhythm guitar, keyboard, backing vocals, saxophone, and flute); Jeff Pilson (bass and backing vocals); Michael Bluestein (keyboard and backing vocals); Bruce Watson (lead and rhythm guitar, backing vocals); and Chris Frazier (drums and percussion). Band history=Formation, 1976 Since its beginning, Foreigner has been led by English musician Mick Jones (former member of Nero and the Gladiators, Johnny Hallyday's band, Spooky Tooth and The Leslie West Band). After the collapse of the Leslie West Band in 1976, Jones found himself stranded in New York City; West's manager, Bud Prager, encouraged Jones to continue his songwriting and rehearse a band of his own in some space Prager had near his New York office. Jones got together with New York keyboardist Al Greenwood (who had just played with former Flash members Colin Carter and Mike Hough in a group called Storm), drummer Stan Williams and Louisiana bassist Jay Davis (later with Rod Stewart) and began jamming. Another friend, Stories singer Ian Lloyd, was brought in to sing but Jones decided the chemistry was not quite right and retained only Greenwood as he renewed his search for players. During a session for Ian Lloyd's album, Jones met up with transplanted Englishman and ex-King Crimson member Ian McDonald and another session for Ian Hunter unearthed another fellow Brit in drummer Dennis Elliott. But after auditioning about forty or fifty singers, the right vocalist was becoming harder to come by until Jones dragged out an old Black Sheep album given to him backstage at a Spooky Tooth concert a few years prior by that group's lead singer, Lou Gramm. Jones put in a call to Gramm, who was back in his hometown of Rochester, New York after Black Sheep's break-up, and sent him a plane ticket to New York City. Gramm proved to be the missing piece of the puzzle and Brooklyn, New York bassist Ed Gagliardi completed the new sextet. A name, \\"Trigger\\", was tentatively agreed to and was the name that appeared on their demo tape, but it was passed on by all the record companies it was delivered to. John Kalodner, a former journalist and radio programmer who was working in A&R; at Atlantic Records, happened to spot a tape on Atlantic president Jerry L. Greenberg's desk with the Trigger identification on it. Kalodner had just been to hear an outfit called Trigger and realized that this was not the same band. He convinced Greenberg that at least one of the songs on the tape could be a big hit and to look into signing this group immediately. Because the Trigger name was already taken, Jones came up with the Foreigner moniker from the fact that no matter what country they were in, three would be foreigners, because he, McDonald and Elliott were English, while Gramm, Greenwood and Gagliardi were American. Debut album, March 1977 In November 1976, after six months of rehearsals, the newly named Foreigner started recording their debut album with producers John Sinclair and Gary Lyons at The Hit Factory but switched to Atlantic Recording Studios where they finished recording the basic tracks and completed the overdubs. The first attempt at mixing the album was done at Sarm Studios, London. But, because of the band's dissatisfaction with the results, the album was re-mixed back at Atlantic by Mick Jones, Ian McDonald and Jimmy Douglass. Bud Prager signed on as the group's manager, a role he would continue in for the next 17 years. The band's debut, Foreigner, was released in March 1977 and sold more than four million copies in the United States, staying in the Top 20 for a year with such hits as \\"Feels Like the First Time\\", \\"Cold as Ice\\" and \\"Long, Long Way from Home\\". 1977‚Äì1990  By May 1977, Foreigner was already headlining theaters and had already scored a gold record for the first album. Not long afterwards, they were selling out U.S. basketball arenas and hockey rinks. After a show at Memorial Hall in Kansas City, Kansas on May 6, 1977, drummer Elliott injured his hand, prompting the band to call in Ian Wallace (ex-King Crimson) to play alongside Elliott on some of the dates until the hand was healed. After almost a year on the road, the band played before over two hundred thousand people at California Jam II on March 18, 1978 and during the following month, the band toured Europe, Japan and Australia for the first time. Their second album, Double Vision (released in June 1978), co-produced by Keith Olsen, topped their previous, selling five million records and spawned hits in \\"Hot Blooded\\", the title track \\"Double Vision\\" and \\"Blue Morning, Blue Day\\". Album number three, Head Games (September 1979), co-produced by Roy Thomas Baker, which was referred to by Gramm as their \\"grainiest\\" album, was also successful because of the thunderous \\"Dirty White Boy\\" and another title track hit \\"Head Games\\". For Head Games, bassist Ed Gagliardi was replaced by Englishman Rick Wills. In his autobiography, Juke Box Hero (named after the seminal Foreigner song), Gramm explains why the band parted ways with Gagliardi: \\"He was a little headstrong and had his own ideas that weren't always compatible with what we were trying to accomplish. Ed was obstinate at times, playing the song the way he wanted to play it rather than the way it was drawn up. Jones often had to stop sessions to get Ed back on track. After a while it became tiresome and slowed down the recording process.\\" Gramm went on to say that he was disappointed overall with Head Games and thought it sounded unfinished. It ended up selling about two million fewer than its predecessor. In a 2015 interview with Classicrockrevisited, Gramm explains his thoughts about why Head Games sold less than the first two: \\"The big change in the band happened after Head Games and before Foreigner 4. We were really aware that Head Games didn't sell nearly as much as the first album or Double Vision. Part of that was because of the cover. The song \\"Head Games\\" was banned by a lot of radio stations after the cover of the album came out. Today, that would not have even been a problem. But in the Bible Belt, the cover of the cute little girl in the boys' bathroom erasing her number off the wall...They didn't see the humor in that. It wasn't supposed to even be sexy. She was sexy....she was cute. It was just the time and the place of what she was doing that was supposed to leave the impression. She was erasing her phone number off the wall of the boys' bathroom and that's all it was. A big deal was made out of that and it really hurt our sales.\\" In September 1980 co-founders Al Greenwood and Ian McDonald were sacked as Jones wished to have more control over the band and write most of the music (along with Gramm). In his book, Gramm goes on to talk about this difficult time: \\"The chemistry that made the band right in the beginning didn't necessarily mean it would always be right. I think a pretty major communication lapse appeared and I don't think anybody really knew what anybody was feeling‚Äîthe deep, inner belief about the direction of the band and how we were progressing. We had reached a point where there was a lot of dissatisfaction\\". In the liner notes for the 2000 release, Juke Box Heroes: The Foreigner Anthology, Jones went on to elaborate further: \\"Ian McDonald, who I consider a great musician and multi-instrumentalist, began to focus more and more on guitar playing, while I believed his true talent lay more in the dimensional and creative imagery he gave the first two albums. Al Greenwood, our keyboard wiz and a very important part of the Foreigner sound at the beginning, had also started to focus more on songwriting. Although both their contributions to the band had been vital, a conflict was developing about the musical direction of the band. I just felt we needed to clarify it. So Lou, Rick, Dennis and I made the decision, and that's when we went down to four.\\" And according to McDonald in a 1999 interview, \\"Mick and Lou decided they wanted to be the focus of the band. Mick wanted to make it more apparent that it was his group, so he decided to make a smaller group. That was his decision. I wouldn't have left‚ÄîI loved the group, it was not my decision.\\" McDonald noted that there was much creative compromise working in the band and that he did more than he received credit for, much as he did in King Crimson. McDonald stated that \\"he had a lot to do with the making of those records and the arrangements and the creating of those songs, more than is probably apparent. I did a lot that went uncredited, which I was happy to do though. When you're in a group you must contribute as much as you can. I was happy to do that. But as I said, it maybe didn't appear that I was doing as much as I in fact was. I had a lot to do with that group... as well as... Mick Jones, obviously, and everyone else‚ÄîI'm not trying to take all the credit, but I'm just saying that I was there, I was involved, and I loved it.\\" The band was now stripped down to a quartet, with session players brought in as needed to record or tour (see below for complete list of members). Greenwood soon joined Gagliardi to form the AOR band Spys, with John Blanco, Billy Milne and John DiGaudio. The band released two albums, an eponymous debut, and the follow-up Behind Enemy Lines. In the meantime, Foreigner began work on the next album at Electric Lady Studios in New York City with producer Robert John \\"Mutt\\" Lange, engineered by Dave Wittman (currently with Trans-Siberian Orchestra). 4 (released in July 1981) contained the hits \\"Urgent\\" (which includes the famous Junior Walker sax solo), \\"Waiting for a Girl Like You\\", \\"Juke Box Hero\\" and \\"Break it Up\\". Before releasing albums of his own, Thomas Dolby played synthesizers on 4 (he contributed the signature synth sound on \\"Urgent\\" and played the intro to \\"Waiting for a Girl Like You\\"). For their 1981‚Äì82 tour in support of 4, the group added Peter Reilich (keyboards, synthesizers, who had played with Gary Wright), former Peter Frampton band member Bob Mayo (keyboards, synthesizers, guitar, backing vocals) and Mark Rivera (sax, flute, keyboards, synthesizers, guitar, backing vocals). Mayo and Rivera had also appeared on the sessions for 4. Reilich was dropped in May 1982 but Mayo and Rivera continued with the band through 1988. Their next album, Agent Provocateur, co-produced by Alex Sadkin, was released successfully in December 1984 and in 1985 gave them their first and only No. 1 hit when \\"I Want to Know What Love Is\\", a ballad backed by Jennifer Holliday and the New Jersey Mass Choir, topped the charts in the US, UK, Australia, Norway, Sweden, etc.[ I Want to Know What Love Is - Foreigner] Billboard Retrieved February 13, 2011 \\"That Was Yesterday\\" was the next single from the album in early 1985 and proved to be another sizable hit. During their 1985 summer/fall tour, Foreigner appeared at the very first Farm Aid on September 22 in Champaign, Illinois. In between his Foreigner commitments, Jones also started a side career as a producer for such albums as Van Halen's 5150 (1986), Bad Company's Fame and Fortune (1986) and Billy Joel's Storm Front (1989). In December 1987 Foreigner released Inside Information, spawning hits such as \\"Say You Will\\" and \\"I Don't Want to Live Without You\\". On May 14, 1988 the band headlined Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary concert at Madison Square Garden, culminating with \\"I Want to Know What Love Is\\", in which the likes of Phil Collins, Crosby, Stills and Nash, Roberta Flack and other Atlantic artists joined in, singing in the choir. Later during the summer, the band went back on the road but the touring for Inside Information was limited to Europe, Japan and Australia. For this tour, Rivera and Mayo were not available, so Larry Oakes (guitar, keyboards, synthesizers, backing vocals) and Lou Cortelezzi (sax) augmented the quartet of Gramm, Jones, Elliott and Wills. Lead vocalist Gramm's departure, May 1990 In the late 1980s, Jones and Gramm each put out solo efforts on Atlantic. Gramm released Ready or Not in January 1987 and shortly after its release, rehearsals for Foreigner's next album had started but ground to a halt as Gramm's status with the group was uncertain. But after the promotion and concert dates for Gramm's album were finished, cooler heads prevailed and Lou rejoined Foreigner in the studio for Inside Information, which was out at the end of 1987. Jones had Mick Jones in August 1989, then Gramm followed with his second solo release, Long Hard Look (October 1989), and decided to leave the group in May 1990 while preparing to tour behind Long Hard Look as the opener for Steve Miller Band. After finishing this tour, Gramm went on to form the short-lived band Shadow King, which put out one eponymous album on Atlantic in October 1991. Meanwhile, Jones brought in a new lead singer, Johnny Edwards (formerly of the bands Buster Brown, Montrose, King Kobra, Northrup and Wild Horses). Edwards made his first live appearance with Foreigner at the Long Island club Stephen Talkhouse on August 15, 1990, where he, Jones, Dennis Elliott and Rick Wills appeared, joined by special guests Terry Thomas (on guitar, who produced their next album) and Eddie Mack on harmonica. The new edition of Foreigner released the album Unusual Heat in June 1991. This was at the time their worst-selling album and only climbed as high as No. 117 on the Billboard 200, although \\"Lowdown and Dirty\\" was a minor mainstream rock hit, reaching No. 4 on that chart. In July 1991 the new lineup of Foreigner played some European dates then made its official U.S. debut on August 9 performing on the second night of a Billy Joel benefit concert at Deep Hollow Ranch in Montauk, New York to raise funds for the preservation of Montauk Point Lighthouse. For their 1991 tour, Jeff Jacobs, who had played in Joel's band, was brought in as the new keyboardist and Mark Rivera returned. But during the fall leg of this tour, Elliott decided to leave the group after a concert at The Ritz in NYC on November 14, 1991 and embark on a career as a wood sculptor. Larry Aberman was then recruited as a temporary replacement until Mark Schulman arrived in 1992 to hold down the drum throne for the next three years. Scott Gilman (guitar, sax, flute) joined the touring band in 1992 and Thom Gimbel took over from Gilman and Rivera in late 1992 after they departed. When Gimbel went to Aerosmith in 1993, Gilman returned to handle the guitar/sax/flute duties until Gimbel came back permanently in the spring of 1995. Gramm returns, 1992 During the Los Angeles riots, inside the confines of the Sunset Marquis Hotel in West Hollywood, where Mick Jones had gone to meet with Lou Gramm, they both ended up sequestered by a city curfew. They decided to use their time together resurrecting their partnership. \\"I flew to Los Angeles, during the riots,\\" says Gramm. \\"We got flown to John Wayne Airport instead of LAX because they were shooting at the planes. Mick and I were holed up in the Sunset Marquis in L.A., with armed security guards walking around on the roof. It was a little weird, to say the least.\\" Gramm ended up rejoining Foreigner, bringing along his Shadow King bandmate bassist Bruce Turgon to replace bassist Wills (who'd left after the band's 1991 tour after a falling out with Jones) and co- produced the band's second greatest hits album, The Very Best ... and Beyond (September 1992), which included three new songs. 1994‚Äì2003 In October 1994 Foreigner released what was supposed to be a comeback album, Mr. Moonlight, in Japan. Featuring new drummer Mark Schulman and augmented by a fifth member, keyboardist Jeff Jacobs, this album was not released in the U.S. until February 1995 and fared even worse than Unusual Heat. It only peaked at No. 136 on the Billboard 200, although the ballad \\"Until the End of Time\\" was a minor hit, reaching No. 42 on the Billboard Hot 100. In January 1995 Ron Wikso (who had played in The Storm with former Journey members Gregg Rolie and Ross Valory) took over percussion duties from Schulman, and Brian Tichy succeeded Wikso in 1998 before Schulman would return in 2000. In 1997 Gramm underwent surgery to remove a brain tumor. The medications he was prescribed caused considerable weight gain and weakened his singing voice. By 1998, the band was back on the road, but Gramm was visibly struggling and it would take him several years to get back to the point where he felt comfortable on stage. In the summer of 1999, Foreigner went on tour as the opening act for Journey and the following summer, Jeff Jacobs had to leave the road for a short time during the band's 2000 summer tour while his wife was giving birth to their child. Keyboardist John Purdell (who had been co-producer of the new tracks on their 1992 album The Very Best of ... and Beyond) stepped in to sub for Jacobs until he was able to return. In 2001 the Warner Music Group selected Foreigner and 4 to be among the first group of albums from their catalog to be remastered, enhanced and released in the new DVD Audio format. In 2002 the 25th Anniversary Year brought affirmation of the enduring respect for Foreigner recordings with Rhino Entertainment reissuing the 1977 to 1981 multi-platinum albums in special enhanced formats. Foreigner, Double Vision, Head Games and 4 received the attention of Rhino's staff with new photos, liner notes and bonus tracks of previously unreleased material. New greatest hits albums were also produced in the U.S. and in Europe. The U.S. version reached No. 80 on the Billboard 200 Album chart. For the group's 25th Anniversary Tour in 2002, they were joined by former Heart and Montrose beat keeper Denny Carmassi. In late October/early November, then December, of 2002, Foreigner played in Belgium and Germany at the annual Night of the Proms festival. It was the last time that Lou Gramm and Mick Jones would play together until June 2013. Gramm would leave the group in early 2003. Jones stated that he and Gramm split because they weren't communicating: \\"I think we really tried hard to save it, but it got to the point when we both realized that to go on would be detrimental for both of us.\\"Chiu, David. \\"Foreigner Get a Makeover\\". Rolling Stone. May 19, 2005. New lead vocalist Kelly Hansen, March 2005 Jones, the founder and only remaining original member of Foreigner, decided to take some time off before looking to form a new lineup in 2004. On July 25, 2004 in Santa Barbara, California at Fess Parker's DoubleTree Resort, Jones appeared at a benefit show for muscular dystrophy dubbed \\"Mick Jones & Friends\\" that included: Jeff Jacobs, Thom Gimbel, former Dokken bass player Jeff Pilson, future Black Country Communion drummer Jason Bonham (son of Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham and leader of Bonham) and Bonham singer Chas West. West was front man for that show only. Inspired by the event and further encouraged by Jason Bonham, Jones continued the search for a new frontman. He would eventually find former Hurricane singer Kelly Hansen, who had sent the band an audition tape and was invited aboard in March 2005, making his debut with the group on March 11 at Boulder Station near Las Vegas. During their 2005 spring tour, Chas West appeared briefly with the band as a special guest, playing rhythm guitar.A Foreigner's Tale last=Jones first=Mick authorlink= coauthors= year=2017 publisher=Rocket88 Their 2005 BMG album, Extended Versions, featured the new line-up playing all their classic hits live in concert in one of the most \\"studio like, clean sounding\\" live album recordings produced. 2007 to the present Foreigner joined Def Leppard along with Styx on tour in 2007. They also toured extensively in their own right in 2007‚Äîthe thirtieth anniversary of the release of their debut. In late 2007, keyboardist Jeff Jacobs left Foreigner after 16 years and was replaced, first by Paul Mirkovich then by Michael Bluestein (in 2008). And in 2008, Bonham also parted ways with Foreigner. Bryan Head was then brought in to fill the drum chair. But his tenure was short and he also departed to be replaced by the returning Tichy. The band released a greatest hits anthology on July 15, 2008, titled No End in Sight: The Very Best of Foreigner. The anthology included all of their greatest hits plus some new live recordings and a new studio track, \\"Too Late\\", which was their first new song release since the 1994 album Mr. Moonlight and the first recorded output of the new lineup. \\"Too Late\\" was released as a single on June 17, 2008. Foreigner live at Wacken Open Air 2016 Foreigner released a new album on September 29, 2009, titled Can't Slow Down. It was one of several recent classic rock releases (AC/DC, the Eagles, Journey and Kiss being four others) to be released exclusively through the Walmart stores chain in the US, while in Europe the album was released by earMUSIC (a label part of the Edel group), charting top 20 in Germany (16) and Top 30 in Switzerland. Can't Slow Down debuted at #29 on the Billboard 200.Trust, Gary. \\"Chart Beat Thursday: Barbra Streisand, Foreigner, Jay Sean\\". billboard.com. October 8, 2009. The first two singles from the album, \\"When It Comes to Love\\" and \\"In Pieces\\" both reached the Top 20 on Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart. In 2010 it was awarded a gold certification from the Independent Music Companies Association, which indicated sales of at least 100,000 copies throughout Europe. In early 2010, Foreigner teamed up with Styx and Kansas for the United in Rock Tour. On May 4, 2010 it was announced that Brian Tichy's replacement as drummer would be Jason Sutter. Jason Sutter's time with the band was short as he left by 2011. Mark Schulman then returned to Foreigner for his third go-round as drummer. On February 20, 2011 the band played for the first time in Bangalore, India along with sitar player Niladri Kumar. In June 2011 Foreigner (again along with Styx) co-headlined with Journey on their UK tour. After this, they joined up with Journey and Night Ranger on a triple bill summer/fall tour of the US. For some dates of this tour, Brian Tichy filled in for Foreigner's drummer Mark Schulman when he was not available. From August 19 to September 10, 2011, Night Ranger guitarist Joel Hoekstra did double duty playing for NR as well as subbing for Jones, who had taken ill. Right after this, guitarist Bruce Watson (ex-Rod Stewart) was brought in as Jones' stand-in for the tour's remaining dates and continued to tour with the group when they hit the road again in February 2012 after Jones underwent aortoiliac bypass surgery in Miami. On October 4, 2011 Foreigner released Acoustique, which presented their best and most famous songs, along with some newer tracks, recorded in stripped-down acoustic mode. In May 2012 after being diagnosed with colorectal cancer, Bluestein was forced to take a leave of absence from the band. His stand in on keyboards was Ollie Marland. Bluestein was able to return to the group in August 2012 and Tichy once again rejoined in the interim until his schedule with Whitesnake called him away. In September 2012, the man Tichy replaced in Whitesnake, Chris Frazier, became Foreigner's new percussionist. On August 31, 2012 after over a year away, Jones returned to the concert stage at Atlanta's Chastain Park. Guitarist Watson, in the meantime, stayed on until Jones was able to return to full health. At this very same show, keyboardist Derek Hilland (ex-Iron Butterfly, Whitesnake and Rick Springfield) came on board to sub for Bluestein for the group's late summer/fall tour dates and again during the winter/spring of 2013 until Bluestein was able to return. On January 9, 2013 the band's original drummer, Dennis Elliott, joined Foreigner on stage at the Hard Rock Cafe in Hollywood, Florida to play on \\"Hot Blooded\\". In addition to touring small clubs and venues, the band frequently is engaged for private parties and conventions, including playing at SeaWorld in Orlando for an IBM Rational Conference (June 6, 2012), at the Gaylord convention center in Washington, D.C. for the Teradata Partners 2012 conference (October 25, 2012) and at SAP's Field Kickoff Meeting in Las Vegas (January 23, 2013). On June 13, 2013 at the 44th Annual Songwriters Hall of Fame Award Ceremony, Jones and Gramm were officially inducted to the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Billy Joel was on hand to induct Jones and Gramm, singing snippets of Foreigner's hits in his introduction speech. Jones said he was proud as the honor makes his work \\"legit\\". The duo then took stage one more time and, along with Thom Gimbel and the house band, performed \\"Juke Box Hero\\" and \\"I Want to Know What Love Is\\" with Anthony Morgan's Inspirational Choir of Harlem‚Äîa performance that brought the entire audience to its feet. In 2014 Foreigner teamed up with Styx and former Eagles guitarist Don Felder for the Soundtrack of Summer Tour. Original bassist Ed Gagliardi died on May 11, 2014, aged 62, after an eight-year battle with cancer. Although discussions of an original member reunion had been proposed, the original band had not performed together since 1979. On June 18, 2014 Foreigner teamed up with the Brockton High School concert choir at the Blue Hills Bank Pavilion in Boston, MA. They performed one of their greatest hits: I Want To Know What Love Is. On January 12, 2015 in Sarasota, Florida, Foreigner were joined on stage by original drummer Dennis Elliott and former bassist Rick Wills to play \\"Hot Blooded\\". In Hartford, Connecticut on June 24, 2015, Foreigner began a summer tour as the opening act for Kid Rock. Foreigner appeared on the \\"Today Show\\" on February 11, 2016 along with the choir from Our Lady of Mercy Academy to promote their Acoustic Tour and the release of their new album, In Concert: Unplugged. On Saturday September 24, 2016, Foreigner performed before an estimated 20,000+ people at the 100th anniversary of the Durham Fair in Durham, Connecticut. The encore song \\"I Want to Know What Love Is\\" utilized the local Coginchaug High School concert choir for backup‚Äîtheir performance having been rehearsed with the band via Skype during the previous months. In a 2016 interview, Jones talked about a possible 40th-anniversary reunion tour, featuring the Head Games-era lineup: \\"It's quite possible. We've actually been talking about it. I'm not at a point where I can say it's definitely gonna happen, but we're all working on trying to make it happen. It's kind of exciting. And hopefully it'll be feasible and possible to pull it off next year (2017). Lou (Gramm) and I have communicated and we've kept up a sort of loose communication as I have actually also with Ian McDonald, Al Greenwood, Dennis Elliott and Rick Wills. We're at the early stages, but we're trying to put something together to commemorate (it's scary when I say it) 40 years.\\" On November 25, 2016, in celebration of their 40th anniversary, Foreigner released a limited-edition 10-inch vinyl EP, The Flame Still Burns, on Rhino Records for Record Store Day's Black Friday event. The EP's track listing contained the title song (which had previously appeared on Foreigner's Acoustique album and had earlier been featured in the 1998 film Still Crazy) plus live unplugged versions of \\"Feels Like The First Time\\", \\"Long, Long Way From Home\\" and \\"Juke Box Hero\\". On July 20, 2017, at Jones Beach Theater in New York, the current Foreigner lineup were joined for their encore by Lou Gramm, Ian McDonald and Al Greenwood to help celebrate the band's 40th anniversary and Greenwood and McDonald came back the following year to take the stage with the group for their Jones Beach show on June 22, 2018. Dennis Elliott likewise joined his old mates for two songs at Foreigner's show on August 2, 2017, at MidFlorida Credit Union Amphitheatre in Tampa, Florida. Another reunion was announced for a pair of shows to take place on October 6‚Äì7, 2017, at the Soaring Eagle Casino & Resort in Mount Pleasant, Michigan, where the group was set to be joined again by Lou Gramm, Dennis Elliott, Al Greenwood, Ian McDonald and Rick Wills. The concerts were filmed for future release, appearing on PBS stations in the U.S. on June 8, 2018. In a July 2018 interview with OC Weekly, bassist Jeff Pilson said that Foreigner has no plans to release a new studio album, but will continue to release singles periodically. On November 9, 2018, all surviving original members of Foreigner came on stage to play alongside the current line-up for a show at Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles, beginning a series of \\"Foreigner Then and Now\\" concerts set to run through the end of the year. In October 2019, the group was slated once again to be joined by the surviving original players for a handful of shows as the Double Vision: Then And Now tour. However, on October 2, it was announced that Lou Gramm would not be taking part in these dates due to illness. Foreigner announced a 2020 summer tour with support from Kansas and Europe called \\"Juke Box Heroes\\" in reference to the song of the same name. On May 19, 2020, Foreigner announced the band‚Äôs Juke Box Heroes 2020 Tour was cancelled, presumably due to the COVID-19 pandemic, saying plans for a 2021 tour would be announced shortly thereafter.

Zaidiyyah emerged in the eighth century from Shi'a Islam. Zaidis are named after Zayd ibn  ªAlƒ´, the grandson of Husayn ibn  ªAlƒ´ and the son of the fourth Imam Ali ibn 'Husain. Followers of the Zaydi Islamic jurisprudence are called Zaydi Shia and make up about 50% of Muslims in Yemen, with the greatest majority of Shia Muslims in that country being of the Zaydi school of thought.http://gulf2000.columbia.edu/images/maps/Yemen_Ethno_Religious_summary_lg.png Origin The Zaydi madhab emerged in reverence of Zayd's failed uprising against the Umayyad Caliph, Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik (ruling 724‚Äì743 AD), which set a precedent for revolution against corrupt rulers. It might be said that Zaydis find it difficult to remain passive in an unjust world, or in the words of a modern influential Zaydi leader, Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi, to \\"sit in their houses\\". Zaydis are the oldest branch of the Shia and are currently the second largest group after Twelvers. Zaidis do not believe in the infallibility of ImƒÅms, but promote their leadership and divine inspiration. Zaydis believe that Zayd ibn Ali in his last hour was betrayed by the people in Kufa. Zaydis as of 2014 constitute roughly 0.5% of the world's Muslim population. Law In matters of Islamic jurisprudence, the Zaydis follow Zayd ibn ‚ÄôAli's teachings which are documented in his book Majmu‚Äô al-Fiqh (). Zaydi fiqh is similar to the Hanafi school of Sunni Islamic jurisprudence. Abu Hanifa, a Sunni madhab shaykh, was favorable and even donated towards the Zaydi cause.The Princeton Encyclopedia of Islamic Political Thought, Page 14, Gerhard B√∂wering, Patricia Crone, Mahan Mirza - 2012 Zaidis dismiss religious dissimulation (taqiyya). Theology In matters of theology, the Zaydis are close to the Mu'tazili school, though they are not exactly Mu'tazilite. There are a few issues between both schools, most notably the Zaydi doctrine of the Imamate, which is rejected by the Mu'tazilites. Of the Shi'a, Zaydis are most similar to Sunnis since Zaydism shares similar doctrines and jurisprudential opinions with Sunni scholars. Zaydis‚Äô theological literature puts an emphasis on justice and human responsibility, and its political implications, i.e. Muslims have an ethical and legal obligation by their religion to rise up and depose unjust leaders including unrighteous sultans and caliphs. Beliefs In the context of the Shi'a belief in spiritual leadership or Imamate, Zaydis believe that the leader of the Ummah or Muslim community must be Fatimids: descendants of Muhammad through his only surviving daughter Fatimah, whose sons were Hasan ibn  ªAlƒ´ and Husayn ibn  ªAlƒ´. These Shi'a called themselves Zaydi to differentiate themselves from other Shias who refused to take up arms with Zayd ibn Ali. Zaydis believe Zayd ibn Ali was the rightful successor to the Imamate because he led a rebellion against the Umayyad Caliphate, who he believed were tyrannical and corrupt. Muhammad al-Baqir did not engage in political action and the followers of Zayd believed that a true ImƒÅm must fight against corrupt rulers.Islamic Dynasties of the Arab East: State and Civilization during the Later Medieval Times by Abdul Ali, M.D. Publications Pvt. Ltd., 1996, p97 The renowned Muslim jurist Abu Hanifa who is credited for the Hanafi school of Sunni Islam, delivered a fatwƒÅ or legal statement in favour of Zayd in his rebellion against the Umayyad ruler. He also urged people in secret to join the uprising and delivered funds to Zayd.Ahkam al- Quran By Abu Bakr al-Jassas al-Razi, volume 1 page 100, published by Dar Al- Fikr Al-Beirutiyya Unlike the Twelver and Isma'ili Shia, Zaydis do not believe in the infallibility of ImƒÅmsJohn Pike and do not believe that the ImƒÅmate must pass from father to son but believe it can be held by any descendant of Hasan ibn  ªAlƒ´ or Husayn ibn  ªAlƒ´. History See Battle of Fakhkh and Alid revolt of 762‚Äì763 for further information. Status of Caliphs and the Sahaba There was a difference of opinion among the companions and supporters of Zayd ibn 'Ali, such as Abu al-Jarud Ziyad ibn Abi Ziyad, Sulayman ibn Jarir, Kathir al-Nawa al-Abtar and Hasan ibn Salih, concerning the status of the first three Caliphs who succeeded to the political and administrative authority of Muhammad. The earliest group, called Jarudiyya (named for Abu al-Jarud Ziyad ibn Abi Ziyad), was opposed to the approval of certain companions of Muhammad. They held that there was sufficient description given by the Prophet that all should have recognised 'Ali as the rightful Caliph. They therefore consider the Companions wrong in failing to recognise 'Ali as the legitimate Caliph and deny legitimacy to Abu Bakr, 'Umar and 'Usman; however, they avoid denouncing them. The Jarudiyya were active during the late Umayyad Caliphate and early Abbasid Caliphate. Its views, although predominant among the later Zaydis, especially in Yemen under the Hadawi sub-sect, became extinct in Iraq and Iran due to forced conversion of the present religious sects to Twelver Shi'ism by the Safavid Dynasty.Modern Iran: Roots and Results of Revolution. Nikki R Keddie, Yann Richard, pp. 13, 20Immortal: A Military History of Iran and Its Armed Forces. Steven R Ward, pg.43 The second group, the Sulaymaniyya, named for Sulayman ibn Jarir, held that the Imamate should be a matter to be decided by consultation. They felt that the companions, including Abu Bakr and 'Umar, had been in error in failing to follow 'Ali but it did not amount to sin. The third group is known as the Tabiriyya, Batriyya or Salihiyya for Kathir an-Nawa al-Abtar and Hasan ibn Salih. Their beliefs are virtually identical to those of the Sulaymaniyya, except they see Uthman also as in error but not in sin.Article by Sayyid 'Ali ibn 'Ali Al-Zaidi, At-tarikh as-saghir 'an ash-shia al-yamaniyeen (Arabic: ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿßÿ±ŸäÿÆ ÿßŸÑÿµÿ∫Ÿäÿ± ÿπŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ¥Ÿäÿπÿ© ÿßŸÑŸäŸÖŸÜŸäŸäŸÜ, A short History of the Yemenite Shi‚Äòites), 2005 Referencing: Momen, p.50, 51. and S.S.

Adams, Macmillan, 1987, p243. \\"They were called \\"Rafida by the followers of Zayd...the term became a pejorative nickname among Sunni Muslims, who used it, however to refer to the Imamiyah's repudiation of the first three caliphs preceding Ali...\\" Twelver Shia references to Zayd While not one of the 12 Imams embraced by the Twelver denomination and current largest branch of Shi'ite Islam, Zayd ibn Ali features in historical accounts within Twelver literature in a positive light. In Twelver Shia accounts, Imam Ali al-Ridha narrated how his grandfather Ja'far al-Sadiq also supported Zayd ibn Ali's struggle: Jafar al-Sadiq's love for Zayd ibn Ali was so immense, he broke down and cried upon reading the letter informing him of his death and proclaimed: EmpiresJustanids= The Justanids (Persian: ÿ¨ÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜ€åÿßŸÜ‚Äé) were the rulers of a part of Daylam (the mountainous district of Gilan) from 791 to the late 11th-century. After Marzuban ibn Justan converted to Islam in 805, the ancient family of Justan's became connected to the Zaydi Alids of the Daylam region. The Justanids adopted the Zaydi form of Shi'ism. =Karkiya dynasty= The Karkiya dynasty, or Kia dynasty, was a Zaydi Shia dynasty which ruled over Bia pish (eastern Gilan) from the 1370s to 1592.

Community and former States Since the earliest form of Zaydism was Jaroudiah, many of the first Zaidi states were supporters of its position, such as those of the Iranian Alavids of Mazandaran Province and the Buyid dynasty of Gilan Province and the Arab dynasties of the Banu Ukhaidhir of al- Yamama (modern Saudi Arabia) and the Rassids of Yemen. The Idrisid dynasty in the western Maghreb were another Arab Zaydi dynasty, ruling 788‚Äì985. The Alavids established a Zaydi state in Deylaman and Tabaristan (northern Iran) in 864;Article by Sayyid 'Ali ibn 'Ali Al-Zaidi, At-tarikh as-saghir 'an ash- shia al-yamaniyeen (Arabic: ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿßÿ±ŸäÿÆ ÿßŸÑÿµÿ∫Ÿäÿ± ÿπŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ¥Ÿäÿπÿ© ÿßŸÑŸäŸÖŸÜŸäŸäŸÜ, A short History of the Yemenite Shi‚Äòites), 2005 Referencing: Iranian Influence on Moslem Literature it lasted until the death of its leader at the hand of the Sunni Samanids in 928. Roughly forty years later, the state was revived in Gilan (Northwest Iran) and survived until 1126.

As such, the ruler of Yemen was known as the Caliph. Al-Hadi ila'l-Haqq Yahya, a descendant of Imam Hasan ibn Ali, founded this Rassid state at Sa'da, al-Yaman, in c. 893-7. The Rassid Imamate continued until the middle of the 20th century, when a 1962 revolution deposed the Imam. After the fall of the Zaydi Imamate in 1962 many Zaydi Shia in northern Yemen had converted to Sunni Islam. The Rassid state was founded under Jarudiyya thought;Article by Sayyid 'Ali ibn 'Ali Al-Zaidi, At-tarikh as-saghir 'an ash-shia al-yamaniyeen (Arabic: ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿßÿ±ŸäÿÆ ÿßŸÑÿµÿ∫Ÿäÿ± ÿπŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ¥Ÿäÿπÿ© ÿßŸÑŸäŸÖŸÜŸäŸäŸÜ, A short History of the Yemenite Shi‚Äòites), 2005 however, increasing interactions with Hanafi and Shafi'i schools of Sunni Islam led to a shift to Sulaimaniyyah thought, especially among the Hadawi sub-sect. In the 21st century, the most prominent Zaidi movement is the Shabab Al Mu'mineen, commonly known as Houthis, who have been engaged in an uprising against the Yemeni Government in which the Army has lost 743 men and thousands of innocent civilians have been killed or displaced by government forces and Houthi, causing a grave humanitarian crisis in north Yemen. Some Persian and Arab legends record that Zaidis fled to China from the Umayyads during the 8th century. =Houthi Yemen= Since 2004 in Yemen, Zaidi fighters have been waging an uprising against factions belonging to the Sunni majority group in the country. The Houthis, as they are often called, have asserted that their actions are for the defense of their community from the government and discrimination, though the Yemeni government in turn accused them of wishing to bring it down and institute religious law. On 20 September 2014, an agreement was signed in Sana'a under UN patronage essentially giving the Houthis control of the government after a decade of conflict. Tribal militias then moved swiftly to consolidate their position in the capital, with the group officially declaring direct control over the state on 6 February 2015. This outcome followed the removal of Yemen's President Ali Abdullah Saleh in 2012 in the wake of protracted Arab Spring protests. Saudi Arabia has exercised the predominant external influence in Yemen since the withdrawal of Nasser's Egyptian expeditionary force marking the end of the bitter North Yemen Civil War. There is a wide array of domestic opponents to Houthi rule in Yemen, ranging from the conservative Sunni Islah Party to the secular socialist Southern Movement to the radical Islamists of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and now ISIS in Yemen.

The Screaming Eagles were charter members of the World Hockey Association, but never played a game in Miami due to the only available arena being unfit for use. The franchise license was purchased and moved, becoming the Philadelphia Blazers for the WHA's inaugural season. History The Screaming Eagles franchise was the second attempt at a professional hockey team for the South Florida market. The first came two years prior; Seymour H. Knox III, Northrup R. Knox and Robert O. Swados, the owners of the Buffalo Sabres, were awarded an American Hockey League franchise in 1970. The Knox-Swados consortium intended on placing their AHL team in South Florida; the AHL refused to allow a team to play in a market that distant (the AHL had no teams south of Virginia at the time). The proposed team was instead placed in Cincinnati, Ohio and named the Cincinnati Swords. Businessman Herb Martin bought a franchise in the WHA in 1972. The Screaming Eagles made a splash immediately by signing Bernie Parent from the Toronto Maple Leafs -- the first National Hockey League star inked by the rebel league -- and Boston Bruins standout Derek Sanderson. Martin developed a unique plan to build an arena within the walls of four office buildings to create what he called the Executive Square Arena. This new arena was to have been a showcase for the new league. The WHA had even planned to open their season in Miami on October 6, 1972 by hosting the Winnipeg Jets in the new arena. But the plans started to fall apart when construction of the proposed arena was halted. Dade County cited failure to comply with a zoning ordinance which requires one parking spot for every four seats in the arena. At a league meeting in Chicago, the WHA would not accept Miami's $100,000 performance bond because of the lack of an arena to open the season.http://www.philablazers.com/gpage.html The only other option for a home arena for the Screaming Eagles had they chosen to stay in South Florida would have been the then-new Hollywood Sportatorium. But Martin felt this arena was unsuitable even for temporary use; it had no air conditioning or permanent seats, and the roof was partially open. Unable to find a solution to the arena problem, on April 28, 1972, Gary Davidson (the President of the WHA) notified Herb Martin that his club's franchise agreement in the new league had been terminated and that the Miami Screaming Eagles were no longer members of the WHA. In June 1972, Bernard Brown and James Cooper were granted the rights to the Miami Screaming Eagles along with the players (namely Bernie Parent) that were under contract with the team, from Herb Martin. Brown and Cooper then relocated the franchise to Philadelphia and renamed the team the Blazers.http://www.philablazers.com/gpage.html Two decades later, Miami was awarded the National Hockey League's Florida Panthers franchise. Although they never iced a team, replicas of the projected Screaming Eagles jersey continue to sell along with those of actual WHA teams.

(Unknown scale) Aventurine is a form of quartz, characterised by its translucency and the presence of platy mineral inclusions that give a shimmering or glistening effect termed aventurescence. Background The most common color of aventurine is green, but it may also be orange, brown, yellow, blue, or grey. Chrome-bearing fuchsite (a variety of muscovite mica) is the classic inclusion and gives a silvery green or blue sheen. Oranges and browns are attributed to hematite or goethite. Because aventurine is a rock, its physical properties vary: its specific gravity may lie between 2.64-2.69 and its hardness is somewhat lower than single-crystal quartz at around 6.5. Aventurine (unknown scale) Aventurine feldspar or sunstone can be confused with orange and red aventurine quartzite, although the former is generally of a higher transparency. Aventurine is often banded and an overabundance of fuchsite may render it opaque, in which case it may be mistaken for malachite at first glance. The name aventurine derives from the Italian \\"a ventura\\" meaning \\"by chance.\\" This is an allusion to the lucky discovery of aventurine glass or goldstone at some point in the 18th century. One story runs that this kind of glass was originally made accidentally at Murano by a workman, who let some copper filings fall into the molten ‚Äúmetal,‚Äù whence the product was called avventurino. From the Murano glass the name passed to the mineral, which displayed a rather similar appearance. Although it was known first, goldstone is now a common imitation of aventurine and sunstone. Goldstone is distinguished visually from the latter two minerals by its coarse flecks of copper, dispersed within the glass in an unnaturally uniform manner. It is usually a golden brown, but may also be found in blue or green. The majority of green and blue-green aventurine originates in India (particularly in the vicinity of Mysore and Chennai) where it is employed by prolific artisans. Creamy white, gray and orange material is found in Chile, Spain and Russia. Most material is carved into beads and figurines with only the finer examples fashioned into cabochons, later being set into jewellery.

In 1960, after \\"the balloons were getting larger and larger, and there was hardly any drawing left\\", he dropped it and began writing plays. Plays and films Gardner is best known for his 1962 play A Thousand Clowns, which ran for 428 performances. He received an Oscar nomination for the screenplay for the successful 1965 movie adaptation. The play was revived in 1996 and 2001. Both the 1962 play and the movie starred Jason Robards, Jr. as Murray Burns, a charming, unemployed children's show writer, who is forced to choose between social conformity and the probable loss of custody of his 11-year-old nephew to the Child Welfare Bureau. The Robards character was in part based on Gardner's friend at that time, humorist Jean Shepherd. In 2000, Robards wrote: > I feel A Thousand Clowns is his masterpiece. It is a real human comedy of > poignancy and laughter, with all of humanity's foibles and eccentricities. > There is a great depth of love and understanding for all in this play. There > are great life lessons to learn daily, which I find myself still doing. For > Herb Gardner to have written this play in his early twenties is a miracle. Gardner's biggest commercial success was the 1985 play I'm Not Rappaport, which ran for two years, won the Tony Award for Best Play and became the basis for a 1996 movie. In 2012, a theater group in Germany came under fire for allowing a white actor to paint his face and take the part of the black character Midge Carter. Other Broadway credits include The Goodbye People (1968), Thieves (1974), and Conversations with My Father (1992). He collaborated with Jule Styne on the ill-fated 1980 musical One Night Stand. Novel Gardner's autobiographical novel, A Piece of the Action, was published in 1958. Gardner was the screenwriter and co-producer of the 1971 motion picture Who Is Harry Kellerman, and Why Is He Saying Those Terrible Things About Me? which starred Dustin Hoffman. Gardner made a brief screen appearance as Rabbi Pierce in the 1987 motion picture Ishtar. Personal life Gardner's first wife was actress Rita Gardner; the union ended in divorce. He later married Barbara Sproul, with whom he raised two adopted sons, Jake Gardner and Rafferty Gardner. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, he was the boyfriend of actress Marlo Thomas.Katie Kelly, \\"Marlo Thomas: 'All My Life I've Had My Dukes Up'\\"], New York Times, March 11, 1973.

He was a Member of Parliament from 1993 to 2011. First elected for the Reform Party, he was the leader of the Democratic Representative Caucus that left the Canadian Alliance in opposition to Stockwell Day's leadership. When the Conservatives won power in 2006, he became a prominent cabinet minister and served as Minister of Agriculture, Indian and Northern Affairs, and Transportation. On June 14, 2012, Strahl was appointed to serve a five-year term as chair of the Security Intelligence Review Committee, but resigned in controversy over conflict of interest accusations resulting from his lobbying efforts for oil and pipeline companies. Before politics Strahl was raised in British Columbia's Interior, attended Trinity Western University, and worked for Cheam Construction, a logging and road building company owned by his father. Bill Strahl. Chuck Strahl and his siblings took over the business after their father died. Member of Parliament (1993-2011) Shortly after the business failed, Strahl ran for office under the Reform Party banner. He was first elected to office in the Reform Party sweep of the region in the 1993 election. He was re-elected in the 1997 and 2000 elections, running as a member of the Canadian Alliance, which had replaced Reform, in 2000. He represented Chilliwack‚ÄîFraser Canyon, a large riding comprising the Upper Fraser Valley, a primarily agricultural area of the province, and the Fraser Canyon-Lillooet-Bridge River regions, which are mostly wilderness with a resource-based economy and also, like the Chilliwack area, have a significant First Nations population. He held a number of shadow cabinet and committee positions. Strahl rose to national prominence in the summer of 2001 when he was the leader and most outspoken member of a group of Canadian Alliance MPs that left the Alliance caucus and sat as members of the Democratic Representative Caucus. Strahl's own leadership ambitions were frustrated due to his inability to speak French as well as the lingering distrust among many colleagues over the perceived disloyalty shown to his party in 2001. He attempted to launch a bid for the leadership of the Conservative Party, but was not able to secure enough financial or political support. Strahl then supported Tony Clement in his failed leadership bid. At the outset of the 38th Parliament of Canada in October 2004, Strahl was appointed Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees of the Whole under the new rules brought about as a result of the Liberal minority government situation. Strahl was appointed Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food and Minister for the Canadian Wheat Board (CWB) at the beginning of the 39th Parliament on 6 February 2006. Strahl removed upwards of 20,000 farmers from the voters list in the midst of the 2006 election to the CWB. They were disqualified for such reasons as not having delivered any grain to the Wheat Board in the previous two years or not having produced enough wheat or malt barley to have generated significant enough income from which to subsist. On 19 December 2006 he dismissed CWB president Adrian Measner, because \\"It's a position that [he] serves at pleasure. And that position was no longer his\\" because he displeased the Cabinet. Strahl was appointed Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and Federal Interlocutor for M√©tis and Non-Status Indians in a cabinet shuffle on 14 August 2007. He added to his responsibilities the title of Minister of the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency on 5 February 2010. Between 6 August 2010 and 18 May 2011, Strahl was Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities. Health problems In August 2005, Strahl announced that he had lung cancer as the result of exposure to asbestos many years prior. The illness was diagnosed after one of his lungs collapsed twice. However, despite his health problems, he successfully ran for re-election in the 2006 election. He later held various positions in the Cabinet such as Minister of Agriculture, Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs, and Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities. On March 12, 2011, Strahl announced he would not be seeking re-election in the upcoming federal election, which was held on May 2, 2011. Chair of Security Intelligence Review Committee (2012-2014) Controversy On June 14, 2012, Strahl was appointed to serve a five-year term as chair of the Security Intelligence Review Committee (SIRC) - Canada's spy agency watchdog. In January 2014, he resigned his position as chair after the media revealed that he was a registered lobbyist for the Enbridge Northern Gateway project. Former Tory MP Deborah Grey, already a SIRC member, was appointed as Stahl's successor by Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Personal life Strahl married in 1975 and has four children. On March 18, 2011, Mark Strahl succeeded his father as nominee for the Conservative Party in the riding of Chilliwack‚ÄîFraser Canyon. The nomination process, which is usually four weeks, lasted only a week. Mark Strahl was endorsed by Preston Manning, former leader of the Reform Party of Canada, who said \\"Mark Strahl -- by virtue of his family background ... is well prepared for service in the House of Commons.\\" Former Chilliwack city councillor Casey Langbroek said most Conservative Party members from the riding were upset and that the nomination process effectively barred 80% of party members from running. Party member Alex Moens said \\"High public office should not be like a family business, where it's passed on from father to son.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Federal Political Profile from the Library of Parliament *Chuck Strahl's voting record Category:1957 births Category:Businesspeople from British Columbia Category:Businesspeople in timber Category:Canadian Alliance MPs Category:Conservative Party of Canada MPs Category:Canadian evangelicals Category:Living people Category:Members of the Christian and Missionary Alliance Category:Members of the House of Commons of Canada from British Columbia Category:Members of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada Category:People from Chilliwack Category:People from New Westminster Category:Reform Party of Canada MPs Category:Trinity Western University alumni Category:Members of the 28th Canadian Ministry Category:20th-century Canadian politicians Category:21st-century Canadian politicians ","title":"Chuck Strahl"},{"id":"430106","text":"In computer science, a software agent is a computer program that acts for a user or other program in a relationship of agency, which derives from the Latin agere (to do): an agreement to act on one's behalf. Such \\"action on behalf of\\" implies the authority to decide which, if any, action is appropriate. Agents are colloquially known as bots, from robot. They may be embodied, as when execution is paired with a robot body, or as software such as a chatbot executing on a phone (e.g. Siri) or other computing device. Software agents may be autonomous or work together with other agents or people. Software agents interacting with people (e.g. chatbots, human-robot interaction environments) may possess human-like qualities such as natural language understanding and speech, personality or embody humanoid form (see Asimo). Related and derived concepts include intelligent agents (in particular exhibiting some aspects of artificial intelligence, such as reasoning), autonomous agents (capable of modifying the methods of achieving their objectives), distributed agents (being executed on physically distinct computers), multi-agent systems (distributed agents that work together to achieve an objective that could not be accomplished by a single agent acting alone), and mobile agents (agents that can relocate their execution onto different processors). Concepts The basic attributes of an autonomous software agent are that agents * are not strictly invoked for a task, but activate themselves, * may reside in wait status on a host, perceiving context, * may get to run status on a host upon starting conditions, * do not require interaction of user, * may invoke other tasks including communication. Nwana's Category of Software Agent The term \\"agent\\" describes a software abstraction, an idea, or a concept, similar to OOP terms such as methods, functions, and objects. The concept of an agent provides a convenient and powerful way to describe a complex software entity that is capable of acting with a certain degree of autonomy in order to accomplish tasks on behalf of its host. But unlike objects, which are defined in terms of methods and attributes, an agent is defined in terms of its behavior. Various authors have proposed different definitions of agents, these commonly include concepts such as * persistence (code is not executed on demand but runs continuously and decides for itself when it should perform some activity) * autonomy (agents have capabilities of task selection, prioritization, goal-directed behavior, decision-making without human intervention) * social ability (agents are able to engage other components through some sort of communication and coordination, they may collaborate on a task) * reactivity (agents perceive the context in which they operate and react to it appropriately). Distinguishing agents from programs All agents are programs, but not all programs are agents. Contrasting the term with related concepts may help clarify its meaning. Franklin & Graesser (1997) discuss four key notions that distinguish agents from arbitrary programs: reaction to the environment, autonomy, goal-orientation and persistence. Intuitive distinguishing agents from objects * Agents are more autonomous than objects. * Agents have flexible behaviour: reactive, proactive, social. * Agents have at least one thread of control but may have more. Distinguishing agents from expert systems * Expert systems are not coupled to their environment. * Expert systems are not designed for reactive, proactive behavior. * Expert systems do not consider social ability. Distinguishing intelligent software agents from intelligent agents in AI * Intelligent agents (also known as rational agents) are not just computer programs: they may also be machines, human beings, communities of human beings (such as firms) or anything that is capable of goal-directed behavior. : Impact of software agents Software agents may offer various benefits to their end users by automating complex or repetitive tasks. However, there are organizational and cultural impacts of this technology that need to be considered prior to implementing software agents. Organizational impactWork contentment and job satisfaction impact People like to perform easy tasks providing the sensation of success unless the repetition of the simple tasking is affecting the overall output. In general implementing software agents to perform administrative requirements provides a substantial increase in work contentment, as administering their own work does never please the worker. The effort freed up serves for a higher degree of engagement in the substantial tasks of individual work. Hence, software agents may provide the basics to implement self-controlled work, relieved from hierarchical controls and interference. Such conditions may be secured by application of software agents for required formal support. Cultural impact The cultural effects of the implementation of software agents include trust affliction, skills erosion, privacy attrition and social detachment. Some users may not feel entirely comfortable fully delegating important tasks to software applications. Those who start relying solely on intelligent agents may lose important skills, for example, relating to information literacy. In order to act on a user's behalf, a software agent needs to have a complete understanding of a user's profile, including his/her personal preferences. This, in turn, may lead to unpredictable privacy issues. When users start relying on their software agents more, especially for communication activities, they may lose contact with other human users and look at the world with the eyes of their agents. These consequences are what agent researchers and users must consider when dealing with intelligent agent technologies. History The concept of an agent can be traced back to Hewitt's Actor Model (Hewitt, 1977) - \\"A self-contained, interactive and concurrently-executing object, possessing internal state and communication capability.\\" To be more academic, software agent systems are a direct evolution of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). MAS evolved from Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI), Distributed Problem Solving (DPS) and Parallel AI (PAI), thus inheriting all characteristics (good and bad) from DAI and AI. John Sculley‚Äôs 1987 ‚ÄúKnowledge Navigator‚Äù video portrayed an image of a relationship between end-users and agents. Being an ideal first, this field experienced a series of unsuccessful top-down implementations, instead of a piece-by-piece, bottom-up approach. The range of agent types is now (from 1990) broad: WWW, search engines, etc. Examples of intelligent software agents=Buyer agents (shopping bots) Buyer agents travel around a network (e.g. the internet) retrieving information about goods and services. These agents, also known as 'shopping bots', work very efficiently for commodity products such as CDs, books, electronic components, and other one- size-fits-all products. Buyer agents are typically optimized to allow for digital payment services used in e-commerce and traditional businesses. User agents (personal agents) User agents, or personal agents, are intelligent agents that take action on your behalf. In this category belong those intelligent agents that already perform, or will shortly perform, the following tasks: * Check your e-mail, sort it according to the user's order of preference, and alert you when important emails arrive. * Play computer games as your opponent or patrol game areas for you. * Assemble customized news reports for you. There are several versions of these, including CNN. * Find information for you on the subject of your choice. * Fill out forms on the Web automatically for you, storing your information for future reference * Scan Web pages looking for and highlighting text that constitutes the \\"important\\" part of the information there * Discuss topics with you ranging from your deepest fears to sports * Facilitate with online job ‚â§search duties by scanning known job boards and sending the resume to opportunities who meet the desired criteria * Profile synchronization across heterogeneous social networks Monitoring-and-surveillance (predictive) agents Monitoring and Surveillance Agents are used to observe and report on equipment, usually computer systems. The agents may keep track of company inventory levels, observe competitors' prices and relay them back to the company, watch stock manipulation by insider trading and rumors, etc. service monitoring For example, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory has an agent that monitors inventory, planning, schedules equipment orders to keep costs down, and manages food storage facilities. These agents usually monitor complex computer networks that can keep track of the configuration of each computer connected to the network. A special case of Monitoring-and-Surveillance agents are organizations of agents used to emulate the Human Decision-Making process during tactical operations. The agents monitor the status of assets (ammunition, weapons available, platforms for transport, etc.) and receive Goals (Missions) from higher level agents. The Agents then pursue the Goals with the Assets at hand, minimizing expenditure of the Assets while maximizing Goal Attainment. (See Popplewell, \\"Agents and Applicability\\") Data-mining agents This agent uses information technology to find trends and patterns in an abundance of information from many different sources. The user can sort through this information in order to find whatever information they are seeking. A data mining agent operates in a data warehouse discovering information. A 'data warehouse' brings together information from many different sources. \\"Data mining\\" is the process of looking through the data warehouse to find information that you can use to take action, such as ways to increase sales or keep customers who are considering defecting. 'Classification' is one of the most common types of data mining, which finds patterns in information and categorizes them into different classes. Data mining agents can also detect major shifts in trends or a key indicator and can detect the presence of new information and alert you to it. For example, the agent may detect a decline in the construction industry for an economy; based on this relayed information construction companies will be able to make intelligent decisions regarding the hiring/firing of employees or the purchase/lease of equipment in order to best suit their firm. Networking and communicating agents Some other examples of current intelligent agents include some spam filters, game bots, and server monitoring tools. Search engine indexing bots also qualify as intelligent agents. * User agent - for browsing the World Wide Web * Mail transfer agent - For serving E-mail, such as Microsoft Outlook. Why? It communicates with the POP3 mail server, without users having to understand POP3 command protocols. It even has rule sets that filter mail for the user, thus sparing them the trouble of having to do it themselves. * SNMP agent * In Unix-style networking servers, httpd is an HTTP daemon that implements the Hypertext Transfer Protocol at the root of the World Wide Web * Management agents used to manage telecom devices * Crowd simulation for safety planning or 3D computer graphics, * Wireless beaconing agent is a simple process hosted single tasking entity for implementing wireless lock or electronic leash in conjunction with more complex software agents hosted e.g. on wireless receivers. * Use of autonomous agents (deliberately equipped with noise) to optimize coordination in groups online. Software development agents (aka software bots) Software bots are becoming important in software engineering. An example of a software bot is a bot that automatically repairs continuous integration build failures. Design issues Issues to consider in the development of agent-based systems include * how tasks are scheduled and how synchronization of tasks is achieved * how tasks are prioritized by agents * how agents can collaborate, or recruit resources, * how agents can be re-instantiated in different environments, and how their internal state can be stored, * how the environment will be probed and how a change of environment leads to behavioral changes of the agents * how messaging and communication can be achieved, * what hierarchies of agents are useful (e.g. task execution agents, scheduling agents, resource providers ...). For software agents to work together efficiently they must share semantics of their data elements. This can be done by having computer systems publish their metadata. The definition of agent processing can be approached from two interrelated directions: * internal state processing and ontologies for representing knowledge * interaction protocols ‚Äì standards for specifying communication of tasks Agent systems are used to model real-world systems with concurrency or parallel processing. * Agent Machinery ‚Äì Engines of various kinds, which support the varying degrees of intelligence * Agent Content ‚Äì Data employed by the machinery in Reasoning and Learning * Agent Access ‚Äì Methods to enable the machinery to perceive content and perform actions as outcomes of Reasoning * Agent Security ‚Äì Concerns related to distributed computing, augmented by a few special concerns related to agents The agent uses its access methods to go out into local and remote databases to forage for content. These access methods may include setting up news stream delivery to the agent, or retrieval from bulletin boards, or using a spider to walk the Web. The content that is retrieved in this way is probably already partially filtered ‚Äì by the selection of the newsfeed or the databases that are searched. The agent next may use its detailed searching or language-processing machinery to extract keywords or signatures from the body of the content that has been received or retrieved. This abstracted content (or event) is then passed to the agent's Reasoning or inferencing machinery in order to decide what to do with the new content. This process combines the event content with the rule-based or knowledge content provided by the user. If this process finds a good hit or match in the new content, the agent may use another piece of its machinery to do a more detailed search on the content. Finally, the agent may decide to take an action based on the new content; for example, to notify the user that an important event has occurred. This action is verified by a security function and then given the authority of the user. The agent makes use of a user-access method to deliver that message to the user. If the user confirms that the event is important by acting quickly on the notification, the agent may also employ its learning machinery to increase its weighting for this kind of event. Bots can act on behalf of their creators to do good as well as bad. There are a few ways which bots can be created to demonstrate that they are designed with the best intention and are not built to do harm. This is first done by having a bot identify itself in the user- agent HTTP header when communicating with a site. The source IP address must also be validated to establish itself as legitimate. Next, the bot must also always respect a site's robots.txt file since it has become the standard across most of the web. And like respecting the robots.txt file, bots should shy away from being too aggressive and respect any crawl delay instructions.

The band consists of Jon Toogood (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Phil Knight (lead guitar, synthesiser, backing vocals), Karl Kippenberger (bass guitar, backing vocals), and Tom Larkin (drums, backing vocals, samplers). The band was known as Pacifier between 2001 and 2004. During their recording career, Shihad have produced five number-one studio albums, holding the title for most number one records for any New Zealand artist, alongside Hayley Westenra, and three top- ten singles in New Zealand. At the release time of their ninth studio album, FVEY, Shihad had the most Top 40 New Zealand chart singles for any New Zealand artist, with 25. Of these singles, \\"Home Again\\", \\"Pacifier\\" and \\"Bitter\\" are listed at numbers 30, 60 and 83, respectively, in the Nature's Best compilation, an official collection of New Zealand's top 100 songs. History=Formation and early years (1988‚Äì1996) Shihad was formed by Jon Toogood and Tom Larkin in 1988. In 1990, Gerald Dwyer, frontman of local punk band Flesh-D-Vice became Shihad's manager; he also managed Head Like A Hole (HLAH). However, Dwyer died of a drug overdose before Shihad's performance at the 1996 Big Day Out in Auckland. Phil Knight, Shakespeare Hotel, Napier, NZ. Love Is the New Hate, Beautiful Machine, and Ignite (2005‚Äì2011) Shihad opened their Love Is the New Hate album tour with a free concert in Auckland's Aotea Square, and an extensive tour of Australia and New Zealand, including a spot on the main stage at Byron Bay, Australia's Splendour In The Grass, in front of an audience of approximately 20,000‚Äîthe album was released in 2005. The band also toured with Cog, the Datsuns, and opened for Evanescence on part of their 2006/2007 world tour. During February and March 2008, the band completed an Australian east coast tour entitled \\"One Will Hear The Tour\\", playing a total of 30 shows, and in the second half of 2008 toured New Zealand on the \\"Beautiful Machine Tour\\" supporting the album of the same name, playing medium-size venues such as the Wellington Town Hall with support from The Mint Chicks and Luger Boa. Shihad also toured with Gyroscope around Australia for Gyroscope's \\"Australia Tour\\" during the same year. For New Year's Eve 2008/2009, Shihad performed in Gisborne, New Zealand, followed by shows at the Coroglen Tavern and the Lake HƒÅwea Motor Inn, also in New Zealand. Shihad supported AC/DC for the New Zealand leg of AC/DC's Black Ice World Tour in January and February 2010. In January 2010, Shihad's new single \\"Cold Heart\\" was released, and was followed by \\"Sleepeater\\" in April and \\"Lead or Follow\\" in July. The series of single releases from early 2010 were in anticipation of Shihad's eighth album, Ignite. It was released on 24 September 2010 and debuted at number one on the New Zealand music charts, eventually achieving gold sales there. The band toured New Zealand in August 2010 performing their albums Killjoy and The General Electric in full. During this time the band featured on the cover of Rip It Up Magazine. At the 2010 New Zealand Music Awards Shihad won the Legacy Award and were inducted into the New Zealand Music Hall of Fame. Shihad confirmed the release of a greatest hits compilation called The Meanest Hits in October 2011, which was released in two formats: a 20-song standard edition and a deluxe 38-song, two-disc edition. Also in October 2011, the band re-released their 1990 EP Devolve, their first 12 single releases for the first time in digital form on iTunes, and their entire singles and B-sides back catalogue, also on iTunes. On the second disc of the Australian release of The Meanest Hits, \\"Down Dance\\" was replaced with \\"Right Outta Nowhere\\"‚Äîthis song does not appear on the New Zealand version of the album. FVEY (2012‚Äìpresent) For the production of their ninth studio album, Shihad worked with Jaz Coleman, of English post-punk band Killing Joke. Coleman produced Shihad's debut album, Churn, but a disagreement with the band occurred after the release of the album. Following a 15-year period in which Coleman and Shihad did not communicate, Coleman made amends with the band members at a London, UK awards ceremony. Toogood explained in June 2014: > Three years ago we were at the Metal Hammer awards. I hadn't talked to Jaz > for ages. We'd had a falling out, I just didn't have time for him. Tom > [Larkin] went and chatted to him and was like, \\"come over and talk to him\\". > I was like, \\"Fuck that guy\\". But he was softer‚Äîhe doesn't drink alcohol > anymore. He's still gnarly and idealistic and brutal but minus the alcohol > that makes him this focused machine. It was just the perfect meeting of what > we wanted to do and having the right guy to do it with. Prior to the recording process, Coleman informed the band, \\"I'm going to work you until you've made a great record\\". Toogood explained that the entirety of the ninth album was recorded live, while Coleman conducted, and the band members were forced to focus entirely on each song as they were recorded, without outside distractions, such as mobile phones. After the completion of a two-month recording period, Toogood referred to the band's time with Coleman as a \\"bootcamp\\"; however, Toogood further explained that the band \\"needed someone to crack the whip\\" and he felt \\"purged\\" afterward, concluding, \\"It's great to hang around guys you've been hanging around with since you were 18.\\" Titled FVEY, the band's ninth album was released on 8 August 2014 on the Warner Music New Zealand label and Toogood has referred to FVEY as Shihad's best album in 15 years. The first single \\"Think You're So Free\\" was described by Australia's Double J radio station as sounding \\"more furious now than they ever have\\" and the music video for the song was published on YouTube on 5 July 2014. Prior to the release of the album, Toogood explained that anger towards social injustice was a primary motivation during the songwriting process, stating: \\"I don't have any answers but just as a concerned citizen, I'm going, 'This is bullshit'. The music's how we feel about that. It's fucking frustrating.\\" Musically, the band chose a heavier sound, signifying a return to the first album, which the band found most enjoyable to play during their greatest hits tour. Naming conflict The name Shihad was chosen after members of the band saw David Lynch's 1984 film, Dune, based on Frank Herbert's classic science fiction novel of the same name, which uses the term \\"Jihad\\", in an approximation of the term used by Muslims which roughly translates to \\"the struggle\\", or as a reference to the \\"Holy War\\". Quote from an interview in Opus Issue 7 ‚Äì 2003 (Newcastle University student magazine) Interview: Pacifier ‚Äì By John Grayson. Following the September 11 attacks, the band decided to change their name due to the similarity between the band's name Shihad and the Arabic word jihad. At the 2002 Big Day Out music festival in Auckland, New Zealand they released T-shirts with 'Shihad' on them, and 'Remote' printed below, indicating that 'Remote' was to be the new name. However, due to this name being taken already, they settled on \\"Pacifier\\", which was a successful single from their album The General Electric. They released an album, Pacifier, under this name in 2002. The American release of the album featured a different track listing to the Australian and New Zealand release, and included the song My Mind's Sedate from The General Electric. On 17 September 2004, the band announced to the world that they would change their name back to Shihad. To quote the band, \\"The events surrounding the name change and our choice to be known as Pacifier are well documented. As much as we believed in what we were doing, and the reasons for doing it at the time ‚Äì the truth is we were wrong.\\" On an appearance on the ABC TV show Spicks and Specks, Jon Toogood talked about how band members do not usually have to consider holy war when thinking of a band name. In an interview, Jon Toogood spoke about an event that contributed to their decision: The band name \\"Pacifier\\" was raffled on the Australian radio station Triple J by Jay and the Doctor and was claimed by a little known band from Tasmania, Theory of Everything.

In the process, the Proto-Bantu-speaking settlers displaced or absorbed pre-existing hunter-gatherer and pastoralist groups that they encountered. The primary evidence for this expansion is linguistic ‚Äì a great many of the languages spoken across Sub-Equatorial Africa are remarkably similar to each other, suggesting the common cultural origin of their original speakers. The linguistic core of the Bantu languages, which comprise a branch of the Niger‚ÄìCongo family, was located in the adjoining regions of Cameroon and Nigeria. However, attempts to trace the exact route of the expansion, to correlate it with archaeological evidence and genetic evidence, have not been conclusive; thus although the expansion is widely accepted as having taken place, many aspects of it remain in doubt or are highly contested. The expansion is believed to have taken place in at least two waves, between about 3,000 and 2,000 years ago (approximately 1,000 BC to AD 1). Linguistic analysis suggests that the expansion proceeded in two directions: the first went across the Congo forest region (towards East Africa), and the second ‚Äì and possibly others ‚Äì went south along the African coast into Gabon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Angola, or inland along the many south- to-north flowing rivers of the Congo River system. The expansion reached South Africa, probably as early as AD 300. Theories on expansion Bantuists believe that the Bantu expansion most probably began on the highlands between Cameroon and Nigeria. The 60,000-km2 Mambilla region straddling the borderlands here has been identified as containing remnants of \\"the Bantu who stayed home\\", as the bulk of Bantu-speakers moved away from the region. Archaeological evidence from the separate works of Jean Hurault (1979, 1986 & 1988) and Rigobert Tueche (2000) in the region reveals that this region has been inhabited by the same culture for 5 millennia, from 3000 B.C to date.Zeitlyn, D and Connell, B (2003): Ethnogenesis and Fractal History on an African Frontier: Mambila-Njerep, -Mandulu. Journal of African History, Vol. 44, No 1, pp. 117-138, June 11, 2003. C.U.P. The majority of the groups of the Bamenda highlands (occupied for 2 millennia to date), somewhat south and contiguous with the Mambilla region, have an ancient history of descent from the north in the direction of the Mambilla region. Initially, archaeologists believed that they could find archaeological similarities in the ancient cultures of the region that the Bantu-speakers were held to have traversed. Linguists, classifying the languages and creating a genealogical table of relationships, believed they could reconstruct material culture elements. They believed that the expansion was caused by the development of agriculture, the making of ceramics, and the use of iron, which permitted new ecological zones to be exploited. In 1966, Roland Oliver published an article presenting these correlations as a reasonable hypothesis. The hypothesized Bantu expansion pushed out or assimilated the hunter-forager proto-Khoisan, who had formerly inhabited Southern Africa. In Eastern and Southern Africa, Bantu speakers may have adopted livestock husbandry from other unrelated Cushitic-and Nilotic- speaking peoples they encountered. Herding practices reached the far south several centuries before Bantu-speaking migrants did. Archaeological, linguistic, genetic, and environmental evidence all support the conclusion that the Bantu expansion was a significant human migration. Niger‚ÄìCongo languages The Niger‚ÄìCongo family comprises a huge group of languages spread throughout Sub-Saharan Africa. The Benue‚ÄìCongo branch includes the Bantu languages, which are found throughout Central, Southern, and Eastern Africa. A characteristic feature of most Niger‚ÄìCongo languages, including the Bantu languages, is their use of tone. They generally lack case inflection, but grammatical gender is characteristic, with some languages having two dozen genders (noun classes). The root of the verb tends to remain unchanged, with either particles or auxiliary verbs expressing tenses and moods. For example, in a number of languages the infinitival is the auxiliary designating the future. Pre-expansion-era demography Before the expansion of Bantu- speaking farmers, Central, Southern, and Southeast Africa were populated by Pygmy foragers, Khoisan-speaking hunter-gatherers, Nilo-Saharan-speaking herders, and Cushitic-speaking pastoralists. Central Africa It is thought that Central African Pygmies and Bantus branched out from a common ancestral population c. 70,000 years ago. Many Batwa groups speak Bantu languages; however, a considerable portion of their vocabulary is not Bantu in origin. Much of this vocabulary is botanical, deals with honey collecting, or is otherwise specialised for the forest and is shared between western Batwa groups. It has been proposed that this is the remnant of an independent western Batwa (Mbenga or \\"Baaka\\") language. Southern Africa Before the Bantu expansion, Khoisan-speaking peoples inhabited Southern Africa. Their descendants have largely mixed with other peoples and adopted other languages. A few still live by foraging often supplemented by working for neighbouring farmers in the arid regions around the Kalahari desert, while a larger number of Nama continue their traditional subsistence by raising livestock in Namibia and adjacent South Africa. Southeast Africa Prior to the arrival of Bantus in Southeast Africa, Cushitic-speaking peoples had migrated into the region from the Ethiopian Highlands and other more northerly areas. The first waves consisted of Southern Cushitic speakers, who settled around Lake Turkana and parts of Tanzania beginning around 5,000 years ago. Many centuries later, around AD 1,000, some Eastern Cushitic speakers also settled in northern and coastal Kenya. In addition, Khoisan-speaking hunter-gatherers also inhabited Southeast Africa before the Bantu expansion. Nilo-Saharan-speaking herder populations comprised a third group of the area's pre-Bantu expansion inhabitants. Expansion San rock art depicting a shield-carrying Bantu warrior. The movement of Bantu settlers, who migrated southwards and settled in the summer rainfall regions of Southern Africa within the last 2000 years, established a range of relationships with the indigenous San people from bitter conflict to ritual interaction and intermarriage. c. 3000BC to c. AD 500 It seems likely that the expansion of the Bantu-speaking people from their core region in West Africa began around 4000‚Äì3500BC. Although early models posited that the early speakers were both iron-using and agricultural, definitive archaeological evidence that they used iron does not appear until as late as 400BC, though they were agricultural. The western branch, not necessarily linguistically distinct, according to Christopher Ehret, followed the coast and the major rivers of the Congo system southward, reaching central Angola by around 500BC. It is clear that there were human populations in the region at the time of the expansion, and pygmies are their closest living relatives. However, mtDNA genetic research from Cabinda suggests that only haplogroups that originated in West Africa are found there today, and the distinctive L0 of the pre-Bantu population is missing, suggesting that there was a complete population replacement. In South Africa, however, a more complex intermixing could have taken place. Further east, Bantu-speaking communities had reached the great Central African rainforest, and by 500BC, pioneering groups had emerged into the savannas to the south, in what are now the Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, and Zambia. Another stream of migration, moving east by 3,000 years ago (1000BC), was creating a major new population center near the Great Lakes of East Africa, where a rich environment supported a dense population. Movements by small groups to the southeast from the Great Lakes region were more rapid, with initial settlements widely dispersed near the coast and near rivers, due to comparatively harsh farming conditions in areas farther from water. Pioneering groups had reached modern KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa by AD 300 along the coast, and the modern Limpopo Province (formerly Northern Transvaal) by AD 500. From the 11th century to 17th century Between the 11th and 15th centuries, the relatively powerful Bantu-speaking states on a scale larger than local chiefdoms began to emerge: in the Great Lakes region, the savanna south of the Central African rainforest, the present-day South African region: Kingdom of Mapungubwe (c.1075‚Äìc.1220) and the Zambezi River where the Monomatapa kings built the famous Great Zimbabwe complex. Such processes of state-formation occurred with increasing frequency from the 16th century onward. They were probably due to denser population, which led to more specialised divisions of labour, including military power, while making outmigration more difficult. Other factors were increased trade among African communities and with European and Arab traders on the coasts, technological developments in economic activity, and new techniques in the political- spiritual ritualisation of royalty as the source of national strength and health. Rise of the Zulu Empire (18th‚Äì19th centuries) By the time Great Zimbabwe had ceased being the capital of a large trading empire, speakers of Bantu languages were present throughout much of southern Africa. Two main groups developed: the Nguni (Xhosa, Zulu, Swazi), who occupied the eastern coastal plains, and the Sotho‚ÄìTswana, who lived on the interior plateau. In the late 18th and early 19th century, two major events occurred. The Trekboers were colonizing new areas of southern Africa, moving northeast from the Cape Colony, and they came into contact with the Xhosa, the Southern Nguni. At the same time, major events were taking place further north in modern-day KwaZulu- Natal. At that time, the area was populated by dozens of small clans, one of which was the Zulu, then a particularly small clan of no local distinction whatsoever. In 1816, Shaka acceded to the Zulu throne. Within a year, he had conquered the neighboring clans, and had made the Zulu into the most important ally of the large Mtetwa clan, which was in competition with the Ndwandwe clan for domination of the northern part of modern-day KwaZulu-Natal. Criticism Manfred K. H. Eggert stated that \\"the current archaeological record in the Central African rainforest is extremely spotty and consequently far from convincing so as to be taken as a reflection of a steady influx of Bantu speakers into the forest, let alone movement on a larger scale.\\", No. 4,2016, pp.79-90 See also * Bantu peoples * Matrilineal belt References * External links * Genetic and Demographic * Bantu Expansion and Hunter- gatherers * Dispersals and genetic adaptation of Bantu-speaking populations in Africa and North America 05 May 2017 Category:Demographic history of Africa Category:Prehistoric migrations Category:Prehistoric Africa Category:Internal migrations in Africa Category:1st millennium BC ","title":"Bantu expansion"},{"id":"430138","text":"The Cable Public Affairs Channel (), better known by its acronym CPAC ( ), is a Canadian discretionary service channel that is owned by a consortium that includes among other part-owners Rogers Communications, Shaw Communications, Vid√©otron, Cogeco, and Eastlink. The channel is devoted to coverage of public and government affairs, including carrying a full, uninterrupted feed of proceedings of the House of Commons of Canada, with three audio channels, one untreated feed and, with the assistance of interpreters, one in each of the official languages. Synopsis CPAC's main purpose is the broadcast of proceedings of the House of Commons. Other programming includes meetings of The House of Commons and Senate of Canada parliamentary committees, occasional Supreme Court proceedings, political conventions, conferences, committees and coverage of general elections. CPAC also airs the proceedings of certain Royal Commissions and judicial enquiries. CPAC is similar to services in other countries including C-SPAN (United States), EuroparlTV (European Union), La Cha√Æne parlementaire (France), Phoenix (Germany), BBC Parliament (United Kingdom) and TV C√¢mara, TV Senado and TV Brasil (Brazil), some of which (particularly C-SPAN) occasionally supply programming to CPAC. History Television broadcasting of the proceedings of the House of Commons began in 1977 after a motion approving it was adopted by the House, with broadcasts commencing in October of that year. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) allowed cable companies to carry the broadcasts on their specialty channels as an interim measure. In 1979, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation was given a temporary network licence to begin live coverage of the proceedings (which had been airing on a tape delayed basis until then), leading to the creation of the CBC Parliamentary Television Network. A permanent licence was granted to the CBC the next year. Original logo used from 1992 to 1996 In 1989, the CBC and a consortium of cable television providers made a joint proposal for the creation of a new entity, the Canadian Parliamentary Channel (CPaC) that would carry the proceedings of the House of Commons and committees, along with proceedings of royal commissions, enquiries, court hearings and provincial legislatures, and public affairs programming. A review of parliamentary broadcasting resulted but the CPaC proposal was not acted upon. In December 1990, the CBC announced that as a result of budget cuts the CBC \\"is no longer able to bear the cost of operating the English- and French-language parliamentary channels. The government will seek the views of the Speaker of the House and consider means of maintaining the service.\\" The CBC announced that it was discontinuing its role as the parliamentary broadcaster effective April 1, 1991. As an interim measure, the House of Commons' Board of Internal Economy negotiated a temporary contract with the CBC to provide parliamentary coverage for an additional year while the Board considered proposals to take over the service. In 1992, the Board came to an agreement with Canadian Parliamentary Channel, Inc., a consortium of 25 cable companies, to take over the CBC's role ‚Äì the new service received its licence from the CRTC in 1993. Second CPAC logo used from 1996 to 2001 While the Canadian Parliamentary Channel's name was soon changed to Cable Public Affairs Channel to reflect the greater diversity of programming and the cable industry's ownership of the service, the ownership structure continues today; the shareholders of Cable Public Affairs Channel Inc. are major cable companies such as Rogers Communications (41.4%), Shaw Communications (25.05%), Vid√©otron (21.71%), Cogeco (6.7%), Eastlink (3.76%) and several other cable companies (including Access Communications and Omineca Cablevision) owning a combined equity of 1.37%. To date there have been few, if any, accusations of influence by these cable companies on CPAC's editorial policy. Indeed, some CPAC promotions (featuring Tom Green) have claimed that because it is owned by the cable industry, \\"not the government\\", it is more independent than other broadcasters, such as the national public broadcaster CBC, which also provide extensive political coverage through various outlets. During federal election campaigns, the network frequently airs Campaign Politics, a documentary series in which each episode profiles one individual electoral district through interviews with candidates and voters. Choice of feeds Logo used from 2001 to 2016 In 2003, at the behest of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), CPAC and its carriers started to allow television viewers to choose which language they can hear the service in, putting the feed of one language on the service's main audio channel and the feed of the other language on its second audio program channel. Some cable systems also offer the two feeds on separate channels for easier access. CPAC has also offered a \\"floor\\" feed, a feed that does not carry any simultaneous translation, although due to the changes noted above, it may not remain in use over cable or satellite television. A choice between all three feeds are offered on CPAC's free Internet video stream available on the channel's website. Senate proceedings Proceedings of the Senate were historically not carried as the upper house had not agreed to allow its sessions to be televised. Then, on 25 April 2006, Senator Hugh Segal moved that the proceedings of the Senate be televised.\\"Segal calls for televised Senate: Kingston politician wants body to be accountable\\".

Non-political programming From February 12 to 28, 2010, CPAC simulcasted the V network's coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympics. V does not have wide availability outside Quebec, unlike previous rightsholder Radio-Canada or even rival private network TVA. This had caused some concern with francophone groups outside Quebec, thus, CPAC was chosen because of its mandatory carriage on the basic service of all cable and satellite providers, as well as the fact that the House of Commons was not sitting during the games.CPAC and CTV Team Up to Deliver French Olympic Coverage , CPAC / COBMC press release, 2010-02-11 Although CPAC's conditions of licence do not normally permit the channel to air sports,Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2009-390, 2009-06-29 (most recent CRTC decision referring to CPAC's permitted categories of programming) it received special authorization from the CRTC to permit this simulcast.CRTC letter to CPAC, 2010-02-11CPAC desservira les francophones hors-Qu√©bec , Radio-Canada, 2010-02-11 Since 2009, CPAC has also had the authority to carry entertainment programming on July 1 in order to cover Canada Day celebrations on Parliament Hill or elsewhere.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2009-390 On-air staff=Hosts * Esther B√©ginL'Essentiel with Esther B√©gin CPAC, August 31, 2019. * Glen McInnis * Ken Rockburn * Alison Smith\\"CPAC Unveils New Look and Welcomes Alison Smith\\" .

He was the first Imam descended from both grandsons of Muhammad: Hasan ibn Ali and Husayn ibn Ali. He is revered by Shiite Muslims for his religious leadership, and respected by Sunni Muslims for his knowledge and Islamic scholarship as a jurist in Medina. Birth and early life Al-Baqir had a prominent seyyid lineage. His father was Ali ibn Husayn \\"Zayn al-Abidin\\", and his paternal grandfather was Husayn ibn Ali, while his mother was Fatima Umm Abd Allah, and his maternal grandfather was Hasan ibn Ali. His grandfathers Hasan and Husayn were the two eldest surviving sons of Ali through his first wife Fatimah, the youngest daughter of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Al-Baqir was born in Medina around 56 AH (676 AD), when Muawiyah I was trying to ensure that his son Yazid I could inherit the caliphate. When Al-Baqir was a child, his family was affected by the Battle of Karbala; he was three or four years old when his grandfather, Husayn, was killed. According to Ya'qubi, al-Baqir was present at Karbala. In his youth he witnessed the struggle for power among the Umayyads, Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr and a number of Shiite parties, whilst his father maintained a distance from local political activity. Name Al-Baqir is an abbreviation of Baqir al-'ilm, which means \\"he who opens knowledge\\", and al- Baqir is said to have been known for his knowledge. According to Ibn Khallikan, he received the nickname \\"al-Baqir\\" (the ample) due to the \\"ample fund of knowledge\\" he collected. However, Ya'qubi believed that he was called al-Baqir because he \\"split open knowledge\\", examining its depths. The Shiites believe that Baqir al-'ilm was not an ordinary title, because it was given to him by Muhammad. According to al-Kulayni, Muhammad's only living companion Jabir ibn Abd Allah would sit in the mosque and cry: \\"Ya baqir al-ilm, Ya baqir al-ilm\\". Although Medinans thought that Jabir was insane, he assured them that Muhammad had told him: \\"O Jabir! You will meet a man from my family who will have the same name and the same characteristics as mine. He will split open knowledge extensively.\\" According to al-Kulayni, Jabir ibn Abd Allah met al-Baqir when passing a Quran school. Abd Allah saw that the imam was still a child, and examined him to see if he had the features which Muhammad had described. Jabir asked, \\"Characteristics of the Messenger of Allah; by Him in whose hands is my soul, O boy, what is your name?\\" When al- Baqir answered that he was Muhammad ibn Ali ibn al-Husayn, Jabir \\"approached him, kissed his head and swore by his father and mother that Muhammad had recited greeting upon him.\\". According to al-Kafi, Imam Baqir stressed the importance of intelligence saying that Allah will hold everyone accountable on the day of judgement according to the degree of intelligence they received in the worldly life. . Imamate During the imamah of Muhammad al-Baqir, riots erupted throughout the Islamic world due to the Umayyad Caliphate's oppression. Disagreements within the Umayyad party kept them occupied, and they left members of the household undisturbed for some time. However, tyranny in the Battle of Karbala had attracted many people to the imams. These conditions had permitted people (particularly the Shiites) to travel to Medina in large groups and visit the imam freely. The possibility of spreading Islam (which had not existed for the previous imams) was available to the fifth imam, indicated by a number of traditions about the imam and scholars trained under him. Division After the death of Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin (the fourth Imam), most of the Shiites agreed upon his son al-Baqir as the next imam; a minority favored another son of the imam (Zayd ibn Ali), and became known as Zaidiyyah. According to Ibn Khallikan, Zaid (Muhammad al- Baqir's brother), appealed for people to support his cause. According to Al- Masudi, he asked for advice from Muhammad al-Baqir; al-Baqir advised him not to rely on the people of Kufa, explaining how they had previously behaved toward the members of his household. Zaid did not listen to his brother's advice, and led the people of Kufa in a fruitless riot. According to Al- Shahrastani, a dispute had arisen between Muhammad al-Baqir and Zaid because Zaid had been following the Mu'tazilite Wasil ibn Ata. Zaid had also announced that the position of imam was conditional on his appearing publicly to assert his rights. Muhammad al-Baqir replied, \\"Your faith then is merely in your father, as such, for according to your theory he was not an imam, for he certainly never came forth to assert his claims.\\" Under the Umayyad rulers Despite his non-involvement in political activities, the Umayyad rulers harassed Muhammad al-Baqir. Many Shia individuals and delegations came to Medina from Kufa to hear al-Baqir's teachings and ask him questions, among which was who had the right to rule. He was also distrusted because of the uprising of his brother Zayd ibn Ali and other relatives. Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik made a pilgrimage to Mecca, where Mohammed al-Baqir and his son Ja'far al-Sadiq were present. At a gathering, al-Baqir delivered a sermon: \\"We are the favorite and chosen servants of God, and His vicegerents on the face of the earth. One who obeys us is successful and one who opposes would be evil and wretched.\\" His statements were conveyed to Hisham, who wrote to the governor of Medina when he returned to his court in Syria instructing him to send al-Baqir and his son to Damascus. When they arrived, he kept them waiting for three days; on the fourth he called them to court, where he was practicing archery with his officials. Works=Ma'athiru'l-Baqir In Ma'athiru'l-Baqir the imam discussed a number of topics, from the nature of the soul and the qualities of the Ulama to the attributes of God and the divine nature (explaining that it was impossible for humans to understand it). A man asked him, \\"Should I think of anything (to understand Allah)?\\" The imam replied: \\"Yes, but you have to imagine a thing which the mind cannot contain and which is without limit. He is unlike whatever comes into your mind. Nothing resembles Him nor can any thought reach Him.\\" He also said, \\"Talk about the creation of Allah, but do not talk about Allah Himself, for that increases the owner of the talk nothing except perplexity.\\" He defined a Rasul as a prophet who hears and sees the angel in bodily form or in a dream. A Nabi is a prophet who hears but does not see the angel, and the imam is like the Nabi. The imam was frequently asked to explain teachings about the imamate, which is also explained in Ma'athiru'l-Baqir (a summary of which is translated into English in Canon Sell's Ithna  ªAshar√≠yya or The Twelve Shi ªah Imams. When asked about collective knowledge of the Quran, Imam al-Baqir would say that no one collected and memorized the Holy Book as Allah revealed it except Muhammad, Ali ibn Abu Talib and the Imams of Ahl al-Bayt after him. Further, no one is able to claim that they have knowledge of the entire Quran, its apparent and hidden essence, except the executors of the will of the Holy Prophet. . Umm al-Kitab Umm al-Kitab, or The Archetype of the Book, is in the form of a discussion between the imam and three companions. Resembling the Infancy Gospel of Thomas, it illustrates the similarity between imamology and gnostic Christology. A major concept of this work is the description of the numinous experience. Its central motif is the psychological and philosophical explanation of spiritual symbols, with believers instructed to perform acts of self-purification and renewal. Colors are used to symbolize theories and levels of consciousness which one must recognize in oneself. Tafsir al-Baqir  Tafsir al-baqir, or Tafsir Abul Jaroud, is al-Baqir's exegesis of the Quran. Ibn al-Nadim included this book in his list of exegeses of the Quran in his Kitab al-Fihrist, writing that Abul Jaroud Ziyad ibn Abi Ziyad (the head of the Jarudiyya) reported al-Baqir's book. According to Sayyd Hasan al-Sadr, \\"A group of the reliable Shiites reported the book from him [Abul Jaroud] from the days of his righteousness\\"; among them was Abu Bas√Ør Yahya bin al-Qasim al-Asadi. Ali bin Ibrah√Ø~m bin Hashim al-Qummi also mentioned it in his book, al-Tafs√Ør, by the authority of Abu Bas√Ør. Death desecrated grave at al-Baqi' in Saudi Arabia Imam al-Baqir died on 7th Dhu al-Hijjah. Imam al-Baqir was poisoned by Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik. According to the Shi'i account, the Caliph gave Zaid a saddle treated with poison; Zaid gave it to the Imam, who used it and died. Al-Baqir was laid to rest under the dome in al-Baqi', where the Imams Hasan ibn Ali and Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin were buried.

He was an Imam of knowledge according to the Zaydi (Fiver) Shia school and Sufis. He lived in a period when Abbasid caliphs were facing numerous difficulties, the most important of which was Shia revolts. The Caliph Al-Ma'mun sought out a remedy for this problem by appointing Al-Ridha as his successor, through whom he could be involved in worldly affairs. However, according to the Shia view, when Al-Ma'mun saw that the Imam gained even more popularity, he decided to correct his mistake by poisoning him. The Imam was buried at the Imam Reza shrine in a city in Khorasan, which afterwards gained the name Mashhad, meaning \\"the place of martyrdom\\". Tomb of Imam Reza at Mashhad is the largest Shi'ite holy site and one of the most visited holy sites in Shi'ite Islam.Parto Khorshid, 1392, Vol.1, P.77 Birth and family life On the eleventh of Dhu al-Qa'ida, 148 AH (29 December 765 CE), a son was born in the house of Imam Musa al-Kadhim (the seventh Imam of Twelver Shia Islam) in Medina. He was named Ali and titled al-Ridha, literally meaning in Arabic, \\"the soothe\\", since it was believed that Allah was contented with him. His kunya (alternative name) was Abu'l Hasan since he was the father of al-Hasan; the naming of a father after his son being a common practice in Arab culture. However, in the Shia sources, he is commonly called Abu'l-·∏§asan al-·πÆƒÅnƒ´ (the second Abu'l Hasan), since his father, Musa al-Kadhim, was also Abu'l Hasan (he was known as Abu'l-·∏§asan al- Awwal, meaning the first Abu'l Hasan). But according to Sunni scholar Imam Ali was Abu'l Hasan Al awwal mean first Abu'l Hasan name after his son Imam Hasan. In keeping with his very high status amongst Shi'a, he has been given other honorific titles since, such as Saber, Vafi, Razi, Zakki and Vali. Ali was born one month after the death of his grandfather, Ja'far as-SƒÅdiq, and brought up in Medina under the direction of his father. His mother, Najmah, was also a distinguished and pious lady. It is said that the boy al-Ridha required a great deal of milk, so that when his mother was asked whether her milk was sufficient, she answered, \\"it is not because my milk is not sufficient, but he wants it all the time, and consequently I am falling short in my prayers.\\" Originally a North African slave woman, she was purchased and freed by Bibi Hamidah Khatun, the wife of Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq. Imam Ali ibn Musa was said to be shadid ummah or Aswad, meaning he had a very dark-skinned or black complexion. Bibi Hamidah was a notable Islamic scholar. Disputes exist regarding the number of his offspring and their names. A group of scholars (Sunni) say that they were five sons and one daughter, and that they were: Muhammad al- Qani', al-Hasan, Ja'far, Ibrahim, al-Husayn, and 'Ayesha. Sabt ibn al-Jawzi, in his work Tadhkiratul-Khawass ( ÿ™ÿ∞⁄©ÿ±€É ÿßŸÑÿÆŸàÿßÿµ, Introduced eminence of the heirs of Muhammad The Prophet of Islam), says that the sons were only four, dropping the name of Husayn from the list.Imam ar-Ridha', A Historical and Biographical Research, Muhammad Jawed Fadallah, Designation as Imam The eighth Imam had reached the Imamate, after the death of his father, through Divine Command and the decree of his forefathers, especially Imam Musa al-Kadhim, who would repeatedly tell his companions that his son Ali would be the Imam after him. As such, Makhzumi says that one day Musa al- Kadhim summoned and gathered us and entitled him as \\"his executor and successor.\\" From the onset, al-Kadhim preferred al-Ridha to the rest of his sons, informing them, \\"This is your brother ‚ÄòAli b. Musa‚Äô, who is the scholar of the Household of Muhammad. Question him about your beliefs and memorize what he says to you, for I heard my father, Ja'far al-Sadiq say: ‚ÄòThe scholar of the Household of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and his Household, is in your loins. Would that I met him, for he is the namesake of (Imam Ali) the Commander of the faithful.' \\" Yazid ibn Salit has also related a similar narration from the seventh Imam when he met him on his way to Mecca: \\"Ali, whose name is the same as the First and the fourth Imam, is the Imam after me.\\" Said the Imam. However, due to the extreme choking atmosphere and pressure prevailed in the period of Musa al-Kazim, he added, \\"What I said must remain (restricted) up to you and do not reproduce it to anybody unless you know he is one of our friends and companions.\\" The same is narrated from Ali bin Yaqtin, from Imam Musa al-Kazim who has said \\"Ali is the best of my children and I have conferred on him my epithet\\" According to WƒÅqedƒ´, even in his youth, Ali al-Ridha would transmit Hadith from his father and his uncles and gave Fatwa in the mosque of Medina. Ali al-Ridha was not looked upon favorably by HƒÅr≈´n Rashƒ´d; and the people of Medina were disallowed from visiting and learning from him. According to Donaldson he was twenty or twenty-five years old when he succeeded his father as Imam in Medina, and it was about eighteen years later, when the Caliph Al-Ma'mun \\"undertook to ingratiate himself with the numerous Shia parties by designating Ali ar-Ridha as his successor to the Caliphate.\\" Contemporary political situation After the death of Harun al-Rashid in 809, Harun's two sons began fighting for control of the Abbasid Empire. One son, Al-Amin, had an Arab mother and thus had the support of Arabs, while his half-brother Al-Ma'mun had a Persian mother and the support of Persia. After defeating his brother, al-Ma'mun faced many insurrections from the followers of Muhammad's family in many areas. The Shia of al-Ma'mun's era, like the Shia of today, who made a large population of al-Ma'mun's Iran, regarded the Imams as their leaders who must be obeyed in all aspects of life, spiritual and terrestrial, as they believed in them as the real caliphs of Muhammad. The Abbasids, like the Umayyads before them, realized this as a big threat to their own caliphate, since the Shias saw them as usurpers of al-Ma'mun which was far from the sacred status of their Imams. Allamah Tabatabaei writes in his book Shi'ite Islam, that in order to quiet the many Shia rebellions around his government, al-Ma'mun summoned Imam al- Ridha to Khorasan and wanted to offer him the role of Crown Prince to prevent the Shias and relatives of al-Ridha from rebelling against the government, seeing as they would then be fighting their own Imam; secondly, to cause the people to lose their spiritual belief and inner attachment to the Imams, because the Imam would be associated with the corrupt government of al-Ma'mun. Thirdly, he intended it to fool other Shias into believing that his government was not so bad after all, because al-Ridha would then come into power after Ma'mun. And fourthly, he wanted to keep a close watch over the Imam of the Shias himself, so that nothing could happen without al-Ma'mun's knowledge. Word spread quickly among al-Ma'mun's circles that al-Ma'mun was not sincere in his offer to make Ali ibn Musa al-Ridha the Crown Prince, and that it was simply a political move. Al-Ma'mun also became paranoid and thought that al- Ridha would see through it as well, and so would his Shias. In order to quiet the doubts of the people, al-Ma'mun first offered al-Ridha the caliphate itself. He wrote a letter to the Abbasids, who were displeased with his decision to entrust al-Ridha the seat of the caliphate, saying: Al-Ridha, who knew the real reason of this offer, politely refused it and said: Al-Ma'mun kept trying to make his offer seem sincere and kept re-offering the caliphate, and finally moved on to his real plan to make his Crown Prince be Ali al- Ridha. In the document where he pledges allegiance to Ali al-Ridha, Ma'mun writes: > His (al-Ma‚Äômu‚Äôn‚Äôs) choosing ‚ÄòAli b. Musa‚Äô b. Ja‚Äòfar b. Muhammad b. ‚ÄòAli b. > al-Husayn b. ‚ÄòAli b. Abu‚Äô Ta‚Äôlib was after asking Allah for the best and > exerting himself in accomplishing His right toward His servants and His > Earth concerning the two houses in general (i.e., the ‚ÄòAbba‚Äôsid House and > the ‚ÄòAlawide Family, may Allah increase it in honor). That is because he > (al-Ma‚Äômu‚Äôn) has seen his (the Imam‚Äôs) brilliant excellence, his plain > knowledge, his manifest piety, his pure asceticism, his renouncing the > world, and his being safe from the people. It has become clear for him that > reports, tongues, and words have unanimously agreed upon his candidacy. > Besides, he knew of his excellence as a youth and through adolescence, so he > has appointed him as his successor after him. When Imam al-Ridha also declined this position, al-Ma'mun threatened him saying \\"Your ancestor Ali was chosen by the second caliph to be in a six member council to elect the third caliph, and ordered to kill any one of the six who didn't comply. If you do not accept the position of Crown Prince in my government, I will follow through on the same threat\\". Al-Ridha said he would accept, under the condition that none of the affairs of government would be his. He would neither appoint anyone, nor dismiss. He would not rule, or pass laws. He would only be Crown Prince in name. Al-Ma'mun became happy that al- Ridha had accepted and would stay out of his way in governing, and agreed to the condition. Al-Ma'mun even changed the black AbbƒÅsid flags to green, the traditional color of Shia Mohammad's flag and Ali's cloak. He also ordered to mint coins with names of both Al-Ma'mun and Ali al-Ridha. Admonishment of his brother Pilgrims of Imam Ali Riza's Shrine in Mashhad, Khorasan When al- Ridha was summoned to Khurasan and reluctantly accepted the role of successor to al-Ma'mun, al-Ma'mun summoned the Imam's brother, Zayd, who had revolted and brought about a riot in Medina to his court in Khorasan. Al-Ma'mun kept him free as an honor to Ali al-Ridha and overlooked his punishment. One day, however, when Ali al-Ridha was delivering a speech in a grand assembly, he heard Zayd praising himself before the people, saying I am so and so. Ali al- Ridha asked him saying: Debates Al-Ma'mun was very interested in working on various sciences translated into Arabic. Thus he arranged debates between the Imam and Muslim scholars and the leaders of religion sects who came in his presence. One of the discussions was on Divine Unity with Sulaiman al-Mervi; a scholar from Khorasan, another discussion with Ali ibn Muhammad ibn al-Jahm was devoted to the sinlessness of the Prophets, which led to another debate on the same subject which Ma'mun took a great part in it himself. Many of these debates are recorded in the collections of Shia hadiths, like Oyoun Akhbar Al- Ridha. The following is an example of these debates which took place between the Imam and an unbeliever(Zindƒ´q). (The Imam) said to him (Zindƒ´q), \\"Dost thou see that if the correct view is your view then are we not equal? All that we have prayed, fasted, given of the alms and declared of our convictions will not harm us. If the correct view is our view then have not you perished and we gained salvation?\\" the Man said. \\"Then let me know, how is He and where is He?\\" Abu-l-Hasan(the Imam)answered, \\"surely the opinion thou hast adopted is mistaken. He determined the 'where', and He was, when there was no 'where'; and He fashioned the 'how', and He was, when there was no 'how'. So He is not known through 'howness' or 'whereness'\\" The man said, \\"So then surely He is nothing if He cannot be perceived by any of the senses.\\" Abu-l-Hasan said, \\"when our senses fail to perceive Him, we know for certain that He is our Lord ‚Ä¶\\" The man said, \\"Then tell me, when was He?\\" Abu-l-Hasan said, \\"Tell when He was not, and then I will tell you when He was...\\" The man said, \\"Then why has He veiled Himself (from men)?\\" Abu-l-Hasan replied, \\"Surely the veil is upon creatures because of the abundance of their sins. As for Him, no secret is hidden from Him during the day or the night‚Ä¶\\" This is a long debate, entitled, The Veil, full text of which could be found in the A Shiite Anthology translated by William Chittick. According to some accounts, Ma'mun's main objective of holding the meetings was a hope to render the Imam incapable of answering questions in order to undermine his popularity. It is related from al-Nawfali who quoted the Imam as saying > Would you (al-Nawfali) like to know when al-Ma'm≈´n will feel remorseful? > ...When he hears me argue with the people of the Torah quoting their own > Torah, with the people of the Gospel quoting their own Gospel, with the > people of the Psalms quoting their own Psalms, with the Zoroastrians arguing > in their Persian language, with the Romans in their own Latin... then al- > Ma'm≈´n will realize that he will not achieve what he aspires... A version of the Quran written by Al-Ridha, now in the Qom Museum, Iran Works=Al-Risalah al-Dhahabiah Al-Risalah al-Dhahabiah (The Golden Treatise) is a treatise on medical cures and the maintenance of good health which is said to have been written in accordance with the demand of Ma'mun. It is regarded as the most precious Islamic literature in the science of medicine, and was entitled \\"the golden treatise\\" as Ma'mun had ordered it to be written in gold ink. It has been explained in this treatise that one's health is threatened when his blood, yellow bile, black bile and phlegm are unbalanced; and that nutrition and traditional medicine may be used to cure imbalances. Among his sayings is, \\"Do you think that you are a small body, while the greatest world has folded itself in you?\\" Research in the related documents, historical evidence and present volumes of this treatise indicates that even if a book titled Al-Risalah al-Dhahabiah could be attributed to Al- Ridha, it doesn't constitute that the present versions are that precise book, and it cannot be taken into use as \\"Sunnah\\". Sahifah The Sahifah is a collection of hadith attributed to Ali al-Ridha which was transmitted by Abdallah ibn A·∏•mad ibn Amer, who heard them from his father A·∏•mad, who was said to have heard it from Ali al-Ridha in 194 AH (809‚Äì10 CE) at Medina. It contains hadiths on various topics like the invocation of Allah, the importance of praying five times a day and of saying the prayer for the dead, the excellence of the Muhammad's household, of the believer, of good manners, and of strengthening the bonds of kinship, and the danger of cheating, of backbiting, and of tattling. It discusses each member of the household. Uyun al Akhbar ar Reda Uyun al Akhbar ar Reda is a book in which is gathered together everything that has been related about Imam from debates on religious questions and the sayings which have been recorded from him, to the explanations of the reason his name was chosen, and traditions concerning his death and the miracles which have occurred at his tomb. It is collected by Ibn Babawayh known as Al-Shaykh al-Saduq. Feqh al-Re≈ºƒÅ Feqh al-Re≈ºƒÅ (al- Rida's Jurisprudence) Also called al-Fiqh al-Radawi, is also attributed to Imam al-Ridha. It was not known till the 10th/16th century when it was judged to be authentic by Muhammad Baqir Majlisi. However, most of Imami scholars doubted its authenticity. Connection to Sufism It has been commonly held that Maruf Karkhi who was converted to Islam through Ali al-Ridha is one of the foremost figures in the golden chain of most Sufi orders. He was a devoted student of Ali al-Ridha and is an important figure for Sufism and Shi'ism. According to Corbin, although at the end of the Safavid period a Ni'mat Allahi Sufi from India named Ma'sum been sent by his spiritual master, Shaykh Shah 'Ali Rida Dakhani, to Iran and settled with his family at Shiraz, to restore the Ni'mat Allahi order in Iran, however the Sufi order while owes its name to Shah Ni'mat Allah Wali, goes back originally to the Eighth Shia Imam, the Imam 'Ali Rida through Ma'ruf al-Karkhi. Selected sayings * \\"Everyone's friend is his reason; his enemy is his ignorance.\\" * \\"Worship is not abundant prayer and fasting; rather it is abundant reflecting on the affair of Allah, the Great and Almighty.\\" * \\"Man is not worshipful unless he is clement.\\" * \\"Faith is a degree above Islam; fear of Allah is a degree above faith; and nothing less than fear of Allah has been divided among men.\\" * \\"Faith is four pillars: trust in Allah, satisfaction with Allah's decree, submission to Allah's command, and entrusting (affairs) to Allah.\\" * \\"If one lacks five attributes, do not expect to gain anything good out of him for your life in this world or your life to come: if his lineage is known to be untrustworthy, if his nature lacks generosity, if his temper lacks balance, if he lacks a noble conduct, and if he lacks fear of his Lord.\\" * \\"If only three years of a person's span of life has remained and he tightens the bond of kin, Allah will make them thirty years, and Allah does whatever He wills.\\" * \\"Imamate is compulsory for religion and it is a system for Muslims.

After finally being able to persuade al-Rida to accept this position, al-Ma'mun realized his mistake, for Shia began to gain even more popularity. Moreover, Arab party in Baghdad were furious when they heard that al-Ma'mun not only appointed the imam as his successor, but sent out commands that the Abbasid'd black flag should be changed to green in honor of the Imam. They were afraid that the empire would be taken from them. They got together, therefore, to depose Ma'mun and give allegiance to Ibrahim ibn al-Mahdi, who was the uncle of Ma'mun. When Ma'mun heard this, the Imam advised him to solve the problem by dismissing him from his position but he did not heed and decided to return to Baghdad and assert his rights. However, when they reached the town of Sarakhs, his vizier was assassinated, and when they reached Tus, al-Ma'm≈´n poisoned the Imam. Then, Muhammad Taqi imam's son came. Al-Ma'm≈´n ordered that he be buried next to the tomb of his own father, Harun al-Rashid, and showed extreme sorrow in the funeral ritual and stayed for three days at the place. According to Madelung the unexpected death of both the vizier and the successor, \\"whose presence would have made any reconciliation with the powerful  øAbbasid opposition in Baghdad virtually impossible, must indeed arouse strong suspicion that Ma'mun had had a hand in the deaths.\\" The more popular record about his death is that he died in 203 AH, at the age of 50. The precise day is not agreed upon. Ritual of reciting the sermon The traditional Kutbeh Khani (Sermon reciting) ritual is held on the night of killing of Imam Reza every year. The ritual, based on the order of governor Ali Shah of Khorasan in 1160 AH, involves the shrine's servants walking from the nearest street around the shrine to Inqilab yard with candles in their hands. When they arrive, they stand around the yard and began reciting the sermon, worship Allah and praise Ahl al-Bayt. This ritual is also held on the night of Ashura. In the Gregorian calendar While the Khutbeh-khani (Sermon reciting) on the night of the martyrdom of Ali al-Ridha is always on nearly the same day (30Safar) of the Islamic calendar, the date on the Gregorian calendar varies from year to year because of differences between the two calendars, since the Islamic calendar, the Hijri calendar (AH), is a lunar calendar and the Gregorian calendar is a solar calendar. Imam Reza shrine Today the Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad occupies a total area of the shrine area occupies while the seven courtyards surrounding it cover an area of , together having an area larger than Masjid al-Haram and Masjid al-Nabawi (which have areas of Great Mosque of al-Haram at ArchNet and respectively). Based on this, some sources describe it as the largest mosque in the world. The courtyards also contain a total of 14 minarets, and 3 fountains. From the courtyards, external hallways named after scholars lead to the inner areas of the mosque. They are referred to as Bast (Sanctuary), since they were meant to be a safeguard for the shrine areas. The Bast hallways lead towards a total of 21 internal halls (Riwaq) surrounding the burial chamber of Ali al-Ridha. Adjacent to the burial chamber is also a mosque dating back to the 10th century known as, Bala-e-Sar mosque.  Narrations of his character  Al-Dhahabi praised al-Ridha's by saying \\"He (al-Ridha') is Imam Abu' al-Hasan. He was the master of the Hashemites of his time; he was the most clement and noblest of them. Al-Ma'mun honored him, yielded to him, and magniÔ¨Åed him to the extent that he appointed him as his successor.\\" See also * Ali al-Hadi * Hajar Khatoon Mosque * Hasan al- Askari * Hasan ibn Ali * Muhammad al-Baqir * Muhammad al-Mahdi * Musa al-Kazim * Hadith of Golden Chain * Al-Risalah al-Dhahabiah * Al-Sahifat al-Ridha NotesReferencesExternal links * * Social and Political Standing of the Imam * A Brief Biography on the Life of Imam * Ali al-Riza an article by Encyclop√¶dia Iranica * About Imam Reza * 'Ali ar-Riza an article of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica online * The Eighth ImƒÅm * Imam Ali ar-Rida * Official WebSite of Astane Quds Cultural Department * Imam Ali Reza on Baabeilm.com * A Glance at the Biography of Emam Reza * Ali ibn Musa Rida biography and Hadith * Imam Ali Reza (p) Holy Shrine in Mashad ‚Äì Live Broadcast * Category:765 births Category:818 deaths Category:Assassinated Shia imams Category:Deaths by poisoning Category:Fourth Fitna Category:Family of Muhammad Category:Twelver imams Category:Zaidi imams Category:8th-century imams Category:9th-century imams Category:Medieval Arab physicians Category:The Fourteen Infallibles Category:Husaynids Category:8th-century Arabs ","title":"Ali al-Ridha"},{"id":"430186","text":"Muhammad ibn Ali al-Jawwad (, ', c. 12 April 811 ‚Äì 29 November 835) was the ninth of the Twelve Imams and a descendant of Muhammad. He was also called Abu Ja'far, Ibn al-Ridha (\\"the son of al-Ridha); al-JawwƒÅd (\\"the generous\\") and al-Taqƒ´ (\\"the pious\\"). His role is celebrated by the largest branch of Shia Islam, the Twelver or AthnƒÅ‚Äòashariyyah branch. According to Shiite accounts, he was poisoned by his wife and died at age 25, the shortest-lived of the Twelve. Early life Al-Jawad was born circa April 12, 811, in Medina (then part of the Abbasid Empire). He was born to his father, Ali al-Ridha and a mother whose name and background is not entirely known. According to Kulaini, his mother was a bondmaid from Nubia named Habibi. However, some say that she was Khaizaran, a girl from the Byzantine Empire. Others believe she belonged to the household of Maria al-Qibtiyya, who was the slave mother of Muhammad's young son Ibrahim. Al-Jawad's father, Ali al-Ridha, knew that his son should take the position of Imamate after him. When al-Jawad was four, his father received a summons from the Abbasid Caliph, al-Ma'mun, asking him to be al- Ma'mun's successor. Al-Ridha left the four-year-old al-Jawad behind in Medina to respond to the summons. The Shiites questioned whether a child of that age could take on his father's responsibility as an Imamate if something happened to his father. In response, al-Ridha used to tell the story of Jesus, who had become a prophet at a younger age. Al-Kadhimiya Mosque Nicknamed al‚ÄìJawad As a young child, Muhammad al-Jawad earned the name al-Jawad (\\"the generous\\"). When his father was away, people gathered by al-Jawad's door in hopes of gaining help. Al-Jawad's caregivers had him leave his house only through another exit to avoid them. Upon hearing this, his father wrote a letter to advising his son not to listen to those who told him not to use the house's main gate. He wrote that the other advice came from stinginess and a fear that someone else might receive goodness (alms) from al-Jawad. Al-Ridha wrote: \\"Whenever you want to go out, keep some gold and silver with you. No one should ask you for anything without your giving it to him. If one of your uncles asks you to be pious to him, do not give him less than fifty dinars and you may give him more if you want. If one of your aunts asks you, do not give her less than twenty-five dinars and you may give her more if you want....\\" Imamate Al-Jawad's age at the time of his father's death in Korasan is unknown, although probably between seven and nine. With his father's death, al-Jawad became a young Imam. According to Shia beliefs, al-Jawad acted like an adult and possessed extraordinary knowledge. Shia beliefs liken this to Jesus, who was called to leadership and his prophetic mission while still a child. Accounts differ as to al-Ridha's death and subsequent events. One account states that al-Ma'mun poisoned al-Ridha, and then summoned al-Jawad to Baghdad in order to marry his daughter, Ummul Fadhl. This apparently provoked strenuous objections by the Abbasids. According to Ya'qubi, al-Ma'mun gave al- Jawad one hundred thousand Dirham and said, \\"Surely I would like to be a grandfather in the line of the Apostle of God and of Ali ibn Abu Talib.\\" Another account states that al-Ma'mun's first meeting with al-Jawad was coincidental. According to this account, al-Ma'mun was hunting when he happened upon a group of boys including al-Jawad, who were playing. When al- Ma'mun's horsemen approached, the boys ran away, except al-Jawad. This prompted al-Ma'mun to stop his carriage and ask, \\"Boy, what kept you from running away with the others?\\" Al-Jawad replied, \\"The road was not so narrow that I should fear there would not be room for you to pass and I have not been guilty of any offence that I should be afraid and I considered that you were the sort of man who would not injure one who had done no wrong.\\" Shia traditions say that the Caliph was delighted and after he traveling a short distance, one of his hunting birds brought him a small fish. Al-Ma'mun hid the fish in his fist, returned and asked al-Jawad: \\"What have I in my hand?\\" Al- Jawad responded: \\"The creator of living things has created in the sea a small fish that is fished by the falcons of the kings and caliphs to try with it the progeny of al-Mustafa. Shiite tradition says that Al-Ma'mun was pleased with this answer and asked the child about his lineage. Soon after, the Caliph called a large gathering, during which al-Jawad was asked many questions and astonished everyone with his judgment and learning. After this, al-Ma'mun formally gave al-Jawad his daughter in marriage. According to beliefs, Yahya ibn Aktham, the Chief Justice of the Abbasid Empire, was present at al- Ma'mun's assembly and wanted to try al-Jawad in al-Ma'mun's presence. He did so by asking a question concerning atonement for a person who hunts game while dressed in pilgrimage garb (Ihram). In response, al-Jawad asked first \\"whether the game killed was outside the sanctified area or inside it; whether the hunter was aware of his sin or did so in ignorance; did he kill the game on purpose or by mistake, was the hunter a slave or a free man, was he adult or minor, did he commit the sin for the first time or had he done so before, was the hunted game a bird or something else, was it a small animal or a big one, is the sinner sorry for the misdeed or does he insist on it, did he kill it secretly at night or openly during daylight, was he putting on the pilgrimage garb for Hajj or for the Umrah?...\\" This apparently astonished the Abbasid who were critical of al-Ma'mun's decision. During the next annual pilgrimage (Hajj), prominent men from around the Islamic world came to Medina to see al- Jawad and another assembly was held. These men were skeptical of al-Jawad's youth and whether he truly was the Imamate). Shiite belief holds that the boy eliminated their doubts. Kulaini recounted that the superintendent of the Shrine gave al-Jawad a test that \\"lasted for several days, in which he answered thirty thousand questions to their great amazement!\\" Abbasid era Ma'mun had asked al-Jawad to marry his daughter because he had been the pioneer of his contemporary elites. One year after this marriage, al-Jawad came back to Medina with Ome Al Fazl, his wife, and devoted his life to teaching. Al-Jawad also married Sumaneh, who was from the Maghreb (Northwest Africa). She bore him a son and a successor, Ali al-Hadi, who would be the tenth Shiite Imam. After al-Ma'mun's death in 833, his successor, Al-Mu'tasim, became the new Caliph. Al-Mu'tasim did not like al-Jawad and in 835 called him to Baghdad. Al-Jawad left his son Ali-al-Hadi with his mother Sumaneh in Medina while his wife accompanied him to Baghdad. They lived there for a year before al-Jawad's wife, according to some sources, poisoned him, at the urging of the new Caliph Al-Mu'tasim.

As Thomas LaMarre states, \\"Anime fans become familiar with a whole range of female figures that are either not really human (robots, aliens, deities, animals), or that possess extra-human powers of some kind or another (from cyborg enhancements to magical or psychic abilities), which take them beyond the merely human woman.\\" Magical girlfriends can be one or many in a single series (always attached to the male lead). Because of the tendency for rivals to appear even when there is one female lead and because of the unnatural gender balance among the cast, magical girlfriend comedies are often conflated with harem comedies. A good example of this conflation is Oh My Goddess!Fujishima, Kosuke. Oh My Goddess! (manga, unflopped) Volume 3. p. 187 which is \\"one of the prototypical 'harem' titles\\" despite the short-lived nature of most of the romantic rivalries. History Magical girlfriends initially derived from the US television series Bewitched, which was dubbed for the Japanese market. Sally the Witch was the first anime series inspired by Bewitched, leading to the popularity of magical girls in Japanese anime. Genre characteristics Often series in the genre start with the male lead encountering the female lead either by pure chance or by an unusual event, after which the female lead somehow becomes bound or otherwise dependent upon him, often forcing a situation of cohabitation. In many cases, this situation is repeated with other characters (Tenchi Muyo!), overlapping with the harem genre. However, the male lead is often inexperienced with women despite typically being a \\"nice guy\\". This situation often prevents the relationship from advancing beyond a platonic level throughout most of the series, as an ideal girlfriend doesn't come on strong herself and is generally passive in the relationship. In parodies, the character may be \\"too young\\" (i.e. Nakahito Kagura in Steel Angel Kurumi; Negi Springfield in Mahou Sensei Negima!) or otherwise have a more rational, ambivalent attitude towards women. A famous early reversal of the cliche occurs with the overtly lecherous Ataru Moroboshi of Urusei Yatsura, who is simply uninterested in monogamous relationships despite the fact few women besides his romantically-aggressive alien girlfriend find him attractive. Another feature is that soon after the male and female leads begin to live together, other (usually female) characters from the female (or male) lead's origin appear (friends, siblings, relatives, rivals or even enemies), either becoming frequent visitors, cohabitors, or generally causing a disruption, or even moving in with the lead couple. Sometimes a character from the male lead's origin will appear. Examples include Ai Yori Aoshi, where Kaoru's half-brother tries to take Aoi for himself, and Omamori Himari, where demonslayer Kuesu Jinguuji appears in volume 3 to claim Yuuto Amakawa as her betrothed. Even when there is one female lead, various rivals always threaten the relationship between the lead characters, often creating complicated \\"love polygons\\". These can vary from being from mundane characters such as men who fight for the affection of the female (and rarely male) lead, or rivals from the female lead's origins. The romantic relationship(s) in magical girlfriend comedies tend to remain static and platonic throughout the series. Commonly episodes involve some sort of superficial threat to the static nature of the relationship (which could, and often is, the male lead or the girlfriends' desire to get closer), which is almost always resolved in some way that doesn't fundamentally alter that relationship. Action plotlines are often introduced through some sort of threat from the magical girlfriend's origins or through other means. If the romantic relationship(s) do move, it is very slow. The \\"ideal woman\\" personality, or yamato nadeshiko Many magical girlfriends are considered by both fans and critics of the genre to be idealizations of woman-kind. This model of the ideal Japanese woman, the yamato nadeshiko, is similar to that found in The Tale of Genji. Ideal girlfriends are not necessarily magical in nature. Some \\"ideal\\" magical girlfriends may seem weak and emotionally needy, while others may possess a godly power stemming from their feminine traits. Ideal women have absolute dedication to whatever work they do and for whomever they have great affection, although depending on the character's actual talents this can make for anything from 'quite capable' to 'well-meaning klutz'. They usually have calm, gentle and demure personalities. They generally suppress selfish desires in favor of desiring good for others. Ideal women are always naive or innocent, sometimes explained by the girlfriend's origins which do not allow for many experiences with mainstream life. Paradoxically, other characters of the girlfriend's origin tend not to be as naive (e.g. Belldandy of Oh My Goddess! is more naive than even her kid sister). Ideal women are emotionally insightful, seeing the good in others when most wouldn't and forgiving their shortcomings. Ideal women are examples of moe girls in manga and anime. As such, ideal girlfriends are not overly independent. They are proper Japanese women who typically will not initiate romantic action themselves, except in a delicate or indirect manner. However, numerous characters are so innocent as to not understand the nature of their actions. Independence and aggression (especially in sexual matters) is a trait of parodies of the ideal girlfriend such as Lum Invader in Urusei Yatsura, Kurumi in Steel Angel Kurumi or Hazuki in Tsukuyomi -Moon Phase-. Parodies of the ideal woman are often selfish and become involved with the male lead because of their own selfish desires which are not (initially) shared by their mate. While the male lead usually has some sort of hold over his girlfriend (as \\"husband,\\" \\"fianc√©,\\" provider, contract holder, client, creator, master, or even owner) the parody of the ideal girlfriend either succeeds in inverting the power balance of relationship or simply reverses roles. Sh≈çjo artists have written another sort of parody of magical girlfriends. Sh≈çjo writers put more emphasis on the girl. Examples include Absolute Boyfriend, in which an ordinary girl gets a magical boyfriend, and Ultra Maniac, in which a Middle School girl meets and becomes best friends with a magical girlfriend; followed by their misadventures at finding boyfriends. Susan J. Napier has described the popularity of the ideal magical girlfriend, for example, Belldandy and Ai to be a backlash against the \\"yellow cab\\" social phenomenon, where some Japanese women were seeking out sexual relationships with non-Japanese men.

A.E. Sparrow of IGN, in reviewing Mamotte Shugogetten, also relates magical girlfriends shows to their western counterparts: > \\"She's completely devoted to protecting her new \\"master\\" from any > misfortune, utterly oblivious to the ways of the modern world, and (in cute > girl manga terms) a total knockout. If you're not completely immersed in the > world of manga yet, think \\"I Dream of Jeannie\\". If you are, then think \\"Oh! > My Goddess!\\". Either one works if you're looking for a comparison.\\" Examples of magical girlfriend in Western media include: Lisa from Weird Science, \\"Angel\\" in Date with an Angel, and Madison from Splash. For science fiction, girlfriends can also be labelled as \\"algorithm-defined fantasy girl\\" and range from robots such as Joi in Blade Runner 2049 and Ava in Ex Machina to artificial intelligence systems such as Samantha in Her.

It is about 7 miles west of the UCLA campus. History In 1911, film director Thomas Ince created his Western film factory, \\"Inceville\\", which at its peak employed nearly 600 people. A decade later, the Rev. Charles H. Scott and the Southern California Methodist Episcopal Church bought the land; in 1922, Scott founded Pacific Palisades, envisioning an elaborate religious-intellectual commune. Believers snapped up choice lots and lived in tents during construction. By 1925, the Palisades had 100 homes. In one subdivision, streets were named for Methodist missionaries. The tents eventually were replaced by cabins, then by bungalows, and ultimately by multimillion-dollar homes. The climate of the area was a big selling point. Temperatures are much cooler than inland Los Angeles during summer, but usually sunnier and less foggy than areas south along the coast (e.g. Santa Monica). During their exile from Nazi Germany in the 1930s and 40s, many German and Austrian intellectuals and artists associated with the Exilliteratur settled in Pacific Palisades, including Thomas Mann and his wife Katia Mann (at 1550 San Remo Drive),David Laskin (October 3, 2008), When Weimar Luminaries Went West Coast New York Times. Lion Feuchtwanger, Theodor W. Adorno, Vicki Baum, Oskar Homolka and Emil Ludwig. Villa Aurora on Paseo Miramar, the Spanish colonial home of Feuchtwanger and his wife, Marta, became the focal point of the expatriate community, which was nicknamed \\"Weimar by the Sea\\".Finn-Olaf Jonas (November 25, 2007), A Scenic Los Angeles Enclave, Without Glitter New York Times. For many decades there was a virtual ban on drinking alcohol in the district, and a Chinese restaurant, House of Lee, held the only liquor license. The Methodist Church created a Chautauqua Conference Grounds in Temescal Canyon. The Presbyterian Synod purchased the property in 1943 and used it as a private retreat center until the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy purchased the property in 1994 to become Temescal Gateway Park. Geography=Neighborhoods * The Via Bluffs and The Huntington Palisades are the neighborhoods that border the \\"village\\" proper to the south of Sunset Boulevard, overlooking the ocean. The Via Mesa is located between Temescal Canyon on the west and Potrero Canyon on the east; the Huntington Palisades is located between Potrero Canyon on the west and Chautauqua Boulevard on the east. Both of these neighborhoods are within walking distance to The Village and sit upon high bluffs that look out over the Pacific Ocean. This area is home to the largest park of the Palisades: the 117-acre Palisades Park which has four baseball diamonds, eight tennis courts, two indoor basketball courts, a hockey rink, dog parks, and a number of playgrounds. * The El Medio Bluffs is located south of Sunset Boulevard beginning about a quarter mile west of The Village, across Temescal Canyon ‚Äì just past Palisades Charter High School. The El Medio Mesa extends for a long distance from Temescal Canyon all the way to where Sunset Boulevard meets the Pacific Coast Highway. As with The Via Bluffs and The Huntington Palisades, The El Medio Bluffs are located on a high ridge overlooking the Pacific Ocean. * Castellammare is located along Pacific Coast Highway on small bluffs much closer to sea-level, north of where Sunset Boulevard meets PCH. This is the home of the Getty Villa and the narrow, winding streets in this neighborhood have Italian names and ocean breezes. * Palisades Highlands is a community near the end of Sunset Blvd., bordering Topanga, about five minutes away from the center of Pacific Palisades (The Village). The Highlands could almost be considered its own separate community high up the hill overlooking the ocean, up Palisades Drive. * Rustic Canyon is the neighborhood east of Chautauqua Boulevard that dips into Santa Monica Canyon and includes the Will Rogers State Historic Park. The neighborhood features post-war homes located on the former polo field of The Uplifters, the original site of The Uplifters clubhouse (now a city park), and \\"cabins\\" developed as second homes and weekend retreats. This area is also known as Uplifter's Ranch. Finishing hole at Riviera Country Club * The Riviera is a Palisades neighborhood located approximately two miles east of the community's Village and features The Riviera Country Club, a country club, and streets named after various locations in the French and Italian Riviera. The neighborhood is divided into north and south sections by Sunset Boulevard. It borders Santa Monica and Brentwood. The Riviera Country Club hosts the Genesis Open on the PGA Tour in February (the tournament has been previously known as the Northern Trust Open and Nissan Open and was originally the \\"Los Angeles Open\\"). Riviera has hosted three major championships: the U.S. Open in 1948 and the PGA Championship in 1983 and 1995. Ben Hogan won three times in less than 18 months at the course (1947 and 1948 L.A.

He remained in Medina teaching until the age of 30 when he was summoned to Samarra by the Abbasid caliph Al-Mutawakkil. There he was treated roughly by the caliph and his successors until, according to Shiite accounts, he was poisoned through intrigue of Al-Mu'tazz the Abbasid caliph, in 254/868, and was buried in Samarra. He is commonly referred to by the title al-Hadi (the one who shows right path) and Alƒ´ an-Naqƒ´. Birth and early life According to the most accurate reports he was born in 828 in a village near Medina called Surayya () to the ninth Shia Imam, Muhammad al-Taqi, (also known as Imam Muhammad al-Jawad), and Lady SamƒÅnah or Susan, who was originally a Berber (from Northwest Africa). His father bestowed upon him the surname Abul- Hasan, after the surnames given to his grandfather Ali al-Ridha and his great grandfather Musa al-Kadhim. To differentiate between these three Abul Hasan, narrators usually call Musa al-Kadhim, abul Hasan the first, call Ali al- Ridha, Abul Hasan the second and call al-Hadi Abul Hasan the third. Imamate After his father's death in 835, Ali al-Hadi assumed the official role of Imamate at the age of 7 or 8. The followers of his father were in agreement on his Imamate, except for a minor group who gathered around his younger brother Musa who when dissociated himself from them, they turned to al-Hadi. Historians have mentioned that after his father's assassination at the will of Al-Mu'tasim, the Abbasid caliph ordered Umar bin al-Faraj to find a teacher in Medina for the young Imam (that must be one of the enemies of the Ahlul Bayt) in order to prevent Shiites from meeting him. He found al-Junaydi for this task, however, al-Junaydi often reported on the Imam's intelligence saying that the boy would provide perspectives on literature and understanding of the Quran and the revelations within. Al-Junaydi, impressed by him, concluded that it could only be by divine causes that the boy could be so knowledgeable, as a result, he dropped the animosity he had held towards the family of the prophet. Al-Askari Mosque before the 2006 bombing Throughout the later years of his Imamate, which coincided with the eight remaining years of the caliphate of Al-Mansur, and five years of the caliphate of next caliph Al- Wathiq, he lived peacefully in Medina engaging himself in teaching a large number of pupils mostly from Iraq, Persia, and Egypt. later on, however, the new Caliph, Al-Mutawakkil, became suspicious of the young Imam and decided to watch him more closely. Summoning to Sammara After Al-Mutawakkil came to throne, the governor of Medina,  øAbdallƒÅh ibn Mo·∏•ammad, wrote the caliph warning him about the activity of al-Hadi saying that he was given money with which he could buy weapons that could be used to revolt against the Caliph. When al-Hadi learned of what Abdullah bin Muhammad had told the caliph, he sent a letter to Mutawakkil defending himself against the accusations and complained about the governor. Apparently convinced of the harmless piousness of al-Hadi, Motawakkel wrote back to al-Hadi stating that he had deposed the governor. He nevertheless asked the Imam to come to Samarra (a military camp, not far from Baghdad which was the capital of Abbasids at the time). At the same time, Mutawakkil ordered Yahya ibn Harthama, the captain of the guard, to go to Medina both to investigate Abdullah's claims and to bring al-Hadi to Samarra. Yahya then searched the Imam's house and found nothing more than copies of the Quran and other religious books. It is said that when the imam approached Baghdad many people gathered to see him. The governor of the city himself rode out of the city to welcome him and stayed a part of night with him. At Sammera, however, the caliph did not immediately receive him, though assigned a house for his staying. Even though Mutawakkil had no reason to be suspicious of al-Hadi, he insisted that he stay in Samarra under house arrest. According to Madelung, he was still able to move in the city and communicate with his followers, giving them instructions or receiving through them the annual Khums (the financial contributions of the faithful). =Narration= Yahya ibn Harthama, the captain of the guard, is narrated to have reported his experience as follows: \\"The Caliph Mutawakkel sent me to Medina with orders to bring Ali ibn Muhammad to answer certain accusations that had been made against him. When I arrived, his household made such wailing and lamentation as I had never heard. I tried to quiet them and assured them that I had received no orders to do him any harm. And when I searched the house where he lived, I found only a Quran, books of prayer and such things. So while I took him away, I offered him my services and showed him very high respect. But one day on the journey, when the sky was clear and the sun just rising, Ali put on a cloak when he mounted his horse and knotted the animal's tail. I was surprised at this, but it was only a little while afterwards that a cloud came up and there was a regular torrent of rain. Then Ali turned to me and said, I know that you did not understand that you saw me do, and that you imagine that I have had some unusual knowledge of this affair. It is not, however, as you supposed, but as I was brought up in a desert, I know the winds that come before rain. This morning the wind blew which does not deceive, and I noticed the odor of rain and so prepared for it. On our arrival in Baghdad, our first visit was to Ishak ibn Ibrahim, of the family of Tahir, who was the governor of the city. He said to me, O Abu Yahya, this man (Ali) is a descendant of the Apostle of God. You know Mutawakkil, and have influence with him, but if you urge him to kill this man, the Prophet, himself will be your enemy. I replied that I saw nothing in the conduct of Ali except what was altogether praiseworthy. I went on to Samarra, where I saw Wasif, the Turk, for I was one of his intimate friends. I swear before God, he said to me, if a single hair of the head of this man falls, I will myself demand satisfaction. I was somewhat surprised at the attitude taken by these men, and when I informed Mutawakkil of what I had heard in praise of the Imam, he gave him a handsome present and treated him with all sorts of honor.\\" Noble Arguments Al-Hadi contributed to the books of argumentation that were compiled by Shiite scholars among which was a theological treatise on human Free Will and some other short texts and statements ascribed to al-Hadi are quoted by Ab≈´ Mu·∏•ammad al-·∏§asan ibn  ªAlƒ´ ibn al-·∏§usayn ibn Shu ªbah al-HarrƒÅnƒ´. With a Hashemite clan member It is said that once a scholar came in where al-Hadi had a meeting with masters of Hashemite (the clan prophet Muhammad had belonged to). Al-Hadi seated the scholar beside himself and treated him with great respect. The Hashemite protested saying: \\"why do you prefer him to the masters of Banu Hashim?‚Äô Al-Hadi said: \\"Beware to be from those whom God has said about, Have you not considered those who are given a portion of the Book? They are invited to the Book of God that it might decide between them, then a part of them turn back and they withdraw. Do you accept the Book of God as a judge?\\" asked al-Hadi. They all said, \\"O son of the messenger of God, we do.\\" Then al-Hadi tried to prove his stance by saying, \\"Has God not said God will exalt those of you who believe, and those who are given knowledge, in high degrees? God does not accept for a knowledgeable believer but to be preferred to an unknowledgeable believer, just as He wants a believer to be preferred to an unbeliever. God has said, God will exalt those of you who believe and those who are given knowledge, in high degrees. Has He said, God will exalt those, who are given honor of lineage, in high degrees? God has said, Are those who know and those who do not know alike? Then, how do you deny my honoring him for what God has honored him?\\" With ibn as-Sikkit  On one occasion, al- Mutawakkil organized a conference to be held in his palace with theologians and jurisprudents he had invited. He had asked Ya'qub ibn Isaak known as ibn as-Sikkit to ask al-Hadi the questions that he didn't think the Imam could answer. One of the questions was that why God had sent Moses with the rod and white hand, sent Jesus with the healing of the blind and leprous and giving life to the dead, and sent Muhammad with the Quran and sword? Al-Hadi's answer goes as follows: \\"Allah sent Moses with the rod and white hand in a time where the predominant thing among people was magic. Therefore, Moses came to them with that and defeated their magic, dazed them, and proved authority over them. And Allah sent Jesus Christ with the healing of the blind and leprous and the giving of life to the dead by the will of Allah in a time where the predominant thing among people was medicine. Therefore, Jesus Christ came to them with that and defeated and dazed them. And Allah sent Muhammad with the Quran and sword in a time where the predominant things among people were sword and poetry. Therefore, Muhammad came to them with the Quran and sword and dazed their poetry, defeated their sword, and proved authority over them.\\" With Yahya ibn Aktham Yahya bin Aktham was another scholar who was invited to try the imam. It is said that after al-Hadi's answer to Yahya's questions, he turned to al-Mutawakkil and advised him saying, \\"We do not like you to ask this man about anything after my questions to him ‚Ä¶ In showing his knowledge there will be strengthening to Rafida (the Shiite).\\" One of the questions is the following: \\"Tell me why Ali (the first Shiite Imam) killed the people of (the battle of) Siffin ‚Ä¶whether they were attacking or fleeing and he finished off the wounded, but on the day of al-Jamal (Battle of the Camel) he did not ... Rather, he said, Whoever keeps to his house will be safe. Why did he do that? If the first decision was right, so the second would be wrong.\\" Al-Hadi replied: \\"The Imam of the people of the Battle of the Camel was killed and they had no leader to refer to. They went back to their homes without fighting, deceiving, or spying. They were satisfied (after the defeat) not to fight any further. But the people of Siffin belonged to a prepared company with a leader who supplied them with spears, armor, and swords, caring for them, giving them good gifts, preparing great monies for them, visiting their sick, curing their wounded, giving sumpters to their footers, helping their needy, and returning them to the fight‚Ä¶\\" Theological argumentations Whether or not it was possible to see God, was one of the common issues discussed at the time of al-Hadi who believed it was impossible to see Him. He argued that \\"seeing is not possible if there is no air (space) between the seer and the seen thing through which sight goes through. If there is no air and no light between the seer and the seen thing, there will be no sight. When the seer equals the seen thing in the cause of sight between them, sight takes place, but those who compare the seer (man) to Allah, they are mistaken because they liken Allah to man‚Ä¶for effects must relate to causes.\\" Another issue that the Imam dealt with was the belief that God has a body (the embodiment of God). Al-Hadi chastised those who believed it and stated that, \\"He, who claims that Allah is a body, is not from us, and we are free from him in this world and the after-world...body (substance) is created, and it is Allah Who has created and embodied it.\\" To attribute Allah with embodiment is to characterize Him with need and to limit Him to a body. Essentially, it is wrong to equate God with created things due to His nature as our creator. Ali al-Hadi also expressed strong feelings about the impossibility of describing God's Essence. The rationale behind his objection was that God is so great that, as humans, we are incapable of conceiving how truly amazing He is, and that the only one that can truly describe God is God Himself. He then uses this as a segue into the belief that true Muslims, the Prophet, and the infallible imams cannot be described either, because their obedience to God draws them closer to the Essence of God, and descriptions cannot wholly encompass their virtuous qualities that result from submitting to God. Humiliating the Imam and al-Mutawakkel's death It is said that Mutawakkil showed courtesy toward the imam in Samarra, and even preferred his judgment to other Faqihs; in the same time however, he troubled and even tried to kill the Imam. Mutawakkel was envious of the Imam because the Imam's position was exalted among the public. He wanted to belittle the Imam. His vizier counseled him, recommending him to give up, because it would make the public blame and criticize him. But he paid no attention to his vizier.Qarashi2007p.416 To try to humiliate the Imam, Mutawakkil ordered that the Imam along with the officials and notables, (so that it wouldn't look like the act was intended for the imam) dismount and travel on foot during a hot summer day while the caliph remained mounted on his horse. Zuraqa the chamberlain of al-Mutawakkil has narrated that he saw the Imam who had almost suffered a heat stroke, was breathing and sweating hard, so he approached him to calm him down by saying \\"Your cousin (Mutawakkil) did not intend to hurt you particularly.\\" Al-Hadi looked at him and said \\"Stop that!\\" And then recited this Quranic verse, Enjoy yourselves in your abode for three days, that is a promise not to be belied. The promise here refers to the punishment which is mentioned in the previous verse for unjust people. Zuraqa related that he had a Shiite teacher who had been among his intimate friends. Zuraqa says \\"when I went home, I sent for him. When he came to me, I told him about what I heard from the Imam. He changed color and said to me, Be careful and store all what you have! Al- Mutawakkil shall die or be killed after three days. I was affected by his speech and asked him to leave. Then I thought with myself and said that it would not harm me to take precautions. If something like that happened, I would have taken my precaution, and if not, I would lose nothing. I went to the house of al-Mutawakkil and took all my money. I deposited them with one of my acquaintances.\\" Within three days of that event, plotters assassinated the caliph; one of the assassins was actually his son, al-Muntasir. Another account of this prediction stated that the Imam was imprisoned by the caliph, and it was that act which provoked the Imam to foretell of his death. Character Ali al-Hadi was given a vast number of descriptive names throughout his life, among which al-Naqi (The Pure), al-Hadi (The Guide) were the most famous. However al-Askari (The Militant; due to the town he had to live in was a military camp), Faqƒ´h (Jurist), al-Aalim (The Knowledgeable) and At-Tayyib (The Generous, The Kind-Hearted, The Good-Natured...) were also among his epithets. It is said that al-Hadi exhibited extreme generosity, though himself at times had no money to pay with either. An example of which is an account that describes how a nomadic man came to the Imam to tell him of how he was heavily in debt and in need of assistance. Al-Hadi, being short of money himself, gave the man a note saying that he was in debt to the nomad, and instructed him to meet the Imam in a place where he had a meeting, and to insist that the Imam pay back the recorded debt. The nomad did as he was told, and the Imam apologized to the nomad in front of those at the meeting for being incapable of paying him back. The officials at the meeting reported the Imam's debt to the caliph, al-Mutawakkil, who then sent the Imam 30,000 dirhams, with which he then presented to the nomad. In Twelver Shiism, he is described as being endowed with the knowledge of the languages of the Persians, Slavs, Indians and Nabataeans in addition to foreknowing unexpected storms and as accurately prophesying other events. In the presence of al- Mutawakkil, he unmasked a woman falsely claiming to be Zaynab, daughter of Ali, by descending into a lion's cage in order to prove that lions do not harm true descendants of Ali (a similar miracle is attributed to his great- grandfather, Musa al-Kadhim). Al-Hadi's miracles made some people to believe the claim of some Heretics like Ibn Hasakah who preached to people that al- Hadi was in fact God, and that they themselves were prophets sent by the imam to guide the Muslims. It is quoted from al-Hadi as denying them and instructing people about the extremists saying \\"Desert them! May Allah curse them. Block them up into narrow passages and if you find any of them, split his head with stone!\\" Death Al-Askari Mosque in Samarra, Iraq destroyed by bombings twice in 2006‚Äì2007 Al-Hadi was poisoned by an agent of Al-Mu'tazz, who was the Abbasid leader of the time, and died in the year 254 of the Islamic calendar (868 CE). His son Hasan al-Askari became the Imam after him. The tomb of al-Hadi, which became also the tomb of his son Hasan al-Askari afterwards, is an important place of Shiite pilgrimage. It was bombed in February 2006 and badly damaged. Another attack was executed on 13 June 2007, which led to the destruction of the two minarets of the shrine. Authorities in Iraq said Al Qaeda was responsible for the attack.Graham Bowley (13 June 2007). \\"Minarets on Shiite Shrine in Iraq Destroyed in Attack\\". New York Times. Al-Hadi's son Ab≈´ Jafar Muhammad, is said to had died before his father in Samarra. His other sons were Hasan and Ja'far, from whom Hasan became the next Imam. According to some sources and pedigrees belonged to Naqvis, however, four more sons namely Hussain, Abdullah, Zaid, and Mussa are attributed to the tenth Imam. Besides Hasan al-Askari, three sons, Hussain, Muhammad, and Jafar, as well as one daughter, Ailia, from different wives have been mentioned by various biographic scholars, including Shaikh Mufeed. Issues of these sons are traceable in different pedigree books published by researchers from time to time.

The legs in turn support what appears as an oversize vertically mounted wooden pizza box. This is a cabinet a few inches thick, with barely enough space in it for the raised desktop surface and a few pens and sheets of paper disposed vertically. It is also called a \\"Billet doux\\". The secretaire en portefeuille is much like a fall front desk which has been reduced in depth to a bare minimum. Like the fall front desk and the secretary desk the secretaire en portefeuille's desktop lifts up to cover internal areas and must thus be cleared of all work before closing up. By its mobile nature and its relatively light weight it was sometimes used as a fire screen desk. It was also sometimes known by that name. Its name comes from the French word for wallet: portefeuille. This is probably because it has the same proportions as many kinds of wallets and it opens up a bit like some of them. Modern day cabinet makers and furniture designers have sometimes created contemporary versions of the secretaire en portefeuille, eschewing the florid designs of the antique ones.

They are key figures in DC's \\"Mystery\\" line of the late 1960s and 1970s, which became the mature-readers imprint, Vertigo, in 1993. Publication history Originally, Cain and Abel were the respective \\"hosts\\" of the EC-style horror comic anthologies House of Mystery and House of Secrets, which ran from the 1950s through the early 1980s. During the 1970s, they also co-hosted (along with Eve) the horror/humor anthology Plop! Both comics had been running Dial H for Hero and Eclipso, respectively, before the introduction of the new host characters. Cain, \\"the Able Care- Taker\\", created by Bob Haney, Jack Sparling and Joe Orlando, first appeared in The House of Mystery #175 (July‚ÄìAugust 1968), modeled on writer Len Wein, who was new to the field.Mark Waid. Millennium Edition: House of Mystery #1 (Sept. 2000), inside back cover A photograph of Wein as Cain can be found in Elvira's House of Mystery #4. Abel, created by Mark Hanerfeld, Bill Draut, and Joe Orlando, first appeared in DC Special #4 (July‚ÄìSeptember 1969), and began hosting The House of Secrets with #81 (August‚ÄìSeptember 1969). Hanerfeld was the model for Abel, and he also appeared in a photograph in Elvira's House of Mystery #4.Tweet from Len Wein, March 6, 2012 On the letters page of Weird Mystery Tales #3 (November 1972), Destiny stated that Cain, Abel, and Eve were not the same characters as their biblical counterparts, whom Destiny said he found much more pleasant. Cain, Eve, and to a lesser extent, Abel, subsequently taunt Destiny for being dull. House of Mystery was canceled in 1983. The final issue showed Cain in front of the House for sale, with his bags packed, and Gregory, his pet gargoyle, behind him. The cover of Vertigo's mostly-reprint Welcome Back to the House of Mystery showed him returning with Abel and Gregory. The House of Secrets and The Witching Hour were eventually merged with The Unexpected and canceled around the same time. Cain then became a supporting character in Blue Devil, with Abel and Gregory making occasional appearances as well. Fictional character biography=House of Mystery/Secrets Cain told tales of various people who boarded at the House of Mystery. Abel stammeringly took abuse from both Cain and the House of Secrets itself, and had an \\"imaginary\\" (it was always rendered in quotes) girlfriend named Goldie, who berated him too. In the early issues, Abel told the stories directly to Goldie, although he always appeared to be alone. He said she was a ghost. Cain is a thin, long-limbed man with an angular, drawn face, glasses, a tufty beard, and hair drawn into two points above his ears. Cain is often mean to Abel, but he is jovial and a friendly storyteller to children and did everything he could to help Superman when the need once arose; however, he has no qualms trapping innocent people inside his television setHouse of Mystery #213 and he was once employed by a vicious mink furrier.House of Mystery #254 Abel is a nervous, stammering, kind-hearted man. Abel also has a tufty beard and hair that comes to points above his ears, though his hair is black rather than brown. He is shorter and fatter than Cain, with a more open face. It is eventually stated (in Sandman #40) that the only time he doesn't stutter is when he is telling a story, and this was characteristic of his earlier appearances. Cain owns a large green draconian gargoyle named Gregory, who first appeared (as a baby) in House of Mystery #175, apparently the offspring of enchanted sculptures who come to the house for a French sculptor who murdered the artist who designed them. Gregory grew to maturity over the course of the series and continued to appear in Sandman stories. Gregory ate the Earth-1 counterparts of writer Paul Kupperberg and editor Jack C. Harris.House of Mystery #254 Cain also used to have a black cat named Oskar, who did not get along with Gregory. Abel moved in with Cain in the House of Mystery shortly before DC Special #4, which Cain states is a temporary situation until the House of Secrets is transported (which occurred in House of Secrets #81, which appeared one month later). Their ages are vague, but Abel presents a story that he claims to have heard from Cain, who scared him with it as a child in 1957.DC Special #4, pp 44 and 48 The story in question originally appeared in Tales of the Unexpected #17 (September 1957). In the final issue of The House of Mystery, Karen Berger, whom Cain first met in issue #292‚Äîthe first issue she edited for DC‚Äîarrives as an unexpected guest at Cain's birthday party, takes him through a secret door that leads to the DC offices, and tells him that his series has been canceled and that he is too old-fashioned. The House is torn down, and Cain metafictionally analyzes his own existence as a character in a comic book.House of Mystery #321 In 1985, the characters were revived by writer Alan Moore, who introduced them into his Swamp Thing series in the issue #33, retelling the Swamp Thing's original origin story as depicted in a 1971 issue of House of Secrets. Cain kills Abel for revealing a secret (the difference between a mystery and a secret is that a mystery can be shared and still remains a mystery) and declares to Abby Holland, \\"I invented murder!\\" In Blue Devil #20 (January 1986), Cain is the caretaker of \\"The House of Weirdness\\" until Blue Devil moves in, and discovers that Abel is there, too. He states that the California mansion is owned by \\"a publishing company back East\\". During the Crisis, although not mentioned in that series, Elvira stumbled onto the House of Mystery, which charged her to find Cain, who had disappeared. Metropolis can be seen through a window in the garage of the House of Weirdness.Blue Devil #21 Cain and Blue Devil can be seen peering at Elvira in Elvira's House of Mystery.Elvira's House of Mystery #1 Cain and Abel reappeared in Swamp Thing #49-50, where they acted as observers and commentators on a fierce battle in Hell. They were depicted together in Abel's first appearance, and they parted to their respective Houses at the end of the story, the House of Secrets having been recently moved, with Cain promising things not to go the way they happened before. Although Cain would abuse Abel, he was not shown killing him until Swamp Thing vol. 2 #33. More often than not, though, they did not appear together, and Cain directed more of his taunts at the reader, while Abel tried to reassure Goldie or the reader. Indeed, in The House of Mystery #257 (April 1978), an asylum escapee, \\"Killer\\" Cowan, kills six people on Christmas Eve, storming into the House of Mystery wearing a Santa Claus suit and demands Cain to keep him occupied by entertaining him with stories. Cain protests that he does not want to entertain someone who ruins all that the holiday stands for. Abel is said to be a voyeur in Secrets of Sinister House #14, and shown to be such in The Sandman #60. Sandman In Gaiman's Sandman universe, it is implied by dialogue between Lucifer and Cain (who had been sent by Dream as a messenger due to his invulnerability) that the biblical Cain and Abel came to live in the Dreaming at Dream's invitation. To support this, Lucifer quotes the verse in the Bible which says that Cain was sent to live in the Land of Nod. This could be a post-Crisis retcon, however, as Destiny claimed in Weird Mystery Tales #3 that they were not the same as the Biblical Cain and Abel. The nature of reality in the Dreaming is often multiple and when Cain, Abel, and Eve are telling young Daniel Hall three stories, Cain objects to Abel's \\"Lil' Endless\\" style retelling of their origin claiming that \\"... they (the Endless) didn't even look remotely human, none of us did!\\" Abel later responds to Matthew the Raven's query about whether they are their biblical namesakes or not by stating; \\"...oh, none of this happened on Earth...\\" before being interrupted by Cain. Eve also states that she is not Cain's mother to which Cain replies, \\"You're everyone's mother\\".The Sandman (vol. 2) #40 This sequence of events would seem to indicate that rather than being the actual literal beings Cain, Abel, and Eve the Dreaming's incarnation of them are closer to their archetypal roles of first murderer, first victim, and first mother. This is supported by several incidents when Cain or Abel have identified themselves as such and claimed that their cycle of murder and resurrection is punishment for their role in the first murder.Swamp Thing vol. 2 #33 This would also allow Joe Kubert's DC Comics adaptation of the Cain and Abel story from the Bible, in which he ignored their \\"Mystery\\" likenesses, to fit neatly into canon.Limited Collectors' Edition C-36 (The Most Spectacular Stories Ever Told... From The Bible) (June‚ÄìJuly 1975) Cain frequently kills Abel in a kind of macabre form of obsessive-compulsive disorder, re-enacting the first murder. In the Dreaming, Abel's death is impermanent, and he seems to recover after a few hours. Cain seems unable to control his frequent murders of Abel, and occasionally expresses remorse over them; there is a genuine bond between the two, beneath the surface contempt. Abel remains dedicated to Cain, and frequently dreams of a more harmonious relationship between the two. In turn, in the graphic novel The Sandman: The Wake, Cain is so distraught when Abel is murdered permanently by The Kindly Ones, he sinks into a rambling mess when asking the new Dream to restore him. In preparation for the funeral services for the deceased Dream, Cain's anger boils over yet again when Abel reveals a secret, but he is calmed by a reprimand and restrained from murdering Abel. He displays a contract, renewed in 1989 (the year The Sandman began) that states that only he is allowed to kill Abel, because Abel can resurrect only when Cain kills him. In the first appearance of the characters in Sandman, issue #2, Cain gives Abel an egg that soon hatches into another gargoyle, a small golden one. Abel is delighted and names the gargoyle \\"Irving\\", but Cain forcefully insists that the names of gargoyles must always begin with a \\"G.\\" When Abel resists, Cain murders him, and after Abel revives he renames the gargoyle \\"Goldie\\", after a friend of his who \\"went away\\". The main function of Cain and Abel throughout The Sandman is as comic relief. However, the two play significant (though not key) roles at several points in the series; it is they who take Morpheus in until his strength is restored following his 72-year-long imprisonment. In the fourth story arc, Season of Mists, Cain is sent to Hell to give a message to Lucifer because the Mark of Cain protects him. Those who would harm Cain would have the full wrath of God visited upon them. Lucifer merely finds this funny, since he is already in Hell. Cain and Abel also aid The Corinthian with the child Daniel during The Kindly Ones, the penultimate story arc of the series. They also appear with Morpheus in The Books of Magic (vol. 1) #3. Recent history Recently, both Cain and Abel have appeared in the new House of Mystery title. Abel appeared in the missing House of Mystery with Goldie, claiming to be on a secret mission to retrieve the various nightmares that were still in the house when it vanished. Meanwhile, Cain, under the guise of a mysterious coachman, plotted with various groups to retake the House of Mystery, which he saw as his rightful property. Eventually, Cain was able to broker a deal to become the co-manager of the House of Mystery's current incarnation as a bar, and both he and Abel have become regular members of the series' cast. In other media=Television * Cain appears in the Justice League Action episode \\"Trick or Threat\\", voiced by Trevor Devall. He is the owner of the House of Mystery, a house filled with magical artifacts, capable of disappearing, and acts as the narrator of the episode. He tells the viewers of the time when Klarion the Witch Boy turned Batman, Zatanna, Doctor Fate, and John Constantine into children on Halloween so that he could lure them into the House of Mystery and steal the Helmet of Fate. * Tom Welling portrays Cain in the TV series Lucifer. At the start of season 3, he goes by Lt. Marcus Pierce, but he is later to be revealed as Cain. Lucifer, looking to help him find a way to die, assists Cain throughout the season, but eventually kills him in the end after his mark is removed. Abel appeared in the episode \\"Infernal Guinea Pig\\", portrayed by Lauren Lapkus. Miscellaneous * Cain and Abel also have a one-page cameo in The Batman Adventures #5 as wardens of Arkham, although this may be a hallucination of Dr. Crane. * Cain and Abel appears in All-New Batman: The Brave and the Bold #12 based on the TV show.

The film, shown in a documentary-like style, centers around pathologist Francis B. Gr√∂ss, played by actor Michael Carr, who presents the viewer with a variety of footage showing different ways of death, from a variety of sources. Plot Pathologist Francis B. Gr√∂ss states to the viewer that he has become interested with the transitional periods of life and death thanks to a recurring dream. He has accrued footage from several parts of the world in an effort to better understand and study the many \\"faces of death\\". In Mexico, Gr√∂ss has captured the mummified corpses of the deceased inhabitants of Guanajuato, as well as video of a dog fight. He next examines the natural predators of the Amazon rainforest and the ways in which they kill their prey. Footage of a live monkey being killed and its brain being eaten by guests of a banquet is also shown. A man is killed by an alligator, an act that Gr√∂ss calls a \\"violent retaliation from a creature who has suffered continued abuse from mankind\\". Gr√∂ss next narrates over recordings of human deaths, the only species who kill for \\"greed\\". Assassin Fran√ßois Jordan is interviewed, admitting that he kills solely for payment, not for \\"political\\" or \\"social value\\". However, Gr√∂ss next introduces \\"another type of killer\\", \\"the one who kills for no apparent reason\\". A gunfight ensues between an armed murderer and a SWAT team; Gr√∂ss questions if the man's actions were caused by society. Soon after, Gr√∂ss exhibits video footage of criminal Larry DeSilva being executed by electric chair. Footage of several more tragic accidents is shown, both animal and human. Gr√∂ss introduces his next topic, the idea that supernatural forces could exist. He meets with architect Joseph Binder, whose wife and son both died under tragic circumstances. He confides in the viewer that he believes that his deceased family remain as ghosts in his house and attempt to communicate with him. Gr√∂ss enlists the services of parapsychologists to verify this, and the team later manages to spot footprints and take photographs of the two apparitions. Binder later communicates with the spirits of his family through a medium, seemingly confirming the existence of life after death. Gr√∂ss remarks that after studying Binder's case, he has concluded even \\"when we die, it isn't really the end\\", \\"the soul in each of us remains a traveller forever\\". Gr√∂ss ends by questioning if death is \\"the end of the beginning or the beginning of the end\\" and leaves the footage that he has shown to the viewer's interpretation. Cast * Michael Carr as Francis B. Gr√∂ss * Samuel Berkowitz as victim * Mary Ellen Brighton as suicide victim * Thomas Noguchi as Chief Medical Examiner Coroner  Production  The movie was written and directed by John Alan Schwartz (credited as \\"Alan Black\\" for writing and as \\"Conan LeCilaire\\" for directing). Schwartz also took credit as second unit director, this time as \\"Johnny Getyerkokov\\". He also appears in one of the segments of the film, as the leader of the alleged flesh eating cult in San Francisco and has brief appearances in several other movies of this series. This movie features Michael Carr as the narrator, and 'creative consultant' called \\"Dr. Francis B. Gr√∂ss\\", whose voice is reminiscent of Leonard Nimoy in the popular TV show In Search of.... John Alan Schwartz has said that this movie's budget was $450,000 and there are estimates that it has grossed more than $35 million worldwide in theatrical releases, not including rentals. According to Schwartz, the scene in the film wherein a murderer is executed by electric chair was achieved with the use of a fake chair built in a friend's loft and toothpaste to emulate saliva. Electric \\"zapping\\" sounds were added in post-production.  Release  The movie is often billed as \\"Banned in 40+ Countries\\", but this claim is doubtful. Although several of the human death scenes and one depicting a monkey being killed are obvious fakes (with Allan A. Apone, make-up and special effects artists for the movie saying that about 40% of it is fake), some of the footage is genuine. In their book Killing for Culture, authors David Kerekes and David Slater note that the nadir of the movie is the inclusion of an extreme fatal accident; \\"the shattered remains of a cyclist are seen under a semi-tractor trailer. The camera pans long enough to capture paramedics scooping up blood clots, brain matter, and clumps of hair from the tarmac ‚Äì this incident is authentic and culled from newsreels.\\" Censorship Due to its graphic content, Faces of Death was banned and censored in many countries. In the United Kingdom, the film was prosecuted and added to the \\"video nasty\\" list, as it was deemed to violate the Obscene Publications Act 1959. In 2003, the film was allowed to be released on DVD in the UK, however cuts of 2 minutes and 19 seconds were required by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) to remove scenes of \\"fighting dogs and [a] monkey being cruelly beaten to death in accordance with Cinematograph Films (Animals Act) 1937 and BBFC Guidelines.\\" In 1980, Faces of Death was refused classification by the Australian Classification Board. Despite the ban, several bootleg VHS tapes were released in the country, and the film was unbanned and released uncut on DVD in 2007. However, its sequels remain banned in the country. The film was also banned in New Zealand in 1989. In Germany, the film was edited for a VHS release, with the removal of some graphic scenes.  Home media  Faces of Death and its sequels were released in boxset form on DVD by MPI Home Video in July 2002. Australian distributor Umbrella Entertainment released the film on DVD in 2007. In 2008, Gorgon Video released the movie on DVD and Blu-ray for its 30th anniversary. A brand new high definition transfer was made with new material and a 5.1 digital soundtrack. Legal case In June 1985, mathematics teacher Bart Schwarz showed the film to his class at Escondido High School in Escondido, California. Two of his students, Diane Feese and Sherry Forget, claimed they were so traumatised by the film that they both \\"developed an unnatural fear of dying and suffered emotional distress.\\" The families of the two girls sued the school district and received a combined $100,000 settlement ($57,500 for Feese and $42,500 for Forget). Schwarz was suspended from the school for 15 days without pay, but was not fired. Copycat crime In November 1986, fourteen-year-old Rod Matthews bludgeoned his classmate Shaun Ouilette to death with a baseball bat. The idea to kill Ouilette was supposedly conceived after Matthews viewed Faces of Death, curious what it would be like if he were to actually kill someone.  Reception  Despite the film's reputation, it was received relatively poorly by critics. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that Faces of Death received a 25% critical approval rating of 12 surveyed critics; the average rating was 2.55/10. Writing for the Kansas City Kansan, reviewer Steve Crum denounced the film as \\"crude, tasteless exploitation footage. Filmed carnage.\\" He ended his review urging the viewer to \\"be ashamed to watch this garbage.\\" Joshua Siebalt of Dread Central had mixed feelings about the film: \\"as a curiosity piece, Faces of Death is well worth a look, especially if you've not seen it in a very long time. As for its place in horror cinema history, well, that remains to be seen. As I said it's not a film that holds up very well at all, but considering how groundbreaking it was for its time, I doubt anyone will ever forget it. And while it is nice to have all of the myths about Faces finally addressed by the people who created it, it also takes some of the fun out if it, too.\\" Christopher Kulik of DVD Verdict wrote, \\"The YouTube generation will be unable to comprehend what purpose the film served thirty years ago, and thus it's difficult to ignore how hopelessly dated Faces of Death really is. In short, it's a cinematic experiment which has long outlived its effects, although it remains compelling for film and horror buffs viewing the film in the proper perspective. For the curious virgins, I say give it a shot only if you can handle what has been described up until this point; if you can get through Faces of Death, then you can get through just about anything. Feel free to judge for yourself.\\" In his review, Screen Anarchy's Ard Vijn was dismissive of the film, remarking that \\"many of the segments have lost their ability to shock, or can easily be recognized as fake by today's more media- savvy audience. Interesting as a curious bit of film history, but nothing more.\\" It was ranked #50 on Entertainment Weeklys \\"Top 50 Cult Films of All Time\\" in 2003.  Legacy  A number of sequels were made. Faces of Death II, III, and IV, as well as Faces of Death: Fact or Fiction? (a \\"documentary\\" on the making of the series) were written and at least partially directed by John Alan Schwartz. Faces of Death V and VI were released in the mid-90s, and are compilations made up entirely of highlights from the first four movies, with no new footage, released in some countries where the original movies were banned. The first three featured Carr as \\"Dr. Gr√∂ss\\", although The Worst of Faces of Death (released between installments III and IV and consisting of highlights from the first three installments) instead featured Schwartz's brother, James Schwartz, as \\"Dr. Louis Flellis\\". Flellis explains that he accidentally killed \\"Dr. Gr√∂ss\\" while operating on him the prior week. However, in Faces of Death IV, Flellis explains the absence of Dr. Gr√∂ss by stating that he had killed himself, having been driven insane as a result of witnessing so much death. Also released with the title Faces of Death VII, was a condensed version of Anton LaVey's 1989 film Death Scenes; and another assemblage of stock footage titled Faces of Death part 7 was released as an online file sometime during the late 1990s. Faces of Death 8 followed soon after. Released only in Germany, and made by unknown individuals, it is a collection of mostly unrelated gore scenes from around the world, with no narration, and no on-screen credits, aside from its title. In 1993, a copycat film, Traces of Death, was released. This movie contained significantly more real footage of actual deaths, including footage of the televised suicide of R. Budd Dwyer. The rock music group Sonic Youth featured film clips from the electric chair and morgue scenes in the music video for the song \\"Mote\\" from their 1990 album Goo. American singer-songwriter Amanda Palmer refers to the movie in her 2008 song \\"Guitar Hero\\" with the lyric \\"I'd rather pick up right where we left/ Making out to Faces of Death.\\" Rock group Cymbals Eat Guitars reference the movie in their 2014 song \\"XR\\" with the lyric \\"Here I am again at Ben's MySpace grave / And then out of nowhere the smell of his basement / Where we watched Faces of Death, and we regretted it\\".

He is also an important figure to Sunni-Sufis. He was called Abu Muhammad and Ibn al-Ridha. Because Samarra, the city where he lived, was a garrison town, he is generally known as al-Askari (Askar is the word for military in Arabic). Al-Askari married Narjis Khatun (also recorded as Sawsan, Mariam) and was kept under house arrest or in prison for most of his life. According to some Shia sources, he was poisoned at the age of 28 on the orders of the Abbasid caliph Al-Mu'tamid and was buried in Samarra. The Twelver Shia are looking forward to the succession of his son, Hujjat-Allah al-Mahdi, as they believe him to be the twelfth Imam, and that he is destined to remove injustice from the world.Eliash, J. \\"·∏§asan al-  øAskarƒ´, Ab≈´ Mu·∏•ammad ·∏§asan b.  øAlƒ´.\\" Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2010. Brill Online. Augustana. 13 April 2010 Birth and early life In 231 or 232 A.H., Hasan al-Askari was born in Medina. Dwight Donaldson has put al-Askari's birth near the time Al-Mutawakkil transferred his father, Ali al-Hadi, from Medina to Samarra. It is unclear whether he was born in Samarra or Medina. Hans Halm has set 233 or 234 A.H.(849 A.D.) as the date of the departure of Hasan al-Askari with his father. Wilferd Madelung considers 23 Ramadan 233 AH (5 May 848 A.D.) the date of their entry into Samarra, so he spent most of his life there. According to authentic Shia Hadith he was born in Medina on the 8th of Rabiul Akhar 232 Hijri (4 December 846 AD) and died in Samarra Iraq on the 8th of Rabiul Awwal 260 Hijri (4 January 874) aged 28. The period of his imamate was six years. He was taken along with his family to Samarra in the year 230, 231 or 232 A.H., and was kept there under house arrest. In Samarra, al-Askari spent most of his time reading the Quran and the Sharia. According to Donaldson, al-Askari must also have studied languages. In later years it was known that he could speak Hindi with the pilgrims from India, Turkish with the Turks, and Persian with the Persians. According to Shia accounts, however, it is part of the divine knowledge given to all Imams to be able to speak all human languages. It is said that even as a child, al-Askari was endowed with divine knowledge. One day a man passed by him and saw that he was crying. The man told him he would buy a toy that he might play with. \\"No!\\" said al-Askari, \\"We have not been created for play.\\" The man was amazed at this answer and said, \\"Then, what for have we been created?\\" \\"For knowledge and worship\\", answered the child. The man said, \\"Where have you got this from?\\" Al-Askari said, \\"From the saying of God, Did you then think that We had created you in vain.\\" The man was confused, so he asked, \\"What has happened to you while you are guiltless, little child?\\" Al-Askari replied, \\"Be away from me! I have seen my mother set fire to big pieces of firewood, but fire is not lit except with small pieces, and I fear that I shall be from the small pieces of the firewood of the Hell.\\" Al-Askari's mother, as in the case of most of The Twelve Imams, was a slave girl who was honoured after bearing children with the title umm walad (mother of offspring). Her given name was Hadith, though some say she was called \\"Susan\\", \\"Ghazala\\", \\"Salil\\", or \\"Haribta\\". Al-Askari had other brothers. Among them was Ja'far who was also known as \\"Ja'far al-Zaki\\" or \\"Jaffar-us-Sani\\". His other brother was Husayn, and together he and al-Askari were known as \\"as-Sibtayn\\", after their two grandfathers Hasan and Husayn, who were also called \\"as-Sibtayn\\". Family Various legends relate to al- Askari's wife, Narjis Khatun (the mother of the twelfth Imam, Muhammad al- Mahdi). It is said that al-Askari's father, Ali al-Hadi, wrote a letter in the script of R√ªm, put it in a red purse with 220 dinars, and gave it to his friend Bashar ibn Sulaiman. The letter instructed him to go to Baghdad, to a ferry dock on the river where the boats from Syria were unloaded, and female slaves were sold. Bashar was told to look out for a shipowner named Amr ibn Yazid, who had a slave girl who would call out in the language of R√ªm: \\"Even if you have wealth and the glory of Solomon the son of David, I can never have affection for you, so take care lest you waste your money.\\" And that if a buyer approached her, she would say, \\"Cursed be the man who unveils my eyebrow!\\" Her owner would then protest, \\"But what recourse do I have I; I am compelled to sell you?\\" The Imam said, \\"You will then hear the slave answer, 'Why this hast, let me choose my purchaser, that my heart may accept him in confidence and gratitude'.\\" Bashar gave the letter to the slave girl as he was instructed. She read it and was unable to keep from crying afterward. Then she said to Amr ibn Yezid, \\"Sell me to the writer of this letter, for if you refuse I will surely kill myself.\\" \\"I therefore talked over the price with Amr until we agreed on the 220 dinars my master had given me,\\" said Bashar. On her way to Samarra, the slave girl would kiss the letter and rub it to her face and body; and when asked by Bashar why she did so despite not knowing the writer of the letter, she said, \\"May the offspring of the Prophet dispel your doubts!\\" Later, however, she gave a full description of the dream she had, and how she had escaped from her father's palace. A lengthier version of this story is recorded in Donaldson's book, along with further discussion on its authenticity. Some Shia sources have recorded her as being a \\"Roman (i.e. Byzantine) princess\\" who pretended to be a slave so that she might travel from her kingdom to Arabia. Mohammad Ali Amir-Moezzi, in the Encyclopedia of Iranica, suggests that the last version is \\"undoubtedly legendary and hagiographic\\". About his descendants, there are different views. According to many collections of Sunni and Shi'a hadith, his only son was Mohammed, who was born in 255 A.H.(869 A.D.). Some sources enumerate up to three girls and three boys as his offspring. Some others say he did not have any offspring. Imamate Shia believe that Hasan al-Askari gained the Imamate after the death of his father‚Äîby divine command, as well as by the decrees of the previous Imams‚Äîat the age of 22. During the seven years of his Imamate, Hasan al-Askari lived in dissimulation (taqiyah), without any social contact, as the Abbasid Caliphs were afraid of the increasing popularity of Shia Islam at the time. The Caliphs also came to know that the leaders among the Shia believed that the eleventh Imam would have a son who was the promised Mahdi. Due to these fears, the Caliphs of the time had decided to put an end to the Imamate of Shi'ism once and for all. Under the rule of the Abbasid Caliphs Hasan al-Askari lived almost his entire life under house arrest in Samarra and under the supervision of the Abbasid caliphs. He was not allowed to communicate with others and wore the Taqiyah (cap). Some say, however, that due to visits made on his traffic route, at the beginning of his imamate, he had a little freedom. According to Sachedina and Jassim M. Hussain, during his house arrest, al-Askari named a personal deputy to guide the Shia in religious thought and collect religious taxes (Khums, Zakat, etc.). He organized The institution of the deputyship (wikala). He criticized the rulers for appropriating the wealth of the nation and extorting the people under their rule by not communicating with or cooperating with the kings of his time. The state remained in a political crisis, as the Abbasid Caliphs were considered puppets of the Turks, who were seen as ruling through terrorism. After the death of al-Askari's father, Ali al-Hadi, the Caliph Al-Mu'tazz summoned him to Baghdad, where he was kept in prison during the short rule of the next Caliph, Al-Muhtadi. Most of his prison time, however, was during the reign of the succeeding Caliph, Al-Mu'tamid, who is known in Shia sources as the main oppressor of the Imam. The Imam's death has largely been attributed to poison administered by al-Mu'tamid. The al-Mu'tamid era coincided with the rebellion of the Alawites, and people allied to them, so al-Askari was released from prison, from 256 to 260 A.H. The news of his death was published in his home. Divisions There was a large sect of Shia, the Waqifiyya, who believed that the Imamate stopped with the seventh Imam, Musa al-Kadhim. They were unwilling to approve the succession of the remaining five Imams. Also, Ja'far, the son of the tenth Imam, claimed to be Imam after the death of his brother, al-Askari, and was followed by a group of Shia. However, this group disbanded soon afterwards, as Ja'far himself gave up his claim. Except for Zaidiyyah and Isma'ilism, which continue to the present day, all other minority sects of the Shia were dissolved in a short period, except for the division made by Ibn Nusayr after the death of Al-Askari, which later became the Alawites. Expertise During their lifetimes, the Shia Imams trained hundreds of scholars whose names and works can be found in biographical books. During the time of the Eleventh Imam, however, some Shia saw Islamic religious life as being in shambles. The Imam was under house arrest, and many non-believers took advantage of this to question religion, in spite of the Imam's continuing to speak out against those who questioned the Qur'an. An account of this can be found in a tafsir ascribed to him. The religious skepticism was manifested in a book entitled The Contradiction of the Quran, by Abd al-Masih ibn Ishaq al-Kindi. News of the book came to al-Askari, who met one of al-Kindi's disciples and said to him, \\"Is there no wise man among you to prevent your teacher, al-Kindi, from that which he has busied himself with?\\" The disciple answered that they were al-Kindi's disciples and were unable to object. Later on, Hasan al-Askari instructed the disciple how to question al-Kindi. > Go to him, be courteous with him, and show him that you will help him in > what he is in. When he feels comfortable with you, you say to him, \\"If > someone recites the Quran, is it possible that he means other meanings than > what you think you understand?\\" He shall say that \\"it is possible because he > is a man who understands when he listens.\\" If he says that, you say to him > \\"How do you know? He might mean other than the meanings that you think, and > so he fabricates other than its (the Qur'an) meanings ‚Ä¶\\" The disciple did as al-Askari advised him; and Al-Kindi was shrewd enough to say, \\"‚Ä¶ No one like you can get to this. Would you tell me where you have got this from?\\" And when he heard the true story said, \\"Now you say the truth. Like this would not come out except that house ‚Ä¶\\". It is said that al-Kindi burnt his book afterwards. Tafsir al-Askari Despite being confined to house arrest for almost his entire life, Hasan al-Askari was able to teach others about Islam, and even compiled a commentary on the Quran that became known as Tafsir al-Askari. However, there was much suspicion about whether it truly was his work. The tafsir was thought by some to have a weak chain of authorities (Sanad), which is an essential part of the transmission of a tradition. The tafsir was also questioned because it contained a few inconsistencies and lacks eloquence, which some claim ruin its validity by default. The main reason people questioned its validity was the fact the Imam was under constant watch by the Abbasid government, which prevented any contact between him and other Shia, making it impossible for such knowledge to be transmitted. Death Al-Askari Mosque in Samarra', Iraq, before the 2006 bombing Opinions differ on the cause of Hasan al-Askari‚Äôs death. Some believe he died from illness. But, according to some Shia sources, others think he was poisoned at the age of 28 at the instigation of the Abbasid Caliph Al-Mu'tamid and died on the 8th Rabi' al-Awwal 260 AH (approximately: 4 January 874)Mufƒ´d, Ibn-al-Mu ªallim, I.

Print. in his house in Samarra and was buried with his father. Shaykh Tabarsi thought, based on hadith of the Imamieh, that all Shia imams will be killed by someone else, so that he believed al-Askari was poisoned. Ibn Shahrashub, referring to documents such as Dala'il al-imama, stated that al- Askari was killed by someone else. Rasul Jafarian, referring to historical documents and detention records of the sixth century A.H., stated that al- Askari opposed the Abbasid Caliph politically and that his death happened early in life. According to the Encyclopaedia of Islam, in all of the sources there is one common thread: that al-Mu'tamid wanted a declaration by medical practitioners that showed the people that al-Askari died a natural death. When news of al-Askari's illness reached Caliph Al-Mu'tamid, he sent a physician and a group of his trusted men to observe the Imam's condition. After the death of the Imam, they had all his female slaves examined by the midwives. For two years, they searched for the successor of the Imam until they eventually lost hope. Al-Askari died on the very same day that his young son, Muhammad al-Mahdi, who then was five or a little over, disappeared and started what was henceforth known as the Minor Occultation. Genealogy trees of Middle Eastern families, mostly from Persia and Khorasan, show that Imam Hasan al- Askari also had a second son called Sayyid Ali Akbar. These indicate that Imam al-Askari had children and tend to substantiate the existence of Imam Muhammad al Mahdi. Sayyid 'Ali is Sultan Saadat (Sodot) who died in Termez. His burial place is located in the main mausoleum Sultan Saodat memorial complex in Termez. \\"Dastur al Mulk\\" (Guide to Kings) (XVII —Åentury) by Khwaja Samandar Muhammad ibn Baqi al-Termizi, translator professor of history Jabbor Esonov, \\"Sharq\\", Tashkent 2001, page 22 \\"Durdonahoi Nasr\\" book, \\"Adib\\", Dushanbe 1985, page 375\\"Sayyidlar Shajarasi\\", \\"Islamic university\\", Tashkent 2017, page 14¬´Buyuk Termiziylar¬ª (–ë—É—é–∫ –¢–µ—Ä–º–∏–∑–∏–π–ª–∞—Ä) book by Mirzo Kenjabek, ‚ÄúUzbekistan National encyclopedias‚Äù 2017, page-267 The reason for dispute over whether Imam Al Askari had children or not is perhaps because of the political conflicts between the followers of the Imamah and the leadership of the Abbasids and Ghulat Shiites who had not believed in Imam Hasan al-Askaris Imamah. In fact, the eleventh Imam had two sons, Sayyid Muhammad (i.e. Imam Mahdi) and Sayyid Ali Akbar.

His son Twelver Shi'ites believe the birth of Al-Askari's son, like that of the prophet Moses, was concealed due to the difficulties of the time and because of the belief that the son was the promised Muhammad al-Mahdi, an important figure in Shia teachings. The Mahdi was believed to be destined to reappear before the end of time to fill the world with justice, peace, and to establish Islam as the global religion. Al-Askari's death coincided with the beginning of the imamate of the Mahdi. Ja'far al Zaki, al-Askari's brother, claimed that his brother never had a son. It is said that when Ja'far al Zaki was about to say the prayer at his brother's funeral, there appeared \\"a fair child, with curly hair, and shining teeth\\", who seized Ja'far's cloak and insisted on saying the prayer. A few days later, a group of Shia pilgrims from Qom, ignorant of his death, came to visit al-Askari. The same Ja'far claimed to be the next Imam. The pilgrims said they would accept him if he would prove himself by telling them their names and indicating how much money they had. While Ja'far was protesting this examination, a servant of Hasan's son appeared, saying that his master had sent him to inform them of their particular names and their specific amounts of money. Ja'far searched everywhere but could not find the boy. The doctrine of his ghaiba declares simply that the Mahdi has been \\"withdrawn by God from the eyes of men, that his life has been miraculously prolonged, that he has been seen from time to time and has been in correspondence with others, and maintains a control over the fortunes of his people\\". Non-Twelver views Many Sunnis do not believe the Mahdi was already born, but there is a group of as many as 40 well-known Sunni scholars including Al-Dhahabi, Ibn-Hajar, Abu al-Falah Hanbali and al-Qunduzi, who believed that he was the son of Hasan.Sheikh Najm al-Din al-Askari, Al-Mahdi Al-Mawood Al-Montazar Enda (by) Ahl al-Sunnah, Vol. 1, P. 220Shadharat al-dhahab (Beirut edition), Vol. 2, p. 141; al-'Ibar fi khabar min ghabar (Kuwait edition), Vol. 2, p. 3 In 648 AH / 1250-1 CE, the Syrian Shafi'i author Mu·∏•ammad b. Yusuf al-Gandji al-Kurashi wrote K. al-Bayan fi akhbar sahib al-zaman in proving the Mahdiship of the Twelfth Imam using Sunni traditions. In 650/1252 Kamalal-Din Mu·∏•ammad b. Talha al- øAdawi al-Nisibini, a Shafi'i scholar, composed his Ma·π≠alib al-su æul fi mana·∏≥ib al al-rasul answering Sunni objections to the belief that the Twelfth ImƒÅm was the Mahdi. The Sibt ibn al-Jawzi wrote Tadhkirat khawass al-umma bi- dhikr khasa æis al-a æimma, collecting hadiths from Sunni sources about the virtues of  øAli and his descendants, and at the end affirmed that the Twelfth Imam was the Expected Qa æim Al Mahdi. Among Sufi circles, Abu Bakr al-Bayha·∏≥ƒ´ (d. 458/1066) had noted that some Sufi gnostics (djama øa min ahl al-kashf) agreed with the Twelver doctrine about the identity of the Mahdi and his ghaybah (occultation). The Persian Sufi Sadr al-Din Ibrahim al-Hammuyi (late 7th/13th century) supported Twelver doctrine on the Mahdi in his Fara æid al- simtayn. The Egyptian Sufi al-Sha ørani, while generally showing no sympathy for Shi øism, affirmed in his al-Yawa·∏≥it wa  æl-djÃ≤awahir (written in 958/1551) that the Mahdi was a son of Imam al-Hasan al- øAskari, born in the year 255/869, and would remain alive until his meeting with Jesus. According to the earliest reports as cited below from official family tree documents and records, Imam Hasan al-Askari fathered seven children and was survived by six.Muhammed bin Yusuf Al Zarandi (d.720 hijrah) ‚ÄúMarij a‚Äôwusul ila ma‚Äôrifat fadlal‚Äù page 176Ibn Abi l-Thalj (d.322 hijrah) ‚ÄúMajmuat nafisa fi tarikh al-a‚Äôimma‚Äù pages 21-22 The names of his illustrious biological children were: Imam Muhammad al-Mahdi, Musa, Ja‚Äôfar, Ibrahim, Fatima, Ayesha, and 'Ali,Kashani ‚ÄúKitab al aqaid al iyman‚Äù page 259 sometimes referred to as Akbar or Asghar.Abul Hasan Ali bin Isa (d.1293 m.)

He is best known for being the author of 'The Rise of China viz. The Logic of Strategy' and 'Coup d'√âtat: A Practical Handbook'. Early life and education Luttwak was born into a Jewish family in Arad, Romania, and raised in Italy and England. After elementary school in Palermo, Sicily, he attended Carmel College and Quintin Grammar School in England, and served briefly in the British Army. He then studied analytical economics at the London School of Economics where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) in 1964. After teaching at the University of Bath, working as an oil consultant in London, and for the Israeli army, he moved to the United States in 1972 for graduate studies at Johns Hopkins SAIS where he graduated with a PhD in International Relations in 1975. The title of his dissertation was Force and Diplomacy in Roman Strategies of Imperial Security. Career Luttwak was a Lecturer in economics at the University of Bath, England. He held posts at the Georgetown University, and SAIS before becoming a Senior Associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Professional Profile: Edward Luttwak . Idcitalia.com. Accessed March 11, 2012. Luttwak has been noted for his innovative policy ideas, suggesting for example that major powers' attempts to quell regional wars actually make conflicts more protracted. His book Coup d'√âtat: A Practical Handbook has been reprinted numerous times, and translated into 18 languages. His book Strategy: The Logic of War and Peace is used as a textbook in war colleges and universities and has been translated into several languages. In 1976 he published The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire from the First Century AD to the Third which generated controversy among professional historians who saw Luttwak as an outsider and non-specialist in the field. However, the book is recognized as seminal because it raised basic questions about the Roman army and its defense of the Roman frontier. Although many professional historians argued against his views on Roman strategy, some at book length, his work undoubtedly increased interest in the study of Roman frontiers and strategy. Since the 1980s, he has published articles on the Byzantine Empire and his book, The Grand Strategy of the Byzantine Empire, was published in late 2009. He provides consulting services to international corporations and government agencies including various branches of the U.S. government and the U.S. military.Professional Profile: Edward Luttwak . Idcitalia.com. Accessed March 11, 2012. He has served as a consultant to the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the National Security Council, the United States Department of State, the United States Navy, United States Army, United States Air Force, and several NATO defense ministries. Working for OSD/Net Assessment, he co- developed the current maneuver-warfare concept, working for the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), he introduced the \\"operational level of war\\" concept into U.S. Army doctrine, wrote the first manual for the Joint Special Operations Agency, and co-developed the Rapid-Deployment Force concept (later U.S. Central Command) for the office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs. He served on the editorial boards of G√©opolitique (France), the Journal of Strategic Studies, The European Journal of International Affairs, and the Washington Quarterly. He speaks English, French, Hebrew, Italian, and Spanish. In 2004, Luttwak was awarded an honorary doctorate degree (LLD) from the University of Bath. He also received honorary degrees from the university of Arad and of Bucarest He is a member of the Italy-USA Foundation. He received the America Award from the Italy-USA Foundation in 2011. He is chairman of the board of Aircraft Purchase Fleet Limited (APFL), an aviation lessor, and the head of a conservation ranch in the Amazon. Criticism=Predictions Luttwak's book Turbo-Capitalism: Winners And Losers In The Global Economy (1998) predicted the populist reaction according to Richard Rorty and many others. Also, his The Grand Strategy of the Soviet Union (1983) emphasized its internal fragility in the face of resurgent national identities that Sovietologists considered folkloric and nothing more; it also disputed in great detail the CIA's estimate of the Soviet economy as grossly inflated. In his 2002 book Public Intellectuals: A Study of Decline, U.S. Appeals Court Judge Richard A. Posner said Luttwak \\"writes well and with authority (that is, with an air of great confidence) and knows a lot‚Äîhe is a serious historian and defense analyst. But writing as a public intellectual, he repeatedly ventures predictions that events falsify. In 1983, he pronounced the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan a success. Besides also citing Luttwak's prediction, in response to a question, of the impoverishment of all but a small minority of Americans \\"soon enough\\", Posner wrote that Luttwak predicted, shortly before the first Persian Gulf War, that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein would evacuate Kuwait \\"after a week or two of bombing (the bombing continued for six weeks without inducing him to do so) and warned that the use of ground forces 'could make Desert Storm a bloody, grinding combat with thousands of (U.S.) casualties.' The ground fighting lasted only four days, rather than the minimum of two weeks that Luttwak predicted, and U.S. casualties were minimal. Writing a month into the bombing, Luttwak was no longer predicting heavy casualties but he still opposed a ground campaign. He thought it would lead inevitably to a military occupation of Iraq from which we would be unable to disengage without disastrous foreign policy consequences.\\" Luttwak predicted in a 2016 op-ed in The Wall Street Journal that the Trump administration would pursue a foreign policy \\"unlikely to deviate from standard conservative norms\\", withdrawing troops from Afghanistan and Iraq, avoiding involvement in Syria and Libya, eschewing trade wars, and modestly reducing spending ‚Äî in short, \\"changes at the margin.\\"Edward N. Luttwak, \\"Suffering From Trumphobia?

Bush's speechwriter David Frum said Luttwak \\"is a very genuinely interesting writer. His book on the grand strategy of the Roman Empire was terrific, and his Coup d'√âtat is that astounding thing: a great work of political science that is also a hilarious satire. Part of the secret of his success is his tone of total confidence. He makes startling claims in a tone that says, 'If only you knew my super-secret sources.'\\" Frum was writing on the occasion of having just seen a column by Luttwak in the UK magazine, Prospect, titled \\"The Middle of Nowhere\\", in which Luttwak \\"magisterially and sardonically attacks a whole series of intellectual errors that allegedly dominate expert opinion on the Middle East\\".

His body of work consists of two symphonies, several additional orchestral works, and numerous songs, all of them imbued with characteristics of folksong. His symphonies, particularly the First, were frequently performed in the early 20th century. His younger brother Viktor Kalinnikov (1870‚Äì1927) was also a composer, mainly of choral music.  Biography  Kalinnikov was a police official's son. He studied at the seminary at Oryol, becoming director of the choir there at fourteen. Later he went to the Moscow Conservatory but could not afford the tuition fees. On a scholarship he went to the Moscow Philharmonic Society School, where he received bassoon and composition lessons from Alexander Ilyinsky. He played bassoon, timpani and violin in theater orchestras and supplemented his income working as a music copyist . In 1892, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky recommended Kalinnikov for the position of main conductor of the Maly Theatre, and later that same year to the Moscow Italian Theater. However, due to his worsening tuberculosis, Kalinnikov had to resign from his theater appointments and move to the warmer southern clime of the Crimea. He lived at Yalta for the rest of his life, and it was there that he wrote the main part of his music, including his two symphonies and the incidental music for Alexey Tolstoy's Tsar Boris . In Yalta he joined two other famous tubercular patients, Maxim Gorky and Anton Chekov . Exhausted, he died of tuberculosis on 11 January 1901, just two days before his 35th birthday. He was survived by his widow and his brother, Viktor Kalinnikov, who composed choral music and taught at the Moscow Philharmonic Society School . Vasily Kalinnikov's reputation was established with his First Symphony, written between 1894 and 1895, which had great success when Vinogradsky conducted it at a Russian Musical Society concert in Kiev on 20 February 1897. Further performances swiftly followed, in Moscow, Vienna, Berlin, and Paris . It was not published until after his death. At Sergei Rachmaninoff's suggestion (following a visit to Kalinnikov in his illness), Tchaikovsky's publisher P. Jurgenson bought three Kalinnikov songs for 120 rubles. After Kalinnikov's death Jurgenson purchased the Symphony No. 2 in A major and other works from his widow for a high sum, commenting that his death \\"had multiplied the value of his works by ten\\" . In Russia his First Symphony remains in the repertory, and his place in musical history is secure . On 7 November 1943, Arturo Toscanini conducted the NBC Symphony Orchestra in a rare broadcast performance of the First Symphony; although the performance was recorded, it was never commercially released by RCA Victor, but was released as a CD recording in 2006 .

Built for the Royal Navy during World War I, the ship was not completed until 1919, and spent less than eight months in British service before being transferred to the RAN at the start of 1920. After arriving in Australia, Tattoo spent her entire career in Australian waters, and was placed in reserve on several occasions. Tattoo was decommissioned in 1936, and was sold for ship breaking in 1937. Design and construction Tattoo was built to the Admiralty design of the S class destroyer, which was designed and built as part of the British emergency war programme.Cassells, The Destroyers, pp. 130‚Äì1 The destroyer had a displacement of 1,075 tons, a length overall of , and a beam of .Cassells, The Destroyers, p. 130 The propulsion machinery consisted of three Yarrow boilers feeding Brown-Curtis turbines, which supplied to the ship's two propeller shafts.Cassells, The Destroyers, p. 131 Although designed with a maximum speed of , Tattoo was only able to achieve on power trials. The destroyer's economical speed of gave her a range of . The ship's company was made up of 6 officers and 93 sailors. The destroyer's primary armament consisted of three QF 4-inch Mark IV guns. These were supplemented by a 2-pounder pom-pom, two 9.5-inch howitzer bomb throwers, five .303 inch machine guns (a mix of Lewis and Maxim guns), two twin 21-inch torpedo tube sets, two depth charge throwers, and two depth charge chutes. Tattoo was laid down by William Beardmore and Company, Limited, at Dalmuir in Scotland on 21 December 1917. The destroyer was launched on 28 December 1918, and completed on 7 April 1919. The ship was commissioned into the Royal Navy in April 1919, but was quickly marked for transfer to the RAN, along with four sister ships. Tattoo was commissioned into the RAN on 27 January 1920. There were plans to rename her HMAS Moresby, but these were cancelled in June 1930. Operational history Tattoo and three of her sister ships sailed for Australia on 20 February, visiting ports in the Mediterranean, India, Singapore, and the Netherlands East Indies before reaching Sydney on 29 April.Cassells, The Destroyers, p. 114 The destroyer was placed in reserve in October 1921, then was reactivated on 12 March 1926 for a six-week period. She was to be fully decommissioned on 26 March 1928, but this was cancelled in favour of decommissioning . Tattoo was recommissioned on 13 July 1931. She was returned to reserve on 30 June 1933, and was briefly reactivated in October of that year to assist in torpedo re-ranging trials. On 8 January 1935, the destroyer was assigned to Flinders Naval Depot, and was moved in and out of commission as required for training. Decommissioning and fate Tattoo paid off for the final time on 19 June 1936. She was sold to Penguins Limited for ship breaking on 4 June 1937.

Community outreach services include programming for Senior facilities and schools across mid-Michigan, year-round instrument lessons, scholarship programs, Jamborees, Traditional Dances, and Wheatscouts - a free program educating children through music, dance, storytelling, crafts and nature. Each year, the organization holds its annual Traditional Arts Weekend the weekend of Memorial Day, and its annual festival during the second weekend in September in the unincorporated community of Remus in the state of Michigan, in the United States. The first Wheatland Music Festival was held August 24, 1974. History In the early 1970s a small group of Mt. Pleasant Food Co-Op (now the GreenTree Cooperative Grocery) members and local musicians were staging free concerts and benefits around the Big Rapids and Mt. Pleasant, MI areas. Common sites were city parks and public halls. Proceeds enabled the food co-op to pay rent and utilities. Meanwhile, founders of the Wheatland Music Organization were organizing about two concerts a month during the summer. The First Wheatland Bluegrass Festival was held as a benefit for the Mt. Pleasant Food Co-Op, August 24, 1974. It was a one-day event held on the Rhode family farm, located four miles east of Remus on M-20. June Rhodes' utility room became festival headquarters, her backyard was the backstage area, and her sister-in-law's yard across the road was the parking lot. The flatbed trailers were in place along with the first-aid tent, a sound system, and a hotdog stand. Several hundred people attended the First Wheatland Festival. Perhaps the single most important attendee was the local postmaster. Before the first festival was even over he had already offered the use of his farm for the next year. The one improvement he could offer was a hayfield instead of corn stubble and dirt. All in all he knew just what the festival idea needed. Who was that postmaster? And why would he want hundreds of strangers sleeping across his 160-acre backyard? What would his wife have to say about this? Mark and Gladys Wernette were contemplating taking a big step towards an uncertain future. But like their parents, Mecosta County's Alsatian pioneers, Mark and Gladys were committed to what they thought was their civic responsibility and offered to lend a hand. By 1975 Wheatland was born. Elections were held and the board of directors was established. Many of the first directors are still active in the organization. This can be attributed to their faith in each other, their commitment to community service, and passion for preserving and presenting traditional music and arts. With the 47th annual festival being deferred to 2021, officials blamed the COVID-19 pandemic as the result of 2020's cancellation.

(formerly Midway Manufacturing and commonly known as simply Midway) was an American video game developer and publisher. Midway's franchises included Mortal Kombat, Rampage, Spy Hunter, NBA Jam, Cruis'n, and NFL Blitz. Midway also acquired the rights to video games that were originally developed by Williams Electronics and Atari Games, such as Defender, Joust, Robotron 2084, Gauntlet, and the Rush series. The company's predecessor Midway Manufacturing was founded in 1958, as an amusement game manufacturer. In 1973 it moved into the interactive entertainment industry, developing and publishing arcade video games. The company scored its first mainstream hit with the U.S. distribution of Space Invaders in 1978. Midway was purchased and re-incorporated in 1988 by WMS Industries Inc. After years as a leader in the arcade segment, Midway moved into the growing home video game market beginning in 1996, the same year that it made its initial public offering of stock. In 1998, WMS spun off its remaining shares of Midway. Midway was ranked the fourth largest-selling video game publisher in 2000.Hong, Quang. \\"Midway Fourth\\". Gamasutra, February 1, 2000, accessed April 5, 2011 After 2000, Midway continued to develop and publish video games for home and handheld video game machines, but it experienced large annual net losses and engaged in a series of stock and debt offerings and other financings and borrowings. Sumner Redstone, the former head of the now merged Viacom and CBS Corporation, increased his stake in Midway from about 15% in 1998, to about 87% by the end of 2007. In December 2008, Redstone sold all his stock and $70 million of Midway debt to Mark Thomas, a private investor, for $100,000.\\"Redstone sells Midway Games to ease debt\\", Reuters, December 1, 2008 In February 2009, Midway Games filed in Delaware for bankruptcy.

U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, filed June 9, 2010 History=Arcade games Midway Mfg. Co. began in 1958 as an independent manufacturer of amusement equipment founded by Henry Ross and Marcine Wolverton. It was purchased by Bally in 1969. Bally, at that time, was a leader in the manufacture of slot machines.\\"Williams-Bally-Midway the 'Roman Empire' of Gaming\\", Gamester81 Enterprises, January 6, 2012 After some years making mechanical arcade games such as puck bowling and simulated western shoot-out, Midway became in 1973 an early American maker of arcade video games. Throughout the 1970s, Midway had a close alliance with Japanese video game publisher Taito, with both companies regularly licensing their games to each other for distribution in their respective country. Meanwhile, Midway's breakthrough success came in 1978, with the licensing and distribution of Taito's seminal arcade game Space Invaders in America. This was followed by Midway's licensing and distributing the hit U.S. version of Namco's Pac-Man in 1980, and its sequel, Ms. Pac-Man, in 1982. Also in 1982, Bally merged its pinball division with Midway to form the Bally/Midway Manufacturing division. Three games released that year, including Satan's Hollow, were the first to feature the Bally/Midway brand. From the late 1970s through the late 1980s, Midway was the leading producer of arcade video games in the United States. The Bally/Midway division of Bally was purchased in 1988 by the arcade and pinball game company Williams Electronics Games through its holding company WMS Industries Inc. Midway moved its headquarters from Franklin Park, Illinois to Williams' then-headquarters in Chicago, and WMS reincorporated Midway as a Delaware corporation. Although WMS retained many R&D; employees from the original Midway, only two game designers were retained: Rampage designers Brian Colin and Jeff Nauman. WMS obtained the right from Bally to use the \\"Bally\\" brand for its pinball games since Bally had completely left the arcade/pinball industry to concentrate on casinos and slot machines. Under WMS ownership, Midway initially continued to produce arcade games under the Bally/Midway label, while producing pinball machines under the \\"Bally\\" brand. In 1991, however, Midway absorbed Williams' video game division and started making arcade games under its own name again, without the \\"Bally\\" part. In 1992, the company's The Addams Family machine became the best selling pinball game of all time. In 1996, WMS purchased Time Warner Interactive, which included Atari Games, originally a part of Atari, Inc. Also in 1996, Midway changed its original corporate name, Midway Manufacturing, to Midway Games Inc., due to its entrance in the home console market. This was facilitated by WMS transferring its former home console division, Williams Entertainment, Inc., to Midway that same year. The division had previously been known as Tradewest while part of the Leland corporation, which WMS had acquired in 1994. The original arcade division of the company became Midway Amusement Games and the newly created home division was named Midway Home Entertainment.Over the years, Midway's arcade system boards included the following: Astrocade; MCR, MCR II, MCR III and MCR-68; T Unit (1993) and X Unit (1991‚Äì1994); Y Unit (1991‚Äì1992); V Unit (1994‚Äì1997); Wolf Unit (1995‚Äì1997); Zeus (1997‚Äì1999) and Zeus II (1999‚Äì2001); Seattle; Vegas; Quicksilver II; and Williams Z Unit (used only with NARC). Spin-off and home video game focus In 1996, WMS made a public offering of Midway stock and, at the same time, WMS transferred its video game copyrights and trademarks, including Defender, Robotron: 2084 and Joust, to Midway. In 1998, WMS spun off its remaining 86.8% interest in Midway to the WMS shareholders, making Midway an independent entity for the first time in almost 30 years.Midway Games Form S-3 filed with the SEC and dated on November 27, 2001 Midway kept Atari Games as a wholly owned subsidiary as part of this spin-off. Midway retained or shared some of the WMS executive staff and used some common facilities with WMS for a few more years. Over several years, Midway gradually terminated all material agreements and executive overlap with WMS and had a declining number of common members of its board of directors, until it shared only one with its former parent company. In 1999, Midway left the pinball industry (it had earlier transferred most of its pinball assets to WMS in 1996 in exchange for video game assets of WMS) and changed the name of its \\"Atari Games\\" subsidiary to Midway Games West, Inc. to avoid confusion with Atari Interactive. On June 22, 2001, Midway announced that it was closing its arcade division due to a decline in the arcade market. Midway shut down Midway Games West in February 2003, but it remained as an entity. After losing money each year since 2000, Midway's losses accelerated in 2003, as it lost $115 million on sales of about $93 million. Despite these losses, the company was able to finance its business with stock and debt offerings and various credit arrangements. In 2003, Sumner Redstone, a significant minority shareholder since the company's spinoff, began to increase his stake in the company and soon owned 80% of the stock.Midway's 2005 and 2006 annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, available on its website at www.sec.gov. In 2004, in an effort to expand its market share, Midway began a purchasing spree of independent video game development studios to strengthen its product development teamsMidway's May 2005 quarterly report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, available on its website at www.sec.gov. In April 2004, Midway acquired Surreal Software of Seattle, Washington. In October 2004, it acquired Inevitable Entertainment of Austin, Texas (which became Midway Austin). In December 2004, it acquired Paradox Development of Moorpark, California. On August 4, 2005, Midway acquired privately held Australian developer Ratbag Games. The studio was renamed Midway Studios‚ÄîAustralia. Four months later, on December 13, Midway announced to its employees there that it was shutting the studio down, leaving its employees based at that studio without a job. Two days later, on December 15, the studio was closed and their Adelaide premises emptied. During 2004 and 2005, Midway lost $20 million on sales of $162 million, and $112 million on sales of $150 million, respectively. Redstone voted his shares to elect his daughter Shari Redstone to Midway's board of directors and later as the chair of the board. Midway was ranked as the #4 video game publisher by sales in 2000. It was ranked as the #19 video game publisher in 2005 and had fallen to #20 in 2006, according to the magazine Game Developer.Game Developer's Top 20 Publishers, 2006 from Gamasutra, 2006, accessed April 5, 2011 Late 2000s and bankruptcy filing In 2006 and 2007, Midway lost a further $77 million on sales of $166 million and $100 million on sales of $157 million, respectively. It continued to finance its business with debt offerings and other credit arrangements. As of 2007, Midway Games was engaged in a legal battle with Mindshadow Entertainment for the Psi-Ops video game rights. Mindshadow alleged that Midway copied Psi-Opss story from a screenplay written and owned by their client. On December 2, 2008 Judge Florence-Marie Cooper of the United States District Court for the Central District of California issued a ruling granting summary judgment on all counts in Midway's favor. Judge Cooper found no evidence of copyright infringement. On March 6, 2007, Midway reported that it had entered into a new $90m credit agreement with National Amusements, a company controlled by Sumner Redstone. Midway's CEO, David Zucker, stated that the introduction of Unreal Tournament 3, and the company's growing success in mass-market games, were setting it up for a \\"significant 2008\\". On March 21, 2008, Zucker resigned as CEO. He was the third executive to resign from the company in three months. Succeeding Zucker as CEO was former Senior Vice President Matt Booty.Matt Booty appointed interim CEO, Chicago Tribune, 2008. During the summer of 2008, in an effort to trim costs, Midway closed its Los Angeles and Austin studios.Midway Games Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, filed with the SEC on April 6, 2009 These closures left Midway with four studios, in Chicago, Seattle, San Diego and Newcastle, England. During this time, Midway just released TNA Impact! and Blitz: The League II around September/October 2008, under the Midway Studios Los Angeles office (before its closure) and the San Diego branch (Midway Games San Diego/Midway Home Entertainment). In November 2008, Midway reported that its cash and other resources \\"may not be adequate to fund... working capital requirements\\" and that it \\"would need to initiate cost cutting measures or seek additional liquidity sources\\". On November 20, 2008, Midway retained Lazard to assist it \\"in the evaluation of strategic and financial alternatives\\".Midway Games Inc. current report on Form 8-K dated December 4, 2008 The next day, Midway received a NYSE delisting notice, after its stock's price fell below one dollar.Midway Games Receives NYSE Delisting Notice, Digital Media Wire Midway's last title, Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, released around this time, in November 2008. On December 2, 2008, Sumner Redstone sold his 87 percent stake in Midway Games to Mark Thomas, a private investor, through his company MT Acquisition Holdings LLC. Thomas's company paid approximately $100,000, or $0.0012 per share. Thomas also received $70 million of Midway's debt owed to Redstone. National Amusements took a significant loss on the sale, although the loss allowed it to benefit from tax losses.\\"Redstone Sells Midway for $100,000 to Ease Debt\\", Gamasutra In December 2008, Midway disclosed that it might default on $240 million of debt after the sale of stock to Thomas triggered clauses in two bond issues totalling $150 million of debt that allowed the bondholders to demand full repayment.Wong, Wailin. \\"Midway Games says it may default on $240 million in debt\\", Chicago Tribune, December 5, 2008 In 2008, Midway lost $191 million on sales of $220 million, and Redstone's sale of his shares to Thomas eliminated Midway's ability to take advantage of accumulated net operating losses and other tax assets potentially worth more than $700 million. On February 12, 2009, Midway and its U.S. subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The company began to operate as a Debtor in possession. A company spokesperson said, \\"We felt this was a logical next step for our organization, considering the change in control triggered the acceleration of the repayment options ... we're looking to reorganize and to come out on the other side stronger.\\"\\"Mortal Kombat maker Midway Games files for bankruptcy\\", Chicago Tribune, February 13, 2009, accessed February 3, 2011 2009 sales of assets Midway announced on May 21, 2009 that it had received a takeover bid from Warner Bros.

The offer did not include the San Diego and Newcastle studios or the TNA video game series. Midway had previously worked with Warner Bros. on several games including Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe. Midway announced on May 28, 2009 that it would \\"accept binding offers up to June 24, 2009, to acquire some or all of the Company's assets.\\" An auction was to be held on June 29, followed by a court hearing to approve the sale to the winning bidder or bidders. However, no other bids were placed for Midway's assets, and so the auction was canceled.

Ogrons are low-intelligence, ape-like hominids who live in scattered communities on the rocky planet Ograviss, on the outer fringes of the Milky Way, far from the central spaceways. The dominant lifeform on their home planet is a giant slug-like lizard named the Eater, which preys on and is prayed to by the Ogrons. Ogrons are hired mercenaries. Those who have employed their services include the Daleks and the Master when he was working for the Daleks. On some human planets, Ogrons are employed as police officers, usually led by a mentally augmented leader. Appearances In Day of the Daleks in an alternate 22nd century ruled by the Daleks, the Ogrons are used as police forces. At the end of the serial, Daleks and Ogrons travel back to attack a peace conference and make sure that their version of history remains intact. This force is destroyed by a bomb. In Frontier in Space, set in 2540, the Ogrons are used by the Master to attack spaceships of both Earth and Draconia, in an attempt to start a war between the two forces, so that the Daleks can conquer the galaxy. This serial shows the Ogrons' home planet. As well as the original Doctor Who television series, they appear in the Virgin Missing Adventures novel The Romance of Crime by Gareth Roberts, the New Adventures novels Shakedown and Mean Streets, both by Terrance Dicks, and the BBC Books novels Mission: Impractical by David A. McIntee, Interference by Lawrence Miles, and Warmonger by Terrence Dicks. In these books, it is explained that the Ogrons are only able to fly spacecraft via their powerful sense of mimicry. Interference states that Ogron speech also uses subsonic frequencies and that they are more intelligent than they appear to be from their audible speech alone. A mentally augmented Ogron named Garshak appears as a supporting character in both Shakedown and Mean Streets, first as police chief for the corrupt megacity on Megarra and later as a private detective. In Warmonger, a group of thirty Ogrons become the Doctor's personal bodyguards when he adopts the alias of \\"Supremo\\" while leading a large alliance of alien races against the renegade Time Lord Morbius, as he recognised that choosing bodyguards from any of his other alien allies would send an unintended message that he favoured one race over the others while assigning the task to individuals of each race would make them compete against each other, while the Ogrons were a small enough group that they could appear to have been specially chosen for the duty. In The Romance of Crime and Mission: Impractical, the Ogron homeworld is given the name Braah. Because of rapid changes in Braah's climate, the evolutionary path the Ogrons were on got confused, resulting in them being a mixture of primate and carnivore instincts. The Virgin New Adventure So Vile a Sin named it as Orestes. According to the Dalek Survival Guide, written by various Doctor Who novelists, the Ogrons have never named their planet, and a committee has proposed the name \\"the Ogron Planet\\". The Ogrons also appear, again in the employ of the Daleks, in the Big Finish Productions audio drama Return of the Daleks. The Ogrons, still under Dalek employ, return in Big Finish story Planet of the Ogrons. In this story it is revealed that the Daleks never originally used the Ogrons during the events of Day or Frontier. The Eighth Doctor (Paul McGann) is able to remember two versions of both events, with and without Ogron involvement. This is revealed to be because of the Time War as a result of Daleks interfering in the past. The story also features a character named Doctor Ogron (Jon Culshaw) initially believed to be a future incarnation of the Doctor, but who turns out to be a result of Dalek genetic experiments to create augmented Ogrons using Time Lord DNA. ;Television *Day of the Daleks (1 January ‚Äì 22 January 1972) *Carnival of Monsters (27 January ‚Äì 17 February 1973) *Frontier in Space (24 February ‚Äì 31 March 1973) *Dimensions in Time (1993) ;Novels *The Romance of Crime *Mission: Impractical *Shakedown *Interference *Warmonger *Mean Streets ;Audio drama *Return of the Daleks (released December 2006) *Planet of the Ogrons (released July 2018) ;Computer games *Dalek Attack (1992) ReferencesExternal links * Category:Doctor Who races Category:Daleks Category:Fictional mercenaries ","title":"Ogron"},{"id":"430276","text":"Four ships of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) have been named HMAS Yarra after the Yarra River in Victoria. *, a River-class torpedo boat destroyer commissioned into the Australian Commonwealth Naval Forces in 1910, transferred to the RAN on its foundation in 1911, operated until 1929, and scuttled *, a Grimsby-class sloop commissioned in 1936 and was lost on 4 March 1942 while defending a convoy from seven Japanese warships *, a River-class destroyer escort commissioned in 1961 and in service until 1985 *, a Huon- class minehunter commissioned in 2003 and in active service as of 2016 Battle honours Five battle honours have been awarded to ships named HMAS Yarra: *Rabaul 1914 *Adriatic 1917‚Äì18 *Libya 1941 *East Indies 1942 *Malaysia 1964‚Äì66 References Category:Royal Australian Navy ship names ","title":"HMAS Yarra"},{"id":"430278","title":"Tariq Abdul-Wahad"},{"id":"430279","text":"The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) issues an annual \\"Patenting by Organizations\\" report on the agency's web site.

Background Subliminal was born in Tel Aviv, Israel to a Persian Jewish mother and Tunisian Jewish father. Subliminal started performing music at age 12, and at age 15 met Yoav Eliasi. The two quickly became friends as a result of their mutual love of hip-hop. In 1995 the two began performing in Israeli clubs geared toward a hip-hop audience, wearing baggy clothes and gold chains. They quickly developed a following among the nation's youth, and soon put out their first album, \\"The Light From Zion\\". After the outbreak of the Second Intifada in 2000, the two began writing patriotic songs. They became known as creators of \\"Zionist hip-hop\\", a label still applied to them. In further contrast to the generally rebellious \\"outlaw\\" nature of most hip-hop, they also praise army service and eschew drugs and smoking. Being the son of Jewish refugees is at the core of Subliminal's hard-line politics. \\"In Tunisia, my father grew up with his family locking all the doors and windows whenever performing a Jewish ceremony -- out of fear of attacks.\\" Both parents, he says, \\"ran for their lives\\" to Israel, where they spent decades recovering from the persecution they had faced.Israeli Rapper Takes U.S. : Rolling Stone Subliminal and Ha'Tzel also helped discover the Palestinian rapper Tamer Nafar; they collaborated but eventually fell out over Subliminal and Nafar's political disagreement. The bitter end of their musical relationship is chronicled in the documentary film, Channels of Rage. In 2006 Subliminal collaborated with countertenor David D'Or for Koahsong \\"Ten Koah\\" (\\"Give Me Strength\\") on Subliminal's hip hop album, Just When You Thought it Was Over. In 2010 Subliminal married Ines Goldberg. Social impact Through lyrics and concerts, Subliminal and his rap group aim to inspire and encourage a new generation to stand as a unified Israeli nation. At many of his concerts, Subliminal begins by calling to the audience, \\"Who is proud to be a Zionist in the state of Israel, put your hands in the air! Hell yeah!\\"Joshua Mitnick, \\"Israeli Hip-Hop Takes on Mideast Politics,\\" USA Today, November 6, 2003. https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2003-11-06-hiphop-usat_x.htm. Subliminal can be seen at many of his concerts wearing American hip hop clothing and a large Star of David chain necklace. Journalist Joshua Mitnick writes that with Subliminal's patriotic, 2002 chart-topping album \\"Ha‚Äôor v‚ÄôHa‚Äôtzel\\" (The Light and the Shadow), > he transformed the Star of David into a fashion statement and helped > integrate the music of urban America into the fold of Israeli pop‚Ä¶ For > Subliminal, the music has generated tens of thousands of record sales.

Their food source is blood, a dietary trait called hematophagy. Three extant bat species feed solely on blood: the common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus), the hairy-legged vampire bat (Diphylla ecaudata), and the white-winged vampire bat (Diaemus youngi). All three species are native to the Americas, ranging from Mexico to Brazil, Chile, Uruguay and Argentina. Taxonomy Due to differences among the three species, each has been placed within a different genus, each consisting of one extant species. In the older literature, these three genera were placed within a family of their own, Desmodontidae, but taxonomists have now grouped them as a subfamily, Desmodontinae, in the New World leaf-nosed bat family, Phyllostomidae. The three known species of vampire bats all seem more similar to one another than to any other species. That suggests that hematophagy (feeding on blood) evolved only once, and the three species share this common ancestor. The placement of the three genera of the subfamily Desmodontinae within the New World leaf-nosed bat family Phyllostomidae Gray, 1825, may be summarized as: * subfamily Desmodontinae ** genus Desmodus *** Desmodus archaeodaptes, extinct, *** Desmodus draculae, extinct, *** Desmodus puntajudensis (Desmodus rotundus puntajudensis) extinct, *** Desmodus rotundus, *** Desmodus stocki, extinct. ** genus Diphylla *** Diphylla ecaudata ** genus Diaemus *** Diaemus youngi Evolution Vampire bats are in a diverse family of bats that consume many food sources, including nectar, pollen, insects, fruit and meat. The three species of vampire bats are the only mammals that have evolved to feed exclusively on blood (hematophagy) as micropredators, a strategy within parasitism. Hematophagy is uncommon due to the number of challenges to overcome for success: a large volume of liquid potentially overwhelming the kidneys and bladder, the risk of iron poisoning, and coping with excess protein. There are multiple hypotheses for how vampire bats evolved. *They evolved from frugivorous bats with sharp teeth specialized for piercing fruit *They initially fed on the ectoparasites of large mammals, and then progressed to feeding on the mammals themselvesGillette, D. D. 1975. Evolution of feeding strategies in bats. Tebiwa 18: 39‚Äì48 (similar to red- billed oxpecker feeding behavior) *They initially fed on insects that were attracted to the wounds of animals, and then progressed to feeding on the wounds *They initially preyed on small arboreal vertebrates *They were arboreal omnivores themselves and began ingesting blood and flesh from wound sites of larger animalsSchutt, W. A., Jr. 1998. Chiropteran hindlimb morphology and the origin of blood-feeding in bats. In T. H. Kunz, and P. A. Racey (eds.), Bat biology and conservation: 157‚Äì168. Washington D.C.: Smithsonian Inst. *They were specialized nectar-feeders that evolved to feed on another type of liquid The vampire bat lineage diverged from its family 26 million years ago. The hairy-legged vampire bat likely diverged from the other two species of vampire bats 21.7 million years ago. Because the hairy-legged vampire bat feeds on bird blood and it is the ancestral vampire bat, it is considered likely that the first vampire bats fed on bird blood as well. Recent analyses suggest that vampire bats arose from insectivores, which discount the frugivore, carnivore, and nectarivore hypotheses of origin. Within 4 million years of diverging from other Phyllostomids, vampire bats had evolved all necessary adaptations for blood-feeding, making it one of the fastest examples of natural selection among mammals. Anatomy and physiology A vampire bat skeleton, showing the distinctive incisors and canines Unlike fruit bats, the vampire bats have short, conical muzzles. They also lack a nose leaf, instead having naked pads with U-shaped grooves at the tip. The common vampire bat, Desmodus rotundus, also has specialized thermoreceptors on its nose, which aid the animal in locating areas where the blood flows close to the skin of its prey. A nucleus has been found in the brain of vampire bats that has a similar position and similar histology to the infrared receptor of infrared-sensing snakes.* A vampire bat has front teeth that are specialized for cutting and the back teeth are much smaller than in other bats. The inferior colliculus, the part of the bat's brain that processes sound, is well adapted to detecting the regular breathing sounds of sleeping animals that serve as its main food source. While other bats have almost lost the ability to maneuver on land, vampire bats can walk, jump, and even run by using a unique, bounding gait, in which the forelimbs instead of the hindlimbs are recruited for force production, as the wings are much more powerful than the legs. This ability to run seems to have evolved independently within the bat lineage.Riskin, Daniel K. and John W. Hermanson. 2005. Biomechanics: Independent evolution of running in vampire bats. Nature 434: 292‚Äì292. Abstract, video. Vampire bats also have a high level of resistance to a group of bloodborne viruses known as endogenous retroviruses, which insert copies of their genetic material into their host's genome. Vampire bats use infrared radiation to locate blood hotspots on their prey. A recent study has shown that common vampire bats tune a TRP-channel that is already heat-sensitive, TRPV1, by lowering its thermal activation threshold to about 30 ¬∞C. This is achieved through alternative splicing of TRPV1 transcripts to produce a channel with a truncated carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic domain. These splicing events occur exclusively in trigeminal ganglia, and not in dorsal root ganglia, thereby maintaining a role for TRPV1 as a detector of noxious heat in somatic afferents. The only other vertebrates capable of detecting infrared radiation are boas, pythons and pit vipers, all of which have pit organs. Ecology and lifecycle Vampire bats tend to live in colonies in almost completely dark places, such as caves, old wells, hollow trees, and buildings. They range in Central to South America and live in arid to humid, tropical and subtropical areas. Vampire bat colony numbers can range from single digits to hundreds in roosting sites. The basic social structure of roosting bats is made of female groups and their offspring, a few adult males, known as \\"resident males\\", and a separate group of males, known as \\"nonresident males\\". In hairy-legged vampire bats, the hierarchical segregation of nonresident males appears less strict than in common vampire bats. Nonresident males are accepted into the harems when the ambient temperature lowers. This behavior suggests social thermoregulation. Resident males mate with the females in their harems, and it is less common for outside males to copulate with the females. Female offspring often remain in their natal groups. Several matrilines can be found in a group, as unrelated females regularly join groups. Male offspring tend to live in their natal groups until they are about two years old, sometimes being forcefully expelled by the resident adult males. Vampire bats form strong bonds with other members of the colony. A related unique adaptation of vampire bats is the sharing of food. A vampire bat can only survive about two days without a meal of blood, yet they cannot be guaranteed of finding food every night. This poses a problem, so when a bat fails to find food, it will often \\"beg\\" another bat for food. A \\"donor\\" bat may regurgitate a small amount of blood to sustain the other member of the colony. For equally familiar bats, the predictive capacity of reciprocity surpasses that of relatedness. This finding suggests that vampire bats are capable of preferentially aiding their relatives, but that they may benefit more from forming reciprocal, cooperative relationships with relatives and non-relatives alike. Furthermore, donor bats were more likely to approach starving bats and initiate the food sharing. When individuals of a population are lost, bats with a larger number of mutual donors tend to offset their own energetic costs at a higher rate than bats that fed less of the colony before the removal. Individuals that spend their own energy as a social investment of sorts are more likely to thrive, and higher rates of survival incentivize the behavior and reinforce the importance of large social networks in colonies. These findings contradict the harassment hypothesis‚Äîwhich claims that individuals share food in order to limit harassment by begging individuals. All considered, vampire bat research should be interpreted cautiously as much of the evidence is correlational and still requires further testing. Another ability that some vampire bats possess is identifying and monitoring the positions of conspecifics (individuals of the same species) simply by antiphonal calling. Similar in nature to the sound mother bats make to call to their pups, these calls tend to vary on a bat to bat basis which may help other bats identify individuals both in and outside of their roost. Vampire bats also engage in social grooming. It usually occurs between females and their offspring, but it is also significant between adult females. Social grooming is mostly associated with food sharing. Feeding A vampire bat feeding on a pig (taxidermy specimens) Vampire bats hunt only when it is fully dark. Like fruit-eating bats, and unlike insectivorous and fish-eating bats, they emit only low-energy sound pulses. The common vampire bat feeds primarily on the blood of mammals (occasionally including humans), whereas both the hairy-legged vampire bat and white-winged vampire bat feed primarily on the blood of birds. Once the common vampire bat locates a host, such as a sleeping mammal, it lands and approaches it on the ground. It then likely uses thermoception to identify a warm spot on the skin to bite. They then create a small incision with their teeth and lap up blood from the wound. Vampire bats, like snakes, have developed highly sensitive thermosensation, with specialized systems for detecting infrared radiation. Snakes co-opt a non-heat-sensitive channel, vertebrate TRPA1 (transient receptor potential cation channel A1), to produce an infrared detector. However, vampire bats tune a channel that is already heat-sensitive, TRPV1, by lowering its thermal activation threshold to about 30 ¬∞C, which allows them to sense the target. As noted by Arthur M. Greenhall:If there is fur on the skin of the host, the common vampire bat uses its canine and cheek teeth like a barber's blades to shave away the hairs. The bat's razor-sharp upper incisor teeth then make a 7mm wide and 8mm deep cut. The upper incisors lack enamel, which keeps them permanently razor sharp.Greenhall, Arthur M. (1988) \\"Feeding Behavior\\". In: Natural History of Vampire Bats (ed. by A. M. Greenhall and U. Schmidt), 111‚Äì132. Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press. Their teeth are so sharp, even handling their skulls in a museum can result in cuts. The bat's saliva, left in the victim's resulting bite wound, has a key function in feeding from the wound. The saliva contains several compounds that prolong bleeding, such as anticoagulants that inhibit blood clotting, and compounds that prevent the constriction of blood vessels near the wound. Digestion A typical female vampire bat weighs 40 grams and can consume over 20 grams (1 fluid ounce) of blood in a 20-minute feed. This feeding behavior is facilitated by its anatomy and physiology for rapid processing and digestion of the blood to enable the animal to take flight soon after the feeding. The stomach and intestine rapidly absorb the water in the blood meal, which is quickly transported to the kidneys, and on to the bladder for excretion. A common vampire bat begins to expel urine within two minutes of feeding. While shedding much of the blood's liquid facilitates flight takeoff, the bat still has added almost 20‚Äì30% of its body weight in blood. To take off from the ground, the bat generates extra lift by crouching and flinging itself into the air. Typically, within two hours of setting out in search of food, the common vampire bat returns to its roost and settles down to spend the rest of the night digesting its meal. Digestion is aided by their microbiome, and their genome protects them against pathogens in the blood. Human health Common vampire bat at the Louisville Zoo Although rare, infection of humans by rabies from vampire bat bites has been documented; for example in 2010 four children in Peru died after being bitten. The highest occurrence of rabies in vampire bats occurs in the large populations found in South America. However, the risk of infection to the human population is less than to livestock exposed to bat bites.http://www.si.edu/Encyclopedia_SI/nmnh/batfacts.htm Only 0.5% of bats carry rabies, and those that do may be clumsy, disoriented, and unable to fly. The unique properties of the vampire bats' saliva have found some positive use in medicine. A study in the January 10, 2003, issue of Stroke: Journal of the American Heart Association tested a genetically engineered drug called desmoteplase, which uses the anticoagulant properties of the saliva of Desmodus rotundus, and was shown to increase blood flow in stroke patients.

The brutality of his murder and the fact that his killers were acquitted drew attention to the long history of violent persecution of African Americans in the United States. Till posthumously became an icon of the civil rights movement. Till was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois. During summer vacation in August 1955, he was visiting relatives near Money, in the Mississippi Delta region. He spoke to 21-year-old Carolyn Bryant, the white married proprietor of a small grocery store there. Although what happened at the store is a matter of dispute, Till was accused of flirting with or whistling at Bryant. In 1955, Bryant had testified that Till made physical and verbal advances. The jury did not hear Bryant's testimony, due to the judge ruling it inadmissible. Decades later, historian Timothy Tyson interviewed Bryant and wrote a book in which he claimed that she had disclosed that she had fabricated part of the testimony regarding her interaction with Till, specifically the portion where she accused Till of grabbing her waist and uttering obscenities; \\"That part's not true,\\" Tyson claimed that Bryant stated in a 2008 interview with him. Till's interaction with Bryant, perhaps unwittingly if at all, violated the strictures of conduct for an African-American male interacting with a white woman in the Jim Crow-era South. Several nights after the incident in the store, Bryant's husband Roy and his half-brother J.W. Milam were armed when they went to Till's great-uncle's house and abducted the boy. They took him away and beat and mutilated him before shooting him in the head and sinking his body in the Tallahatchie River. Three days later, Till's body was discovered and retrieved from the river. Till's body was returned to Chicago where his mother insisted on a public funeral service with an open casketwhich was held at Roberts Temple Church of God in Christ. \\"The open-coffin funeral held by Mamie Till Bradley exposed the world to more than her son Emmett Till's bloated, mutilated body. Her decision focused attention not only on U.S. racism and the barbarism of lynching but also on the limitations and vulnerabilities of American democracy\\". Tens of thousands attended his funeral or viewed his open casket, and images of his mutilated body were published in black-oriented magazines and newspapers, rallying popular black support and white sympathy across the U.S. Intense scrutiny was brought to bear on the lack of black civil rights in Mississippi, with newspapers around the U.S. critical of the state. Although local newspapers and law enforcement officials initially decried the violence against Till and called for justice, they responded to national criticism by defending Mississippians, temporarily giving support to the killers. In September 1955, an all-white jury found Bryant and Milam not guilty of Till's kidnapping and murder. Protected against double jeopardy, the two men publicly admitted in a 1956 interview with Look magazine that they had killed Till. Till's murder was seen as a catalyst for the next phase of the civil rights movement. In December 1955, the Montgomery bus boycott began in Alabama and lasted more than a year, resulting eventually in a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that segregated buses were unconstitutional. According to historians, events surrounding Emmett Till's life and death continue to resonate. Some writers have suggested that almost every story about Mississippi returns to Till, or the Delta region in which he died, in \\"some spiritual, homing way\\".Houck and Grindy, pp. 4‚Äì5. An Emmett Till Memorial Commission was established in the early 21st century. The Sumner County Courthouse was restored and includes the Emmett Till Interpretive Center. Fifty-one sites in the Mississippi Delta are memorialized as associated with Till.  Early childhood  Emmett Till was born in 1941 in Chicago; he was the son of Mamie Carthan (1921‚Äì2003) and Louis Till (1922‚Äì1945). Emmett's mother Mamie was born in the small Delta town of Webb, Mississippi. The Delta region encompasses the large, multi-county area of northwestern Mississippi in the watershed of the Yazoo and Mississippi rivers. When Carthan was two years old, her family moved to Argo, Illinois, as part of the Great Migration of rural black families out of the South to the North to escape violence, lack of opportunity and unequal treatment under the law.Whitfield, p. 15. Argo received so many Southern migrants that it was named \\"Little Mississippi\\"; Carthan's mother's home was often used by other recent migrants as a way station while they were trying to find jobs and housing.Beito and Beito, p. 116. Mississippi was the poorest state in the U.S. in the 1950s, and the Delta counties were some of the poorest in Mississippi. Mamie Carthan was born in Tallahatchie County, where the average income per white household in 1949 was $690 (). For black families, the figure was $462 ().Whitaker (1963), p. 19. In the rural areas, economic opportunities for blacks were almost nonexistent. They were mostly sharecroppers who lived on land owned by whites. Blacks had essentially been disenfranchised and excluded from voting and the political system since 1890, when the white-dominated legislature passed a new constitution that raised barriers to voter registration. Whites had also passed ordinances establishing racial segregation and Jim Crow laws. Mamie largely raised Emmett with her mother; she and Louis Till separated in 1942 after she discovered that he had been unfaithful. Louis later abused her, choking her to unconsciousness, to which she responded by throwing scalding water at him.Till-Mobley and Benson, pp. 14‚Äì16. For violating court orders to stay away from Mamie, Louis Till was forced by a judge in 1943 to choose between jail or enlisting in the U.S. Army. In 1945, a few weeks before his son's fourth birthday, he was executed for the rape and murder of an Italian woman.Till-Mobley and Benson, p. 17.Houck and Grindy, pp. 134‚Äì135. At the age of six, Emmett contracted polio, which left him with a persistent stutter.Till-Mobley and Benson, pp. 36‚Äì38. Mamie and Emmett moved to Detroit, where she met and married \\"Pink\\" Bradley in 1951. Emmett preferred living in Chicago, so he returned there to live with his grandmother; his mother and stepfather rejoined him later that year. After the marriage dissolved in 1952, \\"Pink\\" Bradley returned alone to Detroit.Till- Mobley and Benson, pp. 56‚Äì58. The Chicago two-flat at 6427 S. St. Lawrence Avenue where Emmett Till lived with his mother in mid-1955 Mamie Till Bradley and Emmett lived together in a busy neighborhood in Chicago's South Side, near distant relatives. She began working as a civilian clerk for the U.S. Air Force for a better salary. She recalled that Emmett was industrious enough to help with chores at home, although he sometimes got distracted. His mother remembered that he did not know his own limitations at times. Following the couple's separation, Bradley visited Mamie and began threatening her. At eleven years old, Emmett, with a butcher knife in hand, told Bradley he would kill him if the man did not leave.Till-Mobley and Benson, pp. 59‚Äì60. Usually, however, Emmett was happy. He and his cousins and friends pulled pranks on each other (Emmett once took advantage of an extended car-ride when his friend fell asleep and placed the friend's underwear on his head), and they also spent their free time in pickup baseball games. He was a natty dresser and was often the center of attention among his peers.Till-Mobley and Benson, pp. 70‚Äì87.  Plans to visit relatives in Mississippi  In 1955, Emmett was stocky and muscular; he weighed about and stood tall. Mamie Till Bradley's uncle, 64-year-old Mose Wright, visited her and Emmett in Chicago during the summer and told Emmett stories about living in the Mississippi Delta. Emmett wanted to see for himself. Bradley was ready for a vacation and planned to take Emmett with her on a trip to visit relatives in Nebraska, but after he begged her to let him visit Wright instead, she relented. Wright planned to accompany Till with a cousin, Wheeler Parker; another cousin, Curtis Jones, would join them soon. Wright was a sharecropper and part-time minister who was often called \\"Preacher\\".Federal Bureau of Investigation (2006), p. 6. He lived in Money, Mississippi, a small town in the Delta that consisted of three stores, a school, a post office, a cotton gin, and a few hundred residents, north of Greenwood. Before Emmett departed for the Delta, his mother cautioned him that Chicago and Mississippi were two different worlds, and he should know how to behave in front of whites in the South.Hampton, p. 2. He assured her he understood.Till-Mobley and Benson, pp. 98‚Äì101. Statistics on lynchings began to be collected in 1882. Since that time, more than 500 African Americans have been killed by extrajudicial violence in Mississippi alone, and more than 3,000 across the South.Whitfield, p. 5. Most of the incidents took place between 1876 and 1930; though far less common by the mid-1950s, these racially motivated murders still occurred. Throughout the South, whites publicly prohibited interracial relationships as a means to maintain white supremacy. Even the suggestion of sexual contact between black men and white women could carry severe penalties for black men. A resurgence of the enforcement of such Jim Crow laws was evident following World War II, when African-American veterans started pressing for equal rights in the South.Whitaker (1963), pp. 2‚Äì10. Racial tensions increased after the United States Supreme Court's 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education to end segregation in public education, which it ruled as unconstitutional. Many segregationists believed the ruling would lead to interracial dating and marriage. Whites strongly resisted the court's ruling; one Virginia county closed all its public schools to prevent integration. Other jurisdictions simply ignored the ruling. In other ways, whites used stronger measures to keep blacks politically disenfranchised, which they had been since the turn of the century. Segregation in the South was used to constrain blacks forcefully from any semblance of social equality.Whitaker (1963), pp. 61‚Äì82. A week before Till arrived in Mississippi, a black activist named Lamar Smith was shot and killed in front of the county courthouse in Brookhaven for political organizing. Three white suspects were arrested, but they were soon released.Federal Bureau of Investigation (2006), p. 18.  Encounter between Till and Carolyn Bryant  The remains of Bryant's Grocery and Meat Market in 2009 Bryant's Grocery Mississippi Freedom Trail Marker, 2018 Till arrived in Money, Mississippi, on August 21, 1955. On August 24, he and cousin Curtis Jones skipped church where his great-uncle Mose Wright was preaching and joined some local boys as they went to Bryant's Grocery and Meat Market to buy candy. The teenagers were children of sharecroppers and had been picking cotton all day. The market mostly served the local sharecropper population and was owned by a white couple, 24-year-old Roy Bryant and his 21-year-old wife Carolyn. Carolyn was alone in the front of the store that day; her sister-in-law was in the rear of the store watching children. Jones left Till with the other boys while Jones played checkers across the street. The facts of what took place in the store are still disputed. According to what Jones said at the time, the other boys reported that Till had a photograph of an integrated class at the school he attended in Chicago,Accounts are unclear; Till had just completed the seventh grade at the all-black McCosh Elementary School in Chicago (Whitfield, p. 17). and Till bragged to the boys that the white children in the picture were his friends. He pointed to a white girl in the picture, or referred to a picture of a white girl that had come with his new wallet,FBI (2006), p. 44. and said she was his girlfriend and one or more of the local boys dared Till to speak to Bryant.Hampton, p. 3. However, writing a personal account of the incident in a book released in 2009, Till's cousin Simeon Wright, who was also present, disputed Jones' version of what happened on that day. According to Wright, Till did not have a photo of a white girl in his wallet and no one dared him to flirt with Bryant. Speaking in 2015, Wright said: \\"We didn't dare him to go to the store ‚Äì the white folk said that. They said that he had pictures of his white girlfriend. There were no pictures. They never talked to me. They never interviewed me.\\" The FBI report completed in 2006 notes \\"...[Curtis] Jones recanted his 1955 statements prior to his death and apologized to Mamie Till- Mobley\\". According to some versions, including comments from some of the kids standing outside the store,Timeline: The Murder of Emmett Till, PBS.org, accessed January 27, 2014. Till may have wolf-whistled at Bryant. Till's cousin, Simeon Wright, who was with him at the store stated Till whistled at Bryant, saying \\"I think [Emmett] wanted to get a laugh out of us or something\\", furthering \\"He was always joking around, and it was hard to tell when he was serious.\\" Wright stated that following the whistle he became immediately alarmed saying \\"Well, it scared us half to death\\", and: \\"You know, we were almost in shock. We couldn't get out of there fast enough, because we had never heard of anything like that before. A black boy whistling at a white woman? In Mississippi? No.\\" Wright stated \\"the Ku Klux Klan and night riders were part of our daily lives\\".Wright, pp. 50‚Äì51. Following his disappearance, a newspaper account stated that Till sometimes whistled to alleviate his stuttering.Metress, p. 20. His speech was sometimes unclear; his mother said he had particular difficulty with pronouncing \\"b\\" sounds, and he may have whistled to overcome problems asking for bubble gum.Whitfield, p. 18. She said that, to help with his articulation, she taught Till how to whistle softly to himself before pronouncing his words. During the murder trial,During trial, Carolyn Bryant's testimony was taken outside the presence of the jury. () Bryant testified that Till grabbed her hand while she was stocking candy and said, \\"How about a date, baby?\\" She said that after she freed herself from his grasp, the young man followed her to the cash register, grabbed her waist and said, \\"What's the matter baby, can't you take it?\\"Notes later obtained from the defense give a different story, with Bryant earlier claiming she was \\"insulted\\" but not mentioning him touching her. () Bryant said she freed herself, and Till said, \\"You needn't be afraid of me, baby\\", used \\"one 'unprintable' word\\" and said \\"I've been with white women before.\\"Federal Bureau of Investigation (2006), p. 40.Whitaker, Stephen (Summer 2005). \\"A Case Study in Southern Justice: The Murder and Trial of Emmett Till\\", (PDF) Rhetoric & Public Affairs 8 (2), pp. 189‚Äì224. Bryant also alleged that one of Till's companions came into the store, grabbed him by the arm, and ordered him to leave. According to historian Timothy Tyson, Bryant admitted to him in a 2008 interview that her testimony during the trial that Till had made verbal and physical advances was false. Bryant had testified Till grabbed her waist and uttered obscenities but later told Tyson \\"that part's not true\\". As for the rest of what happened, the 72-year-old stated she could not remember. Bryant is quoted by Tyson as saying \\"Nothing that boy did could ever justify what happened to him\\". However, the tape recordings that Tyson made of the interviews with Bryant do not contain Bryant saying those things. In addition, the woman with Bryant at the interviews, her daughter-in-law, Marsha Bryant, says that Bryant never told Tyson that. Decades later, Till's cousin Simeon Wright also challenged the account given by Carolyn Bryant at the trial.Douglas Linder, \\"The Emmett Till Murder Trial: An Account\\" (2012), University of Missouri-Kansas City, accessed January 28, 2014. Wright entered the store \\"less than a minute\\" after Till was left inside alone with Bryant, and he saw no inappropriate behavior and heard \\"no lecherous conversation\\". Wright said Till \\"paid for his items and we left the store together\\". In their 2006 investigation of the cold case, the FBI noted that a second anonymous source, who was confirmed to have been in the store at the same time as Till and his cousin, supported Wright's account. Author Devery Anderson writes that in an interview with the defense's attorneys, Bryant told a version of the initial encounter that included Till grabbing her hand and asking her for a date, but not Till approaching her and grabbing her waist, mentioning past relationships with white women, or having to be dragged unwillingly out of the store by another boy. Anderson further notes that many remarks prior to Till's kidnapping made by those involved indicate that it was his remarks to Bryant that angered his killers, rather than any alleged physical harassment. For instance, Mose Wright (a witness to the kidnapping) said that the kidnappers mentioned only \\"talk\\" at the store, and Sheriff George Smith only spoke of the arrested killers as accusing Till of \\"ugly remarks\\". Anderson suggests that this evidence taken together implies that the more extreme details of Bryant's story were invented after the fact as part of the defense's legal strategy. In any event, after Wright and Till left the store, Bryant went outside to retrieve a pistol from underneath the seat of a car. The teenagers saw her do this and left immediately. It was acknowledged that Till whistled while Bryant was going to her car. However, it is disputed whether Till whistled toward Bryant or toward a checkers game that was occurring just across the street. One of the other boys ran across the street to tell Curtis Jones what happened in the store. When the older man with whom Jones was playing checkers heard the story, he urged the boys to leave quickly, fearing violence. Bryant told others of the events at the store, and the story spread quickly. Jones and Till declined to tell his great-uncle Mose Wright, fearing they would get in trouble.Hampton, pp. 3‚Äì4. Till said he wanted to return home to Chicago. Carolyn's husband Roy Bryant was on an extended trip hauling shrimp to Texas and did not return home until August 27.Federal Bureau of Investigation (2006), p. 46. Historian Timothy Tyson said an investigation by civil rights activists concluded Carolyn Bryant did not initially tell her husband Roy Bryant about the encounter with Till, and that Roy was told by a person who hung around down at their store. Roy was reportedly angry at his wife for not telling him. Carolyn Bryant told the FBI she didn't tell her husband because she feared he would beat Till up.  Lynching  When Roy Bryant was informed of what had happened, he aggressively questioned several young black men who entered the store. That evening, Bryant, with a black man named J. W. Washington, approached a black teenager walking along a road. Bryant ordered Washington to seize the boy, put him in the back of a pickup truck, and took him to be identified by a companion of Carolyn's who had witnessed the episode with Till. Friends or parents vouched for the boy in Bryant's store, and Carolyn's companion denied that the boy Bryant and Washington seized was the one who had accosted her. Somehow, Bryant learned that the boy in the incident was from Chicago and was staying with Mose Wright.Some recollections of this part of the story relate that news of the incident traveled in both black and white communities very quickly. Others say that Carolyn Bryant refused to tell her husband about it. Till's oldest cousin Maurice Wright, perhaps put off by Till's bragging and clothes, told Roy Bryant at his store about Till's interaction with Bryant's wife. (Whitfield, p. 19.) Several witnesses overheard Bryant and his 36-year-old half-brother, John William \\"J. W.\\" Milam, discussing taking Till from his house.Federal Bureau of Investigation (2006), pp. 47‚Äì49. In the early morning hours‚Äîbetween 2:00 am and 3:30 am‚Äîon August 28, 1955, Bryant and Milam drove to Mose Wright's house. Milam was armed with a pistol and a flashlight. He asked Wright if he had three boys in the house from Chicago. Till was sharing a bed with another cousin; there were eight people in the small two-bedroom cabin. Milam asked Wright to take them to \\"the nigger who did the talking\\". Till's great-aunt offered the men money, but Milam refused as he rushed Emmett to put on his clothes. Mose Wright informed the men that Till was from up north and didn't know any better. Milam reportedly then asked, \\"How old are you, preacher?\\" to which Wright responded \\"64\\". Milam threatened that if Wright told anybody he wouldn't live to see 65. The men marched Till out to the truck. Wright said he heard them ask someone in the car if this was the boy, and heard someone say \\"yes\\". When asked if the voice was that of a man or a woman Wright said \\"it seemed like it was a lighter voice than a man's\\". In a 1956 interview with Look magazine, in which they confessed to the killing, Bryant and Milam said they would have brought Till by the store in order to have Carolyn identify him, but stated they did not do so because they said Till admitted to being the one who had talked to her. They tied up Till in the back of a green pickup truck and drove toward Money, Mississippi. According to some witnesses, they took Till back to Bryant's Groceries and recruited two black men. The men then drove to a barn in Drew. They pistol-whipped him on the way and reportedly knocked him unconscious. Willie Reed, who was 18 years old at the time, saw the truck passing by. Reed recalled seeing two white men in the front seat, and \\"two black males\\" in the back. Some have speculated that the two black men worked for Milam and were forced to help with the beating, although they later denied being present. Willie Reed said that while walking home, he heard the beating and crying from the barn. He told a neighbor and they both walked back up the road to a water well near the barn, where they were approached by Milam. Milam asked if they heard anything. Reed responded \\"No\\". Others passed by the shed and heard yelling. A local neighbor also spotted \\"Too Tight\\" (Leroy Collins) at the back of the barn washing blood off the truck and noticed Till's boot. Milam explained he had killed a deer and that the boot belonged to him. Some have claimed that Till was shot and tossed over the Black Bayou Bridge in Glendora, Mississippi, near the Tallahatchie River. The group drove back to Roy Bryant's home in Money, where they reportedly burned Emmett's clothes. In an interview with William Bradford Huie that was published in Look magazine in 1956, Bryant and Milam said they intended to beat Till and throw him off an embankment into the river to frighten him. They told Huie that while they were beating Till, he called them bastards, declared he was as good as they, and said that he had sexual encounters with white women. They put Till in the back of their truck, drove to a cotton gin to take a fan‚Äîthe only time they admitted to being worried, thinking that by this time in early daylight they would be spotted and accused of stealing‚Äîand drove for several miles along the river looking for a place to dispose of Till. They shot him by the river and weighted his body with the fan.Several major inconsistencies between what Bryant and Milam told interviewer William Bradford Huie and what they had told others were noted by the FBI in 2006. The pair of men told Huie they were sober, yet reported years later they had been drinking. In the interview, they said they had driven what would have been looking for a place to dispose of Till's body, to the cotton gin to obtain the fan, and back again, which the FBI noted would be impossible in the time they were witnessed having returned. Several witnesses recalled that they saw Bryant, Milam, and two or more black men with Till's beaten body in the back of the pickup truck in Glendora, yet they did not tell Huie they were in Glendora. (FBI, [2006], pp. 86‚Äì96.) Mose Wright stayed on his front porch for twenty minutes waiting for Till to return. He did not go back to bed. He and another man went into Money, got gasoline, and drove around trying to find Till. Unsuccessful, they returned home by 8:00 am.Federal Bureau of Investigation (2006), pp. 55‚Äì57. After hearing from Wright that he would not call the police because he feared for his life, Curtis Jones placed a call to the Leflore County sheriff, and another to his mother in Chicago. Distraught, she called Emmett's mother Mamie Till Bradley.Hampton, p. 4. Wright and his wife Elizabeth drove to Sumner, where Elizabeth's brother contacted the sheriff.Whitfield, p. 21. Bryant and Milam were questioned by Leflore County sheriff, George Smith. They admitted they had taken the boy from his great-uncle's yard but claimed they had released him the same night in front of Bryant's store. Bryant and Milam were arrested for kidnapping.Federal Bureau of Investigation (2006), p. 68. Word got out that Till was missing, and soon Medgar Evers, Mississippi state field secretary for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and Amzie Moore, head of the Bolivar County chapter, became involved. They disguised themselves as cotton pickers and went into the cotton fields in search of any information that might help find Till.Hampton, p. 6. Three days after his abduction and murder, Till's swollen and disfigured body was found by two boys who were fishing in the Tallahatchie River. His head was very badly mutilated, he had been shot above the right ear, an eye was dislodged from the socket, there was evidence that he had been beaten on the back and the hips, and his body weighted by a fan blade, which was fastened around his neck with barbed wire. He was nude, but wearing a silver ring with the initials \\"L. T.\\" and \\"May 25, 1943\\" carved in it.Federal Bureau of Investigation (2006), pp. 69‚Äì79.Many years later, there were allegations that Till had been castrated. (Mitchell, 2007) John Cothran, the deputy sheriff who was at the scene where Till was removed from the river testified, however, that apart from the decomposition typical of a body being submerged in water, his genitals had been intact. (FBI [2006]: Appendix Court transcript, p. 176.) Mamie Till-Mobley also confirmed this in her memoirs. (Till-Bradley and Benson, p. 135.) His face was unrecognizable due to trauma and having been submerged in water. Mose Wright was called to the river to identify Till. The silver ring that Till was wearing was removed and returned to Wright and next passed on to the district attorney as evidence.  Funeral and reaction  Mamie Till at Emmett's funeral Although lynchings and racially motivated murders had occurred throughout the South for decades, the circumstances surrounding Till's murder and the timing acted as a catalyst to attract national attention to the case of a 14-year-old boy who had allegedly been killed for breaching a social caste system. Till's murder aroused feelings about segregation, law enforcement, relations between the North and South, the social status quo in Mississippi, the activities of the NAACP and the White Citizens' Councils, and the Cold War, all of which were played out in a drama staged in newspapers all over the U.S. and abroad.Houck and Grindy, p. 6. After Till went missing, a three-paragraph story was printed in the Greenwood Commonwealth and quickly picked up by other Mississippi newspapers. They reported on his death when the body was found. The next day, when a picture of him his mother had taken the previous Christmas showing them smiling together appeared in the Jackson Daily News and Vicksburg Evening Post, editorials and letters to the editor were printed expressing shame at the people who had caused Till's death. One read, \\"Now is the time for every citizen who loves the state of Mississippi to 'Stand up and be counted' before hoodlum white trash brings us to destruction.\\" The letter said that Negroes were not the downfall of Mississippi society, but whites like those in White Citizens' Councils that condoned violence.Houck and Grindy, pp. 19‚Äì21. Till's body was clothed, packed in lime, placed into a pine coffin and prepared for burial. It may have been embalmed while in Mississippi. Mamie Till Bradley demanded that the body be sent to Chicago; she later said that she worked to halt an immediate burial in Mississippi and called several local and state authorities in Illinois and Mississippi to make sure that her son was returned to Chicago.Hampton, p. 5. A doctor did not examine Till post-mortem.Federal Bureau of Investigation (2006), pp. 80‚Äì81. Mississippi's governor, Hugh L. White, deplored the murder, asserting that local authorities should pursue a \\"vigorous prosecution\\". He sent a telegram to the national offices of the NAACP promising a full investigation and assuring them \\"Mississippi does not condone such conduct\\". Delta residents, both black and white, also distanced themselves from Till's murder, finding the circumstances abhorrent. Local newspaper editorials denounced the murderers without question.Beito and Beito, p. 118. Leflore County Deputy Sheriff John Cothran stated, \\"The white people around here feel pretty mad about the way that poor little boy was treated, and they won't stand for this.\\"Whitfield, pp. 23‚Äì26. Soon, however, discourse about Till's murder became more complex. Robert B. Patterson, executive secretary of the segregationist White Citizens' Council, used Till's death to claim that racial segregation policies were to provide for blacks' safety and that their efforts were being neutralized by the NAACP. In response, NAACP executive secretary Roy Wilkins characterized the incident as a lynching and said that Mississippi was trying to maintain white supremacy through murder. He said, \\"there is in the entire state no restraining influence of decency, not in the state capital, among the daily newspapers, the clergy, nor any segment of the so-called better citizens.\\"Metress, pp. 16‚Äì20. Mamie Till Bradley told a reporter that she would seek legal aid to help law enforcement find her son's killers and that the State of Mississippi should share the financial responsibility. She was misquoted; it was reported as \\"Mississippi is going to pay for this.\\"Houck and Grindy, pp. 22‚Äì24. Till's mutilated corpse on display. His mother had insisted on an open-casket funeral. Images of Till's body, printed in The Chicago Defender and Jet magazine, made international news and directed attention to the lack of rights of blacks in the U.S. South. The A. A. Rayner Funeral Home in Chicago received Till's body. Upon arrival, Bradley insisted on viewing it to make a positive identification, later stating that the stench from it was noticeable two blocks away.Till-Mobley and Benson, p. 132. She decided to have an open-casket funeral, saying: \\"There was just no way I could describe what was in that box. No way. And I just wanted the world to see.\\" Tens of thousands of people lined the street outside the mortuary to view Till's body, and days later thousands more attended his funeral at Roberts Temple Church of God in Christ. Photographs of his mutilated corpse circulated around the country, notably appearing in Jet magazine and The Chicago Defender, both black publications, generating intense public reaction. According to The Nation and Newsweek, Chicago's black community was \\"aroused as it has not been over any similar act in recent history\\".Whitfield, p. 23.When Jet publisher John H. Johnson died in 2005, people who remembered his career considered his decision to publish Till's open-casket photograph his greatest moment. Michigan congressman Charles Diggs recalled that for the emotion the image stimulated, it was \\"probably one of the greatest media products in the last 40 or 50 years\\". (Dewan, 2005) Time later selected one of the Jet photographs showing Mamie Till over the mutilated body of her dead son, as one of the 100 \\"most influential images of all time\\": \\"For almost a century, African Americans were lynched with regularity and impunity. Now, thanks to a mother's determination to expose the barbarousness of the crime, the public could no longer pretend to ignore what they couldn't see.\\" Till was buried on September 6 in Burr Oak Cemetery in Alsip, Illinois. News about Emmett Till spread to both coasts. Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley and Illinois Governor William Stratton also became involved, urging Mississippi Governor White to see that justice be done. The tone in Mississippi newspapers changed dramatically. They falsely reported riots in the funeral home in Chicago. Bryant and Milam appeared in photos smiling and wearing military uniforms,Houck and Grindy, p. 29. and Carolyn Bryant's beauty and virtue were extolled. Rumors of an invasion of outraged blacks and northern whites were printed throughout the state, and were taken seriously by the Leflore County Sheriff. T. R. M. Howard, a local businessman, surgeon, and civil rights proponent and one of the wealthiest blacks in the state, warned of a \\"second civil war\\" if \\"slaughtering of Negroes\\" was allowed.Houck and Grindy, pp. 31‚Äì37. Following Roy Wilkins' comments, white opinion began to shift. According to historian Stephen Whitfield, a specific brand of xenophobia in the South was particularly strong in Mississippi. Whites were urged to reject the influence of Northern opinion and agitation.Whitfield, pp. 28‚Äì30. This independent attitude was profound enough in Tallahatchie County that it earned the nickname \\"The Freestate of Tallahatchie\\", according to a former sheriff, \\"because people here do what they damn well please\\", making the county often difficult to govern.Whitaker (1963), pp. 21‚Äì22. Tallahatchie County Sheriff Clarence Strider, who initially positively identified Till's body and stated that the case against Milam and Bryant was \\"pretty good\\", on September 3 announced his doubts that the body pulled from the Tallahatchie River was that of Till. He speculated that the boy was probably still alive. Strider suggested that the recovered body had been planted by the NAACP: a corpse stolen by T. R. M. Howard, who colluded to place Till's ring on it.Beito and Beito, p. 119. Strider changed his account after comments were published in the press denigrating the people of Mississippi, later saying: \\"The last thing I wanted to do was to defend those peckerwoods. But I just had no choice about it.\\"Following the trial, Strider told a television reporter that should anyone who had sent him hate mail arrive in Mississippi, \\"the same thing's gonna happen to them that happened to Emmett Till\\". (Whitfield, p. 44.) Bryant and Milam were indicted for murder. The state's prosecuting attorney, Hamilton Caldwell, was not confident that he could get a conviction in a case of white violence against a black male accused of insulting a white woman. A local black paper was surprised at the indictment and praised the decision, as did the New York Times. The high- profile comments published in Northern newspapers and by the NAACP were of concern to the prosecuting attorney, Gerald Chatham; he worried that his office would not be able to secure a guilty verdict, despite the compelling evidence. Having limited funds, Bryant and Milam initially had difficulty finding attorneys to represent them, but five attorneys at a Sumner law firm offered their services pro bono. Their supporters placed collection jars in stores and other public places in the Delta, eventually gathering $10,000 for the defense.Whitfield, p. 34.  Trial  The trial was held in the county courthouse in Sumner, the western seat of Tallahatchie County, because Till's body was found in this area. Sumner had one boarding house; the small town was besieged by reporters from all over the country. David Halberstam called the trial \\"the first great media event of the civil rights movement\\".Dewan, Shaila (August 28, 2005). \\"How Photos Became Icon of Civil Rights Movement\\", The New York Times. Retrieved October 5, 2010. A reporter who had covered the trials of Bruno Hauptmann and Machine Gun Kelly remarked that this was the most publicity for any trial he had ever seen. No hotels were open to black visitors. Mamie Till Bradley arrived to testify, and the trial also attracted black congressman Charles Diggs from Michigan. Bradley, Diggs, and several black reporters stayed at T. R. M. Howard's home in Mound Bayou. Located on a large lot and surrounded by Howard's armed guards, it resembled a compound. The day before the start of the trial, a young black man named Frank Young arrived to tell Howard he knew of two witnesses to the crime. Levi \\"Too Tight\\" Collins and Henry Lee Loggins were black employees of Leslie Milam, J. W.'s brother, in whose shed Till was beaten. Collins and Loggins were spotted with J. W. Milam, Bryant, and Till. The prosecution team was unaware of Collins and Loggins. Sheriff Strider, however, booked them into the Charleston, Mississippi, jail to keep them from testifying.Beito and Beito, pp. 121‚Äì122. The trial was held in September 1955 and lasted for five days; attendees remembered that the weather was very hot. The courtroom was filled to capacity with 280 spectators; black attendees sat in segregated sections.Whitfield, p. 38. Press from major national newspapers attended, including black publications; black reporters were required to sit in the segregated black section and away from the white press, farther from the jury. Sheriff Strider welcomed black spectators coming back from lunch with a cheerful, \\"Hello, Niggers!\\"Beito and Beito, p. 122.

Photojournalist Ernest Withers defied the judge's orders banning photography during the trial to capture this shot. The defense sought to cast doubt on the identity of the body pulled from the river. They said it could not be positively identified, and they questioned whether Till was dead at all. The defense also asserted that although Bryant and Milam had taken Till from his great-uncle's house, they had released him that night. The defense attorneys attempted to prove that Mose Wright‚Äîwho was addressed as \\"Uncle Mose\\" by the prosecution and \\"Mose\\" by the defense‚Äîcould not identify Bryant and Milam as the men who took Till from his cabin. They noted that only Milam's flashlight had been in use that night, and no other lights in the house were turned on. Milam and Bryant had identified themselves to Wright the evening they took Till; Wright said he had only seen Milam clearly. Wright's testimony was considered remarkably courageous. It may have been the first time in the South that a black man had testified to the guilt of a white man in court‚Äîand lived. Journalist James Hicks, who worked for the black news wire service, the National Negro Publishers Association (later renamed the National Newspaper Publishers Association), was present in the courtroom; he was especially impressed that Wright stood to identify Milam, pointing to him and saying \\"There he is\\",The trial transcript says \\"There he is\\", although witnesses recall variations of \\"Dar he\\", \\"Thar he\\", or \\"Thar's the one\\". Wright's family protested that Mose Wright was made to sound illiterate by newspaper accounts and insist he said \\"There he is.\\" (Mitchell, 2007) calling it a historic moment and one filled with \\"electricity\\".Hampton, p. 11. A writer for the New York Post noted that following his identification, Wright sat \\"with a lurch which told better than anything else the cost in strength to him of the thing he had done\\".Whitfield, p. 39. A reporter who covered the trial for the New Orleans Times-Picayune said it was \\"the most dramatic thing I saw in my career\\".Mitchell, Jerry (February 19, 2007). \\"Re-examining Emmett Till case could help separate fact, fiction\\", USA Today [originally published in the Jackson Clarion-Ledger]. Retrieved October 1, 2010. Mamie Till Bradley testified that she had instructed her son to watch his manners in Mississippi and that should a situation ever come to his being asked to get on his knees to ask forgiveness of a white person, he should do it without a thought. The defense questioned her identification of her son in the casket in Chicago and a $400 life insurance policy she had taken out on him.Beito and Beito, pp. 124‚Äì126. While the trial progressed, Leflore County Sheriff George Smith, Howard, and several reporters, both black and white, attempted to locate Collins and Loggins. They could not, but found three witnesses who had seen Collins and Loggins with Milam and Bryant on Leslie Milam's property. Two of them testified that they heard someone being beaten, blows, and cries. One testified so quietly the judge ordered him several times to speak louder; he said he heard the victim call out: \\"Mama, Lord have mercy. Lord have mercy.\\"Whitfield, p. 40. Judge Curtis Swango allowed Carolyn Bryant to testify, but not in front of the jury, after the prosecution objected that her testimony was irrelevant to Till's abduction and murder. It may have been leaked in any case to the jury. Sheriff Strider testified for the defense his theory that Till was alive, and that the body retrieved from the river was white. A doctor from Greenwood stated on the stand that the body was too decomposed to identify, and therefore had been in the water too long for it to be Till.Beito and Beito, p. 126. In the concluding statements, one prosecuting attorney said that what Till did was wrong, but that his action warranted a spanking, not murder. Gerald Chatham passionately called for justice and mocked the sheriff and doctor's statements that alluded to a conspiracy. Mamie Bradley indicated she was very impressed with his summation. The defense stated that the prosecution's theory of the events the night Till was murdered was improbable, and said the jury's \\"forefathers would turn over in their graves\\" if they convicted Bryant and Milam. Only three outcomes were possible in Mississippi for capital murder: life imprisonment, the death penalty, or acquittal. On September 23 the all-white, all-male jury (both women and blacks had been banned)A PBS documentary on the murder of Emmett Till. acquitted both defendants after a 67-minute deliberation; one juror said, \\"If we hadn't stopped to drink pop, it wouldn't have taken that long.\\"Whitfield, pp. 41‚Äì42.Note: Blacks were generally excluded from juries because they were disenfranchised; jurors were drawn only from registered voters. In post-trial analyses, blame for the outcome varied. Mamie Till Bradley was criticized for not crying enough on the stand. The jury was noted to have been picked almost exclusively from the hill country section of Tallahatchie County, which, due to its poorer economic make-up, found whites and blacks competing for land and other agrarian opportunities. Unlike the population living closer to the river (and thus closer to Bryant and Milam in Leflore County), who possessed a noblesse oblige outlook toward blacks, according to historian Stephen Whitaker, those in the eastern part of the county were virulent in their racism. The prosecution was criticized for dismissing any potential juror who knew Milam or Bryant personally, for fear that such a juror would vote to acquit. Afterward, Whitaker noted that this had been a mistake, as those who knew the defendants usually disliked them. One juror voted twice to convict, but on the third discussion, voted with the rest of the jury to acquit.Rubin, Richard (July 21, 2005). \\"The Ghosts of Emmett Till\\", New York Times Magazine. Retrieved October 3, 2010. In later interviews, the jurors acknowledged that they knew Bryant and Milam were guilty, but simply did not believe that life imprisonment or the death penalty were fit punishment for whites who had killed a black man.Beito and Beito, p. 128. But two jurors said as late as 2005 that they believed the defense's case. They said that the prosecution had not proved that Till had died, nor that it was his body that was removed from the river. In November 1955, a grand jury declined to indict Bryant and Milam for kidnapping, despite their own admissions of having taken Till. Mose Wright and a young man named Willie Reed, who testified to seeing Milam enter the shed from which screams and blows were heard, both testified in front of the grand jury.Whitfield, pp. 48‚Äì49. After the trial, T. R. M. Howard paid the costs of relocating to Chicago for Wright, Reed, and another black witness who testified against Milam and Bryant, in order to protect the three witnesses from reprisals for having testified.Beito and Beito, p. 127. Reed, who later changed his name to Willie Louis to avoid being found, continued to live in the Chicago area until his death on July 18, 2013. He avoided publicity and even kept his history secret from his wife until she was told by a relative. Reed began to speak publicly about the case in the PBS documentary The Murder of Emmett Till aired in 2003.Fox, Margalit, \\"Willie Louis, Who Named the Killers of Emmett Till at Their Trial, Dies at 76\\". The New York Times. July 24, 2013.  Media discourse  Newspapers in major international cities and religious, and socialist publications reported outrage about the verdict and strong criticism of American society. Southern newspapers, particularly in Mississippi, wrote that the court system had done its job.Whitfield, pp. 46‚Äì47. Till's story continued to make the news for weeks following the trial, sparking debate in newspapers, among the NAACP and various high-profile segregationists about justice for blacks and the propriety of Jim Crow society. In October 1955, the Jackson Daily News reported facts about Till's father that had been suppressed by the U.S. military. While serving in Italy, Louis Till raped two women and killed a third. He was court-martialed and executed by hanging by the Army near Pisa in July 1945. Mamie Till Bradley and her family knew none of this, having been told only that Louis had been killed for \\"willful misconduct\\". Mississippi senators James Eastland and John C. Stennis probed Army records and revealed Louis Till's crimes. Although Emmett Till's murder trial was over, news about his father was carried on the front pages of Mississippi newspapers for weeks in October and November 1955. This renewed debate about Emmett Till's actions and Carolyn Bryant's integrity. Stephen Whitfield writes that the lack of attention paid to identifying or finding Till is \\"strange\\" compared to the amount of published discourse about his father.Whitfield, p. 117. According to historians Davis Houck and Matthew Grindy, \\"Louis Till became a most important rhetorical pawn in the high-stakes game of north versus south, black versus white, NAACP versus White Citizens' Councils\\". In 2016, reviewing the facts of the rapes and murder for which Louis Till had been executed, John Edgar Wideman posited that, given the timing of the publicity about Emmett's father, although the defendants had already confessed to taking Emmett from his uncle's house, the post-murder trial grand jury refused to even indict them for kidnapping. Wideman also presented evidence suggesting that the conviction and punishment of Louis Till may have been racially motivated. Protected against double jeopardy, Bryant and Milam struck a deal with Look magazine in 1956 to tell their story to journalist William Bradford Huie for between $3,600 and $4,000. The interview took place in the law firm of the attorneys who had defended Bryant and Milam. Huie did not ask the questions; Bryant and Milam's own attorneys did. Neither attorney had heard their clients' accounts of the murder before. According to Huie, the older Milam was more articulate and sure of himself than the younger Bryant. Milam admitted to shooting Till and neither of them believed they were guilty or that they had done anything wrong.Whitfield, p. 52. Quote from Milam on why he killed Till. Displayed at the National Civil Rights Museum, Memphis, Tennessee Reaction to Huie's interview with Bryant and Milam was explosive. Their brazen admission that they had murdered Till caused prominent civil rights leaders to push the federal government harder to investigate the case. Till's murder contributed to congressional passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1957: it authorized the U.S. Department of Justice to intervene in local law enforcement issues when individual civil rights were being compromised. Huie's interview, in which Milam and Bryant said they had acted alone, overshadowed inconsistencies in earlier versions of the stories. As a consequence, details about others who had possibly been involved in Till's abduction and murder, or the subsequent cover-up, were forgotten, according to historians David and Linda Beito.Beito and Beito, pp. 150‚Äì151.A month after Huie's article appeared in Look, T. R. M. Howard worked with Olive Arnold Adams of The New York Age to publish a version of the events that agreed more with the testimony at the trial and what Howard had been told by Frank Young. It appeared as a booklet titled Time Bomb: Mississippi Exposed and the Full Story of Emmett Till. Howard also acted as a source for an as-yet unidentified reporter using the pseudonym Amos Dixon in the California Eagle. Dixon wrote a series of articles implicating three black men, and Leslie Milam, whom he reported had participated in Till's murder in some way. Time Bomb and Dixon's articles had no lasting effect in the shaping of public opinion. Huie's article in the far more widely circulated Look became the most commonly accepted version of events. (Beito and Beito, pp. 150‚Äì151.)  Later events  Till's murder increased fears in the local black community that they would be subjected to violence and the law would not protect them. According to Deloris Melton Gresham, whose father was killed a few months after Till, \\"At that time, they used to say that 'it's open season on n*****s.' Kill'em and get away with it.\\" After Bryant and Milam admitted to Huie that they had killed Till, the support base of the two men eroded in Mississippi.Hampton, pp. 13‚Äì14. Many of their former friends and supporters, including those who had contributed to their defense funds, cut them off. Blacks boycotted their shops, which went bankrupt and closed, and banks refused to grant them loans to plant crops. After struggling to secure a loan and find someone who would rent to him, Milam managed to secure 217 acres and a $4,000 loan to plant cotton, but blacks refused to work for him. He was forced to pay whites higher wages. Eventually, Milam and Bryant relocated to Texas, but their infamy followed them; they continued to generate animosity from locals. In 1961, while in Texas, when Bryant recognized the license plate of a Tallahatchie County resident, he called out a greeting and identified himself. The resident, upon hearing the name, drove away without speaking to Bryant.Whitaker, 2005 After several years, they returned to Mississippi. Milam found work as a heavy equipment operator, but ill health forced him into retirement. Over the years, Milam was tried for offenses such as assault and battery, writing bad checks, and using a stolen credit card. He died of spinal cancer on December 30, 1980, at the age of 61. Bryant worked as a welder while in Texas, until increasing blindness forced him to give up this employment. At some point, he and Carolyn divorced; he remarried in 1980. He opened a store in Ruleville, Mississippi. He was convicted in 1984 and 1988 of food stamp fraud. In a 1985 interview, he denied that he had killed Till, but said: \\"if Emmett Till hadn't got out of line, it probably wouldn't have happened to him.\\" Fearing economic boycotts and retaliation, Bryant lived a private life and refused to be photographed or reveal the exact location of his store, explaining: \\"this new generation is different and I don't want to worry about a bullet some dark night\\".Atiks, Joe. (August 25, 1985). \\"Emmett Till: More Than A Murder.\\" The Clarion-Ledger. Reproduced July 2, 2011, at \\"US Slave\\" blog. Retrieved July 16, 2013. He died of cancer on September 1, 1994, at the age of 63.Federal Bureau of Investigation (2006), pp. 24‚Äì26. Till's mother married Gene Mobley, became a teacher, and changed her surname to Till-Mobley. She continued to educate people about her son's murder. In 1992, Till-Mobley had the opportunity to listen while Bryant was interviewed about his involvement in Till's murder. With Bryant unaware that Till-Mobley was listening, he asserted that Till had ruined his life, expressed no remorse, and said: \\"Emmett Till is dead. I don't know why he can't just stay dead.\\"Till-Mobley and Benson, p. 261. In 1996, documentary filmmaker Keith Beauchamp, who was greatly moved by Till's open- casket photograph, started background research for a feature film he planned to make about Till's murder. He asserted that as many as 14 people may have been involved, including Carolyn Bryant Donham (who by this point had remarried). Mose Wright heard someone with \\"a lighter voice\\" affirm that Till was the one in his front yard immediately before Bryant and Milam drove away with the boy. Beauchamp spent the next nine years producing The Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till, released in 2003. That same year, PBS aired an installment of American Experience titled The Murder of Emmett Till. In 2005, CBS journalist Ed Bradley aired a 60 Minutes report investigating the Till murder, part of which showed him tracking down Carolyn Bryant at her home in Greenville, Mississippi. A 1991 book written by Stephen Whitfield, another by Christopher Metress in 2002, and Mamie Till-Mobley's memoirs the next year all posed questions as to who was involved in the murder and cover-up. Federal authorities in the 21st century worked to resolve the questions about the identity of the body pulled from the Tallahatchie River. In 2004, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that it was reopening the case to determine whether anyone other than Milam and Bryant was involved. David T. Beito, a professor at the University of Alabama, states that Till's murder \\"has this mythic quality like the Kennedy assassination\\". The DOJ had undertaken to investigate numerous cold cases dating to the Civil Rights Movement, in the hope of finding new evidence in other murders as well. The body was exhumed, and the Cook County coroner conducted an autopsy in 2005. Using DNA from Till's relatives, dental comparisons to images taken of Till, and anthropological analysis, the exhumed body was positively identified as that of Till. It had extensive cranial damage, a broken left femur, and two broken wrists. Metallic fragments found in the skull were consistent with bullets being fired from a .45 caliber gun.Federal Bureau of Investigation (2006), pp. 99‚Äì109. In February 2007, a Leflore County grand jury, composed primarily of black jurors and empaneled by Joyce Chiles, a black prosecutor, found no credible basis for Beauchamp's claim that 14 people took part in Till's abduction and murder. Beauchamp was angry with the finding. David Beito and Juan Williams, who worked on the reading materials for the Eyes on the Prize documentary, were critical of Beauchamp for trying to revise history and taking attention away from other cold cases. The grand jury failed to find sufficient cause for charges against Carolyn Bryant Donham. Neither the FBI nor the grand jury found any credible evidence that Henry Lee Loggins, identified by Beauchamp as a suspect who could be charged, had any role in the crime. Other than Loggins, Beauchamp refused to name any of the people he alleged were involved.  Historical markers  The first highway marker remembering Emmett Till, erected in 2006, was defaced with \\"KKK\\", and then completely covered with black paint. In 2007, eight markers were erected at sites associated with Till's lynching. The marker at the \\"River Spot\\" where Till's body was found was torn down in 2008, presumably thrown in the river. A replacement sign received more than 100 bullet holes over the next few years. Another replacement was installed in June 2018, and in July it was vandalized by bullets. Three University of Mississippi students were suspended from their fraternity after posing in front of the bullet-riddled marker, with guns, and uploading the photo to Instagram. As stated by Jerry Mitchell, \\"It is not clear whether the fraternity students shot the sign or are simply posing before it.\\" In 2019, a fourth sign was erected. It is made of steel, weighs , is over thick, and is said by its manufacturer to be indestructible.  Claim that Carolyn Bryant recanted her testimony  In 2017, author Timothy Tyson released details of a 2008 interview with Carolyn Bryant. He claimed that during the interview she had disclosed that she had fabricated parts of her testimony at the trial. Tyson said that during the interview, Bryant retracted her testimony that Till had grabbed her around her waist and uttered obscenities, saying \\"that part's not true\\". The jury did not hear Bryant's testimony at the trial as the judge had ruled it inadmissible, but the court spectators heard. The defense wanted Bryant's testimony as evidence for a possible appeal in case of a conviction. In the 2008 interview, the 72-year- old Bryant said she could not remember the rest of the events that occurred between her and Till in the grocery store. She also said: \\"nothing that boy did could ever justify what happened to him\\". Tyson said that Roy Bryant had been verbally abusive toward Carolyn, and \\"it was clear she was frightened of her husband\\". Bryant described Milam as \\"domineering and brutal and not a kind man\\". An editorial in The New York Times said regarding Bryant's admission that portions of her testimony were false: \\"This admission is a reminder of how black lives were sacrificed to white lies in places like Mississippi. It also raises anew the question of why no one was brought to justice in the most notorious racially motivated murder of the 20th century, despite an extensive investigation by the F.B.I.\\" The New York Times quoted Wheeler Parker, a cousin of Till's, who said: \\"I was hoping that one day she [Bryant] would admit it, so it matters to me that she did, and it gives me some satisfaction. It's important to people understanding how the word of a white person against a black person was law, and a lot of black people lost their lives because of it. It really speaks to history, it shows what black people went through in those days.\\" In a report to Congress in March 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice stated that it was reopening the investigation into Till's death due to new information. However, the 'recanting' claim made by Tyson was not on his tape-recording of the interview. ‚ÄúIt is true that that part is not on tape because I was setting up the tape recorder\\" Tyson said. Donham‚Äôs daughter-in- law, Marsha Bryant, who was present for the two interviews, said her mother- in-law ‚Äúnever recanted.‚Äù The support Tyson provided to back up his claim, was a handwritten note that he said had been made at the time.  Influence on civil rights  Till's case attracted widespread attention because of the brutality of the lynching, the victim's young age, and the acquittal of the two men who later admitted killing him. It became emblematic of the injustices suffered by blacks in the South. In 1955 The Chicago Defender urged its readers to react to the acquittal by voting in large numbers; this was to counter the disenfranchisement since 1890 of most blacks in Mississippi by the white-dominated legislature; other southern states followed this model, excluding hundreds of thousands of citizens from politics.Carson, et al, pp. 39‚Äì40. Myrlie Evers, the widow of Medgar Evers, said in 1985 that Till's case resonated so strongly because it \\"shook the foundations of Mississippi‚Äîboth black and white, because ... with the white community ... it had become nationally publicized ... with us as blacks ... it said, even a child was not safe from racism and bigotry and death.\\" The NAACP asked Mamie Till Bradley to tour the country relating the events of her son's life, death, and the trial of his murderers. It was one of the most successful fundraising campaigns the NAACP had ever conducted.Till-Mobley and Benson, pp. 191‚Äì196. Journalist Louis Lomax acknowledges Till's death to be the start of what he terms the \\"Negro revolt\\", and scholar Clenora Hudson-Weems characterizes Till as a \\"sacrificial lamb\\" for civil rights. NAACP operative Amzie Moore considers Till the start of the Civil Rights Movement, at the very least, in Mississippi.Beito and Beito, p. 130. The 1987 Eyes on the Prize, a 14-hour Emmy award-winning documentary, begins with the murder of Emmett Till. Accompanying written materials for the series, Eyes on the Prize and Voices of Freedom (for the second time period), exhaustively explore the major figures and events of the Civil Rights Movement. Stephen Whitaker states that, as a result of the attention Till's death and the trial received, In Montgomery, Rosa Parks attended a rally for Till, led by Martin Luther King Jr. Soon after, she refused to give up her seat on a segregated bus to a white passenger. The incident sparked a year-long well-organized grassroots boycott of the public bus system. The boycott was designed to force the city to change its segregation policies. Parks later said when she did not get up and move to the rear of the bus, \\"I thought of Emmett Till and I just couldn't go back.\\"Houck and Grindy, p. x. According to author Clayborne Carson, Till's death and the widespread coverage of the students integrating Little Rock Central High School in 1957 were especially profound for younger blacks: \\"It was out of this festering discontent and an awareness of earlier isolated protests that the sit-ins of the 1960s were born.\\"Carson, et al, p. 107. After seeing pictures of Till's mutilated body, in Louisville, Kentucky, young Cassius Clay (later famed boxer Muhammad Ali) and a friend took out their frustration by vandalizing a local railyard, causing a locomotive engine to derail.Hampton, p. 321.Gorn, pp. 76‚Äì77. In 1963, Sunflower County resident and sharecropper Fannie Lou Hamer was jailed and beaten for attempting to register to vote. The next year, she led a massive voter registration drive in the Delta region, and volunteers worked on Freedom Summer throughout the state. Before 1954, 265 black people were registered to vote in three Delta counties, where they were a majority of the population. At this time, blacks made up 41% of the total state population. The summer Emmett Till was killed, the number of registered voters in those three counties dropped to 90. By the end of 1955, fourteen Mississippi counties had no registered black voters.Whitfield, p. 62. The Mississippi Freedom Summer of 1964 registered 63,000 black voters in a simplified process administered by the project; they formed their own political party because they were closed out of the Democratic Regulars in Mississippi.Carson, et al, pp. 177‚Äì178.

Casket  During a renewed investigation of the crime in 2005, the Department of Justice exhumed Till's remains to conduct an autopsy and DNA analysis which confirmed the identification of his body. Till was reburied in a new casket later that year. In 2009, his original glass-topped casket was found, rusting in a dilapidated storage shed at the cemetery. The casket was discolored and the interior fabric torn. It bore evidence that animals had been living in it, although its glass top was still intact. The Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C. acquired the casket a month later. According to director Lonnie Bunch III, it is an artifact with the potential to stop future visitors and make them think.Trescott, Jacqueline (August 27, 2009). \\"Emmett Till's Casket Donated to the Smithsonian\\", The Washington Post.

Representation in culture  Langston Hughes dedicated an untitled poem (eventually to be known as \\"Mississippi‚Äî1955\\") to Till in his October 1, 1955, column in The Chicago Defender. It was reprinted across the country and continued to be republished with various changes from different writers.Metress, Christopher (Spring 2003). \\"Langston Hughes's 'Mississippi-1955': A Note on Revisions and an Appeal for Reconsideration\\", African American Review, 37 (1), pp. 139‚Äì148.

In it he questioned why the tenets of segregation were based on irrational reasoning. Till's murder was the focus of a 1957 television episode for the U.S. Steel Hour titled \\"Noon on Doomsday\\" written by Rod Serling. He was fascinated by how quickly Mississippi whites supported Bryant and Milam. Although the script was rewritten to avoid mention of Till, and did not say that the murder victim was black, White Citizens' Councils vowed to boycott U.S. Steel. The eventual episode bore little resemblance to the Till case.Whitfield, pp. 83‚Äì84. Gwendolyn Brooks wrote a poem titled \\"A Bronzeville Mother Loiters in Mississippi.

The same year Harper Lee published To Kill a Mockingbird, in which a white attorney is committed to defending a black man named Tom Robinson, accused of raping a white woman. Lee, whose novel had a profound effect on civil rights, never commented on why she wrote about Robinson. Literature professor Patrick Chura noted several similarities between Till's case and that of Robinson.Chura, Patrick (Spring 2000). \\"Prolepsis and Anachronism: Emmett Till and the Historicity of To Kill a Mockingbird\\", Southern Literary Journal, 32 (2), pp. 1‚Äì26. Writer James Baldwin loosely based his 1964 drama Blues for Mister Charlie on the Till case. He later divulged that Till's murder had been bothering him for several years.Metress, Christopher (Spring 2003). \\"No Justice, No Peace\\": The Figure of Emmett Till in African American Literature\\" MELUS, 28 (1), pp. 87‚Äì103. Anne Moody mentioned the Till case in her autobiography, Coming of Age in Mississippi, in which she states she first learned to hate during the fall of 1955.Carson, et al, pp. 41‚Äì43. Audre Lorde's poem \\"Afterimages\\" (1981) focuses on the perspective of a black woman thinking of Carolyn Bryant 24 years after the murder and trial. Bebe Moore Campbell's 1992 novel Your Blues Ain't Like Mine centers on the events of Till's death. Toni Morrison's play Dreaming Emmett (1986), is a feminist look at the roles of men and women in black society, which she was inspired to write while considering \\"time through the eyes of one person who could come back to life and seek vengeance\\".Whitfield, pp. 119‚Äì120. Emmylou Harris includes a song called \\"My Name is Emmett Till\\" on her 2011 album, Hard Bargain. According to scholar Christopher Metress, Till is often reconfigured in literature as a specter that haunts the white people of Mississippi, causing them to question their involvement in evil, or silence about injustice. The 2002 book Mississippi Trials, 1955 is a fictionalized account of Till's death. The 2015 song by Janelle Mon√°e \\"Hell You Talmbout\\" invokes the names of African-American people ‚Äì including Emmett Till ‚Äì who died as a result of encounters with law enforcement or racial violence. In 2016 artist Dana Schutz painted Open Casket, a work based on photographs of Till in his coffin as well as on an account by Till's mother of seeing him after his death.

Stregheria is sometimes referred to as La Vecchia Religione (\\"the Old Religion\\").A New history of Witchcraft, Jeffrey Russell & Brooks Alexander, page 152, \\"the old religion\\" was first used in Leland's Aradia The word stregheria is an archaic Italian word for \\"witchcraft\\", the most used and modern Italian word being stregoneria.Nuovo Dizionario Italiano- Latino, the Societ√† Editrice Dante Alighieri (1959) \\"Stregoneria Italiana\\" is a form of stregoneria that is Catholic-rooted folk magic having little if any relationship to other forms of Italian Witchcraft. Author Raven Grimassi has written on the topic. Grimassi taught what he called the Aridian tradition from 1980. He mixed elements of Gardnerian Wicca with ideas inspired by Charles G. Leland's Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches (1899). The name \\"Aradia\\" is due to Leland, who claimed that Erodiade (the Italian name of Herodias) was the object of a \\"witch-cult\\" in medieval Tuscany. Since 1998, Grimassi has been advocating what he calls the Arician tradition, described as an \\"initiate level\\" variant of the religion, involving an initiation ceremony. Author Paul Theroux has quoted Norman Lewis and Danilo Dolci by stating that the Sicilian strega is a useful, probably indispensable witch who \\"arranges marriages, concocts potions, dabbles a little in black magic, clears up skin conditions, and casts out devils.\\" Stregheria has both similarities and differences with Wicca, and in some ways resembles reconstructionist Neopaganism focused on a specific nation or culture (in this case the folk religion of ancient and medieval Italy). Stregheria honors a pantheon centered on a Moon Goddess and a Horned God regarded as central, paralleling Wiccan views of divinity. History The modern movement originates in the 1970s with Italian-American Leo Martello. Martello claimed to belong to a \\"family tradition\\" of religious witchcraft in his 1973 book Witchcraft: The Old Religion. Martello does not use the word \\"Stregheria\\" when referring to his personal practice, but refers to it as \\"the Strega tradition\\". Raven Grimassi began teaching the \\"Aridian Tradition\\", a modernized public system presented in his published works, in 1980 in the San Diego, California area. Grimassi published two books related to the topic (Italian Witchcraft and Hereditary Witchcraft) between 1981 and 2009. Revival of the name Stregheria first occurs in Grimassi's Ways of the Strega (1994). In using an archaic Italian term, Grimassi follows Gerald Gardner (1954), who used the Old English form wicca to refer to the adherents of his alleged \\"witch cult\\". The word is earlier found in a book titled Apologia della Congresso Notturno Delle Lamie by Girolamo Tartarotti (1751), who uses stregheria to describe Italian witchcraft as the cult of the goddess Diana. Although the validity of this view has been disputed by American scholars, Italian ethnohistorian Paolo Portone has demonstrated reference to the cult of Diana in the records of the earliest witch trials, including in the Canon Episcopi. Moreover, by contrasting the trials held before the Inquisitor of Milan in 1384 and 1390 of Sybil de Laria and Pierina de Bugatis, Portone has demonstrated how Inquisitors constructed beliefs surrounding \\"evil witches\\" directly from the Pagan worship of Diana. Grimassi founded the \\"Arician Tradition\\" in 1998, described as an initiate level variant of Stregheria. Raven Grimassi Raven Grimassi is the pen name of an Italian-American author, born in 1951 as the son of an Italian immigrant who was born and raised in the area of Naples, Italy. He became involved with a coven presenting itself as Gardnerian Wicca in 1969 in San Diego. He is the founder of the Aridian and Arician traditions of Italian-based witchcraft. He stepped down as the directing elder of Arician Witchcraft in 2004. Grimassi currently (as of 2009) lives in Massachusetts and is the directing elder of the Ash, Birch and Willow tradition, and co-director of the Fellowship of the Pentacle. He was formerly co-director of the College of the Crossroads. Grimassi is reportedly descended from an Italian witch named Calenda Tavani, who lived in Naples several generations ago. Grimassi states that his early training was a mixture of Italian witchcraft and folk magic. His later interest in Neo-paganism began in 1969, and he was initiated into a system claiming to be Gardnerian Wicca in San Diego though the tradition's claim eventually proved to be false. Ten years later, Grimassi began teaching the \\"Aridian Tradition\\", which he describes as a \\"modern system\\" of Italian Witchcraft or Stregheria, that he created for non-initiates. Grimassi also studied Kabbalah and other traditions of Wicca such as Brittic and the Pictish-Gaelic system in which he received third degree initiation in 1983 according to the Encyclopedia of Wicca & Witchcraft.Encyclopedia of Wicca & Witchcraft, Raven Grimassi, Llewellyn Publications, 2003 Grimassi also received third degree initiation into Traditionalist Celtic Wicca in 2001 at the First Wiccan Church of Escondido, California. Views on a historical \\"religion of witchcraft\\" Grimassi shares in common, in his books, the general \\"Witch-cult hypothesis\\" that appears in the writings of Charles G. Leland (Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches, 1899), a theory to the effect that European witchcraft was the continuation of an ancient pre-Christian form. Grimassi describes the roots of Stregheria as a syncretic offshoot of Etruscan religion that later blended with \\"Tuscan peasant religion\\", medieval Christian heresy, and veneration of saints. Grimassi views Leland's book Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches as a \\"Christianized and distorted version\\" of the original story of Aradia, whom he believes to be a mortal woman named Aradia di Toscano. However, Grimassi does endorse a number of elements from Leland's Aradia material, such as the inclusion of a full moon ritual and a sacred meal at the Tregenda, or Sabbat, along with the pantheon of a goddess and god figure. Grimassi writes that Aradia di Toscano passed on a religion of witchcraft, based on ancient Etruscan paganism, to her followers (whom Grimassi calls \\"The Triad Clans\\"). The Triad Clans are referred to as \\"an alliance of three related Witch Clans known as the Tanarra, Janarra, and Fanarra\\". Folklorist Sabina Magliocco points out that \\"Grimassi never claims to be reproducing exactly what was practiced by Italian immigrants to North America; he admits Italian-American immigrants \\"have adapted a few Wiccan elements into their ways\\". Claims of family tradition Reports that Grimassi claims to belong to a \\"family tradition\\" of religious witchcraft has attracted criticism.Magliocoo, Sabina \\"...this state of affairs, along with the lack of ethnographic evidence to corroborate the reports of Martello, Bruno and Grimassi, makes the existence of an Italian witch cult among Italian-Americans extremely unlikely.\\" in Grimassi responds by saying that, although he wrote about such a family tradition, he intentionally never specifically mentions his own family in his books, but that Llewellyn's marketing department designed text depicting him as being raised in a family tradition . Grimassi does not deny being the bearer of a family lineage but chooses to protect the privacy of his family by not mentioning or referencing specific members (hence his use of a pseudonym). Sabina Magliocco, who has criticized some of Grimassi's claims, does point out that \\"Grimassi never claims to be reproducing exactly what was practiced by Italian immigrants to North America; he admits Italian-American immigrants \\"have adapted a few Wiccan elements into their ways\\". After personally meeting Grimassi, Magliocco writes in her letter to the Pomegranate Reader's Forum: > I had the pleasure of meeting Raven Grimassi during the summer of 2001, > unfortunately after the final draft of my article had already been submitted > to The Pom. He was very gracious and helpful to me. From information he > revealed during our interview, I can say with reasonable certainty that I > believe him to have been initiated into a domestic tradition of folk magic > and healing such as I describe in my article. Practices Drawing of a pentagram ring from Crotone, Italy, taken from IMAGINI DEGLI DEI ANTICHI (Vincenzo Cartari, 1647) Grimassi's tradition centers around a duotheistic pair of deities that are regarded as divine lovers, and they may go by many different names, including: Uni and Tagni, Tana and Tanus, Diana and Dianus, Jana and Janus, and more.The Encyclopedia of Modern Witchcraft and Neo-Paganism, Shelley Rabinovitch & James Lewis, page 262, (2004) Practices include the celebration of seasonal holidays, ritual magic, strict adherence to performing their rituals skyclad for at least half of the year, and reverence for gods, ancestors and tradition-specific spirits. Stregheria itself has variant traditions, and individual practices may vary considerably. In comparing Stregheria to Wicca, Grimassi notes both similarities between the two and differences. He has defended his material as being significantly different from Wicca at the roots level, and asserts that many of the foundational concepts in Gerald Gardner's Wicca can be found earlier in works on Italian Witchcraft and ancient Mediterranean mystery sects. Grimassi called his specific teachings on Stregheria the \\"Aridian Tradition\\" from 1980, after Aradia of Tuscany, an alleged messianic figure known as the \\"goddess of the witches\\", viewed within the \\"Arician Tradition\\" as a witch who revived the Old Religion. While the \\"Aridian\\" tradition was based on \\"self-dedication\\" alone, the \\"Arician\\" tradition involves a rite of initiation. Some systems within Stregheria use a pentagram as an important symbol. The pentagram is often worn in the form of ring or necklace piece. Some traditions of Stregheria use the ritual tools of cup, wand, pentacle and blade, which are seen in the suits of occult or divinatory tarot cards and amongst many systems of Western occultism. Some Stregheria rituals take place in a circle, with an altar facing North. Ritual actions include prayer, and the blessing of food. Some adherents of Stregheria celebrate the eight holidays of the neopagan Wheel of the Year, called \\"Treguendas\\", while others celebrate the Roman Catholic or the ancient Roman holidays. One unified practice among Streghe is \\"ancestor reverence through spirits known as Lares\\".

It has since been taken off the air and replaced with a new adaptation, Franklin and Friends. The animated Franklin has also appeared in several TV-movies: Franklin and the Green Knight (2000), Franklin's Magic Christmas (2001) and Back to School with Franklin (2003). Plot Franklin focuses on the eponymous growing young turtle who, as his television stories and books always begin, \\"could count by twos and tie his shoes\\". He goes to school, lives in a small village called Woodland with his friends, and has many adventures playing and learning in the world around him, sometimes with the helping hand of an adult such as his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Turtle. Franklin likes swimming, arts and crafts (especially drawing), and loves shoofly pie. He's been known to be afraid of the dark and of thunderstorms. Franklin has a best friend named Bear, as well as a blue blanket and a blue stuffed dog named Sam. In earlier seasons, he sleeps with his blanket and Sam. When Franklin is scared by thunderstorms, Sam and his blue blanket help keep him calm. EpisodesCharacters and neighborhood The main character of the series is Franklin Turtle himself. All episodes and movies focus on Franklin as the main character. Almost all events are presented directly from his point of view with some exceptions. There are no stories in which Franklin is not present, though sometimes certain other characters may take more of a focus. Franklin's family includes his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Turtle and his little sister Harriet. Mr. and Mrs. Turtle are presented as gentle and loving parents who provide direction and guidance for Franklin, as well as reasonable discipline when needed. His sister, Harriet, was born in the film Franklin and the Green Knight and was featured in stories in the fifth and sixth season of the program. Franklin's extended family includes his paternal grandmother, who lives close by, as well as his maternal grandparents, who live on a remote farm (As shown in \\"Franklin's Magic Christmas\\"). In the film Franklin and the Turtle Lake Treasure, his paternal aunt Lucy and her goddaughter Sam chose to settle in Woodland as well. Sam has a mom and a dad but they let her stay in Woodland so she could visit her Godmother, Lucy. And in the new CGI series, his paternal Aunt Teeny (Aunt T or Aunt Turtle) is introduced. In later episodes, Franklin's maternal aunt and uncle and his maternal cousin will be introduced. Franklin's parents are the only couple in Woodland to be of different ages. Most of the married couples in Woodland have the two people the same age. And there are most couples in Woodland have married twin siblings. Franklin's best friend is Bear, who is a bear that loves to eat and, in later seasons, has a sister named Beatrice. His other close friend is Snail, a garden snail who considers Franklin to be his best friend. One of Franklin's other friends that appears most often on the series is Beaver. Franklin's other friends that appear most often on the series are Goose, Rabbit, Fox, Badger, Raccoon and Skunk. He is taught by Mr. Owl, though this character was temporarily replaced by Miss Koala in the film Back to School with Franklin, when Mr. Owl was called away on a family emergency. Goose's family included a mother and father who are both the same age, but are revealed to be divorced in Franklin and Friends. Goose's extended family as seen in Franklin Migrates includes her paternal grandmother (whom she is called Granny) and her maternal grandfather (whom he is called Grandpa) as well as her maternal aunt and uncle who are married twin siblings and her maternal cousin Giselle. Other characters are seen on the show with less frequency, sometimes only appearing in one or a few episodes. Woodland Franklin and his friends live in a small, animal-resident village in eastern North America known as Woodland. The village is small enough that most residents know one another and meet on a regular basis. There is a small shopping district, some roads (with very little traffic), and at least one community schoolhouse. * Turtle Household ‚Äì Franklin, his parents Mr. and Mrs. Turtle, and Harriet's home. * Granny Turtle ‚Äì Franklin's paternal grandmother who talks a lot and has a nice attic. * Great-Grandpa Turtle ‚Äì Shown once on Franklin's Magic Christmas when Grandma was telling a story about him. * Great-Grandma and Great-Grandpa Turtle ‚Äì The parents of Granny who died in a fire. Great-Grandma was a great berry picker and Great-Grandpa was a great fisher. * Oakwood School ‚Äì The schoolhouse in Woodland where Mr. Owl works at and where Franklin goes to school. * Shopping District ‚Äì Woodland is known to have a robust shopping district with an ice-cream shop, Mr. Mole's hardware store, a pharmacy, a grocery market, a coffee shop, a bookstore, and more. Franklin and his friends sometimes travel here with their parents, with each other, or even by themselves. * Tree Fort - A treehouse Franklin's friends built in the episode \\"Franklin's Fort\\". At the time, Franklin was afraid of heights, but got over his fear at the end of the episode after he helped a tiny bird. Franklin and his friends would then use it for their activities and to hang out. In the episode \\"Franklin Plays It Safe\\", it got destroyed due to falling out of its tree when the branch that was holding it broke. However, a new one was built at the end. * Pond ‚Äì Franklin and his friends often hang out by the pond, which is attached to a stream. They sometimes go swimming, sit by the pond, or participate in various activities. *Woods ‚Äì Woodland is surrounded on at least one end by forests. A character named Gopher who appeared in the movie Franklin and the Green Knight is known to live here. In Franklin and the Green Knight, Franklin and Snail had an adventure here. They journeyed deep into the woods where they met several characters and found magic cherry blossoms. * Oakwood Ravine ‚Äì Located within the woods and connected distantly to the playground. The only area in Woodland that is shown to contain poison ivy. * Nature Trail ‚Äì The Nature Trail is a trail that has a picnic ground within it, as well as the Monarch Meadow and Blueberry Hill Lookout. Franklin and Bear went on a hiking trip in the trail once. They expected to find monarch butterflies in the meadow, but found caterpillars instead. There is a pond here as well. Franklin and Bear try to skip stones in it, but the stones sink. * Village Park ‚Äì Kids go to skateboard here. * Playground ‚Äì For the younger kids such as Harriet and Beatrice. It has a slide, swings and monkey bars. Harriet, Kit, and Beatrice all enjoy playing here. * Tamarack Play Park ‚Äì An amusement park area never seen on the programme, but referenced. When Franklin is unable to travel there with all his friends, he creates \\"Turtle Play Park\\". * Faraway Farm ‚Äì The farm far away from Woodland where Franklin's maternal grandparents live. Franklin and his family spend Christmas here with his maternal grandparents in the TV special Franklin's Magic Christmas. * Turtle Lake ‚Äì An area featured only in the TV special Franklin and the Turtle Lake Treasure. Franklin's Granny lived in this area, but lost her home and parents in a fire. * Woodland Town Hall ‚Äì The Woodland Town Hall is used to hold the production of Sleeping Beauty performed by Franklin and his class in \\"Franklin's Starring Role\\". * Thrill Hill ‚Äì A steep hill that the big kids in town like to skateboard down. Franklin ends up skateboarding down it accidentally and then is dared to do it again. At first he agrees, but ends up not taking the dare. * Blueberry Hill ‚Äì A hill within a nature park that has a spectacular view, when it's not too cloudy. The name may be a reference to the 1940 song. Sports and games Baseball is seen more often in earlier seasons, with only sporadic appearances in later episodes. Hockey and soccer are favoured as sports to play. Once, when Franklin and Bear went to sign up for football, spaces had run out, so they were signed up for basketball instead. Owing to the show's Canadian roots, ice hockey has an important place in the Franklin world. It is featured in several stories, including one in which Skunk is taught by Franklin and Bear how to play. Franklin also gets to meet a couple of his professional hockey heroes in the fifth and sixth seasons of the programme. In addition to sports, the characters enjoy a number of games and activities. Franklin becomes his school's chess champion. Harriet and Beatrice enjoy playing tag and hide-and- seek. And Franklin and his friends enjoy playing knights. Production=Development The development design of Franklin the Turtle for the animated TV series character, was the achievement of Canadian Animation artist and Illustrator Kurt Lehner, which he worked on during his time at Nelvana Studios in 1997. These designs were studies taken directly from the Franklin the Turtle book series itself. Though Lehner did not continue to work with the \\"series\\" design team which was hired after the development process, at that time he was given the privilege of also designing Beaver, Rabbit and Skunk as well. In May 2004, new episodes of the series began airing on the Canadian network, Treehouse TV. Franklin and many of his friends had new voice actors in these new adventures, including award-winning American actor Grant Eubanks. Many of the show's strongest writers and staff-members remained on board, however. These new stories saw Franklin facing a flood, worries about the old treehouse, and earning a badge in a group called the Woodland Trailblazers. For the sixth season Funbag and other animation studios joined in the development of Franklin. The most recent movie in the series is Franklin and the Turtle Lake Treasure. The film was written by John van Bruggen and directed by Dominique Monf√©ry. The 76 minute long film premiered in theatres in 2006 and had its debut on Noggin on New Year's Eve, 2007, as part of a celebration of the network's conversion to a 24/7 format. Format Franklin is traditionally animated with some computer aid, especially in the later seasons. Franklin is closed-captioned. Franklin almost always aired with two 11-minute stories, except on Canada's CBC, which splits the stories apart and shows one at a time. The Franklin DVD and video releases include individual stories grouped together as part of a theme, rather than complete episodes. Unlike many animated children's programs, Franklin has no interstitial segments or end-tags featuring the characters. The scenes shown in the cartoon opening introduction were changed after the show's first season. Many of these scenes featured Otter, a character who left the series early in the first season and was only seen once more in later seasons. Differences in the colouring of the cartoon can be spotted from season-to- season. The more recent feature films, most noticeably Back to School with Franklin have a somewhat different look from the television series. The film Franklin and the Turtle Lake Treasure had considerably higher production values, with more colour differentiation between the various turtles, higher quality animation, an overall brighter look, and beautifully painted backgrounds. Broadcast In Canada, the series aired on Family Channel and Treehouse TV. In the United States, it aired on CBS as part of their Saturday- morning CBS Kidshow block from 1998 to 1999. Then it aired on \\"Nick Jr. on CBS\\" for 2 years from September 16, 2000 to September 7, 2002. It also aired on Nickelodeon as part of the Nick Jr. television block from January 11, 1999 to July 30, 2004. It even aired on Noggin (now Nick Jr.) from February 2, 1999 until September 27, 2009 when Noggin was re-branded as Nick Jr., and continued to air reruns until March 8, 2013 after 16 years.https://web.archive.org/web/20130219040936/http://tvlistings.zap2it.com/tvlistings/ZCSGrid.do?stnNum=19211&channel;=75&aid;=zap2it In the United Kingdom, it aired on Sky One from March 21, 1998 until May 27, 2000, Channel 4 from November 1, 1998 until August 31, 2004, Nick Jr. from 1999 to 2008, Five from October 2004 and Tiny Pop in 2013. It has also been broadcast in India on Pogo along with another animated series, Angelina Ballerina. Reception The show was well received by critics and parents. Joly Herman of Common Sense Media stated in a review, \\"Franklin is a show that takes for granted respect for elders and vice versa. There's no whining, fighting, yelling, provocation, or aggravation. Franklin ultimately sets a good example of responsible TV programming, and it is a rare show that celebrates the innocence of childhood.\\" In other media=Books and movies Franklin television stories are mostly based on books in the original Franklin Adventure series. The practice of adapting television stories from books was dropped in the programme's second season, though elements and dialogue from some of the books are incorporated into later stories. Although, many Franklin television stories have been made into books in the Franklin TV Storybook and Franklin First Readers series. Usually written by Sharon Jennings, these adaptations are shortened versions of what is seen on TV and may contain non-canon material. In September 11, 2000, Franklin's little sister Harriet was introduced in the direct-to-video and DVD movie Franklin and the Green Knight. The two shared an adventure in November 24, 2001 in Franklin's Magic Christmas. Back to School with Franklin was released direct-to-video in September 6, 2004, which involved Harriet befriending Beaver's younger brother Kit, and new character Mrs. Koala introduced as a teacher to Franklin and his friends. Home media=Streaming All the episodes are available for free on Corus Entertainment / Nelvana's own Treehouse Direct channel and Franklin Official channel on YouTube. Live tours Franklin has been seen in numerous touring stage shows, including \\"Franklin's Big Adventure,\\" \\"Franklin's Class Concert,\\" \\"Franklin's Family Christmas Concert,\\" and \\"Franklin's Carnival Of Animals.\\" Produced by Koba Entertainment and presented by Paquin Entertainment, these stage shows featured a number of songs including \\"Come See the World,\\" \\"What I Do in the Morning\\" and \\"The Dinosaur Song\\". In 2009, a new touring show, \\"Franklin and The Adventures of the Noble Knights\\", was developed, and is currently touring in France. The show is also produced by Koba Entertainment, and presented by Paquin Entertainment. The Director/Choreographer is Patti Caplette. This show toured in Canada in 2010. A soundtrack CD featuring the songs from the programme is now available. CGI series On September 27, 2010, Nelvana announced that it had begun production on a new all-CGI Franklin series called Franklin and Friends. The series has been ordered for 52 episodes and the characters that return in the series are Bear, Fox, Rabbit, Beaver, Goose, Snail and, naturally, Franklin himself. Additionally, the series features a new regular character, Franklin's paternal aunt named Aunt T., described as \\"quirky.\\" The series \\"features special themes including fun mysteries, Woodland events and outdoor activities.\\" This is a Canada-Singapore joint venture between Nelvana and Infinite Frameworks Pte.

It is meant to reduce fuel consumption -- something very important for drivers who travel several hundred miles each day. Progressive shifting is accomplished by changing gears upward as early as possible when accelerating, while staying within the flat torque range. Each shift will go a little higher into the RPM, until the vehicle is in its top gear at cruising speed. After each shift is completed, the engine and transmission should be operating at or near the lowest rpm speeds recommended by the manufacturers of those parts. The fastest acceleration is achieved when the truck is receiving as close as possible to maximum power throughout the entire time it is accelerating. E.g. in a truck with a Caterpillar C15 engine it is achieved by going all the way up to 1950RPM, then shifting to a gear that will put the engine at 1500RPM. In contrast, using progressive shifting, i.e. maintaining maximum torque, the overall acceleration is slower but there is increased fuel efficiency and lower wear of engine due to smaller RPM.

The town is close to the coast and the mouth of the Waikouaiti River. Today, Waikouaiti is a retail trade and servicing centre for the surrounding district, which has sheep farming as the principal primary activity. A major egg producer, Zeagold Foods, a branch of Mainland Poultry LTD has a 500,000-hen factory farming operation here and is in the process of expanding over the next year to meet demand for egg products. Hawksbury, 3 km southwest of Waikouaiti, has a cheese factory and shop, a swimming pool and housing developed from the old mental health institution, Cherry Farm. Karitane, 3 km to the southeast has a small fishing port. History Prior to the arrival of Europeans the area was occupied by MƒÅori, who had a kaik, or unfortified settlement, at modern Karitane and a pa, or fortified settlement, on the adjacent Huriawa Peninsula. An 1826 sketch of the east Otago coast, shows the headlands and beaches of what are now Karitane and Waikouaiti.Otago coast map sketch - Thomas Shepherd (1779‚Äì1835), Original in the Mitchell Library, Sydney. Reproduced in Entwisle, 2005, illustration 17 Waikouaiti was the first European settlement in southern New Zealand to be mainly based on farming and one of the first enduring European settlements in Otago. From 1837 there had been a whaling station confusingly also called \\"Waikouaiti\\" nearby on the south side of the estuary at what is now called \\"Karitane\\". Having already purchased large areas of land in the South Island (much of which was later declared to have been iinvalid) Johnny Jones sent settlers from Sydney, Australia in the Magnet to farm the district in 1840, eight years before the foundation of the Otago Association's settlement.E. J. Tapp. 'Jones, John - Jones, John', from the Dictionary of New Zealand Biography. Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand, updated 30-Oct-2012 This was the first farm in the Otago region. Waikouaiti Presbyterian Church, built 1914, West window. The 'Johnny Jones' chair, a very rare early example of domestic New Zealand made seated furniture. Jones himself did not move to Waikouaiti until 1843, after financial losses during an economic depression in Sydney. His original homestead and some of the associated buildings of his colonial manor farm, known as Matanaka Farm, which still stand on Cornish Head, date from this time. The farm buildings, though not the homestead, are owned by Heritage New Zealand and are open to the public. They are the oldest surviving farm buildings in New Zealand. Jones moved to Dunedin in 1854 but was influential in the development of Waikouaiti for many years after. The wooden shingle roofed St. John's Anglican Church in Waikouaiti proper opened in 1858, was funded by Jones. It was designed by Benjamin Mountfort of Christchurch who also designed the Provincial Council Building there. In 1861 Dr. William Chapman, at Jones request, became the first GP for the district. The Presbyterians built a wooden church in 1863. It was moved to Kildare Street in 1876 and still remains. It became the Sunday School when a brick church was built in 1914, designed by J.Louis Salmond but this building closed in 2008 and was demolished in 2009. The modern East Otago Events Centre which is used for many community activities Place names The town of Waikouaiti was initially called \\"Hawksbury,\\" a name that still applies to the Hawksbury Lagoon wetland in the centre of the town, known in MƒÅori as Matainaka,Place names on KƒÅti Huirapa Runaka ki Puketeraki website, viewed 2012-01-04 and also adopted in the name of the residential/industrial redevelopment at the former Cherry Farm Hospital. The name Waikouaiti is MƒÅori, and is believed to come from phrases meaning \\"small bitter waters\\" (wai-kawa-iti) or \\"braided streamlets\\" (wai-koua-iti). This placename once applied to a whaling station at Karitane, but subsequently drifted to the present location. Transport=Road Waikouaiti is located on State Highway 1 40 kilometres north of Dunedin city centre and 666 kilometres from Picton. Waikouaiti is serviced by the Dunedin to Palmerston bus service operated by Dunedin Passenger Transport. The bus operates thrice daily each way Monday to Friday (excluding public holidays).Otago Regional Council: Timetable Railway The Main South Line railway between Christchurch and Invercargill passes through Waikouaiti. It was constructed in the 1870s, and daily passenger trains passed through Waikouaiti until the cancellation of the Southerner in February 2002. Currently, the only passenger service is a tourist service operated by the Taieri Gorge Railway. Named the Seasider, it operates between Dunedin and Palmerston, once or twice a week in the summer months and occasionally during winter. Freight trains operate through Waikouaiti multiple times daily.

The bay is bounded on the northwest by New York's Staten Island, on the west by Perth Amboy, New Jersey, on the south by the Raritan Bayshore communities of Monmouth County, New Jersey, and on the east by Sandy Hook Bay. The bay is named after the Raritans, a branch of the Lenape tribe who lived in the vicinity of the bay for thousands of years prior to the arrival of Dutch colonists in the 17th century.  History  Archeological evidence suggests that humans were already in the region at the close of the Pleistocene. The early \\"Big Game Hunters\\" vanished, but the coastal regions were resettled by peoples accustomed to village-style living (\\"tidewater communities\\") that subsisted on hunting and gathering marine shellfish, and eventually, on agriculture. In pre-Columbian times \\"woodlands cultures\\" probably centered in the Ohio Valley became the dominant cultural influence in the region. Large shell middens were found around Raritan Bay and on Staten Island, a testament of the utilization of the bay for food by Algonquin Indian tribes (Lenapes) who occupied the area when early Colonialists arrived. Unfortunately, early settlers used these shell piles for road construction and field fertilizer. Tottenville was once well known for its roads paved with oyster shells.Geologic History of Raritan Bay from the U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey, accessed June 24, 2008  Geology  The south side of Raritan Bay The Raritan River was perhaps the major drainage channel along the ice front throughout the Wisconsin glaciation (Stages 1, 2, 3 and 4). Prior to that time the region drained southward across the saddle between the Atlantic Highlands and the Newark Basin into the Delaware River Valley. This saddle area is a very broad flood plain that preserves river terrace gravels (Pensauken Formation) from the Sangemon Interglacial State (Stage 5), as well as older Pleistocene fluvial deposits (The Bridgetown Formation). During the lowstand in sea level caused by the Wisconsin glacier, the Raritan River carved back into its headlands and captured the major drainages from the Newark Basin. As the Wisconsin glaciers melted, the Flandrian Transgression eventually flooded the deeper valleys of the Hudson, Raritan, and Arthur Kill. During warming at the end of the Pleistocene and Early Holocene, the area encompassing Raritan Bay changed from tundra to a landscape dominated by spruce and pine forests. These forests gradually gave way to the modern deciduous forest in the region by mid-Holocene time. Lagoons and bays in the area around Sandy Hook hosted oysters, hard and soft shell clams, lobsters, blue crabs, and a variety of other invertebrates common in bays in the region today. South of western Long Island, tidal flats and wetlands occupied the margins of a tidal estuary (now submerged by marine waters). Inner Raritan Bay began to fill about 2,500 years ago with large oyster beds forming along the estuarine tributaries. Sea level continued to rise about one foot per century. This rise in sea level has resulted in the landward migration of the shoreline (aided by storm-induced coastal erosion) as much as two miles in some portions of the coast since colonial times.  Economy and ecology  The bay supported a lucrative fishing and shellfish industry during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, especially oysters, which helped to support a stable population around the bay and aided, in part, to feed the flood of immigration. Stable communities continued to grow and change with new industries supporting a larger population base. Advances in methods of fishing and shellfish collecting resulted in overextraction of these resources from the bay. The peak of the fishing industry occurred in the late 1880s to 1910s. Fishing and farming slowly gave way to industries including ship building, ceramics, chemicals and paint manufacturing, electrolytic copper refining, and petroleum refining. In the Keasbey, New Jersey area, large pits were dug to extract the clays for ceramics and bricks, and huge chemical dumps, fly ash piles, and landfills were created to accommodate the waste from the growing industrial empire. The building of shore management structures (dikes, groins, seawalls), the spraying of DDT (and other pesticides) to control the mosquito problem, the carving of ditches to drain wetlands, the filling of shore lowlands, the channelization of creeks, highway and sewer construction, neighborhood development, and a myriad point and non-point sources of household, automobile, industrial chemicals, and ocean dumping all contributed to growing toxicity of the bay. For most of the 20th century, the shores of Arthur Kill have been home to the largest petroleum importing, refining, and storage facilities on Earth; as a consequence the estuary has been host to major and minor oil spills. In addition, Arthur Kill drains the area encompassing the second largest landfill on Earth (Fresh Kills Landfill). This landfill, and others along the Raritan River, provide an ample supply of leachate to the waterways. Chemical wastes cause stress and disruption of the life cycles of plankton, shellfish and other invertebrates, and the fish, birds, and other wildlife that they support. The result has been ecological disaster. The bay approached sterile conditions at the peak of pollution and algal bloom-induced anoxia. Environmental actions from the 1970s to present have helped slowly bring back sea life, but current conditions pale to the wealth of marine resources of the past; certain species of fish and birds continue to decline, and the introduction of tenacious exotic species from around the world contribute to their decline. As a sign of optimism though, oysters are beginning to naturally reappear in the Hudson River after having vanished completely about the time of World War II. Regional industrial overdevelopment and other pollution factors have raised PCB levels in the fish catch and prompted government recommendations against its routine consumption. The bay is crossed by a dredged channel allowing commercial ships to enter the Arthur Kill.  Aquatic species  Raritan Bay's fish include striped bass, fluke, winter flounder, bluefish, porgy, black sea bass, smoothhound shark, northern puffer, northern king fish, oyster toadfish, tautog and weakfish. The crustacean species represented include the blue crab, fiddler crab, green crab, horseshoe crab and spider crab. Clams and mussels also live in Raritan Bay. The bay is a popular destination for recreational fishing due to its proximity to the densely populated areas of Central Jersey and New York City.

Clarence Matheson Bowley in command. The first major U.S. warship built after the construction boom of World War II, Norfolk was authorized in 1947 as an anti-submarine hunter killer ship which could operate under all weather conditions and would carry the latest radar, sonar, and other electronic devices. As a large destroyer leader designed on a light cruiser hull she could carry a greater variety of detection gear than a destroyer. After her Caribbean shakedown cruise (February 1954), Norfolk was assigned to the U.S. Atlantic Fleet and between 1955 and 1957 served successively as flagship for Commander Destroyer Flotillas 2, 4, and 6. During 1956 and 1957 she acted as flagship for Commander Destroyer Force, Atlantic Fleet. In June 1957, Norfolk participated in the International Fleet Review as flagship for Admiral Jerauld Wright, Commander-in-Chief Atlantic Fleet and Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic for NATO. A boiler on the ship blew up in later 1955. By 1959 Norfolks eight 3 inch/50 caliber guns had been replaced by eight 3\\"/70 caliber guns and her 20 mm. battery had been removed. In 1960 the addition of an ASROC launcher enhanced her antisubmarine capabilities. On 10 May 1960, an 83-foot Cuban vessel harassed Norfolk while she was patrolling the Florida Straits with in Cuban waters. In Fall 1961 she took part in UNITAS II as flagship for Commander Cruiser Destroyer Flotilla 2. During the operation she performed ASW training exercises with the navies of Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil. Norfolk repeated this cruise over the next five years during which she served as flagship of Commander South Atlantic Forces except in 1962 when she was flagship for Commander Cruiser Destroyer Forces Atlantic Fleet. In 1965 she was the flagship for UNITAS VI. Norfolk joined LANTFLEX 66 as flagship between 28 November and 16 December 1966. During this exercise she shadowed the Russian trawlers Repiter and Teodilit. She proved her antisubmarine capabilities again as flagship for Commander South Atlantic Forces during UNITAS VIII in Fall 1967. Norfolk was assigned to Commander Middle East Force as flagship (17 April‚Äì15 October 1968). On this mission she visited Bahrain, French Somaliland, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia. Kenya, the Seychelles, Mauritius, Malagasy Republic, India, Pakistan, Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, Mexico, and Panama Canal Zone. In October 1968 Norfolk returned to Norfolk where she decommissioned 15 January 1970 and entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. By 1 September 1974, Norfolk was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register and sold for scrap. Memorials Two of Norfolk's 3‚Ä≥/70 anti-aircraft mounts were saved from the scrap heap and were on display at the Naval Training Center in Orlando, Florida. When NTC-Orlando closed, the Boca Raton Community High School's NJROTC requested custodianship of the mounts. The guns now stand near the east end zone of the football field in Boca Raton, Florida.

As with many places in and close to the Maniototo area, its name may have been influenced by the Northumberland ancestry of early surveyor John Turnbull Thomson (there is a Middle March region in Northumberland, centred on the town of Otterburn).

Peonies are native to Asia, Europe and Western North America. Scientists differ on the number of species that can be distinguished, ranging from 25 to 40, although the current consensus is 33 known species. The relationships between the species need to be further clarified. Most are herbaceous perennial plants tall, but some are woody shrubs tall. They have compound, deeply lobed leaves and large, often fragrant flowers, in colors ranging from purple and pink to red, white or yellow, in late spring and early summer. The flowers have a short blooming season, usually only 7‚Äì10 days. Peonies are among the most popular garden plants in temperate regions. Herbaceous peonies are also sold as cut flowers on a large scale, although generally only available in late spring and early summer. An emerging source of peonies in mid to late summer is the Alaskan market. Unique growing conditions due to long hours of sunlight create availability from Alaska when other sources have completed harvest.  Description = Morphology  All Paeoniaceae are deciduous perennial herbs or shrubs, with thick storage roots and thin roots for gathering water and minerals. Some species are caespitose (tufted), because the crown produces adventitious buds, while others have stolons. They have rather large compound leaves without glands and stipules, and with anomocytic stomata. In the woody species the new growth emerges from scaly buds on the previous flush or from the crown of the rootstock. The large bisexual flowers are mostly single at the end of the stem. In P. emodi, P. lactiflora, P. veitchii and many of the cultivars these contributed to, few additional flowers develop in the axils of the leaves. Flowers close at night or when the sky is overcast. Each flower is subtended by a number of bracts, that may form a sort of involucre, has 3-7 tough free sepals and mostly 5-8, but occasionally up to 13 free petals. These categories however are intergrading, making it difficult to assign some of them, and the number of these parts may vary. Within are numerous (50‚Äì160) free stamens, with anthers fixed at their base to the filaments, and are sagittate in shape, open with longitudal slits at the outer side and free pollen grains which have three slits or pores and consist of two cells. Within the circle of stamens is a more or less prominent, lobed disc, which is presumed not to excrete nectar. Within the disk is a varying number (1-15) of separate carpels, which have a very short style and a decurrent stigma. Each of these develops into a dry fruit (which is called a follicle), which opens with a lengthwise suture and each of which contains one or a few large fleshy seeds. The annual growth is predetermined: if the growing tip of a shoot is removed, no new buds will develop that season.

These include monoterpenoid glucosides, flavonoids, tannins, stilbenoids, triterpenoids, steroids, paeonols, and phenols. In vitro biological activities include antioxidant, antitumor, antipathogenic, immunomodulative, cardiovascular-system-protective activities and central-nervous-system activities. Paeoniaceae are dependent on C3 carbon fixation. They contain ellagic acid, myricetin, ethereal oils and flavones, as well as crystals of calcium oxalate. The wax tubules that are formed primarily consist of palmitone (the ketone of palmitic acid).  Genome  The basic chromosome number is five. About half of the species of the section Paeonia however is tetraploid (4n=20), particularly many of those in the Mediterranean region. Both allotetraploids and autotetraploids are known, and some diploid species are also of hybrid origin.  Taxonomy  The family name \\"Paeoniaceae\\" was first used by Friedrich K.L. Rudolphi in 1830, following a suggestion by Friedrich Gottlieb Bartling that same year. The family had been given other names a few years earlier.James L. Reveal. 2008 onward. \\"A Checklist of Family and Suprafamilial Names for Extant Vascular Plants.\\" At: Home page of James L. Reveal and C. Rose Broome. (see External links below). The composition of the family has varied, but it has always consisted of Paeonia and one or more genera that are now placed in Ranunculales. It has been widely believed that Paeonia is closest to Glaucidium, and this idea has been followed in some recent works.David J. Mabberley. 2008. Mabberley's Plant-Book.Cambridge University Press: UK. Molecular phylogenetic studies, however, have demonstrated conclusively that Glaucidium belongs in the family Ranunculaceae, order Ranunculales, but that Paeonia belongs in the unrelated order Saxifragales. The genus Paeonia consists of about 35 species, assigned to three sections: Moutan, Onaepia and Paeoniae. The section Onaepia only includes P. brownii and P. californicum. The section Moutan is divided into P. delavayi and P. ludlowii, together making up the subsection Delavayanae, and P. catayana, P. decomposita, P. jishanensis, P. osti, P. qiui and P. rockii which constitute the subsection Vaginatae. P. suffruticosa is a cultivated hybrid swarm, not a naturally occurring species. The remainder of the species belongs to the section Paeonia, which is characterised by a complicated reticulate evolution. Only about half of the (sub)species is diploid, the other half tetraploid, while some species both have diploid and tetraploid populations. In addition to the tetraploids, are some diploid species also likely the result of hybridisation, or nothospecies. Known diploid taxa in the Paeonia-section are P. anomala, P. lactiflora, P. veitchii, P. tenuifolia, P. emodi, P. broteri, P. cambedessedesii, P. clusii, P. rhodia, P. daurica subsps. coriifolia, daurica, macrophylla and mlokosewitschii. Tetraploid taxa are P. arietina, P. officinalis, P. parnassica, P. banatica, P. russi, P. peregrina, P. coriacea, P. mascula subsps. hellenica and mascula, and P. daurica subsps. tomentosa and wittmanniana. Species that have both diploid and tetraploid populations include P. clusii, P. mairei and P. obovata. P. anomala was proven to be a hybrid of P. lactiflora and P. veitchii, although being a diploid with 10 chromosomes. P. emodi and P. sterniana are diploid hybrids of P. lactiflora and P. veitchii too, and radically different in appearance. P. russi is the tetraploid hybrid of diploid P. lactiflora and P. mairei, while P. cambedessedesii is the diploid hybrid of P. lactiflora, likely P. mairei, but possibly also P. obovata. P. peregrina is the tetraploid hybrid of P. anomala and either P. arietina, P. humilis, P. officinalis, P. parnassica or less likely P. tenuifolia, or one of their (now extinct) common ancestors. P. banatica is the tetraploid hybrid of P. mairei and one of this same group. P. broteri, P. coriacea, P. clusii, P. rhodia, P. daurica subsp. mlokosewitschi, P. mascula subsp. hellenica and ssp. mascula, and P. daurica subsp. wittmanniana are all descendants of hybrids of P. lactiflora and P. obovata.  Phylogeny  According to recent genetic analyses, the monogeneric family Paeoniaceae is related to a group of families with woody species in the order Saxifragales. This results in the following relationship tree. One dissertation suggests the section Onaepia branches off earliest. A later publication of the same author and others suggests the Moutan-section splits off first. Within that section P. ludlowii and P. delavayi are more related to each other than to any other species. cited on { - valign=\\"top\\" align=\\"left\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" width=\\"50%\\" }  Species  *Herbaceous species (about 30 species) **Paeonia algeriensis **Paeonia anomala **Paeonia arietina **Paeonia broteri **Paeonia brownii (Brown's peony) **Paeonia californica (California peony or wild peony) **Paeonia cambessedesii (Majorcan peony) **Paeonia clusii ***subsp. clusii ***subsp. rhodia **Paeonia coriacea **Paeonia corsica **Paeonia daurica ***subsp. coriifolia ***subsp. daurica ***subsp. macrophylla ***subsp. mlokosewitschii ***subsp. tomentosa ***subsp. velebitensis ***subsp. wittmanniana **Paeonia emodi **Paeonia intermedia **Paeonia kesrouanensis (Keserwan peony) **Paeonia lactiflora (Chinese or common garden peony) **Paeonia mairei **Paeonia mascula (Balkan, wild or male peony) **Paeonia obovata ***subsp. willmottiae **Paeonia officinalis (European or common peony, type species) **Paeonia parnassica (Greek peony) **Paeonia peregrina **Paeonia sterniana **Paeonia tenuifolia (Steppe peony) **Paeonia veitchii (Veitch's peony) *Woody species (about 8 species) **Paeonia decomposita **Paeonia delavayi (Delavay's tree peony) **Paeonia jishanensis (Jishan peony) **Paeonia ludlowii (Ludlow's tree peony) **Paeonia ostii (Osti's peony) **Paeonia qiui (Qiu's peony) **Paeonia rockii (Rock's peony or tree peony; synonym Paeonia suffruticosa subsp. rockii (Chinese tree peony, known as \\"moutan (moutan peony)\\" in China)) File:Paeonia anomala riu orkhon.jpgPaeonia anomala File:Peon√≠a o Rosa alabardera (Peonia broteroi) (3814459852).jpgPaeonia broteri File:Paeoniabrownii3.jpgPaeonia brownii File:Paeonia californica 2320679478.jpgPaeonia californica File:Paeonia cambessedesii - Copenhagen Botanical Garden - DSC07470.JPGPaeonia cambessedesii File:Paeonia cambessedesii 2c.JPGPaeonia cambessedesii File:Paeonia daurica ssp mlokosewitschii.jpgPaeonia daurica mlokosewitschii File:Paeonia delavayi feuille.jpgPaeonia delavayi File:Paeonia emodi - Kew Gardens.jpgPaeonia emodi File:Paeonia anomala var. intermedia 2016-04-19 7716.JPGPaeonia intermedia File:Paeonia ludlowii.jpgPaeonia ludlowii File:Paeonia mairei.jpgPaeonia mairei File:Paeonia mascula 02.jpgPaeonia mascula File:Paeonia mascula subsp. russoi 3.jpgPaeonia russoi File:Paeonia japonica.JPGPaeonia obovata japonica File:Rugova Mountains.jpgPaeonia officinalis File:Paeonia ostii.jpgPaeonia ostii File:Paeonia rockii 2011 G2.jpgPaeonia rockii File:–í–æ—Ä–æ–Ω–µ—Ü—å 09.jpgPaeonia tenuifolia  Etymology  The peony is named after Paeon (also spelled Paean), a student of Asclepius, the Greek god of medicine and healing. In Greek mythology, when Asclepius became jealous of his pupil, Zeus saved Paeon from the wrath of Asclepius by turning him into the peony flower.Flowers in Greek Mythology, VALENTINE floral creations. Accessed 23 June 2008.  Distribution  The genus Paeonia naturally occurs in the temperate and cold areas of the Northern Hemisphere. The section Moutan, which includes all woody species, is restricted in the wild to Central and Southern China, including Tibet. The section Onaepia consist of two herbaceous species and is present in the West of North-America, P. brownii between southern British Columbia and the Sierra Nevada in California and eastward to Wyoming and Utah, while P. californica is limited to the coastal mountains of Southern and Central California. The section Paeonia, which comprises all other herbaceous species, occurs in a band stretching roughly from Morocco to Japan. One species of the section Paeonia, P. anomala, has by far the largest distribution, which is also north of the distribution of the other species: from the Kola peninsula in North- West Russia, to Lake Baikal in Siberia and South to the Tien Shan Mountains of Kazakhstan. The rest of the section concentrates around the Mediterranean, and in Asia. The species around the Mediterranean include Paeonia algeriensis that is an endemic of the coastal mountains of Algeria, P. coriacea in the Rif Mountains and Andalusia, P. cambessedesii on Majorca, P. russoi on Corsica, Sardinia and Sicilly, P. corsica on Corsica, Sardinia, the Ionian islands and in western Greece, P. clusii subsp. clusii on Crete and Karpathos, and subsp. rhodia on Rhodes, P. kesrouanensis in the Western Taurus Mountains, P. arietina from the Middle Taurus Mountains, P. broteri in Andalucia, P. humilis from Andalucia to the Provence, P. officinalis from the South of France, through Switzerland to the Middle of Italy, P. banatica in western Romania, northern Serbia and Slovenia and in southern Hungary, P. peregrina in Albania, western Bulgaria, northern Greece, western Romania, Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia, while P. mascula has a large distribution from Catalonia and southern France to Israel and Turkey. Between the two concentrations, the subspecies of Paeonia daurica occur, with subspecies velebitensis in Croatia, and daurica in the Balkans and Crimea, while the other subspecies coriifolia, macrophylla, mlokosewitschii, tomentosa and wittmanniana are known from the Caucasus, Ka√ßkar and Alborz Mountains. Paeonia emodi occurs in the western Himalayas between Pakistan and western Nepal, P. sterniana is an endemic of southeastern Tibet, P. veitchii grows in Central China (Qinghai, Ningxia, Gansu, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Sichuan and the eastern rim of Tibet), like P. mairei (Gansu, Guizhou, Hubei, Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Yunnan), while P. obovata grows in warm-temperate to cold China, including Manchuria, Korea, Japan, Far Eastern Russia (Primorsky Krai) and on Sakhalin, and P. lactiflora occurs in Northern China, including Manchuria, Japan, Korea, Mongolia, Russia (Far East and Siberia).  Distributional history  The species of the section Paeonia have a disjunct distribution, with most of the species occurring in the Mediterranean, while many others occur in eastern Asia. Genetic analysis has shown that all Mediterranean species are either diploid or tetraploid hybrids that resulted from the crossbreeding of species currently limited to eastern Asia. The large distance between the ranges of the parent species and the nothospecies suggest that hybridisation already occurred relatively long ago. It is likely that the parent species occurred in the same region when the hybrids arose, and were later exterminated by successive Pleistocene glaciations, while the nothospecies remained in refugia to the South of Europe. During their retreat P. lactiflora and P. mairei likely became sympatric and so produced the Himalayan nothospecies P. emodi and P. sterniana.  Cultivation  Paeonia 'Sarah Bernhardt'Ancient Chinese texts mention the peony was used for flavoring food. Confucius (551‚Äì479 BC) is quoted to have said: \\"I eat nothing without its sauce. I enjoy it very much, because of its flavor.\\" Peonies have been used and cultivated in China since early history. Ornamental cultivars were created from plants cultivated for medicine in China as of the sixth and seventh century. Peonies became particularly popular during the Tang dynasty, when they were grown in the imperial gardens. In the tenth century the cultivation of peonies spread through China, and the seat of the Sung dynasty, Luoyang, was the centre for its cultivation, a position it still holds today. A second centre for peony cultivation developed during the Qing dynasty in C√°ozh≈çu, now known as He Ze. Both cities still host annual peony exhibitions and state-funded peony research facilities. Before the tenth century, P. lactiflora was introduced in Japan, and over time many varieties were developed both by self fertilisation and crossbreeding, particularly during the eighteenth to twentieth centuries (middle Edo to early Sh≈çwa periods). During the 1940s Toichi Itoh succeeded in crossing tree peonies and herbaceous peonies and so created a new class of so- called intersectional hybrids. Although P. officinalis and its cultivars were grown in Europe from the fifteenth century on, originally also for medicinal purposes, intensive breeding started only in the nineteenth century when P. lactiflora was introduced from its native China to Europe. The tree peony was introduced in Europe and planted in Kew Gardens in 1789. The main centre of peony breeding in Europe has been in the United Kingdom, and particularly France. Here, breeders like Victor Lemoine and Fran√ßois F√©lix Crousse selected many new varieties, mainly with P. lactiflora, such as \\"Avant Garde\\" and \\"Le Printemps\\". The Netherlands is the largest peony cut flower producing country with about 50 million stems each year, with \\"Sarah Bernhardt\\" dominating the sales with over 20 million stems.  Plant growth habits  Peony species come in two distinct growth habits, while hybrid cultivars in addition may occupy an intermediate habit. * herbaceous: During summer, renewal buds develop on the underground stem (the \\"crown\\"), particularly at the foot of the current season's annual shoots. These renewal buds come in various sizes. Large buds will grow into stems the following growing season, but smaller buds remain dormant. The primordia for the leaves can already be found in June, but the flower only starts differentiating in October, as the annual shoots die down, completing its development in December, when sepals, petals, stamens and pistils are all recognisable. * tree: During the summer, large buds develop at the tip of the annual growth and near its foot. In the autumn, the leaves are shed, and the new stems become woody and are perennial. * Itoh (or \\"Intersectional\\"): In 1948 horticulturist Toichi Itoh from Tokyo used pollen from the yellow tree peony \\"Alice Harding\\" to fertilize the herbaceous P. lactiflora \\"Katoden\\", which resulted in a new category of peonies, the Itoh or intersectional cultivars. These are herbaceous, have leaves like tree peonies, with many large flowers from late spring to early autumn, and good peony wilt resistance. Some of the early Itoh cultivars are \\"Yellow Crown\\", \\"Yellow Dream\\", \\"Yellow Emperor\\" and \\"Yellow Heaven\\".  Flower types  Six types of flower are generally distinguished in cultivars of herbaceous peonies. * single: a single or double row of broad petals encircle fertile stamens, carpels visible. * Japanese: a single or double row of broad petals encircle somewhat broadened staminodes, may carry pollen along the edges, carpels visible. * anemone: a single or double row of broad petals encircle narrow incurved petal-like staminodes; fertile stamens are absent, carpels visible. * semi-double: a single or double row of broad petals encircles further broad petals intermingled with stamens. * bomb: a single row of broad petals encircles a shorter dense pompon of narrower petals. * double: the flower consists of many broad petals only, including those which likely are altered stamens and carpels.

Tree peonies can be propagated by grafting, division, seed, and from cuttings, although root grafting is most common commercially. Herbaceous peonies such as Paeonia lactiflora, will die back to ground level each autumn. Their stems will reappear the following spring. However tree peonies, such as Paeonia suffruticosa, are shrubbier. They produce permanent woody stems that will lose their leaves in winter but the stem itself remains intact above ground level.  Uses  The herb known as Paeonia, in particular the root of P. lactiflora (Bai Shao, Radix Paeoniae Lactiflorae), has been used frequently in traditional medicines of Korea, China and Japan. In Japan, Paeonia lactiflora used to be called ebisugusuri (\\"foreign medicine\\"). Pronunciation of Áâ°‰∏π (peony) in Japan is \\"botan.\\" In kampo (the Japanese adaptation of Chinese medicine), its root was used as a treatment for convulsions. It is also cultivated as a garden plant. In Japan Paeonia suffruticosa is called the \\"King of Flowers\\" and Paeonia lactiflora is called the \\"Prime Minister of Flowers.\\"Sasaki, Sanmi. 2005. Chado: The Way of Tea: A Japanese Tea Master's Almanac. Translated from the Japanese by Shaun McCabe and Iwasaki Satoko. Boston: Tuttle. Page 247. In China, the fallen petals of Paeonia lactiflora are parboiled and sweetened as a tea-time delicacy. Peony water, an infusion of peony petals, was used for drinking in the Middle Ages. The petals may be added to salads or to punches and lemonades. Peonies are also extensively grown as ornamental plants for their very large, often scented flowers.  Culture  In this gold-engraved lacquerware food tray from the Song dynasty (960-1279), the two long-tailed birds represent longevity, and the peony seen at the top center represents prosperity Peony, by Chinese artist Wang Qian, Yuan dynasty (1271-1368) Portrait of a peony by Chinese artist Yun Shouping, 17th century The peony is among the longest-used flowers in Eastern culture. Along with the plum blossom, it is a traditional floral symbol of China, where the Paeonia suffruticosa is called Áâ°‰∏π (m«îdƒÅn). It is also known as ÂØåË≤¥Ëä± (f√πgu√¨huƒÅ) \\"flower of riches and honour\\" or Ëä±Áéã (huawang) \\"king of the flowers\\", and is used symbolically in Chinese art.Terese Tse Bartholomew, Hidden Meanings in Chinese Art (San Francisco: Asian Art Museum/Chong-Moon Lee Center for Asian Art and Culture), 2006. In 1903, the Qing dynasty declared the peony as the national flower. Currently, the Republic of China government in Taiwan designates the plum blossom as the national flower, while the People's Republic of China government has no legally designated national flower. In 1994, the peony was proposed as the national flower after a nationwide poll, but the National People's Congress failed to ratify the selection. In 2003, another selection process was initiated, but no choice has been made to date. The ancient Chinese city Luoyang has a reputation as a cultivation centre for the peonies. Throughout Chinese history, peonies in Luoyang have been said to be the finest in the country. Dozens of peony exhibitions and shows are still held there annually. In the Middle Ages, peonies were often painted with their ripe seed-capsules, since it was the seeds, not the flowers, which were medically significant. Ancient superstition dictated that great care be taken not to be seen by a woodpecker while picking the plant's fruit, or the bird might peck out one's eyes.Sowerby, James & John Edward. 1899. Ranunculaceae to Cruciferae. London: George Bell & Sons. Page 69. The red flowers of the species Paeonia peregrina are important in Serbian folklore. Known as Kosovo peonies (, ), they are said to represent the blood of Serbian warriors who died when fighting in the Battle of Kosovo in June 1389. In 1957, the Indiana General Assembly passed a law to make the peony the state flower of Indiana, a title which it holds to this day. It replaced the zinnia, which had been the state flower since 1931. Mischievous nymphs were said to hide in the petals of the Peony, giving it the meaning of Shame or Bashfulness in the Language of Flowers. While the peony takes several years to re-establish itself when moved, it blooms annually for decades once it has done so.The Language of Flowers, edited by Sheila Pickles, 1990 Peonies tend to attract ants to the flower buds. This is due to the nectar that forms on the outside of the flower buds, and is not required for the plants' own pollination or other growth. The presence of ants is thought to provide some deterrence to other harmful insects though, so the production of ant- attracting nectar is plausibly a functional adaptation. Ants do not harm the plants. Peonies are a common subject in tattoos, often used along with koi- fish. The popular use of peonies in Japanese tattoo was inspired by the ukiyo-e artist Utagawa Kuniyoshi's illustrations of Suikoden, a classical Chinese novel. His paintings of warrior-heroes covered in pictorial tattoos included lions, tigers, dragons, koi fish, and peonies, among other symbols. The peony became a masculine motif, associated with a devil-may-care attitude and disregard for consequence. Famous painters of peonies have included Conrad Gessner (ca. 1550) and Auguste Renoir in 1879. Paeonia officinalis can be found in the altar picture of Maria im Rosenhag by Schongauer in the former Dominican Church in Colmar. The Italian Jesuit, painter and architect Giuseppe Castiglione (1688-1766), who worked at the court of the Qianlong Emperor in the Qing dynasty, painted peonies.

Fossil evidence reveals that Laysan ducks once lived across the entire archipelago, but today survive only on Laysan Island and two atolls. The duck has several physical and behavioral traits linked to the absence of ground-based predators in its habitat. By 1860, the ducks had disappeared from everywhere except Laysan Island. The introduction of rabbits brought the bird to the brink of extinction in 1912 with twelve surviving individuals. Rabbits were eradicated from the island in 1923 and numbers of Laysan ducks began to rise, reaching 500 by the 1950s. In an effort to ensure the long-term future of this duck, 42 birds were translocated to Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge in 2002. These thrived in their new surroundings, and another group were later relocated to Kure Atoll. Taxonomy Named by Lionel Walter Rothschild in 1892, the Laysan duck is named after Laysan island, one of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the mallard clade of dabbling ducks, and is a highly unusual species, both behaviorally and genetically. Recent evidence suggests they originated from an east Asian, southern hemisphere ancestor of mallards, not from stray migratory mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) as had been reported in the past. Description The Laysan duck is teal-sized and dark brown, with a prominent white eye-ring. The bill is short and spatulate, dark green with variable black blotching in males, and dull orange with variable black blotching in females. The Laysan duck usually has a ring of fat around its neck. Some males show faint iridescence on the head or neck and have slightly upturned central tail feathers. The wing has an iridescent purplish-green patch (speculum feathers) in both sexes. Leucistism, or extensive white feathering, is common on the head and neck of older birds. The legs and feet are orange, usually brighter in the male. The annual pre-basic molt is complete, and the ducks lose all their flight feathers and become incapable of flight until new feathers grow in. Wild ducks have been known to live to the age of twelve years, and captive birds have lived to the age of eighteen. Behavior The Laysan duck is a poor flyer, but walks and runs well, with a pelvic girdle adapted to terrestrial foraging. Its wings and wing muscles are reduced; it prefers to freeze in place when pursued. Energetic foraging behavior includes a fly-snapping sprint through Neoscatella sexnotata brine fly swarms. With necks outstretched, and bills close to the ground, the ducks run along a mudflat and as clouds of flies rise up in front, snap them up by rapidly opening and closing their bills. The ducks also will dabble and filter feed along lake shallows, shore, and in upland vegetation for macroinvertebrates, algae, leaves, and seeds. During the day, and especially in the breeding season, they prefer to hide among the grass and shrub vegetation, helping them to avoid avian predators such as frigatebirds. They prefer to venture out in the open and feed on the lake from dusk til dawn, although there seems to be marked variation from year to year according to the availability of food items. Reproduction Pair formation begins in fall, and nest building begins in spring. The female builds a well-concealed nest on the ground below dense vegetation, especially Eragrostis variabilis bunchgrass. The nest is a shallow bowl lined with dead grass and down feathers. Egg-laying typically occurs from April to August. Average clutch size on Laysan Island is approximately four bird egg/eggs. The newly established population on Midway lays larger clutches, presumably because of better availability of food. Ducklings are precocious and feed on their own day two after hatching, but are guarded, brooded, and led to foraging sites by the hen for approximately 40 to 60 days. Status and conservation=Decline to near-extinction Male Laysan duck The decline of the Laysan duck began between AD 400 and 1000, with the colonization of the Hawaiian Islands by Polynesians and associated non-native mammalian predators. By 1860, the ducks disappeared from all but Laysan Island (the duck's namesake), most likely due to predation by introduced rats. Like many isolated island species, the Laysan duck evolved in an environment lacking mammalian predators, and is ill-suited to defend itself against non-native ground hunters, such as humans, rats, pigs, and small Asian mongooses. For example, Laysan ducks are more likely to freeze their movement rather than flush or fly when startled‚Äî a strategy well suited for cryptic defense against Hawaii's native flying predators, but ineffective against ground predators. The Laysan duck can still fly, but not very well and not for long distances; it does not disperse between islands. The Laysan duck found refuge through most of the nineteenth century on rat-free Laysan Island, surviving within the smallest geographic range of any duck species worldwide (). Laysan Island gained federal protection in 1909, with the establishment of the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge. However, devastation of the island's vegetation by introduced domestic rabbits brought the duck to the brink of extinction in 1912, with an all-time low population of seven adults and five juveniles. Recovery After many domestic rabbits starved and the remaining ones were eradicated by biologists in 1923, the ducks began to recover, increasing to a population of about 500 individuals by the 1950s. Congress passed the Endangered Species Preservation Act in 1966, and in 1967 the Laysan duck was declared an endangered species with federal protection. However, population bottlenecks occurred, such as the severe 1993 El Ni√±o drought and food shortage, which reduced the number of ducks to about 100. Today, breeding and survival of the birds are closely tracked. Since 1998, a sample of birds have been fitted with unique leg bands or radio transmitters for monitoring reproductive success and survival, revealing that typically only 30% of ducklings on Laysan Island survive to fledge. In 2004, the population grew to an estimated 576 ducks. Laysan ducks chasing brine flies In October 2004 and 2005, 42 Laysan ducks were translocated to Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge as a collaborative effort between the United States Geological Survey and Fish and Wildlife Service to establish a second population of ducks in the wild. The creation of a second population, since disaster is unlikely to strike both atolls simultaneously, reduces the risk of extinction by random catastrophes such as drought, hurricanes, tsunamis, disease outbreaks (like avian influenza), and accidental introductions of non-native plants and animals. The second ‚Äúinsurance‚Äù population of Laysan ducks on Midway has grown quickly, more than doubling in size within the first two years. As of January 2007, 100 ducks call Midway's Sand and Eastern Islands home. Researchers monitoring the Midway population have found that the ducks are breeding at an earlier age, and laying more eggs than birds on Laysan. This suggests that the abundant habitat and food available on Midway have stimulated greater reproductive effort in the ducks, which contributes optimism for the success of this re-introduced population. A third population has now been introduced to Kure Atoll. Future outlook The persistence of the Laysan duck into the future seems likely at present, though threats to the population remain. Threats include the introduction of non-native species, which may change vital rates, displace native species and adversely affect nesting and foraging opportunities. Devastation to vegetation could increase sedimentation of the lakes and seeps that serve as important foraging habitat. Human disturbance may impact nesting and brooding, and landing permits to the Laysan Island refuge are granted only for official or scientific purposes. Debris and contaminants washed ashore by ocean currents could pose a serious threat to the duck. Pesticide containers and oil spills have contaminated Laysan in the past. The island homes of the duck are especially vulnerable to a rise in sea level and extreme weather associated with global warming. Even a slight rise in sea level would destroy a large portion of the duck's current habitat. The spread of parasites such as the nematode Echinuria uncinata could be extremely pathogenic, as well as the introduction of disease by migratory waterfowl along the Pacific Flyway (such as avian influenza, avian malaria, cholera, botulism and duck plague). Environmental catastrophes such as drought, severe storms, and tsunamis may decimate populations. Sea level rise and increased frequency and severity of storms are an anticipated effect of global warming and could effect the population of the Laysan duck. Laysan duck brood A recovery plan for the Laysan duck has been developed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The goal of the recovery program is to conserve and recover the species to the extent that it may be down-listed from endangered to threatened in the near future, and ultimately, that the population be healthy enough to no longer require federal protection under the Endangered Species Act. The emphasis of the recovery plan is the distribution of additional viable populations in the Laysan duck's historical and prehistorical range. The creation of multiple populations will decrease the risk that catastrophic events will result in species extinction. The increase of population size will diminish the threats from demographic and environmental uncertainties. To achieve this goal, biologists plan to establish at least five populations on a combination of predator-free Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and predator-controlled sites on Main Hawaiian Islands. This plan includes wild translocation and the establishment of a successful captive or semi-captive breeding program using wild source eggs for reintroductions to the Main Hawaiian Islands. Additionally, the plan calls for achieving gene flow between the wild source populations through long-term inter-island translocations, and island-specific management for each population to reduce threats and improve quality of habitat. If basic criteria of the recovery plan are met, the Laysan duck could be down-listed from endangered to threatened by 2019.  References  External links  * THIS IS MISSING NOW, SEP. 10, 2020!!!

Berkeley devised elaborate musical production numbers that often involved complex geometric patterns. Berkeley's works used large numbers of showgirls and props as fantasy elements in kaleidoscopic on-screen performances.  Early life  The \\"By a Waterfall\\" production number from Footlight Parade (1933) made use of one of the largest soundstages ever built, specially constructed by Warner Bros. to film Berkeley's creations. Dames (1934). Berkeley was born in Los Angeles, California, to Francis Enos (who died when Busby was eight) and stage actress Gertrude Berkeley (1864‚Äì1946). Among Gertrude's friends, and a performer in Tim Frawly's Stock company run by Busby Berkeley's father, were actress Amy Busby from whom Berkeley gained the appellation \\"Buzz\\" or \\"Busby\\"Amy Busby portrait gallery; New York Public Library Retrieved April 28, 2015 and actor William Gillette, then only four years away from playing Sherlock Holmes.

In addition to her stage work, Gertrude played mother roles in silent films while Berkeley was still a child. Berkeley made his stage d√©but at five, acting in the company of his performing family. In 1917, he lived in Athol, Massachusetts, working as an advertising and sales manager.U.S., World War I Draft Registration Cards, 1917‚Äì1918 for Busby Berkeley Enos During World War I, Berkeley served as a field artillery lieutenant. Watching soldiers drill may have inspired his later complex choreography. Career=Early years During the 1920s, Berkeley was a dance director for nearly two dozen Broadway musicals, including such hits as A Connecticut Yankee. As a choreographer, Berkeley was less concerned with the dancing skill of his chorus girls as he was with their ability to form themselves into attractive geometric patterns. His musical numbers were among the largest and best-regimented on Broadway. His earliest film work was in Samuel Goldwyn's Eddie Cantor musicals, where he began developing such techniques as a \\"parade of faces\\" (individualizing each chorus girl with a loving close-up), and moving his dancers all over the stage (and often beyond) in as many kaleidoscopic patterns as possible. Berkeley's top shot technique (the kaleidoscope again, this time shot from overhead) appeared seminally in the Cantor films, and also the 1932 Universal drama film Night World (where he choreographed the number \\"Who's Your Little Who-Zis?\\"). Groundbreaking choreographer Berkeley's numbers were known for starting out in the realm of the stage, but quickly exceeding this space by moving into a time and place that could only be cinematic, only to return to shots of an applauding audience and the fall of a curtain. He used only one camera to achieve this, instead of the usual four, to retain control over his vision so no director could edit the film. As choreographer, Berkeley was allowed a certain degree of independence in his direction of musical numbers, and they were often markedly distinct from (and sometimes in contrast to) the narrative sections of the films. He often didn't even see the other sections of the picture. The numbers he choreographed were mostly upbeat and focused on decoration as opposed to substance, some costing around $10,000 a minute more than the picture they were in. One dramatic exception was the heart-rending and notably martial \\"Remember My Forgotten Man\\" from Gold Diggers of 1933, which dealt with the mistreatment of World War I veterans during the Great Depression. Berkeley's popularity with an entertainment-hungry Depression audience was secured when he choreographed five musicals back-to-back for Warner Bros.: 42nd Street, Footlight Parade, the aforementioned Gold Diggers of 1933, Dames, and Fashions of 1934, as well as In Caliente and Wonder Bar with Dolores del R√≠o. Berkeley always denied any deep significance to his work, arguing that his main professional goals were to constantly top himself and to never repeat his past accomplishments. As the outsized musicals in which Berkeley specialized became pass√©, he turned to straight directing. The result was 1939's They Made Me a Criminal, one of John Garfield's best films and although a success at the box office, it was the only non musical film Berkeley directed. Berkeley had several well-publicized run-ins with MGM stars such as Judy Garland. In 1943, he was removed as director of Girl Crazy because of disagreements with Garland, although the lavish musical number \\"I Got Rhythm\\", which he directed, remained in the picture.Hugh Fordin, The World of Entertainment: The Freed Unit at MGM, 1975 Carmen Miranda in The Gang's All Here (1943) His next stop was at 20th Century-Fox for 1943's The Gang's All Here, in which Berkeley choreographed Carmen Miranda's \\"Lady in the Tutti- Frutti Hat\\" number. The film made money, but Berkeley and the Fox brass disagreed over budget matters. Berkeley returned to MGM in the late 1940s, where among many other accomplishments he conceived the Technicolor finales for the studio's Esther Williams films. Berkeley's final film as choreographer was MGM's Billy Rose's Jumbo (1962).  Later years In the late 1960s, the camp craze brought the Berkeley musicals back to the forefront. He toured the college and lecture circuit, and even directed a 1930s-style cold medication commercial for Contac capsules entitled the \\"Cold Diggers of 1969\\", complete with a top shot of a dancing clock. The 75 year-old Berkeley returned to Broadway to direct a successful revival of No No Nanette starring his old Warner Brothers colleague and 42nd Street star Ruby Keeler; both also played cameos in the 1970 film The Phynx the same year.  Personal life  Berkeley was married six times.Hanley, Robert (1976). \\"Busby Berkeley, the Dance Director, Dies\\", in the New York Times, March 15, 1976, p. 33 His wives included actresses Merna Kennedy, Esther Muir the starlet Claire James, and Etta Dunn, who survived him. He was also involved in an alienation of affections lawsuit in 1938 involving Carole Landis, and was engaged to Lorraine Stein.Fleming, E.J. (2005). Carole Landis: A Tragic Life in Hollywood. Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland and Co. , p. 49 Berkeley drank heavily, often having martinis in his daily bath. After his mother died and his career began to slow, he attempted suicide, slitting his wrists and taking an overdose of sleeping pills in July of 1946. He was admitted to a hospital for an extended stay, an experience which severely affected his mental state. In September 1935, Berkeley was responsible for an automobile accident in which two people were killed and five seriously injured.People, Sep. 30, 1935, from Time magazine Badly cut and bruised, he was brought to court on a stretcher,Choreographer and film director Busby Berkeley being carried into his manslaughter trial on a stretcher, a Los Angeles Times photo from the website of the UCLA Charles E.

Some witnesses said they smelled liquor on him'. The first two trials for second degree murder ended with hung juries; he was acquitted in a third. Berkeley died from natural causes on March 14, 1976 in Palm Springs, California at the age of 80.Johns, Howard, (2004). Palm Springs Confidential: Playground of the Stars. Fort Lee, New Jersey: Barricade Books. He is buried in the Desert Memorial Park in Cathedral City, California.

A classic example is the centrifugal governor, also known as the Watt or fly-ball governor on a reciprocating steam engine, which uses the effect of inertial force on rotating weights driven by the machine output shaft to regulate its speed by altering the input flow of steam.  History  Cut-away drawing of steam engine speed governor. The valve starts fully open at zero speed, and is closed as the balls rotate and rise. The speed sensing drive shaft is top right Porter governor on a Corliss steam engineCentrifugal governors were used to regulate the distance and pressure between millstones in windmills since the 17th century. Early steam engines employed a purely reciprocating motion, and were used for pumping water ‚Äì an application that could tolerate variations in the working speed. It was not until the Scottish engineer James Watt introduced the rotative steam engine, for driving factory machinery, that a constant operating speed became necessary. Between the years 1775 and 1800, Watt, in partnership with industrialist Matthew Boulton, produced some 500 rotative beam engines. At the heart of these engines was Watt's self-designed \\"conical pendulum\\" governor: a set of revolving steel balls attached to a vertical spindle by link arms, where the controlling force consists of the weight of the balls. The theoretical basis for the operation of governors was described by James Clerk Maxwell in 1868 in his seminal paper 'On Governors'. Building on Watt's design was American engineer Willard Gibbs who in 1872 theoretically analyzed Watt's conical pendulum governor from a mathematical energy balance perspective. During his Graduate school years at Yale University, Gibbs observed that the operation of the device in practice was beset with the disadvantages of sluggishness and a tendency to over-correct for the changes in speed it was supposed to control. Gibbs theorized that, analogous to the equilibrium of the simple Watt governor (which depends on the balancing of two torques: one due to the weight of the \\"balls\\" and the other due to their rotation), thermodynamic equilibrium for any work producing thermodynamic system depends on the balance of two entities. The first is the heat energy supplied to the intermediate substance, and the second is the work energy performed by the intermediate substance. In this case, the intermediate substance is steam. These sorts of theoretical investigations culminated in the 1876 publication of the Gibbs' famous work On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances and in the construction of the Gibbs‚Äô governor. These formulations are ubiquitous today in the natural sciences in the form of the Gibbs' free energy equation, which is used to determine the equilibrium of chemical reactions; also known as Gibbs equilibrium.Wheeler, L. (1951). Josiah Willard Gibbs - the History of a Great Mind. Woodbridge, CT: Ox Bow Press. Governors were also to be found on early motor vehicles (such as the 1900 Wilson-Pilcher), where they were an alternative to a hand throttle. They were used to set the required engine speed, and the vehicle's throttle and timing were adjusted by the governor to hold the speed constant, similar to a modern cruise control. Governors were also optional on utility vehicles with engine driven accessories such as winches or hydraulic pumps (such as Land Rovers), again to keep the engine at the required speed regardless of variations of the load being driven. Speed limiters Governors can be used to limit the top speed for vehicles, and for some classes of vehicle such devices are a legal requirement. They can more generally be used to limit the rotational speed of the internal combustion engine or protect the engine from damage due to excessive rotational speed. Cars Today, BMW, Audi, Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz limit their production cars to . Certain Quattro GmbH and AMG cars, and the Mercedes/McLaren SLR is an exception. The BMW Rolls-Royces are limited to . Jaguars, although British, also have a limiter, as do the Swedish Saab and Volvo on cars where it is necessary.

In European markets, General Motors Europe sometimes choose to discount the agreement, meaning that certain high-powered Opel or Vauxhall cars can exceed the mark, whereas their Cadillacs do not. Ferrari, Lamborghini, Maserati, Porsche, Aston Martin and Bentley also do not limit their cars, at least not to . The Chrysler 300C SRT8 is limited to 270 km/h. Most Japanese domestic market vehicles are limited to only or . The top speed is a strong sales argument, though speeds above about are not likely reachable on public roads.

Mopeds Mopeds in the United Kingdom have had to have a speed limiter since 1977. p.179 states: \\"Mopeds redefined to 30 mph maximum design speed\\" Most other European countries have similar rules (see the main article). Public services vehicles Public service vehicles often have a legislated top speed. Scheduled coach services in the United kingdom (and also bus services) are limited to 65 mph. Urban public buses often have speed governors which are typically set to between and . Trucks (HGVs) All heavy vehicles in Europe and New Zealand have law/by-law governors that limits their speeds to or . Fire engines and other emergency vehicles are exempt from this requirement. Example uses=Aircraft Aircraft propellers are another application. The governor senses shaft RPM, and adjusts or controls the angle of the blades to vary the torque load on the engine. Thus as the aircraft speeds up (as in a dive) or slows (in climb) the RPM is held constant. Small engines Small engines, used to power lawn mowers, portable generators, and lawn and garden tractors, are equipped with a governor to limit fuel to the engine to a maximum safe speed when unloaded and to maintain a relatively constant speed despite changes in loading. In the case of generator applications, the engine speed must be closely controlled so the output frequency of the generator will remain reasonably constant. Small engine governors are typically one of three types: *Pneumatic: the governor mechanism detects air flow from the flywheel blower used to cool an air-cooled engine. The typical design includes an air vane mounted inside the engine's blower housing and linked to the carburetor's throttle shaft. A spring pulls the throttle open and, as the engine gains speed, increased air flow from the blower forces the vane back against the spring, partially closing the throttle. Eventually a point of equilibrium will be reached and the engine will run at a relatively constant speed. Pneumatic governors are simple in design and inexpensive to produce. However, they do not regulate engine speed very accurately and are affected by air density, as well as external conditions that may influence airflow. *Centrifugal: a flyweight mechanism driven by the engine is linked to the throttle and works against a spring in a fashion similar to that of the pneumatic governor, resulting in essentially identical operation. A centrifugal governor is more complex to design and produce than a pneumatic governor. However, the centrifugal design is more sensitive to speed changes and hence is better suited to engines that experience large fluctuations in loading. *Electronic: a servo motor is linked to the throttle and controlled by an electronic module that senses engine speed by counting electrical pulses emitted by the ignition system or a magnetic pickup. The frequency of these pulses varies directly with engine speed, allowing the control module to apply a proportional voltage to the servo to regulate engine speed. Due to their sensitivity and rapid response to speed changes, electronic governors are often fitted to engine-driven generators designed to power computer hardware, as the generator's output frequency must be held within narrow limits to avoid malfunction. Turbine controls Operation of a flyball governor to control speeds of a water turbine In steam turbines, the steam turbine governing is the procedure of monitoring and controlling the flow rate of steam into the turbine with the objective of maintaining its speed of rotation as constant. The flow rate of steam is monitored and controlled by interposing valves between the boiler and the turbine. In water turbines, governors have been used since the mid-19th century to control their speed. A typical system would use a Flyball governor acting directly on the turbine input valve or the wicket gate to control the amount of water entering the turbine. By 1930, mechanical governors started to use PID controllers for more precise control. In the later part of the twentieth century, electronic governors and digital systems started to replace mechanical governors. Electrical generator For electrical generation on synchronous electrical grids, prime movers drive electrical generators which are electrically coupled to any other generators on the grid. With droop speed control, the frequency of the entire grid determines the fuel delivered to each generator, so that if the grid runs faster, the fuel is reduced to each generator by its governor to limit the speed. Elevator Governors are used in an Elevator. It acts as a stopping mechanism in case the elevator runs beyond its tripping speed (which is usually a factor of the maximum speed of the lift and is preset by the manufacturer as per the international lift safety guidelines). This device must be installed in traction elevators and roped hydraulic elevators.

Her keel was laid down on 12 January 1944 by the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company of Manitowoc, Wisconsin. She was launched on 28 May 1944 sponsored by Emily Taft Douglas, Congresswoman from Illinois, and later United States Senator from Illinois, and commissioned on 14 October 1944 with Commander Frank D. Latta in command. Latta was a veteran of nine war patrols and holder of the Navy Cross, earned while commanding officer of . Floated high and dry in a floating drydock down the Mississippi River, among the islands and channels of which her captain had first \\"felt the call of the sea\\" as \\"a mere youth\\", Lagarto departed New Orleans, Louisiana, on 12 November 1944, for Panama, escorted by the submarine chaser . Releasing her escort on 15 November, Lagarto reported to Commander, Panama Sea Frontier, to begin her shakedown two days later. Captain John G. Johns supervised the boat's training during the period between 20 November and 5 December 1944. Sadly, during that period, on 3 December, Chief Machinist's Mate Pat Cole died of coronary thrombosis while Lagarto lay at Saboya Anchorage, off Perlas Island, Panama. Clearing Balboa, Canal Zone, on 9 December 1944, Lagarto reached Pearl Harbor on Christmas Day 1944\\\\. The following day, she commenced a period of training (supervised by Captain Jesse L. Hull for its duration) and a special availability. The latter saw the installation of a second gun and replacement of the 20 mm with two 40 mm mounts, installation of additional topside ready-use lockers, eight topside mounts for .50 cal (12.7 mm) machine guns, in addition to other internal work, including the alteration of the small arms magazine to accommodate additional ammunition stowage, bringing the boat's total capacity to 220 rounds. Additionally, a Panama Bay sound test having revealed a \\"singing\\" port propeller, that was replaced. The special training and availability period concluded on 23 January 1945. January ‚Äì March 1945 Lagarto, accompanied by , departed Pearl Harbor on 24 January 1945, escorted initially by . Releasing their escort four and a half hours out, the two boats proceeded in company, conducting dives and drills daily and acting as targets for each other on alternate days. Ultimately, the pair reached the Marianas on 4 February, exchanging recognition signals with friendly planes as they neared Saipan. Escorted in by the infantry landing craft on 5 February, Lagarto moored in a nest alongside as she lay alongside in Tanapag Harbor. Haddock moored outboard. Tragedy struck the next day, however, when an automobile accident on Saipan resulted in serious injuries to two of Lagartos more experienced officers: Lieutenant Walter R. Shaw, a ‚Äúmustang‚Äù (commissioned from the enlisted ranks) veteran of three war patrols, and Ensign Allen G. Brewington, who, like Shaw, was a mustang but a veteran of nine patrols, including one in Haddock for which he had earned the Silver Star. In addition, the mishap incapacitated three of Haddocks officers, including Commander John P. ‚ÄúBeetle‚Äù Roach, her skipper and a Naval Academy classmate of Lagartos commanding officer. Consequently, Lieutenant Robert J. Williams (five war patrols) and Lieutenant, junior grade Walter B. Phelps (four war patrols) arrived by air from Guam, reporting on board Lagarto late in the forenoon watch on 7 February to replace Shaw and Brewington. Underway during the first dog watch on 7 February 1945, escorted by the motor minesweeper , \\"Latta's Lancers\\" (Task Group 17.13) formed column‚ÄîLagarto, Haddock, and ‚Äîand headed for the Bonin Islands to destroy \\"picket boats\\" in advance of the carrier strikes planned to be launched by Task Force 38 in mid- month. Releasing YMS-426 at midnight, Lagarto decoded a dispatch a little over two hours into the mid watch on 8 February, however, communicating the sad tidings that Lieutenant Shaw had died (\\"His loss was a serious blow to the Lagarto,\\" wrote Captain Willard J. Suits, Commander, Submarine Squadron 22, \\"and the submarine service.\\") of the injuries suffered in the automobile accident on the 6th. At noon the same day (8 February), while Lagarto mourned her loss, Commander Latta informed the \\"wolfpack\\" that its being behind schedule would not permit coordinated practice firing. 12 February ‚Äì 13 February Entering the assigned patrol area on 11 February 1945, \\"Latta's Lancers\\" commenced searching for their quarry. A quarter of an hour into the first dog watch on 12 February, Lagarto sighted four B-29s; contacting two over her VHF (very high frequency) radio equipment, she \\"received [the] dope on [the] picket vessels\\" they sought. Haddock likewise obtained contact data from the Superfortresses. Thus forewarned, Haddock obtained the first radar contact an hour before the end of the first watch on 12 February; opening the range, she commenced tracking what proved to be the \\"guardboats\\" (converted trawlers) No.8 Kotoshiro Maru (109 tons) and No.3 Showa Maru (76 tons), neither vessel underway. \\"With excellent SCR (Set, Complete, Radio) communication,\\" Commander Latta \\"outlined [the] plan to [the] other skippers as easily as if we were in the same wardroom\\". He ordered Sennet to westward, maintaining contact with her SJ radar, while Lagarto kept in touch with Haddock in like fashion. With the coming of the mid watch on 13 February 1945, the Japanese craft still lay-to, \\"apparently not alerted.\\" Consequently, Latta ordered Haddock to break contact and his boat formed a line of bearing on Sennet. Lagarto began opening to westward at 04:15, and at 05:40 began heading in on the surface toward the last known position of No.8 Kotoshiro Maru and No.3 Showa Maru. With Sennet on the left flank and Haddock on the right, and Lagarto as guide in the center, the boats some apart, Latta planned to close to , then turn right about 50 degrees, to put the seas and wind in a most favorable position and still close the range, allocating Sennet the picket to the north, Haddock the one to the south; Lagarto, meanwhile, would direct the fire to whichever vessel \\"appeared to be offering the most opposition.\\" At 06:20 on 13 February 1945, Lagarto manned her battle surface stations, and opened fire with her number one gun 12 minutes later on the clearly unsuspecting enemy that lay \\"nicely outlined against [the] red eastern sky\\" distant. \\"Japs began jabbering in high gear at 4,475 KCS!\\" Latta reported subsequently, as one of the guardboats managed to transmit a dispatch as chaos descended suddenly upon her: \\"Gun attack by submarines in position 30-00N, 136-30E...‚Äù Lagartos photographer seemed elated (in a \\"happy daze,\\" the commanding officer reported) at the apparently photogenic aspect of the action he was recording, repeating \\"Oh boy, Oh boy!\\" No such elation seized the enemy, however, who determinedly fought back against his heavier adversaries, as the action progressed, with whatever caliber weapon lay at hand. No.8 Kotoshiro Maru and No.3 Showa Maru began turning to the northward, returning fire with what appeared to be approximately \\"40-millimeter size\\" weapons. Lagarto recorded \\"numerous splashes within twenty yards (18 m) of ship...\\" Lagarto, followed by Sennet and Haddock, concentrated her fire upon No.8 Kotoshiro Maru, the leading and northerly vessel as she appeared to be laying a smoke screen to obscure her smaller sister; Haddock silenced the lead boat's forward gun. Inside of ten minutes, the Americans‚Äô fire began to tell, as the first quarry began to burn; smoke began obscuring her from view. Haddock, meanwhile, shifted fire to No.3 Showa Maru, noting one particularly defiant Japanese sailor firing back with a rifle, while Sennet, being blanked out by Lagarto, swung left in a full circle and fell in astern of the pack commander's boat, shifting her fire to Haddocks target as well. As No.3 Showa Maru began to burn, however, the smoke cleared away from the larger guardboat, revealing her still underway and full of fight. Sennet \\"commenced hot pursuit\\" of No.8 Kotoshiro Maru. Lagarto likewise closed the range with the larger patrol vessel, opening up with her 40-millimeter guns at ; by 06:45, No.8 Kotoshiro Maru‚Äôs guns had fallen silent and she wallowed in the sea, burning fiercely, while No.3 Showa Maru likewise lay in extremis. Haddock, having expended the last of her ammunition, headed for the latter, lying riddled and burning, to finish her off, but No.3 Showa Maru sank before the submariners could man her 40-millimeter guns. Haddock circled the wreckage several times \\"to see if we could pick up any Japs or material but neither could be found.\\" Sennet neared No.8 Kotoshiro Marus side \\"to see if anything worth salvaging was left\\", but apparently found it \\"too hot\\" and pulled clear. Latta ordered her to sink the wreck. Sennet hastened No.8 Kotoshiro Marus demise with \\"a couple rounds of 5\\" from close range.\\" \\"Latta's Lancers\\" having summarily disposed of the two guardboats (there were no survivors from either Japanese vessel) with no loss to themselves, Lagarto, Haddock, and Sennet formed a scouting line and continued their search. A little less than four hours later, a lookout in Lagarto spotted a patrolling \\"Betty\\" (Mitsubishi G4M Type 0 land attack plane) crossing astern, heading for Haddock; Lagarto submerged; Haddock spotted the Betty and did likewise; both boats logged the presence of explosions that, fortunately, caused no damage. During the first dog watch on 13 February 1945, a lookout in Haddock, despite poor visibility conditions, spotted two more guardboats lying-to about distant. Sending a contact report to her two pack-mates, Haddock maintained contact as the day went on. Lagarto exchanged calls with Sennet on the SJ, and ordered that boat to close Haddock. \\"Our choice of direction is biased\\", Latta later explained, \\"neither boat [Lagarto nor Sennet] having a sight in two days\\". At 22:49 Lagarto contacted Haddock by the SJ. \\"When within range of good SCR communication [such as had facilitated the destruction of No.8 Kotoshiro Maru and No.3 Showa Maru] [Latta] outlined to both skippers a plan previously proposed by Commander [George E.] Porter [Jr., Sennet‚Äôs commanding officer.]\\" Since Haddock had expended the last of her ammunition in the engagement with the two pickets that morning, Latta ordered her to maintain contact while Lagarto and Sennet opened to the westward as before. Those two boats would strike at dawn with gunfire and Haddock would make a close range submerged torpedo attack. Ironically, Haddock‚Äôs skipper, Commander William H. Brockman, Jr., had arrived at the same solution independently. 14 February Lagarto began her easterly approach for the attack at 05:50 on 14 February 1945. \\"No likelihood of bright eastern sky today\\", her commanding officer later recounted, \\"all heavy gray overcast and seas less favorable to gun firing.\\" Going to \\"battle surface\\" 15 minutes later, Lagarto opened fire on the right-hand vessel at , swinging to the right to bring both of her mounts to bear, \\"cold seas washing over [the] gun crews.\\" The Japanese fought back more spiritedly than the day before. \\"Return fire heavier than yesterday\\", Latta noted in his patrol report, \\"but targets slower getting underway.\\" Sennet reported numerous holes in her superstructure and one man wounded from the \\"extremely accurate\\" fire, but Lagarto emerged from the encounter unscathed. Haddock fired one torpedo at at one of the guardboats, but missed. Lagarto and Sennet, having expended the last of their ammunition, broke off the action by 07:00 and stood away from the scene of the action, leaving behind one guardboat, No.3 Kanno Maru (98 tons), damaged. 20 February Detaching Sennet to proceed to her assigned patrol area and Haddock to hers, Lagarto proceeded to carry out the remainder of her patrol. Outside aircraft sightings on 17, 19 February and 20 February, it seemed devoid of contacts until the forenoon watch on 24 February 1945 off Okino Shima. Identifying a \\"RO-class submarine\\" at 10:58, Lagarto maneuvered into position and launched four torpedoes at 11:18; she logged the sound of what appeared to be an explosion on the target, and a second explosion that seemed to reflect the impact of the torpedo with an underwater cliff. Her quarry got off a report: \\"Torpedo attack in position 32-41N., 132-36E. Damage sustained...\\" The target's screws appeared to stop shortly after the explosion, followed less than ten minutes later by a \\"heavy underwater explosion like [a] collapsed hull...\\" The identity of Lagarto‚Äôs victim appears to have been the Japanese submarine I-371 (Lieutenant Kamijukoku Yasuo), that had departed Truk for Yokosuka on 31 January 1945. However, the credit of the 880-ton merchantman Tatsumomo Maru to Lagarto seems questionable in view of Lagarto‚Äôs only carrying out one attack on one target, reported as a submarine, in excellent visibility conditions. Sweeping the area with her periscope soon thereafter, Lagarto saw only empty ocean. Later that day, she heard \\"distant, heavy depth charge explosions\\", prompting Latta to write: \\"Hope Haddock is not paying for our attack...\\" Lagarto submerged to conduct a patrol of Van Diemen Strait the following day, 25 February 1945, and the heavy seas encountered rendered control difficult; she encountered 8‚Äì10 degree rolls at depths of between periscope observations. She conducted a submerged patrol off Bungo Suido the next day, sighting a veritable parade of guardboats similar to those encountered and destroyed less than a fortnight before. She photographed the nearest one (2,500 yards) and later, \\"nothing following these lads\\", secured from battle stations. On the 27th, she encountered what she reported as a midget submarine without success. Ultimately, a few more fruitless days passed, after which she exchanged patrol areas with Haddock on 7 March. 13 March Ultimately departing her patrol area on 13 March 1945, bound for Subic Bay and a refit, Lagarto shaped course for a rendezvous with Haddock the following morning. At 06:12 on 14 March, Lagarto sighted a submarine through her high periscope, and began calling Haddock on the SCR. At 06:48, however, Lagarto sighted another submarine on an opposite bearing. \\"One of them\\", Latta later recounted, \\"is probably enemy‚Äîbut which?\\" Establishing voice communication with Haddock at 07:03 identified her as the first contact, so Lagarto advised her sister boat of the second‚Äîobviously enemy‚Äîcontact. Hobbled by her number two main engine being temporarily out of commission, Lagarto (\\"Haddock has four engines to our three\\", Latta lamented) directed Haddock to make an end-around and then attack once she had achieved a favorable position to do so. Tracking the enemy all morning allowed Lagarto to improve the bearing, identifying her as an \\"I-class submarine.\\" Decreasing the range, both American boats gained on the enemy, but \\"Haddock found a few more turns and began to pull ahead rapidly.\\" Latta wished Commander Brockman luck. Ultimately, however, the Japanese boat frustrated the Americans‚Äô designs, submerging and escaping both. \\"After [a] final talk with Comdr. Brockman and mutual well-wishing\\", Latta wrote subsequently, \\"[Lagarto] took departure and set course for previously assigned route to Subic Bay.\\" Lagarto joined her escort, an hour into the morning watch on 20 March 1945, and after anchoring for a sound test in Subic Bay, moored alongside the submarine tender to commence a refit. She returned from patrol \\"clean and shipshape with a minimum number of material defects.\\" April ‚Äì May 1945 Lagarto departed Subic Bay on 12 April 1945, bound for the South China Sea, and received orders on 27 April to patrol the outer waters of the Gulf of Siam. A little under an hour into the forenoon watch on 2 May, exchanged calls with Lagarto by SJ radar. Later, an hour into the afternoon watch on 2 May, Baya sighted a Consolidated PB4Y-2 Privateer and contacted him by VHF. While \\"he had no dope for us\\", Baya‚Äôs skipper wrote later, the submarine informed the aviators of the proximity of Lagarto and . At 20:55, Baya again exchanged calls with Lagarto; less than an hour later, she slowed to take soundings, recording seven fathoms. She changed course to parallel the coast. 2 May Baya‚Äôs SJ picked up four contacts at at 21:55 on 2 May 1945; her battle stations tracking party took their places. At 22:10, Baya sent a contact report to Lagarto. Latta responded at 22:45 that his boat was in contact with a convoy, tracking it on a base course of 310¬∞ (T), speed nine knots (17 km/h), running along the 5 to 7 fathom curve (10 m). There was one large ship, one medium, and two escorts, both of which appeared to be equipped with 10-centimeter radar. Beneath a clear, dark, sky, Baya began her attack at through the flat sea, from off the convoy‚Äôs starboard bow, setting her torpedoes to run at four feet. Soon she began encountering SJ and 10-centimeter radar interference \\"all around the dial\\". Two additional contacts materialized‚Äîone turned out to be a large three-masted junk, the other proved to be Lagarto. Baya, however, soon had her hands full; as her commanding officer later reported: \\"Jap gunnery poor but plenty of it. Tracers passing down both sides of the periscope shears and overhead...\\" Both escort vessels‚Äîone of which Baya identified as a \\"Shiretaka-type minelayer\\"‚Äîgave a good account of themselves; at 23:33, Baya informed Lagarto \\"that we had been driven off by gunfire.\\" Baya‚Äôs skipper later ruminated: \\"It is nothing short of a miracle that we came through so much gun fire without a single hit.\\" \\"We were in a continuous hail of lead, fire, and steel and sustained not a scratch.\\" 3 May The dogged defenders, who skillfully utilized searchlights and withering gunfire of calibers from to 25-millimeter, elicited grudging admiration of the American submariners. During the mid watch on 3 May 1945, Baya rendezvoused with Lagarto and their captains discussed plans. The latter's proposed to dive on the convoy's track to make contact at 14:00, in the middle of the afternoon watch; Baya would be 10 to further along the track, \\"if no contact was made we [Baya] were to intercept at 20:00 at convoy‚Äôs possible 21:30 position.\\" That having been arranged, the boats set course for their arranged stations. At 15:00 on 3 May 1945, Baya sent the first \\"of numerous contact reports to Lagarto.\\" By 23:47, \\"having sent Lagarto contact reports almost half hourly with no receipt\\", Baya decided to go it alone. Again, however, the Japanese escorts drove off Baya when she attacked during the mid watch on 4 May, again saving their charges from destruction. Post-war examination of Japanese records revealed the most likely reason for Lagarto‚Äôs silence. One of the two escorts, the minelayer , made an attack on 3 May against a submerged submarine in of water at . Announced as \\"overdue from patrol and presumed lost\\" on 10 August 1945, Lagarto was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 September 1945. Discovery, 2005‚Äì2006 In May 2005, a group of private deep- sea divers, led by British wreck diver Jamie MacLeod, discovered the wreck in of water in the Gulf of Thailand. The wreck is mostly intact and sitting upright on the ocean floor. During the dive, a large rupture was discovered on the port bow area, suggesting a depth charge as the catalyst to her sinking. Also observed during the dive was an open torpedo tube door, with an empty torpedo tube behind it, suggesting the possibility that Lagarto fired off a torpedo shortly before her sinking. In June 2006, Navy divers from surveyed and photographed the wreck for six days. More evidence was seen that this is Lagarto. Twin 5-inch gun mounts were seen on the forward and rear parts of the ship. \\"Manitowoc\\" was seen on the propellers providing a connection to the Manitowoc, Wisconsin shipyard. The pictures were sent back to naval archeologists for further review. After viewing the evidence provided by the Salvor divers, it was confirmed that this was indeed Lagarto. Awards Lagarto received one battle star for World War II service.

He is best known for his early and vocal role as one of the leading judges in the Salem witch trials. Hathorne was absent from the list of men appointed to the Court of Oyer & Terminer in June 1692. That court relied heavily on the spectral evidence, examinations, interrogations, and affidavits previously conducted by Hathorne, co-signed by Jonathan Corwin, and recorded by Rev. Samuel Parris and/or Ezekiel Cheever Jr. On September 22, 1692, the date of the final eight executions, Hathorne was present at a meeting (Sewall Diary) with Stoughton and Cotton Mather to discuss using court records in a new publication designed to promote the trials.Collections of the Mass. Hist. Soc. 1878 Unlike Samuel Sewall, Hathorne is not known to have repented for his actions. He was a patrilineal ancestor of writer Nathaniel Hawthorne. Life Hathorne's father, Major William Hathorne, was among the early settlers of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in the 1630s and held a number of military and political positions for several decades. John was born in Salem in August 1641; his father's surviving records give the date as August 4, but the records of the First Church of Salem indicate he was baptized on August 2. John married in Salem, March 22, 1674/5, Ruth Gardner, granddaughter of \\"Old Planter\\" Thomas Gardner, a settler of Salem who arrived as part of colonization efforts funded by the Dorchester Company in 1625. Hathorne expanded on the successes of his father in building a small empire based on land and merchant trade to England and the West Indies. In addition to lands in the Salem area he also had interests in the lands of what is now Maine. He assumed positions of authority in the town, and was appointed a justice of the peace of Essex County, and served as a member of the colony's council of assistants (a combination of legislative upper house and high court). In this role he was called on to mediate disputes in the county's towns, including Salem Village (present-day Danvers).Hurd, Duane Hamilton. History of Essex County, Massachusetts, p. xvii, vol. I, J. W. Lewis & Co., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 1888. Salem interrogations and trials When in early 1692 accusations of witchcraft began to circulate in Salem Village, Hathorne and magistrate Jonathan Corwin were called upon to question both accusers and accused to determine if there was cause for a trial; they were eventually joined in this task by officials from Boston, including Deputy Governor Thomas Danforth. Hathorne's questioning of a number of individuals was characterized at the time as somewhat harsh. Historical and fictional accounts of the trials often depict him as convinced that the accused were guilty. He is noted for his questioning of Rebecca Nurse and Bridget Bishop:Woodward, 1864, Records of Salem witchcraft, copied from the original documentshttps://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/008590808 :Bishop : I am no witch :Hathorne : Why if you have not wrote in the book, yet tell me how far you have gone? :Bishop : I have no familiarity with the devil. :Hathorne : How is it then, that your appearance doth hurt these? :Bishop : I am innocent. :Hathorne : Why you seem to act witchcraft before us by the motion of your body which seems to have influence upon the afflicted. :Bishop : I know nothing of it. I am innocent to a witch. I know not what a witch is. :Hathorne : How do you know then that you are not a witch? :Bishop : I do not know what you say. :Hathorne : How can you know, you are no witch, and yet not know what a witch is? :Bishop : I am clear... :--Records of Salem witchcraft, copied from the original documents by Woodward, William Eliot, 1864Records of Salem witchcraft, copied from the original documents by Woodward, William Eliot, d. 1892 Published 1864 When the Special Court of Oyer and Terminer was established in May 1692, Governor Sir William Phips did not appoint Hathorne to the panel, which was headed by Lieutenant Governor William Stoughton. This panel heard trials in which 19 were convicted and executed for witchcraft. The special court was replaced in 1693 by the Superior Court of Judicature, on which Hathorne was not immediately seated; it cleared most of the accused it tried of any wrongdoing, and the few convictions it handed down were vacated by Governor Phips. Later years Later in the 1690s Hathorne followed in his father's military footsteps and became more involved in the colonial military activities of King William's War, leading forces in the 1696 Siege of Fort Nashwaak (present-day Fredericton, New Brunswick). He continued to be active in the colonial militia, and was promoted to colonel in 1711. He was also finally appointed to the Superior Court by Governor Joseph Dudley, a seat he held until 1711. He died in Salem in 1717, and is interred in the Burying Point Cemetery along with a number of his descendants. John was the great- great-grandfather of Nathaniel Hawthorne (born \\"Hathorne\\"), author of many works, including The Scarlet Letter and The House of the Seven Gables. The latter work, set in Salem, contains allusions to the witch trials in its history of the house. Hawthorne was somewhat distressed and deeply ashamed at his ancestor's lack of remorse over the trials. Nathaniel may have adopted the \\"Hawthorne\\" spelling in an effort to dissociate himself from the judge. He did publish several works in 1830 under the Hathorne name, and his assumption of the modified spelling may have been an echo of the family's ancestral name from Bray, Berkshire, England. Historical documents from England contain a variety of spellings of the name, including Hauthorne, Hathorn, Hothorne and Hawthorne. In Arthur Miller's play The Crucible (and its film adaptations), Hathorne is portrayed as quite sadistic and, quite possibly, the most ignorant, antagonistic character besides Abigail Williams and her posse. Hathorne is the leading judge who continually denies witnesses any chance to redeem their names in court, as if he has already determined the outcome. He is cynical and rarely shows emotion, with the exception of the finale, where he is almost joyful that John Proctor is going to confess his crimes. Hathorne is the judge appointed by Satan at the trial in Stephen Vincent Benet's story \\"The Devil and Daniel Webster\\", where he is described as \\"a tall man, soberly clad in Puritan garb, with the burning gaze of the fanatic. In the 1941 film version he was portrayed by H.B. Warner. \\" In Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's play Giles Corey of the Salem Farms, Hathorne is shown debating Cotton Mather on the nature of witchcraft and presiding over hearings in which Giles Corey refuses to enter a plea. (In both the real trial and Longfellow's work, Corey was crushed to death for this refusal.) The horror film The Lords of Salem features a witchhunting reverend named John Hawthorne. \\"Judge Hawthorne\\" is referenced in the song Mary Towne Estey 1692, released by Primate Fiasco on the album MASSACHUSETTS WINTER. Singer and lyricist Dave Russo of Primate Fiasco is a 9th generation direct maternal descendant of Mary, who was sentenced to hanging by Judge Hawthorne.

It is migratory and winters mainly in central and eastern China. Vagrant birds are encountered in Japan and Korea (where it used to winter in numbers when it was more common), and more rarely in Kazakhstan, Laos, coastal Siberia, Taiwan, Thailand and Uzbekistan. While uncommon in the wild, this species has been domesticated. Introduced and feral populations of its domestic breeds occur in many places outside its natural range. The wild form is also kept in collections, and escapes are not unusual amongst feral flocks of other Anser and Branta geese. Description The close-up of head The swan goose is large and long-necked for its genus, wild birds being long (the longest Anser goose) and weighing or more (the second-heaviest Anser, after the greylag goose, A. anser). The sexes are similar, although the male is larger, with a proportionally longer bill and neck; in fact the largest females are barely as large as the smallest males. Typical measurements of the wing are in males, in females; the bill is about long in males and in females. The tarsus of males measures around . The wingspan of adult geese is . At Moscow Zoo The upperparts are greyish-brown, with thin light fringes to the larger feathers and a maroon hindneck and cap (reaching just below the eye). The remiges are blackish, as are the entire underwing and the white-tipped rectrices, while the upper- and undertail coverts are white. A thin white stripe surrounds the bill base. Apart from darker streaks on the belly and flanks, the underside is pale buff, being especially light on the lower head and foreneck which are sharply delimited against the maroon. In flight, the wings appear dark, with no conspicuous pattern. Uniquely among its genus, the long, heavy bill is completely black; the legs and feet, on the other hand, are orange as in most of its relatives. The eyes' irides are maroon. Juveniles are duller than adult birds, and lack the white bill base and dark streaks on the underside. The voice is a loud drawn-out and ascending honking aang. As a warning call, a similar but more barking honk is given two or three times in short succession. The karyotype of the swan goose is 2n=80, consisting of four pairs of macrochromosomes, 35 pairs of microchromosomes, and a pair of sex chromosomes. The two largest macrochromosome pairs as well as the Z (female) chromosome are submetacentric, while the third-largest chromosome pair is acrocentric and the fourth-largest is metacentric. The W chromosomes are acrocentric too, as are the larger microchromosomes, the smaller ones probably being telocentric. Compared to the greylag goose, there seems to have been some rearrangement on the fourth-largest chromosome pair. Ecology It inhabits steppe to taiga and mountain valleys near freshwater, grazing on plants such as sedges (Cyperaceae), and rarely swimming. It forms small flocks outside the breeding season. In the winter, it grazes on plains and stubble fields, sometimes far from water. Birds return from the winter quarters around April, and the breeding season starts soon thereafter. It breeds as single pairs or loose groups near marshes and other wetlands, with nesting activity starting about May. The clutch is usually 5‚Äì6 but sometimes up to 8 eggs, which are laid in a shallow nest made from plants, placed directly on the ground, often on a small knoll to keep it dry. The precocial young hatch after about 28 days and become sexually mature at 2‚Äì3 years of age. Around late August/early September, the birds leave for winter quarters, where they gather in small groups to moult their worn plumage. The swan goose was uplisted from Near Threatened to Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List in 1992 and further to Endangered in 2000, as its population is declining due to habitat loss and excessive hunting and (particularly on the Sanjiang Plain in China) egg collecting. But new research has shown it to be not as rare as it was believed, and consequently, it was downlisted to Vulnerable status again in 2008. Still, less than 500 pairs might remain in Russia, while in Mongolia numbers are unknown though about 1,000 were seen at √ñgii Lake in 1977. Favorite wintering locations in China are Lake Dongting, Lake Poyang, the Yancheng Coastal Wetlands and other locations around the lower Yangtze River, where some 60,000 individuals may be found each year ‚Äì though this may be almost the entire world population. Until the 1950s, the species wintered in small numbers (up to about 100 birds annually) in Japan, but habitat destruction has driven them away. Altogether, between 60,000 and 100,000 adult Swan Geese remain in the wild today. Domestication Though the majority of domestic geese are descended from the greylag goose (A. anser), two breeds are direct descendants of the swan goose: the Chinese goose and the African goose. These breeds have been domesticated since at least the mid-18th century ‚Äì perhaps even (in China) since around 1000 BC. They vary considerably from their wild parent in appearance, temperament, and ability to produce meat and eggs; the most conspicuous feature is the prominent bill knob PDF fulltextCarol Ekarius (2007).

He noted that the external differences between Chinese geese and breeds descended from the Greylag goose belied a rather close relationship: > \\"The hybrids from the common and Chinese geese (A. cygnoides), species which > are so different that they are generally ranked in distinct genera,The swan > goose had been separated in the monotypic genus Cygnopsis (alternatively > spelled Cycnopsis) by Johann Friedrich von Brandt in 1836, some 20 years > before Darwin wrote this.

Total population was estimated as 60‚Äì90,000 individuals in 2012.

Chinese geese differ from the wild birds in much larger size (up to 5‚Äì10 kg in males, 4‚Äì9 kg in females), and in having an often strongly developed basal knob on the upper side of the bill. The knob at the top of the beak is more prominent on males than females. It takes several months for the knob to become pronounced enough that it can be used for determining sex. Chinese geese are a close cousin of the African goose, a heavier breed also descended from the swan goose. Chinese geese appear in two varieties: a brown, similar to the wild swan goose, and white. While many domestic Chinese geese have a similar body type to other breeds, the breed standards as defined in the American Poultry Association's Standard of Perfection and other sources call for a slimmer, taller fowl.Ekarius (2007) Chinese geese are among the better laying breeds of goose. A female Chinese goose can lay 50‚Äì60 eggs over the course of the breeding season (February to June), although there are reports of Chinese geese laying up to 100 eggs during that time.Buckland & Guy (2002) FootnotesReferences * * Buckland, Roger & Guy, G√©rard (eds.)

Cisneros's early life provided many experiences she later drew on as a writer: she grew up as the only daughter in a family of six brothers, which often made her feel isolated, and the constant migration of her family between Mexico and the United States instilled in her the sense of \\"always straddling two countries ... but not belonging to either culture.\\" Cisneros's work deals with the formation of Chicana identity, exploring the challenges of being caught between Mexican and Anglo-American cultures, facing the misogynist attitudes present in both these cultures, and experiencing poverty. For her insightful social critique and powerful prose style, Cisneros has achieved recognition far beyond Chicano and Latino communities, to the extent that The House on Mango Street has been translated worldwide and is taught in U.S classrooms as a coming-of-age novel. Cisneros has held a variety of professional positions, working as a teacher, a counselor, a college recruiter, a poet-in-the-schools, and an arts administrator, and has maintained a strong commitment to community and literary causes. In 1998 she established the Macondo Writers Workshop, which provides socially conscious workshops for writers, and in 2000 she founded the Alfredo Cisneros Del Moral Foundation, which awards talented writers connected to Texas. Cisneros currently resides in Mexico.  Early life and education Cisneros was born in Chicago, Illinois on December 20, 1954, the third of seven children. The only surviving daughter, she considered herself the \\"odd number in a set of men\\". Cisneros's great-grandfather had played the piano for the Mexican president and was from a wealthy background, but he gambled away his family's fortune. Her paternal grandfather Enrique was a veteran of the Mexican Revolution, and he used what money he had saved to give her father, Alfredo Cisneros de Moral, the opportunity to go to college. However, after failing classes due to what Cisneros called his \\"lack of interest\\" in studying, Alfredo ran away to the United States to escape his father's anger. While roaming the southern United States with his brother, Alfredo visited Chicago where he met Elvira Cordero Anguiano. After getting married, the pair settled in one of Chicago's poorest neighborhoods. Cisneros's biographer Robin Ganz writes that she acknowledges her mother's family name came from a very humble background, tracing its roots back to Guanajuato, Mexico while her father's was much more \\"admirable\\". Taking work as an upholsterer to support his family, Cisneros's father began \\"a compulsive circular migration between Chicago and Mexico City that became the dominating pattern of Cisneros's childhood.\\" Their family was constantly moving between the two countries, which necessitated their finding new places to live as well as schools for the children. Eventually the instability caused Cisneros's six brothers to pair off in twos, leaving her to define herself as the isolated one. Her feelings of exclusion from the family were exacerbated by her father, who referred to his \\"seis hijos y una hija\\" (\\"six sons and one daughter\\") rather than his \\"siete hijos\\" (\\"seven children\\"). Ganz notes that Cisneros's childhood loneliness was instrumental in shaping her later passion for writing. Cisneros's one strong female influence was her mother, Elvira, who was a voracious reader and more enlightened and socially conscious than her father. According to Ganz, although Elvira was too dependent on her husband and too restricted in her opportunities to fulfill her own potential, she ensured her daughter would not suffer from the same disadvantages as she did. Her family made a down payment on their own home in Humboldt Park, a predominantly Puerto Rican neighborhood on Chicago's West Side when she was eleven years old. This neighborhood and its characters would later become the inspiration for Cisneros's novel The House on Mango Street. For high school, Cisneros attended Josephinum Academy, a small Catholic all-girls school. Here she found an ally in a high-school teacher who helped her to write poems about the Vietnam War. Although Cisneros had written her first poem around the age of ten, with her teacher's encouragement she became known for her writing throughout her high- school years. In high school she wrote poetry and was the literary magazine editor, but, according to herself, she did not really start writing until her first creative writing class in college in 1974. After that it took a while to find her own voice. She explains, \\"I rejected what was at hand and emulated the voices of the poets I admired in books: big male voices like James Wright and Richard Hugo and Theodore Roethke, all wrong for me.\\" Cisneros was awarded a bachelor of arts degree from Loyola University Chicago in 1976, and received a master of fine arts degree from the Iowa Writers' Workshop at the University of Iowa in 1978. While attending the Workshop, Cisneros discovered how the particular social position she occupied gave her writing a unique potential, recalling \\"It wasn't as if I didn't know who I was. I knew I was a Mexican woman. But I didn't think it had anything to do with why I felt so much imbalance in my life, whereas it had everything to do with it! My race, my gender, and my class! And it didn't make sense until that moment, sitting in that seminar. That's when I decided I would write about something my classmates couldn't write about.\\" She conformed to American literary canons and adopted a writing style that was purposely opposite that of her classmates, realizing that instead of being something to be ashamed of, her own cultural environment was a source of inspiration. From then on, she would write of her \\"neighbors, the people [she] saw, the poverty that the women had gone through.\\" thumb Cisneros says of this moment: > So to me it began there, and that's when I intentionally started writing > about all the things in my culture that were different from them‚Äîthe poems > that are these city voices‚Äîthe first part of Wicked Wicked ways‚Äîand the > stories in House on Mango Street. I think it's ironic that at the moment > when I was practically leaving an institution of learning, I began realizing > in which ways institutions had failed me. Drawing on Mexican and Southwestern popular culture and conversations in the city streets, Cisneros wrote to convey the lives of people she identified with. Literary critic Jacqueline Doyle has described Cisneros's passion for hearing the personal stories that people tell and her commitment to expressing the voices of marginalized people through her work, such as the \\"thousands of silent women\\" whose struggles are portrayed in The House on Mango Street. Five years after receiving her MFA, she returned to Loyola University-Chicago, where she had previously earned a BA in English, to work as an administrative assistant. Prior to this job, she worked in the Chicano barrio in Chicago, and teaching high school dropouts at Latino Youth High School.  Later life and career = Teaching  In addition to being an author and poet, Cisneros has held various academic and teaching positions. In 1978, after finishing her MFA degree, she taught former high-school dropouts at the Latino Youth High School in Chicago. The 1984 publication of The House on Mango Street secured her a succession of writer-in-residence posts at universities in the United States, teaching creative writing at institutions such as the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Michigan. She was subsequently a writer-in-residence at Our Lady of the Lake University in San Antonio, Texas. Cisneros has also worked as a college recruiter and an arts administrator.  Family  Cisneros currently resides in San Miguel de Allende, a city in central Mexico, but for years she lived and wrote in San Antonio, Texas, in her briefly controversialRimer, Sara (July 13, 1998). \\"San Antonio Journal; Novelist's Purple Palette Is Not to Everyone's Taste\\". The New York Times. \\"Mexican-pink\\" home with \\"many creatures little and large.\\" In 1990 when Pilar E. Rodr√≠guez Aranda asked Cisneros in an interview for the Americas Review why she has never married or started a family, Cisneros replied, \\"I've never seen a marriage that is as happy as my living alone. My writing is my child and I don't want anything to come between us.\\" She has elaborated elsewhere that she enjoys living alone because it gives her time to think and write. In the introduction to the third edition of Gloria E. Anzald√∫a's Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza, Cisneros wrote: \\"It's why I moved from Illinois to Texas. So that the relatives and family would allow me the liberty to disappear into myself. To reinvent myself if I had to. As Latinas, we have to ... Because writing is like putting your head underwater.\\"  Writing process  Cisneros's writing is often influenced by her personal experiences and by observations of many of the people in her community. She once confided to other writers at a conference in Santa Fe that she writes down \\"snippets of dialogue or monologue‚Äîrecords of conversations she hears wherever she goes.\\" These snippets are then mixed and matched to create her stories. Names for her characters often come from the San Antonio phone book; \\"she leafs through the listings for a last name, then repeats the process for a first name.\\" By mixing and matching she is assured that she is not appropriating anyone's real name or real story, but at the same time her versions of characters and stories are believable. Cisneros once found herself so immersed in the characters of her book Woman Hollering Creek that they began to infiltrate her subconscious mind. Once while she was writing the story \\"Eyes of Zapata,\\" she awoke \\"in the middle of the night, convinced for the moment that she was Ines, the young bride of the Mexican revolutionary. Her dream conversation with Zapata then became those characters' dialogue in her story.\\" Her biculturalism and bilingualism are also very important aspects of her writing. Cisneros was quoted by Robin Ganz as saying that she is grateful to have \\"twice as many words to pick from ... two ways of looking at the world,\\" and Ganz referred to her \\"wide range of experience\\" as a \\"double-edged sword.\\" Cisneros's ability to speak two languages and to write about her two cultures gives her a unique position from where she is able to tell not just her story, but also the stories of those around her.  Community legacy  Cisneros has been instrumental in building a strong community in San Antonio among other artists and writers through her work with the Macondo Foundation and the Alfredo Cisneros del Moral Foundation. The Macondo Foundation, which is named after the town in Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez's book One Hundred Years of Solitude, \\"works with dedicated and compassionate writers who view their work and talents as part of a larger task of community-building and non-violent social change.\\" Officially incorporated in 2006, the foundation began in 1998 as a small workshop that took place in Cisneros's kitchen. The Macondo Writers Workshop, which has since become an annual event, brings together writers \\"working on geographic, cultural, economic, social and spiritual borders\\" and has grown from 15 participants to over 120 participants in the first 9 years. Currently working out of Our Lady of the Lake University in San Antonio, the Macondo Foundation makes awards such as the Gloria E. Anzald√∫a Milagro Award honoring the memory of Anzald√∫a, a fellow Chicana writer who died in 2004, by providing Chicano writers with support when they are in need of some time to heal their \\"body, heart or spirit\\" and the Elvira Cordero Cisneros Award which was created in memory of Sandra Cisneros's mother. Macondo offers services to member writers such as health insurance and the opportunity to participate in the Casa Azul Residency Program. The Residency Program provides writers with a furnished room and office in the Casa Azul, a blue house across the street from where Cisneros lives in San Antonio, which is also the headquarters of the Macondo Foundation. In creating this program, Cisneros \\"imagined the Casa as a space where Macondistas could retreat from the distractions of everyday life and have a room of his/her own for the process of emotional, intellectual and spiritual introspection.\\" Cisneros founded the Alfredo Cisneros del Moral Foundation in 1999. Named in memory of her father, the foundation \\"has awarded over $75,500 to writers born in Texas, writing about Texas, or living in Texas since 2007\\". Its intention is to honor Cisneros's father's memory by showcasing writers who are as proud of their craft as Alfredo was of his craft as an upholsterer. Cisneros co-founded with Bryce Milligan the Annual Texas Small Bookfair, the forerunner to the Inter-American Bookfair.  Chicano literary movement  Literary critic Claudia Sadowski-Smith has called Cisneros \\"perhaps the most famous Chicana writer\\", and Cisneros has been acknowledged as a pioneer in her literary field as the first female Mexican- American writer to have her work published by a mainstream publisher. In 1989, The House on Mango Street, which was originally published by the small Hispanic publishing company Arte P√∫blico Press, was reissued in a second edition by Vintage Press; and in 1991 Woman Hollering Creek was published by Random House. As Ganz observes, previously only male Chicano authors had successfully made the crossover from smaller publishers. That Cisneros had garnered enough attention to be taken on by Vintage Press said a lot about the possibility for Chicano literature to become more widely recognized. Cisneros spoke of her success and what it meant for Chicana literature in an interview on National Public Radio on 19 September 1991: As a pioneer Chicana author, Cisneros filled a void by bringing to the fore a genre that had previously been at the margins of mainstream literature. With her first novel, The House on Mango Street, she moved away from the poetic style that was common in Chicana literature at the time and began to define a \\"distinctive Chicana literary space\\", challenging familiar literary forms and addressing subjects such as gender inequality and the marginalization of cultural minorities. According to literary critic Alvina E Quintana, The House on Mango Street is a book that has reached beyond the Chicano and Latino literary communities and is now read by people of all ethnicities. Quintana states that Cisneros's writing is accessible for both Anglo- and Mexican-Americans alike since it is free from anger or accusation, presenting the issues (such as Chicana identity and gender inequalities) in an approachable way. Cisneros's writing has been influential in shaping both Chicana and feminist literature. Quintana sees her fiction as a form of social commentary, contributing to a literary tradition that resembles the work of contemporary cultural anthropologists in its attempt to authentically represent the cultural experience of a group of people, and acknowledges Cisneros's contribution to Chicana feminist aesthetics by bringing women to the center as empowered protagonists in much of her work.  Writing style = Bilingualism  Cisneros often incorporates Spanish into her English writing, substituting Spanish words for English ones where she feels that Spanish better conveys the meaning or improves the rhythm of the passage. However, where possible she constructs sentences so that non-Spanish speakers can infer the meaning of Spanish words from their context. In Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories Cisneros writes: \\"La Gritona. Such a funny name for such a lovely arroyo. But that's what they called the creek that ran behind the house.\\" Even if the English- speaking reader does not initially know that arroyo means creek, Cisneros soon translates it in a way that does not interrupt the flow of the text. She enjoys manipulating the two languages, creating new expressions in English by literally translating Spanish phrases. In the same book Cisneros writes: \\"And at the next full moon, I gave light, T√≠a Chucha holding up our handsome, strong-lunged boy.\\" Previous sentences inform the reader that a baby is being born, but only a Spanish speaker will notice that \\"I gave light\\" is a literal translation of the Spanish \\"d√≠ a luz\\" which means \\"I gave birth.\\" Cisneros joins other Hispanic-American US writers such as Gloria Anzald√∫a, Piri Thomas, Giannina Braschi, Gustavo P√©rez Firmat, and Junot D√≠az, who create playful linguistic hybrids of Spanish and English. Cisneros noted on this process: \\"All of a sudden something happens to the English, something really new is happening, a new spice is added to the English language.\\" Spanish always has a role in Cisneros's work, even when she writes in English. As she discovered, after writing The House on Mango Street primarily in English, \\"the syntax, the sensibility, the diminutives, the way of looking at inanimate objects\\" were all characteristic of Spanish. For Cisneros, Spanish brings to her work not only colorful expressions, but also a distinctive rhythm and attitude.  Narrative modes, diction, and apparent simplicity  Cisneros's fiction comes in various forms‚Äîas novels, poems, and short stories‚Äîby which she challenges both social conventions, with her \\"celebratory breaking of sexual taboos and trespassing across the restrictions that limit the lives and experiences of Chicanas\\", and literary ones, with her \\"bold experimentation with literary voice and her development of a hybrid form that weaves poetry into prose\\". Published in 1991, Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories is a collection of twenty-two short stories that form a collage of narrative techniques, each serving to engage and affect the reader in a different way. Cisneros alternates between first person, third person, and stream-of-consciousness narrative modes, and ranges from brief impressionistic vignettes to longer event-driven stories, and from highly poetic language to brutally frank realist language. Some stories lack a narrator to mediate between the characters and the reader; they are instead composed of textual fragments or conversations \\"overheard\\" by the reader. For example, \\"Little Miracles, Kept Promises\\" is composed of fictional notes asking for the blessings of patron saints, and \\"The Marlboro Man\\" transcribes a gossiping telephone conversation between two female characters. Works by Cisneros can appear simple at first reading, but this is deceptive. She invites the reader to move beyond the text by recognizing larger social processes within the microcosm of everyday life: the phone conversation in \\"The Marlboro Man\\" is not merely idle gossip, but a text that allows the reader to dig into the characters' psyches and analyze their cultural influences. Literary critics have noted how Cisneros tackles complex theoretical and social issues through the vehicle of apparently simple characters and situations. For example, Ram√≥n Sald√≠var observes that The House on Mango Street \\"represents from the simplicity of childhood vision the enormously complex process of the construction of the gendered subject\\". In the same vein, Felicia J. Cruz describes how each individual will interact differently with Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories, thus eliciting such varied reader responses as \\"it is about growing up\\", to \\"it's about a Chicana's growing up\\", to \\"it is a critique of patriarchal structures and exclusionary practices\\". Cisneros's writing is rich not only for its symbolism and imagery, deemed by critic Deborah L Madsen to be \\"both technically and aesthetically accomplished\\", but also for its social commentary and power to \\"evoke highly personal responses\\". this helped her achieve the way she taught.  Literary themes = Place  When Cisneros describes the aspirations and struggles of Chicanas, the theme of place often emerges. Place refers not only to her novels' geographic locations, but also to the positions her characters hold within their social context. Chicanas frequently occupy Anglo- dominated and male-dominated places where they are subject to a variety of oppressive and prejudicial behaviors; one of these places that is of particular interest to Cisneros is the home. As literary critics Deborah L. Madsen and Ram√≥n Sald√≠var have described, the home can be an oppressive place for Chicanas where they are subjugated to the will of male heads-of-household, or in the case of their own home, it can be an empowering place where they can act autonomously and express themselves creatively. In The House on Mango Street the young protagonist, Esperanza, longs to have her own house: \\"Not a flat. Not an apartment in back. Not a man's house. Not a daddy's. A house all my own. With my porch and my pillow, my pretty purple petunias. My books and my stories. My two shoes waiting beside the bed. Nobody to shake a stick at. Nobody's garbage to pick up after.\\" An aspiring writer, Esperanza yearns for \\"a space for myself to go, clean as paper before the poem.\\" She feels discontented and trapped in her family home, and witnesses other women in the same position. According to Sald√≠var, Cisneros communicates through this character that a woman needs her own place in order to realize her full potential‚Äîa home which is not a site of patriarchal violence, but instead \\"a site of poetic self-creation.\\" One source of conflict and grief for Cisneros's Chicana characters is that the male-dominated society in which they live denies them this place. Critics such as Jacqueline Doyle and Felicia J. Cruz have compared this theme in Cisneros's work to one of the key concepts in Virginia Woolf's famous essay \\"A Room of One's Own\\", that \\"a woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction,\\" or put another way, \\"economic security\\" and personal liberty are necessary for \\"artistic production.\\" Cisneros explores the issue of place in relation not only to gender but also to class. As Sald√≠var has noted, \\"Aside from the personal requirement of a gendered woman's space, Esperanza recognizes the collective requirements of the working poor and the homeless as well.\\" He refers to Esperanza's determination not to forget her working-class roots once she obtains her dream house, and to open her doors to those who are less fortunate. Esperanza says \\"Passing bums will ask, Can I come in? I'll offer them the attic, ask them to stay, because I know how it is to be without a house.\\" According to Sald√≠var, this statement of Esperanza's alludes to \\"the necessity for a decent living space\\" that is fundamental to all people, despite the different oppressions they face.  Construction of femininity and female sexuality  As Madsen has described, Cisneros's \\"effort to negotiate a cross-cultural identity is complicated by the need to challenge the deeply rooted patriarchal values of both Mexican and American cultures.\\" The lives of all Cisneros's female characters are affected by how femininity and female sexuality are defined within this patriarchal value system and they must struggle to rework these definitions. As Cisneros has said: \\"There's always this balancing act, we've got to define what we think is fine for ourselves instead of what our culture says.\\" Cisneros shows how Chicanas, like women of many other ethnicities, internalize these norms starting at a young age, through informal education by family members and popular culture. In The House on Mango Street, for example, a group of girl characters speculate about what function a woman's hips have: \\"They're good for holding a baby when you're cooking, Rachel says ... You need them to dance, says Lucy ... You gotta know how to walk with hips, practice you know.\\" Traditional female roles, such as childrearing, cooking, and attracting male attention, are understood by Cisneros's characters to be their biological destiny. However, when they reach adolescence and womanhood, they must reconcile their expectations about love and sex with their own experiences of disillusionment, confusion and anguish. Esperanza describes her \\"sexual initiation\\"‚Äîan assault by a group of Anglo-American boys while awaiting her friend Sally at the fairground. She feels stricken and powerless after this, but above all betrayed; not only by Sally, who was not there for her, but \\"by all the women who ever failed to contradict the romantic mythology of love and sex\\". Cisneros illustrates how this romantic mythology, fueled by popular culture, is often at odds with reality in Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories, where multiple references to romantic telenovelas obsessively watched by the female characters are juxtaposed with the abuse and poverty they face in their own lives. When Cisneros addresses the subject of female sexuality, she often portrays negative scenarios in which men exert control over women through control over their sexuality, and explores the gap she perceives between the real sexual experiences of women and their idealized representation in popular culture. However, Cisneros also describes female sexuality in extremely positive terms, especially in her poetry. This is true, for example, of her 1987 volume of poetry My Wicked, Wicked Ways. According to Madsen, Cisneros refers to herself as \\"wicked\\" for having \\"reappropriated, taken control of, her own sexuality and the articulation of it ‚Äì a power forbidden to women under patriarchy\\". Through these poems she aims to represent \\"the reality of female sexuality\\" so that women readers will recognize the \\"divisive effects\\" of the stereotypes that they are expected to conform to, and \\"discover the potential for joy in their bodies that is denied them\\". Cisneros breaks the boundary between what is a socially acceptable way for women to act and speak and what is not, using language and imagery that have a \\"boisterous humor\\" and \\"extrovert energy\\" and are even at times \\"deliberately shocking\\". Not all readers appreciate this \\"shocking\\" quality of some of Cisneros's work. Both female and male readers have criticized Cisneros for the ways she celebrates her sexuality, such as the suggestive photograph of herself on the My Wicked, Wicked Ways cover (3rd Woman Press, 1987). Cisneros says of this photo: \\"The cover is of a woman appropriating her own sexuality. In some ways, that's also why it's wicked: the scene is trespassing that boundary by saying 'I defy you. I'm going to tell my own story.'\\" Some readers \\"failed to perceive the transgressive meaning of the gesture\\", thinking that she was merely being lewd for shock value, and questioned her legitimacy as a feminist. Cisneros's initial response to this was dismay, but then she reports thinking \\"Wait a second, where's your sense of humor? And why can't a feminist be sexy?\\"  Construction of Chicana identity  The challenges faced by Cisneros's characters on account of their gender cannot be understood in isolation from their culture, for the norms that dictate how women and men ought to think and behave are culturally determined and thus distinct for different cultural groups. Through her works, Cisneros conveys the experiences of Chicanas confronting the \\"deeply rooted patriarchal values\\" of Mexican culture through interactions not only with Mexican fathers, but the broader community which exerts pressure upon them to conform to a narrow definition of womanhood and a subservient position to men. A recurrent theme in Cisneros's work is the triad of figures that writer and theorist Gloria Anzald√∫a has referred to as \\"Our Mothers\\": the Virgen de Guadalupe, La Malinche and La Llorona. These symbolic figures are of great importance to identity politics and popular culture in Mexico and the southwest United States, and have been used, argues theorist Norma Alarc√≥n, as reference points \\"for controlling, interpreting, or visualizing women\\" in Mexican-American culture. Many theorists, including Jacqueline Doyle, Jean Wyatt, Emma Perez and Cordelia Candelaria, have argued that the gender identity of Mexican and Chicana women is complexly constructed in reference to these three figures., , , , and . La Virgen de Guadalupe, a Catholic icon of the manifestation of the Virgin Mary in the Americas, is revered in Mexico as a \\"nurturing and inspiring mother and maiden\\". La Malinche, the indigenous mistress and intermediary of conquistador Hern√°n Cort√©s, has according to Wyatt \\"become the representative of a female sexuality at once passive, \\"rapeable,\\" and always already guilty of betrayal\\". Cisneros describes the problematic dichotomy of the virgin and the whore presented by these two figures: \\"We're raised in a Mexican culture that has two role models: La Malinche and la Virgen de Guadalupe. And you know that's a hard route to go, one or the other, there's no in-betweens.\\" Madsen has noted that these 'good' and 'bad' archetypes are further complicated by the perception, held by many Chicana feminists, that they would be guilty of betraying their people, like La Malinche, if they attempt to define their femininity in more \\"Anglo\\" terms. Through her work, Cisneros critiques the pressures Chicanas face to suppress their sexuality or channel it into socially acceptable forms so as to not be labeled \\"Malinchista[s] ... corrupted by gringa influences which threaten to splinter [their] people\\". The third figure, La Llorona, who derives from a centuries-old Mexican/Southwestern folktale, is \\"a proud young girl [who] marries above her station and is so enraged when her husband takes a mistress of his own class that she drowns their children in the river\\". She dies grief-stricken by the edge of the river after she is unable to retrieve her children and it is claimed that she can be heard wailing for them in the sound of the wind and water. These entities, from the gentle and pure Virgen de Guadalupe, to the violated and treacherous la Malinche, to the eternally grieving la Llorona give rise to a \\"fragmentary subjectivity\\" often experienced by Chicanas, and their need to come to terms with them, renegotiate them on their own terms, or reject them altogether. The three \\"Mothers\\" come out most clearly in Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories. In the stories \\"Never Marry a Mexican\\" and \\"Woman Hollering Creek\\", the female protagonists grapple with these \\"Mexican icons of sexuality and motherhood that, internalized, seem to impose on them a limited and even negative definition of their own identities as women\\". The protagonist in \\"Never Marry a Mexican\\" is haunted by the myth of la Malinche, who is considered a whore and a traitor, and defies la Malinche's passive sexuality with her own aggressive one. In \\"Woman Hollering Creek\\" the protagonist reinvents the la Llorona myth when she decides to take charge of her own future, and that of her children, and discovers that the grito of the myth, which is the Spanish word for the sound made by la Llorona, can be interpreted as a \\"joyous holler\\" rather than a grieving wail. It is the borderland, that symbolic middle ground between two cultures, which \\"offers a space where such a negotiation with fixed gender ideals is at least possible\\".  Borderland  Even though that Cisneros does not explicitly locate her stories and novels on the Mexico-U.S. border, Sadowski-Smith identifies the concept as perhaps Cisneros's most salient theme due to the constant border crossings, both real and metaphorical, of characters in all of her works. The House on Mango Street takes place in Chicago where the narrator lives, and in Mexico City where she visits extended family. Caramelo primarily takes place in those settings as well, but part of the book details the narrator's experiences as a teenager in San Antonio, TX. Various characters in Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories also make trips to Mexico to reunite with family members. However, to quote literary critics Jes√∫s Benito and Ana Mar√≠a Manzanas, the \\"image of the border has become fully meaningful not only when we consider it as a physical line but when we decenter it and liberate it from the notion of space to encompass notions of sex, class, gender, ethnicity, identity, and community.\\" Cisneros frequently divorces the border from its strictly geographic meaning, using it metaphorically to explore how Chicana identity is an amalgamation of both Mexican and Anglo-American cultures. The border represents the everyday experiences of people who are neither fully from one place nor the other; at times the border is fluid and two cultures can coexist harmoniously within a single person, but at other times it is rigid and there is an acute tension between them. Literary critic Katherine Payant has analyzed the border metaphor in Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories, which manifests in references to the Chicana/o characters' Mexican roots and the (im)migration between the two countries, the recurrence of overlapping pre-Columbian, mestizo and Southwestern Chicano myths, and the portrayal of Chicanas/os as \\"straddling two or three cultures.\\" Payant makes use of Gloria Anzald√∫a's concept of living \\"on the borderlands\\" to describe the experience of Cisneros's Chicana characters who, in addition to their struggle to overcome patriarchal constructs of their gender and sexual identity, must negotiate linguistic and cultural boundaries.  Awards  At a ceremony in September 2016 was awarded a 2015 National Medal of Arts. In 2019, PEN America awarded her the PEN/Nabokov Award for Achievement in International Literature. Sandra Cisneros received fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1981 and 1988, and in 1985 was presented with the American Book Award by the Before Columbus Foundation for The House on Mango Street. Subsequently, she received a Frank Dobie Artists Fellowship, and came first and second in the Segundo Concurso Nacional del Cuento Chicano, sponsored by the University of Arizona. She has further received the Quality Paperback Book Club New Voices Award, the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award, the PEN Center West Award for best fiction, and the Lannan Foundation Literary Award for Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories. This book was selected as the noteworthy book of the year by both The New York Times and The American Library Journal, and an anthology of erotic poetry, Loose Woman, won the Mountain & Plains Booksellers' Award. Cisneros was recognized by the State University of New York, receiving an honorary doctorate from Purchase in 1993 and a MacArthur fellowship in 1995. In 2003, Caramelo was highly regarded by several journals including The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, the San Francisco Chronicle, the Chicago Tribune, and The Seattle Times, which led to her Premio Napoli Award in 2005; the novel also was shortlisted for the Dublin International IMPAC award, and was nominated for the Orange Prize in England. In 2003, Cisneros became part of the second group of recipients of the newly formed Texas Cultural Trust's Texas Medal of Arts.Associated Press. \\"Talented Texans to be honored,\\" Houston Chronicle, February 7, 2003, page 2.\\"Thanks for telling the story of Texas through the arts\\" (editorial), Austin American- Statesman, February 9, 2003.\\"Legislature honors 13 artists, patrons,\\" San Antonio Express-News, March 26, 2003, page 2B. In 2016, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill awarded Cisneros an honorary Doctor of Letters. The Archives and Special Collections at Amherst College holds some of her papers.
