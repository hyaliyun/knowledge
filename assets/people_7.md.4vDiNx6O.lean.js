Poindexter Jr. (April 3, 1925 ‚Äì March 30, 2010) was an American newspaper, radio and television journalist whose career spanned more than 50 years. Poindexter reported for KYW-TV (Channel 3), based in Philadelphia, from 1967 until his retirement in February 2001. He won three Emmy Awards for his reports during his career. He also wrote for the Philadelphia Tribune, The Philadelphia Bulletin, the London Daily Express, Jet and Ebony magazine, and was an early member of the Philadelphia Association of Black Journalists.Michael Klein, \\"Malcolm Poindexter passes away\\", Philly.com, March 30, 2010.\\"Malcolm Poindexter\\", Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia. Life and career Poindexter was born and raised in the Eastwick neighborhood of Southwest Philadelphia. His father was a pianist, vocal coach and baritone. He graduated from Overbrook High School and attended Temple University. He began his career in journalism in 1947 as a writer and general assignment reporter for the Philadelphia Tribune and the Associated Negro Press. Poindexter spent 15 years with the Philadelphia Tribune as a writer, photojournalist, columnist, sportswriter, sports editor, city editor, business manager, assistant comptroller and comptroller. During the 1948 Democratic and Republican National Conventions, both of which were held in Philadelphia, Poindexter had to interview politicians and attendees from the hallways because black journalists were not allowed on the convention floors. Poindexter joined the staff of the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin in 1960 and contributed feature articles to the newspaper's Sunday magazine. KYW Newsradio, which began broadcasting in 1965, hired Poindexter as one of its first reporters. He created a five-part series on the lives of migrant workers in South Jersey, in which he became a migrant worker himself. His migrant worker series won KYW Newsradio the radio station's first two professional awards ‚Äì the Sigma Delta Chi Award for Community Service and an Associated Press award. Poindexter joined KYW-TV in 1967. He worked as a general assignment reporter, education reporter and television host at KYW. He received more than 300 awards during his career, including four Emmys. Poindexter was inducted into the Philadelphia Broadcast Pioneers Hall of Fame in 1996. Poindexter and his family moved from his former home on Washington Square, an affluent section of Center City, to a larger house facing Norris Square in North Philadelphia in 1975. He rehabilitated their new home and turned his attention to the surrounding neighborhood, which suffered from high crime and poverty. He later spoke to a Philadelphia Daily News reporter of his move, \\"I'd been reporting on misery and suffering for 25 years. I felt there was more I could do than just report after the fact. Why not roll up my sleeves and see what I could do?\\" People Magazine ran an article on Poindexter called \\"A Philadelphia Anchorman Fights to Change His Mean Streets\\" on his efforts in its June 30, 1980 issue. Poindexter retired from KYW-TV, often known as CBS 3, in February 2001, and was named \\"Ambassador to the Arts\\" for the CBS television station.\\"Veteran Reporter Malcolm Poindexter Named \`Ambassador to the Arts' for KYW-3\\", 2001 PR Newswire Association.

Malcolm Poindexter died of complications from Alzheimer's disease at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania on March 30, 2010, at the age of 84, just four days before his 85th birthday. A resident of Center City at the time, Poindexter was survived by his wife, Ilse, a former librarian with the Free Library of Philadelphia; sons, David and Malcolm III; daughter, Lynne and a stepdaughter, Kirsten.

History=As a prison Museo Sugbo is housed in what was once called C√°rcel de Ceb√∫, the provincial jail of Cebu. Designed in 1869 by Domingo de Escondrillas, the lone architect in Cebu at the time, the C√°rcel de Ceb√∫ was originally proposed as the C√°rcel del Distrito, the main prison for the Visayas District. This accounts for its relatively large size at the time it was built. After a flurry of endorsements and independent review in Manila, the project was approved and construction commenced around 1871. It is believed that most of the coral stone blocks from the Parian church ‚Äì which was demolished in 1878 after the Bishop of Cebu won a long- drawn court case against its parishioners in the 1850s ‚Äì were used to build parts of the c√°rcel. After twenty years of use, a renovation was ordered in 1892, which added more buildings behind the main structure that now serves as the first six galleries of the museum. Records are not clear as to when the second storey of the main building was added, but the architectural design suggests this to be during the American colonial period. The gaol housed not only criminals in its 140+ year history. During the revolution, many of the Katipuneros were incarcerated here without trial and many of them were eventually executed in nearby Carreta cemetery. During the early years of the American period, the gaol served as a stable for horses competing at the hip√≥dromo (racetrack) nearby, but it was eventually used once again as a prison, both for the city and the province. During the Japanese occupation, guerrillas were imprisoned here after enduring torture under the hands of the Kempeitai, the Japanese secret police. After the war, many of the collaborators in Cebu were also imprisoned here. From the 1950s to 1976, the front section of the gaol served as the city jail, while the three structures behind were used as the provincial jail. The c√°rcel changed names twice, first during the American through the post-War periods when it was called the Cebu Provincial Jail. In the 1980s, the name was changed to Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center (CPDRC). C√°rcel de Ceb√∫ as Museo Sugbo Following the transfer of CPDRC to a more spacious and modern prison complex in December 2004 the gaol was converted into Museo Sugbo, the repository of Cebuano heritage, a feat that was realised when the first four galleries of the museum were inaugurated on August 5, 2008. On August 13, 2009, Gov. Gwendolyn Garcia and Dr. Ambeth Ocampo, chair of the National Historical Institute, led dignitaries in unveiling a National Historical Marker at Museo Sugbo. They also inaugurated the Visayas Branch of the Museum of Philippine Political History. Directly opposite this branch museum, the governor and National Museum director Corazon Alvina also inaugurated the National Museum Cebu Branch Galleries. Both museum branches occupy separate buildings within the Museo Sugbo complex. Two special exhibitions were also inaugurated during this event: Sen. Vicente Rama Memorabilia and the Gregorio and Jovito Abellana Memorabilia, in two separate galleries. Also inaugurated during this event was the Well of Good Fortune and Happiness on a Spanish-era well that was unearthed when the rear portion of the Museo Sugbo complex was being refurbished in 2009. At the same time four more galleries were added to the Museo, bringing the total to 10. Two more galleries are currently being developed with inauguration 2010: a Provincial Art Gallery and the Cebu Media Gallery. A reproduction of prison life is also being planned within one of the bartolinas (isolation cells) in the former prison complex, another of which is being developed into a gift shop.

Taxonomy  This genus was treated within family Buccinidae. It was moved to family Nassariidae in 2016.Galindo, L. A., Puillandre, N., Utge, J., Lozouet, P., & Bouchet, P. (2016). \\"The phylogeny and systematics of the Nassariidae revisited (Gastropoda, Buccinoidea)\\". Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 99: 337-353. Type species The issue regarding type species of the genus Nassaria Link, 1807 is confusing. Cernohorsky (1981) and Fraussen (2006) assume ‚ÄúNassaria lyrata Link, 1807‚Äù. Considering other instances in Link (1807), this latter name is expected to represent a new combination for Buccinum lyratum Gmelin, 1791, not as a separately available new taxon. Link‚Äôs (1807) original reference reads ‚ÄúN. lyrata. L. G. p. 3494. M.C. 4, t. 122, f. 1122, 1123‚Äú [‚ÄùL.G.‚Äù stands for Linnaeus, Gmelin edition and M.C. For Martini & Chemnitz‚Äôs ‚ÄúConchylien Cabinet‚Äù]. Nevertheless, as pointed out by M√∂rch (1862), MacNeil (1961), and others, the two cited references are inconsistent. Gmelin‚Äôs Buccinum lyratum is introduced on pp. 3494‚Äì3495, and currently considered as a synonym of Boreotrophon clathratus (Linnaeus, 1767) whereas the reference to Martini & Chemnitz (1780), vol. 4, t. 122, f. 1122, 1123 matches Buccinum album Gmelin, 1791, described on page 3495 with reference to the same figures. The vernacular name ‚ÄúFischreuseschnecken‚Äù (a German translation of Nassa snails) used by Link matches ‚ÄúFischreuse‚Äù used by Martini & Chemnitz for f. 1122, 1123, indicating that the latter was the species really intended. This is the rationale for the current interpretation, where Nassaria lyrata Link, 1807 is considered an available name based on Martini & Chemnitz f. 1122, 1123 and objective junior synonym of Buccinum album Gmelin, 1791.

History Founded in September 1992, AMAI is an independent organization of different Mexican companies doing market research, opinion and communication, whose purpose is to establish the quality standards as well as common standards in methods, techniques, terminology, analysis criteria, etc. that are related to market research inside Mexico.AMAI \\"Asociaci√≥n Mexicana de Agencias de Investigaci√≥n de Mercado y Opini√≥n P√∫blica (AMAI)\\" retrieved January 2010 It is a professional entity that brings together all the key Mexican industry players of research, who generate about three-quarters of the Mexican market. Since its inception, AMAI established its own Code of Ethics and standardize the criteria for socio-economic levels in Mexico, which has led to greater transparency in the investigation and the possibility of comparing the results produced by different agencies. The first index of socio-economic levels occurred in 1994, becoming the standard criteria of classification used in the country. The current index is known as the \\"Rule 13x6\\" which classifies into 6 levels the households in Mexico. In 1999 was a protocol called ESIMM (Standard of Service for the Market Research in Mexico) which set the substantive requirements of quality to be observed in any undertaking of research that is operating in Mexico. While originally adopted on a voluntary basis is now, a mandatory requirement to gain access to the Association. In 2006 an agreement with ESOMAR (European Society for Opinion and Marketing Research) was made to offer online courses offered by the University of Georgia to 3 countries, in that same year, another webpage was launched as a medium hub of electoral survey results; by the end of 2009 the concept was expanded to include references on social surveys and general interest.

One of the main roles of AMAI is to ensure that all marketing companies in Mexico receive the certification as well as the ISO. For over 15 years this association, AMAI, publishes a quarterly magazine and teaches a course at ITAM University of Marketing Research. From 1992 AMAI has had several presidents who held office for a period of two years, these are chosen by an assembly.

Creagh is best known for, firstly, delivering antisemitic speeches in 1904 that incited riots against the small Jewish community in Limerick, as well as, secondly, his work as a Catholic missionary in the Kimberley region of Western Australia between 1916 and 1922. Limerick boycott Creagh played a significant role in launching the ‚ÄúLimerick boycott‚Äù of 1904‚Äì06, in which many non-Jews economically boycotted, on an antisemitic basis, the small Jewish community in Limerick. The boycott was accompanied by a number of antisemitic assaults and intimidation, and caused some Jews to leave the city. The boycott and associated events are sometimes referred to as the \\"Limerick pogrom\\" (a name derived, in part, from the Eastern European origins of many Jews in Limerick). There had been a community of Irish Jews in Limerick City as early as 1790. A small number of Lithuanian Jews, fleeing persecution in their homeland, began arriving in Limerick in 1878. They formed an accepted part of the city's retail trade,Keogh (1998), p. 31 and established a synagogue and a cemetery. From 1884, there was occasional and sometimes violent, antisemitic activity.Keogh (1998), p. 19 On Monday, 11 January 1904, Creagh, already a priest, gave a speech in a meeting at the Redemptorist Church at Mount Saint Alphonsus, attacking Jews in general.Keogh (1998), pps. 26‚Äì30 He repeated many historical myths about Jews, including that of ritual murder, and said that the Jews had come to Limerick \\"to fasten themselves on us like leeches and to draw our blood\\".Paul Bew, Ireland: The Politics of enmity 1789‚Äì2006, Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 364 Immediately after Creagh made his call for a boycott, according to historian Dermot Keogh, people left the church, passing ‚ÄúColooney Street where most ... Jews lived... many [members of the crowd] were fired up by Creagh's [speech]... The Jewish community ... [who may have] sensed the menacing mood of the crowd ... remained ... in their homes as [the crowd] ... passed... Jewish shops, however, remained open and their owners felt menaced. One old Fenian ... single-handedly defended a shop ... until ... police arrived to mount a guard.‚ÄùKeogh (1998), pp. 39 While 300 people reportedly attacked \\"Jewish\\" businesses, few arrests were made. A 15 year old youth was arrested and later imprisoned for a month, for throwing a stone at the local rebbe that hit him on the ankle. Once released, Raleigh was welcomed by a demonstration protesting that he was innocent and that his sentence had been too harsh.Keogh (1998), pps. 113 The boycott was condemned by figures from across the political spectrum in Ireland and Creagh was criticised publicly by his Catholic superiors, who said that \\"religious persecution had no place in Ireland\\".Fisk, (1985), p. 430‚Äì431 An anonymous letter to the Redemptorists labelled Creagh a \\"disgrace to the Catholic religion\\". The Arch Confraternity did not regret the turn of events. At one of its meetings it passed a resolution : \\"We tender to Fr Creagh our very best wishes on his recent lectures on the ways and means of Jewish trading and at this meeting representing 6,000 members of the Confraternity we express our full confidence in his views‚Äô. According to a police report, five Jewish families, numbering 32 people, left Limerick due to the boycott and other, concurrent antisemitic activity, while another 26 families remained.Shalom Ireland: a Social History of Jews in Modern Ireland by Ray Rivlin, , published by Gill & MacMillanKeogh (1998), pps. 123‚Äì125 The boycott appeared to accelerate a general decline in the numbers of Jews in Limerick. While the 1911 census suggested nine Jewish families new to the area had joined 13 families that had remained in Limerick,Fr. Creagh C.S.S.R. Social Reformer 1870‚Äì1947 by Des Ryan, Old Limerick Journal Vol. 41, Winter 2005 the Jewish population numbered only 122 people. By 1926, this number had declined dramatically, to just 30 people. Many descendants of Jewish families and individuals that left Limerick due to the boycott later became prominent in other parts of Ireland or overseas.  Missionary  Creagh was moved briefly by his superiors to Belfast, and transferred as a missionary to the Philippines. There Creagh had a nervous breakdown in 1906. A year later he was posted to Wellington, New Zealand. By 1914, Creagh had been transferred to Australia. He was appointed, soon afterwards, as rector of the Redemptorist monastery in North Perth. In 1915, A. O. Neville, Chief Protector of Aborigines in Western Australia, argued that the Catholic mission at Lombadina, in the Kimberley should be closed, because the property of belonged to a Filipino from Manila, Thomas Puertollano, who was married to an Aboriginal woman and was technically employing the Aborigines. This was a breach of regulations as ‚ÄòAsiatics are not allowed to employ Aborigines‚Äô. Following the outbreak of World War I, German Pallotine missionaries at Broome, in the Kimberley were interned. In May 1916, Creagh was appointed vicar apostolic at Broome to replace the Pallotines. When Creagh was appointed to the Kimberley region, his brief included safeguarding the mission from threats from the Department of Aborigines and Fisheries and Immigration. Creagh‚Äôs brother and a partner bought the land for ¬£1100 and the lease was transferred from Puertollano to Creagh‚Äôs brother. Creagh thought highly of Puertollano, writing that he was \\"a man to whom I am under the greatest obligations. He was the former owner of Lombadina and for years he kept the Mission there going\\". Creagh officially opened and blessed the Church of Christ the King in Beagle Bay, south of Lombadina, on the feast of the Assumption in August 1918. He was also involved in supporting the work of the St John of God Sisters in the Broome area. He obtained regular salaries for the Sisters at the Japanese Hospital and had the Sisters put on the staff of the District Hospital where they undertook night duty. Creagh also built a beach house for the Sisters at Broome, located a few miles from town where there was a good water supply. A vegetable garden was planted and goats and poultry were kept, tended by a family from Lombadina. This small farm enterprise helped to supply the convent with fresh produce. In the early 1920s, before leaving Broome, Creagh authorised the Sisters to launch an appeal to purchase more land and build a new convent. He was parish priest at Bunbury (19235), Pennant Hills (192630) and Waratah where he suffered a stroke. After recovering from the stroke, he spent the rest of his life conducting retreats and preaching. He died at a monastery in Wellington. FootnotesReferences * Fisk, Robert.

It is located by Tilikum Place and is open since 1929. It is considered the oldest drinking establishment in the neighborhood and has received accolades from local media for being one of the best dive bars in the city. History The building was originally constructed by the Webb Investment Company in 1922 for use as a dairy warehouse. It was built in what was known as the Denny Regrade, named after a project to flatten Denny Hill. C. Preston Smith opened the cafe during an economic downturn in 1929. Coffee, two eggs, a ham steak, hashbrowns, and four pieces of buttered toast with jelly cost 40 cents. Smaller dishes were 25 cents or less. A barroom was opened adjacent to the cafe upon the repeal of prohibition in 1933 to sell beer and wine. It became a lounge when state law allowed for the sale of hard liquor in 1944. Smith's son, Dick, took over in 1975. Along with political activities in the neighborhood, the younger Smith was known for installing a periscope over the men's room urinal to provide views of the Space Needle. The 5 Point Cafe made headlines in August 2004 when radio personality Tom Leykis was ejected and then assaulted outside. Leykis said his assailant kicked him in the head and knocked him to the ground. He was cut above the eye and needed 17 stitches. In September 2009, it was rumored that The 5 Point would be closing. In November 2009, it was purchased by David Meinert. He has changed little but the menu was expanded slightly with vegetarian options. The 5 Point again made headlines when it became Seattle's first establishment to publicly ban Google Glass during the product's initial developmental release. The bar again received attention in October 2014 when rock star Tom Morello was denied entry late on a busy evening. Morello used Twitter to criticize the poor customer service of the doorman and the owner's stance on worker's rights. Meinert had previously been strongly opposed to a Seattle ordinance mandating a $15 minimum wage but responded to the accusation by citing the cafe's relatively higher pay, paid time off, health insurance, and retirement plans for his staff. Culture A neon side at the cafe and bar The 5 Point Cafe serves large portions of traditional American food and stiff drinks at inexpensive prices. Located in what is now an affluent neighborhood, it has historically catered to working class and eclectic patrons. Brassieres dangle from a stuffed moose head and there is a juke box with an expansive collection. The cafe has been called one of the best dive bars in the world by the alternative weekly newspaper The Stranger. It has been voted \\"Best Dive Bar\\" in Seattle several times by Seattle Magazine. The younger Smith installed quirky signs throughout the location. Before Washington banned smoking in restaurants and bars, the cafe touted it as smoker-friendly with a sign that read: \\"Smokers welcome, non- smokers beware\\". Other signs have slogans such as \\"We cheat tourists-n-drunks since 1929\\" and \\"Alcoholics Serving Alcoholics since 1929\\".

(1986). Individuality in the contact call of the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta). American Journal of Primatology, 11, 163-179 Contact calls are unlike other calls (such as alarm calls) in that they are not usually widely used, conspicuous calls, but rather short exclamations that differ between individuals. Often, the message that the call is meant to convey is specific to the individual or group's activity, such as informing other members of the group about one's location while foraging for food. Some social animal species communicate the signal of potential danger by stopping contact calls, without the use of alarm calls. Charles Darwin wrote about this in relation to wild horse and cattle. Humming as contact calls Joseph Jordania suggested that human humming could have played a function of contact calls in early human ancestors.Jordania, J. (2009). Times to Fight and Times to Relax: Singing and Humming at the Beginnings of Human Evolutionary History. Kadmos, 1, 272‚Äì277 According to his suggestion, humans find it distressing to be in full silence (which is a sign of danger for them), and this is why humans who are alone sometimes hum, whistle, talk to themselves, or listen to TV or radio during other activities. Birds Birds use contact calls in flight to establish location and to keep aware of each other's presence while flying and feeding. For some species, this call consists of a short, high-pitched sound, recognized and duplicated exactly by mates. Some fowl, such as geese,\\"honk\\" while in migration to communicate location and proximity to others in their flock. In parapatric and sympatric species of birds, where territories of one species may border or overlap with that of another species, the contact calls of each species may divergently evolve to help differentiate one species from that of the other within close proximity. Where one species may have little to no variation among the contact calls of distinct allopatric populations, populations with overlapping territories may change their contact call to sound different from the bordering population's. The same variation pattern is seen in certain species of birds, such as the White-eyed Birds (Zosterops spp.) with increasing elevation and longitude/latitude. Warning Some species of birds have alarm calls to specifically warn other individuals of predators. The Black-capped Chickadee warns its kind of the level of threat an approaching predator is by the number of \\"de\\"s heard. Its call, chick-a-dee-dee-dee, might indicate more danger than chick-a-dee-dee. Some calls reveal more details about an approaching predator, indicated by the pitch or speed. When there is a threatening enemy in the air, such as a hawk or eagle, the Florida Scrub-Jay warns other jays to seek cover by using a thin, shrill-like call. In contrast, an approaching predatory feline provokes a low-pitched \\"scolding\\" sound, and calls on fellow jays for help in scaring the intruder away. Comfort Parrots kept as pets demonstrate contact calls with their human owners. Parrots make their call to establish that the human is within earshot, and continue to make the call (sometimes growing louder into a scream) until acknowledged. The screaming develops in pet parrots, as well as wild flock, when the animal feels like its needs are not being met because the contact call is not being understood. Deer Deer communicate with contact calls, alarm calls and other calls to signal when they are ready to breed, to feed, to locate others in their group, after they have shed their velvet, to signal frustration, to summon nearby deer and to intimidate unwanted visitors. Non-aggressive * Location: Main contact call to signify location. * Doe Grunt : Doe's call; used to summon fawns for feeding. * Buck Grunt : Buck's call; used to summon fawns. * Sparring : Signals that the deer has shed its velvet. * Breeding Bellow : Doe is ready to breed. Aggressive * Sniff: Deer uses this call to intimidate unwanted deer visitors and prevent fighting. * Wheeze: Buck makes this sound to intimidate other deer and to prevent fights. Primates A troop of Ring- Tailed Lemurs Ring-Tailed Lemurs A ring-tailed lemur's contact call is used heavily to communicate and is classified on the level of excitement the lemur achieves in a situation. When low to moderately excited, the lemur moans; a \\"meow\\" is heard when the excitement is raised to a moderate level or when a situation will bring group togetherness. The loudest call occurs when a lemur is separated from its troop, and is recognizable by a distinct \\"wail.\\" Pygmy Marmosets Pygmy marmosets have developed a vocal system in which two acoustically different contact calls have been established. These two different calls allow individual marmosets to identify others within their population. The call an individual uses varies as a response to the call that they've heard. If one of the contact calls is played over a loudspeaker (from a familiar location to the marmoset), the response from a given individual can be predicted, indicating that the calls are used as an identification mechanism of communication. Baboons Chacma Baboons have been observed to use contact calls not only as identification tools and locators of members of the group, but also as a way of communicating messages with one another about their status with respect to the main group. Mother baboons can recognize and locate the contact calls or barks of her offspring when they venture to forage or explore independently, such as to be able to find them if they get lost and need help finding their way back. The mother never barks back, unless she is in danger of being separated from the group (i.e. searching for her offspring will lead her too far astray from the group as it moves across the terrain). In this case, she will venture out slightly in the direction of the calling infant and bark back intermittently to let the lost baboon track her voice down and make its way back to the group.

Bugge graduated from Trondhjem Cathedral School in 1823 and from the Royal Frederick University with the cand.philol. degree in 1829. In September 1831, in Christiania he married Anne Marie Magelssen (1811‚Äì1874). Their son Wilhelm Bugge became a bishop. Bugge was also uncle of Johannes Christian Piene and great-grandfather of Leif Vetlesen. Career Bugge was hired as principal at Trondhjem Cathedral School in 1833. He was a school reformer, and first published his thoughts on the school system in 1835's . Bugge was sent by the Norwegian state to study schools in France and German states from 1836 to 1837. In 1838 he finished his reflections from the travel, in three volumes. Named , the work was published by the Norwegian state the next year, and even awarded with a gold medal by Frederick Augustus II of Saxony. In 1839, Bugge got a seat on the public commission . Bugge had ideas that bore stems of the comprehensive school thought. He was inspired by Grundtvig's idea about educating the masses, and also supported Ivar Aasen's endeavors. However, he also wanted to protect the \\"learned\\" schools, which taught classical subjects, from too much influence from natural sciences and modern languages. A public polemic ensued between \\"classicists\\" and \\"realists\\"; Herman Foss and Anton Martin Schweigaard adhered to the latter. Among Bugge's supporters were professor and later principal of Christiania Cathedral School Ludvig Vibe. Although the classical subjects declined and never recovered, Bugge all in all became known as one of the \\"grand school strategists in 19th-century Norway\\", together with Ole Vig and Hartvig Nissen. Bugge was also a member of Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters from 1833, and praeses (chairman) from 1838 to 1851. He was also Mayor of Trondheim in 1845, 1849 and 1850. Bugge's public fall came in 1851, when he was forced to retire from Trondhjem Cathedral School, having battled alcoholism for some years. When he translated the Iliad in 1852, he was ridiculed and parodied in parts of the Norwegian press, mainly because he wrote too dialectical. Bugge settled in Bergen where he worked as a private tutor until his death in July 1853.

The graphon is shown as a magenta heatmap (lower right). A random graph of size n is generated by independently assigning to each vertex k \\\\in {1,\\\\dotsc,n} a latent random variable U_{k} \\\\sim \\\\mathrm{U}(0,1) (values along vertical axis) and including each edge (k,l) independently with probability f(U_{k},U_{l}). For example, edge (3,5) (green, dotted) is present with probability f(0.72,0.9); the green boxes in the right square represent the values of (u_{3},u_{5}) and (u_{5},u_{3}). The upper left panel shows the graph realization as an adjacency matrix. In graph theory and statistics, a graphon (also known as a graph limit) is a symmetric measurable function W:[0,1]^2\\\\to[0,1], that is important in the study of dense graphs. Graphons arise both as a natural notion for the limit of a sequence of dense graphs, and as the fundamental defining objects of exchangeable random graph models. Graphons are tied to dense graphs by the following pair of observations: the random graph models defined by graphons give rise to dense graphs almost surely, and, by the regularity lemma, graphons capture the structure of arbitrary large dense graphs.  Statistical formulation  A graphon is a symmetric measurable function W:[0,1]^{2}\\\\to[0,1]. Usually a graphon is understood as defining an exchangeable random graph model according to the following scheme: # Each vertex j of the graph is assigned an independent random value u_{j}\\\\sim U[0,1] # Edge (i,j) is independently included in the graph with probability W(u_{i},u_{j}). A random graph model is an exchangeable random graph model if and only if it can be defined in terms of a (possibly random) graphon in this way. The model based on a fixed graphon W is sometimes denoted \\\\mathbb{G}(n, W), by analogy with the Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi model of random graphs. A graph generated from a graphon W in this way is called a W-random graph. It follows from this definition and the law of large numbers that, if W eq0, exchangeable random graph models are dense almost surely.  Examples  The simplest example of a graphon is W(x,y)\\\\equiv p for some constant p\\\\in[0,1]. In this case the associated exchangeable random graph model is the Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi model G(n,p) that includes each edge independently with probability p. If we instead start with a graphon that is piecewise constant by: # dividing the unit square into k\\\\times k blocks, and # setting W equal p_{lm} on the (l,m)^{\\\\text{th}} block, the resulting exchangeable random graph model is the k community stochastic block model, a generalization of the Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi model. We can interpret this as a random graph model consisting of k distinct Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi graphs with parameters p_{ll} respectively, with bigraphs between them where each possible edge between blocks (l,l) and (m,m) is included independently with probability p_{lm}. Many other popular random graph models can be understood as exchangeable random graph models defined by some graphon, a detailed survey is included in Orbanz and Roy.  Jointly exchangeable adjacency matrices  A random graph of size n can be represented as a random n\\\\times n adjacency matrix. In order to impose consistency (in the sense of projectivity) between random graphs of different sizes it is natural to study the sequence of adjacency matrices arising as the upper-left n\\\\times n sub-matrices of some infinite array of random variables; this allows us to generate G_{n} by adding a node to G_{n-1} and sampling the edges (j,n) for j. With this perspective, random graphs are defined as random infinite symmetric arrays (X_{ij}). Following the fundamental importance of exchangeable sequences in classical probability, it is natural to look for an analogous notion in the random graph setting. One such notion is given by jointly exchangeable matrices; i.e. random matrices satisfying : (X_{ij}) \\\\ \\\\overset{d}{=} \\\\, (X_{\\\\sigma(i)\\\\sigma(j)}) for all permutations \\\\sigma of the natural numbers, where \\\\overset{d}{=} means equal in distribution. Intuitively, this condition means that the distribution of the random graph is unchanged by a relabeling of its vertices: that is, the labels of the vertices carry no information. There is a representation theorem for jointly exchangeable random adjacency matrices, analogous to de Finetti‚Äôs representation theorem for exchangeable sequences. This is a special case of the Aldous‚ÄìHoover theorem for jointly exchangeable arrays and, in this setting, asserts that the random matrix (X_{ij}) is generated by: # Sample u_{j}\\\\sim U[0,1] independently # X_{ij}=X_{ji}=1 independently at random with probability W(u_i,u_j), where W:[0,1]^2\\\\to[0,1] is a (possibly random) graphon. That is, a random graph model has a jointly exchangeable adjacency matrix if and only if it is a jointly exchangeable random graph model defined in terms of some graphon.  Graphon estimation  Due to identifiability issues, it is impossible to estimate either the graphon function W or the node latent positions u_i, and there are two main directions of graphon estimation. One direction aims at estimating Wup to an equivalence class, or estimate the probability matrix induced by W.  Analytic formulation  Any graph on n vertices {1, 2, \\\\dots, n} can be identified with its adjacency matrix A_G. This matrix corresponds to a stepfunction W_G : [0,1]^2 \\\\to [0, 1], defined by partitioning [0,1] into intervals I_1, I_2, \\\\dots, I_n such that I_j has interior \\\\left(\\\\frac{j-1}{n}, \\\\frac{j}{n}\\\\right) and for each (x,y)\\\\in I_i\\\\times I_j, setting W_G(x,y) equal to the (i,j)^{\\\\text{th}} entry of A_G. This function W_G is the associated graphon of the graph G. In general, if we have a sequence of graphs (G_n) where the number of vertices of G_{n} goes to infinity, we can analyze the limiting behavior of the sequence by considering the limiting behavior of the functions (W_{G_n}). If these graphs converge (according to some suitable definition of convergence), then we expect the limit of these graphs to correspond to the limit of these associated functions. This motivates the definition of a graphon (short for \\"graph function\\") as a symmetric measurable function W:[0,1]^{2}\\\\to[0,1] which captures the notion of a limit of a sequence of graphs. It turns out that for sequences of dense graphs, several apparently distinct notions of convergence are equivalent and under all of them the natural limit object is a graphon.  Examples  Example 1: Take a random sequence (G_n) Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi graphs G_n = G(n,p) with some fixed parameter p. Intuitively, as n tends to infinity, the limit of this sequence of graphs is determined solely by edge density of these graphs. In the space of graphons, it turns out that such a sequence converges almost surely to the constant W(x,y)\\\\equiv p, which captures the above intuition. Example 2: Take the sequence (H_n) of half-graphs, defined by taking H_n to be the bipartite graph on 2n vertices u_1, u_2, \\\\dots, u_n and v_1, v_2, \\\\dots, v_{n} such that u_i is adjacent to v_j precisely when i\\\\le j. If the vertices are listed in the presented order, then the adjacency matrix A_{H_n} has two corners of \\"half square\\" block matrices filled with ones, with the rest of the entries equal to zero. For example, the adjacency matrix of H_{3} is given by \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\end{bmatrix}. As n gets large, these corners of ones \\"smooth\\" out. Matching this intuition, the sequence (H_n) converges to the half-graphon W defined by W(x,y) = 1 when x-y \\\\ge 1/2 and W(x,y) = 0 otherwise. Example 3: Take the sequence (K_{n,n}) of complete bipartite graphs with equal sized parts. If we order the vertices by placing all vertices in one part at the beginning and placing the vertices of the other part at the end, the adjacency matrix of (K_{n,n}) looks like a block off-diagonal matrix, with two blocks of ones and two blocks of zeros. For example, the adjacency matrix of K_{2,2} is given by \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix}. As n gets larger, this block structure of the adjacency matrix remains constant, so that this sequence of graphs converges to a \\"complete bipartite\\" graphon W defined by W(x,y) = 1 whenever \\\\min(x,y) \\\\le 1/2 and \\\\max(x,y) > 1/2, and setting W(x,y) = 0 otherwise. Example 4: Consider the sequence (K_{n,n}) from the previous example again. If we instead order vertices by alternating between parts, the adjacency matrix has a chessboard structure of zeros and ones. For example, under this ordering, the adjacency matrix of K_{2,2} is given by \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix}. As n gets larger, the adjacency matrices become a finer and finer chessboard. Despite this behavior, we still want the limit of (K_{n,n}) to be unique and result in the graphon from example 4. This means when we formally define convergence for a sequence of graphs, the definition of a limit should be agnostic to relabelings of the vertices. Example 5: Take a random sequence (G_n) of W-random graphs by drawing G_n \\\\sim \\\\mathbb{G}(n, W) for some fixed graphon W. Then just like in the first example from this section, it turns out that (G_n) converges to W almost surely. Example 6: Given graph G with associated graphon W = W_G, we can recover graph theoretic properties and parameters of G by integrating transformations of W. For example, the edge density (i.e. average degree divided by number of vertices) of G is given by the integral \\\\int_{0}^1 \\\\int_0^1 W(x,y) \\\\; \\\\mathrm{d}x \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}y . This is because W is {0,1}-valued, and each edge (i, j) in G corresponds to a region I_i \\\\times I_j of area 1/n^2 where W equals 1. Similar reasoning shows that the number of triangles in G is equal to \\\\frac 16 \\\\int_{0}^1 \\\\int_0^1 \\\\int_0^1 W(x,y)W(y,z)W(z,x) \\\\; \\\\mathrm{d}x \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}y \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}z .  Notions of convergence  There are many different ways to measure the distance between two graphs. If we are interested in metrics that \\"preserve\\" extremal properties of graphs, then we should restrict our attention to metrics that identify random graphs as similar. For example, if we randomly draw two graphs independently from an Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi model G(n,p) for some fixed p, the distance between these two graphs under a \\"reasonable\\" metric should be close to zero with high probability for large n. There are two natural metrics that behave well on dense random graphs, in this sense. The first is a sampling metric, which says two graphs are close if their distributions of subgraphs are close. The second is an edge discrepancy metric, which says two graphs are close when their edge densities are close on all their corresponding subsets of vertices. Miraculously, a sequence of graphs converges when with respect to one distance precisely when it converges with respect to the other. Moreover, the limit objects under both distances turn out to graphons. The equivalence of these two notions of convergence mirrors how various notions of quasirandom graphs are equivalent. = Subgraph counts = One way to measure the distance between two graphs G and H is to compare their relative subgraph counts. That is, for each graph F we can compare the number of copies of F in G and F in H. If these numbers are close for every graph F, then intuitively G and H are similar looking graphs.  Homomorphism densities  Rather than dealing directly with subgraphs, it turns out to be easier to work with graph homomorphisms. This is fine when dealing with large, dense graphs, since in this scenario the number of subgraphs and the number of graph homomorphisms from a fixed graph are asymptotically equal. Given two graphs F and G, the homomorphism density t(F, G) of F in G is defined to be the number of graph homomorphisms from F to G . In other words, t(F,G) is the probability a randomly chosen map from the vertices of F to the vertices of G sends adjacent vertices in F to adjacent vertices in G. Graphons offer a simple way to compute homomorphism densities. Indeed, given a graph G with associated graphon W_G and another F, we have t(F, G) = \\\\int \\\\prod_{(i,j)\\\\in E(F)} W_G(x_i, x_j) \\\\; \\\\left{\\\\mathrm{d}x_i\\\\right}_{i\\\\in V(F)} where the integral is multidimensional, taken over the unit hypercube [0,1]^{V(F)}. This follows from the definition of an associated graphon, by considering when the above integrand is equal to 1. We can then extend the definition of homomorphism density to arbitrary graphons W, by using the same integral and defining t(F, W) = \\\\int \\\\prod_{(i,j)\\\\in E(F)} W(x_i, x_j) \\\\; \\\\left{\\\\mathrm{d}x_i\\\\right}_{i\\\\in V(F)} for any graph F.  Limits in terms of homomorphism density  Given this setup, we say a sequence of graphs (G_n) converges if for every fixed graph F, the sequence of homomorphism densities \\\\left(t(F, G_n)\\\\right) converges. Although not evident from the definition alone, if (G_n) converges in this sense, then there always exists a graphon W such that for every graph F, we have \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} t(F, G_n) = t(F, W) simultaneously. = Cut distance = Take two graphs G and H on the same vertex set. Because these graphs share the same vertices, one way to measure their distance is to restrict to subsets X, Y of the vertex set, and for each such pair subsets compare the number of edges e_G(X,Y) from X to Y in G to the number of edges e_H(X,Y) between X and Y in H. If these numbers are similar for every pair of subsets (relative to the total number of vertices), then that suggests G and H are similar graphs. To formalize this, for any symmetric, measurable function f : [0,1]^2 \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}, define the cut norm of f to be the quantity \\\\lVert f \\\\rVert_\\\\square = \\\\sup_{S, T\\\\subseteq [0,1]} \\\\left \\\\int_{S} \\\\int_{T} f(x,y) \\\\; \\\\mathrm{d}x \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}y \\\\right taken over all measurable subsets S, T of the unit interval. This norm captures our earlier notion of distance, because for two graphs G and H with same vertex set V of size V = n, the cut norm with the associated graphons \\\\lVert W_G - W_H \\\\rVert_\\\\square = \\\\frac 1{n^2} \\\\max_{X, Y\\\\subseteq V}\\\\lefte_G(X,Y) - e_H(X,Y)\\\\right lets us compute the maximum discrepancy of the edge densities between G and H. Note that this definition can still be used even when the graphs being compared do not share a vertex set. This distance measure still has one major limitation: it can assign nonzero distance to two isomorphic graphs. To make sure isomorphic graphs have distance zero, we should compute the minimum cut norm over all possible \\"relabellings\\" of the vertices. This motivates the definition of the cut distance between two graphons W and U to be \\\\delta_\\\\square(U, W) = \\\\inf_{\\\\varphi} \\\\lVert U - W^\\\\varphi \\\\rVert_\\\\square where W^\\\\varphi(x,y) = W(\\\\varphi(x), \\\\varphi(y)) is the composition of W with the map \\\\varphi, and the infimum is taken over all measure-preserving bijections from the unit interval to itself. The cut distance between two graphs is defined to be the cut distance between their associated graphons.  As a metric space  To make the cut-distance into a metric, we take the set of all graphons and identify two graphons U \\\\sim W whenever \\\\delta_\\\\square(U, W) = 0. The resulting space of graphons is denoted \\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{W}}_0, and together with \\\\delta_\\\\square forms a metric space. This space turns out to be compact. Moreover, it contains the set of all finite graphs as a dense subset. Here, graphs are being identified as {0,1}-valued step functions on the unit square. These observations show that the space of graphons is a completion of the space of graphs with respect to the cut distance.  Applications  Regularity lemma = Using compactness of the space of graphons (\\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal{W}}_0, \\\\delta_{\\\\square}), one can prove stronger versions of Szemer√©di's regularity lemma. = Sidorenko's conjecture = The analytic nature of graphons allows greater flexibility in attacking inequalities related to homomorphisms. For example, Sidorenko's conjecture is a major open problem in extremal graph theory, which asserts that for any graph G on n vertices with average degree pn (for some p\\\\in [0,1]) and bipartite graph H on v vertices and e edges, the number of homomorphisms from H to G is at least p^{e}n^{v}. Since this is quantity is the expected number of labeled subgraphs of H in a random graph G(n,p), the conjecture can be interpreted as the claim that for any bipartite graph H, the random graph achieves (in expectation) the minimum number of copies of H over all graphs with some fixed edge density. Many approaches to Sidorenko's conjecture formulate the problem as an integral inequality on graphons, which then allows the problem to be attacked using other analytical approaches.  Generalizations  Graphons are naturally associated with dense simple graphs. There are extensions of this model to dense directed weighted graphs, often referred to as decorated graphons. There are also recent extensions to the sparse graph regime, from both the perspective of random graph models and graph limit theory.

During the Byzantine times Christianity prospered in the island and many monasteries and churches were built. Among them was Theoskepasti church, which was dedicated to the Virgin Mary (Greek: Panagia). It was built within meters from the sea on a protruding rock, dominating the surrounding scenery.Theoskepasti Church http://www.paphos26.com/sights/panayia-theoskepasti-church.asp Legends By the end of the 11th century Saracens start attacking Cyprus. Theoskepasti church, due to its position, could easily be discerned by invading Arabs, during their raids. However, according to a legend the church was veiled with dark clouds of fog and rendered invisible as soon as the Saracens approached it. Due to this legend the church got the name \\"Theoskepasti\\" from the Greek words \\"Theos\\" and \\"skepazo\\" which mean \\"God\\" and \\"to veil\\" respectively. So, the name is 'Veiled by God'. According to another tradition, when once a Saracen managed to enter the church and tried to steal the golden candle, divine power cut off his hands. The New Church The present-day Panagia Theoskepasti church was built on the foundations of the older Byzantine church in 1923. The architecture of the previous church was preserved. A full restoration of the present-day church was completed in March 2009.Restoration of Theoskepasti church http://www.minasmina.com/PROJECTS/Pages/theoskepasti.htm Important exhibits Precious portable icons are kept at Theoskepasti Church.

If boarding/exiting at Vainikkala or Vyborg, the checks take place inside these stations. Vehicles Driver's cabin The Allegro service is operated using Class Sm6 trainsets built by Alstom. Sm6 stands for electric multiple unit (, literally 'electric motor train') model 6. The Sm6 appears similar to VR's earlier Sm3 Pendolino series, but is based on the fourth generation 'Pendolino Nuovo' or 'New Pendolino' designs and its construction differs from the Sm3 in many ways. The top speed of the train in passenger traffic is and the train can run at a speed of at least between Tikkurila and Luum√§ki and Vyborg and St. Petersburg after extensive rail works. The aim is to reduce travel time between Helsinki and Saint Petersburg from 5¬Ω hours to 3 hours. The travel time was 3:27. The Sm6 is equipped to operate on both the Finnish and the Russian railway networks. The units have dual-voltage electrical equipment able to use both the Finnish 25 kV 50 Hz alternating current and the Russian 3 kV direct current electrification. The wheelsets are built to run at over speeds on both the Finnish and the nominally slightly narrower Russian gauge, and the doors are equipped with a retractable step to make boarding from both Finnish high and Russian high platforms easy.

Jeremiah Halpern, an experienced activist who had been involved in the Haganah in 1920 and had served Betar in many capacities, was the first director of the school. Halpern had worked with Moshe Rosenberg since the 1920s in the development of Betar's military programmes and together they conceived of a school for Betar madrichim.Shindler, 2006, p. 152. Shortly after becoming director, Halpern recruited the revolutionary Zionist Abba Ahimeir as an instructor of the nationalist youth and together they led the school in an increasingly radical direction in which military training was viewed as a means of establishing the military wing of a national liberation movement.Shindler, 2006, p. 152-154. Under the leadership of Halpern (and later of Ahimeir), the 24 cadets took the lead in organising demonstrative activities outside Betar, which notably included taking the initiative in the march to the Western Wall in August 1929.Shindler, 2006, p. 153. The demonstration was later identified as the proximal cause of the 1929 Palestine riots by the Shaw Commission.Mattar, 1988, p. 48. Halpern's cadets formed the nucleus for the right-wing Maximalist tendency in Revisionism and the activities of Halpern and Ahimeir contributed to the evolution of the Irgun and to the support of Revisionist Maximalism within Betar.Shindler, 2006, p. 153.

The U. S. Food Administration was the agency responsible for the administration of the U.S. army overseas and allies' food reserves during the United States participation in World War I. One of its important tasks was the stabilization of the price of wheat on the U.S. market. It was established by of August 10, 1917, pursuant to the Food and Fuel Control Act, and was abolished by another executive order, , on August 21, 1920. \\"Records of the United States Food Administration\\", The National Archives at Fort Worth, Texas During the time of the administration, the United States was short of nearly everything as many commodities were being sold to their allies. All citizens were asked to donate any weapons, horses, and ammunition they possessed to help supply the army, with a small hope of the items being returned. The rationing was done during this time of National need so that food for soldiers, and citizens, wouldn't be an issue. Concepts such as \\"meatless Mondays\\" and \\"wheatless Wednesdays\\" were also implemented to help ration food, so that the government could prioritise the war effort. History Mina Van Winkle, in Food Administration uniform, explains Victory gardening and explains recommended food processing. The appointment of Hoover Woodrow Wilson realised he would need a dynamic leader to ensure the Food administration was effective. His advisor, Edward House suggested Herbert Hoover who had previously run the Commission for Relief in Belgium. Walter Hines Page, the British ambassador, endorsed this choice and Wilson, a Democrat agreed although Hoover was a Republican. Hoover accepted the position only on the basis that he would have a completely free hand as regards the Washington bureaucracy, which in particular referred to David F. Houston, the Secretary of Agriculture. Despite initial resistance Houston acquiesced and Hoover was appointed. Grain Corporation The administration employed its Grain Corporation, organized under the provisions of the Food Control Act of August 10, 1917, as an agency for the purchase and sale of foodstuff. Having done transactions in the size of $7 billion it was rendered obsolete by the armistice in Europe. President Woodrow Wilson promoted its transition in a new agency for the support of the reconstruction of Europe. It became the American Relief Administration, approved by an Act (Public, No. 274, 65th Congress) on February 25, 1919. The Food Administration Grain Corporation became the United States Grain Corporation pursuant to of May 14, 1919.

It is located in the neighbourhood of Algorta, in the municipality of Getxo. On its current form, the station opened on 11 November, 1995 replacing an older station.  History  The original station opened in 1893 as part of the Getxo-Plentzia extension of the Bilbao-Las Arenas railway. The station was at-grade open air station with one side platform and one island platform. The station building, now disappeared, followed the same architectural design as others of the same line, with the only remaining example being that of Neguri station. Next to the station there was a small train depot. Starting in 1947, the narrow-gauge railway companies that operated within the Bilbao metropolitan area were merged to become Ferrocarriles y Transportes Suburbanos de Bilbao S.A. (Railways and Suburban Transports of Bilbao), shortened FTS and the first precedent of today's Metro Bilbao. In 1977, the FTS network was transferred to the public company FEVE and in 1982 to the recently created Basque Railways. In the decade of 1990s, it was decided the station, just like the most of the former railway line, would be integrated into Metro Bilbao's line 1. The rail line was then put underground and a new also underground station was built, opened in 1995. The former station building, platforms and train depot were demolished and replaced with a public plaza named Algorta Station Plaza.

In cardiac physiology, isovolumetric contraction is an event occurring in early systole during which the ventricles contract with no corresponding volume change (isovolumetrically). This short-lasting portion of the cardiac cycle takes place while all heart valves are closed. Description In a healthy young adult, blood enters the atria and flows to the ventricles via the opened atrioventricular valves (tricuspid and mitral valves). Atrial contraction rapidly follows, actively pumping about 30% of the returning blood. As diastole ends, the ventricles begin depolarizing and, while ventricular pressure starts to rise owing to contraction, the atrioventricular valves close in order to prevent backflow to the atria. At this stage, which corresponds to the R peak or the QRS complex seen on an ECG, the semilunar valves (aortic and pulmonary valves) are also closed. The net result is that, while contraction causes ventricular pressures to rise sharply, there is no overall change in volume because of the closed valves. The isovolumetric contraction phase lasts about 0.03 s, but this short period of time is enough to build up a sufficiently high pressure that eventually overcomes that of the aorta and the pulmonary trunk upon opening of the semilunar valves. This process, therefore, helps maintain the correct unidirectional flow of blood through the heart and circulatory system. Etymology The word contains the prefix iso-, derived from the Ancient Greek ·º¥œÉŒøœÇ (√≠sos), meaning equal. Therefore, an isovolumetric contraction is one in which the volume of fluid remains constant.

History In 1785, John Davenport began as a potter working with Thomas Wolfe of Stoke. In 1794, he acquired his own pottery at Longport and began producing cream- coloured blue and white transfer-printed earthenware. In 1801 he began making glass, and by 1805 he was making porcelain and stone china as well.Godden, 116 By September 1806 the quality of his porcelain wares was such that the Prince of Wales, later to become King George IV, ordered services of the finest and most valuable kinds.Staffordshire Advertiser, 20 September 1806 John retired in 1830 and his sons, William and Henry, carried on the firm. Henry died in 1835 and the firm became William Davenport and Company. William died in 1869. The firm continued under William‚Äôs two sons till 1887 when the factory was closed. In 1887 Davenport was acquired by Burleigh Pottery. A book of 1843 said the firm had three works in Longport and another one at Newport, this making earthenware, and altogether had over 1,500 workers. All wares were of very good quality for their type. From around 1860 most wares were porcelain.Godden, 116 The landscape artist James Holland (1800‚Äì1872) was employed, from the age of 12, for 7 years as a flower painter at the Longport works. His father and other members of the family were also employed there.

Castrucci was born in Rome, where he studied with Arcangelo Corelli; in 1715, he settled in London, where he became known as one of the finest virtuoso violinists of his generation. By 1718 he had become leader of the opera orchestra of George Frideric Handel, a position which he held until 1737, when he was succeeded by the younger John Clegg. In 1739 he became one of the first beneficiaries of the Royal Society of Musicians and was little heard of thereafter, apart from an erroneous report of his death in 1746. After a benefit concert in Dublin in 1750, he died there of malaria in 1752. Despite being by then a pauper, he was buried with full ceremony in St. Mary's Church, Dublin. Castrucci was the inventor of the 'violetta marina', which was a variation of the viola d'amore. Handel wrote obbligati for this instrument.Pratt, Waldo Selden. The History of Music. New York: G.

She is the recipient of a MacArthur \\"genius grant\\" Fellowship. Dufka currently serves as an Associate Director at Human Rights Watch.  Early life and education  Dufka grew up in Utah and California received a bachelor's degree from San Francisco State University in 1979. In 1984, she graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a master's degree in social work.  Work = Social work  Following completion of her master's degree, Dufka worked as a humanitarian volunteer and social worker in Latin America. She volunteered with Nicaraguan refugees during the country's revolution, and with victims of the 1985 Mexico City earthquake. She then moved to El Salvador as a social worker with the Lutheran church . While in El Salvador, Dufka became close with local photojournalists, and was asked by the director of a local human rights organization to launch a program to document human rights abuses through photography. The director of the program was killed two weeks later, reportedly by death squads. Dufka's photos of his body ran in The New York Times, and she accepted the position.  Photojournalism  Dufka received her first contract as a photojournalist in 1989, with the Reuters news agency, covering the conflict in El Salvador. In 1992, she relocated to Sarajevo, where she covered the ethnic conflicts in the Balkans. Dufka remained in the region until 1993, when the vehicle in which she was traveling encountered an anti-tank mine. She was seriously injured, suffering facial lacerations, internal injuries, and ligament damage. Following three weeks of rehabilitation in London, Dufka returned to the field on assignment for Reuters in Mogadishu, Somalia. She remained stationed in East Africa, covering much of the continent for the agency, including the Rwandan genocide. Her images from Rwanda were later used as evidence during the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. She covered famine in Sudan, conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the Liberian civil war, among others. Dufka identifies as a member of the \\"Bang Bang Club.\\" The term, initially used to reference photojournalists working in South Africa's townships during apartheid, has also been applied more broadly to conflict photojournalists covering conflicts during the 1990s, especially those on the African continent. In 1998 Dufka went to Nairobi, Kenya to cover the bombing of the American Embassy. She arrived hours after the blast, and was deeply frustrated by 'missing the scoop.' Later, upon watching the news coverage of the attack, Dufka realized that she had lost ‚Äúcompassion‚Äù for the subjects of her work, and resolved to end her career as a photojournalist.  Human rights  In 1999 Dufka left Nairobi to open a field office for Human Rights Watch in Freetown, Sierra Leone, where she documented human rights abuses associated with the country's ongoing civil war.Sierra Leone: getting away with murder, mutilation, rape, Radio Netherlands Archives, January 25, 2000 In 2002 she took a leave of absence to work as a criminal investigator for the Chief of Investigations and the Prosecutor for the United Nations' Special Court for Sierra Leone. In 2003, Dufka returned the United States. That same year she was awarded the MacArthur \\"genius grant\\" Fellowship for her journalistic and documentary work documenting the 'devastation' of Sierra Leone and the conflict's toll on human rights. Dufka returned to West Africa in 2005 to lead the Human Rights Watch field office in Dakar, Senegal. She is currently a senior researcher for the Africa division of Human Rights Watch, overseeing the organization's work on West Africa. In 2012, Dufka testified before the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the armed conflict in northern Mali.

Born 9 October 1906 at Souk Ahras, Algeria, he died 20 March 1972 in Paris. Biography=Political career Of Corsican origins, Casanova studied law at university in Paris. He became secretary of the Communist cell there, and he entered the underground apparatus of the French Communist Party (PCF) in 1928, when he was just twenty-one years old. By 1936, he had become a close associate of Maurice Thorez, the party's secretary-general. Drafted into the French armed forces in 1939, Casanova was promptly taken prisoner; however, he escaped and resumed contact with the party through an intermediary, Claudine Chomat, in March 1942. Initially, he worked in the communist resistance with Pierre Villon, a period during which he met Pablo Picasso and Louis Aragon. He then served the National Military Committee of the FTP (Francs-Tireurs et Partisans), whose leader, Charles Tillon, proposed Casanova as the FTP's representative to the Provisional Consultative Assembly (Assembl√©e consultative provisoire) of 1944 in Algiers, but he never attended. At the time of the liberation (August 1944), he was elected to be a delegate for Seine-et-Marne to two national constituent assemblies and then to the National Assembly of France itself, a position he held for the duration of the French Fourth Republic (1946-1958). He was Minister for Veterans and War Victims in the provisional governments of F√©lix Gouin and Georges Bidault from 26 January to 8 July 1946. He became an associate member of the central committee of the French Communist Party (PCF) in July 1945 and then an alternate to the National Office in June 1947, and, lastly, a full member in June 1954, at the time of the Thirteenth Congress of the PCF. He represented the party in the Peace Movement, replacing Charles Tillon, who stepped down in 1952 (in connection with his association with Andr√© Marty). At the PCF, he was responsible for relations with intellectuals and with youth. After the revelations of the Twentieth Congress of the Soviet Communist Party, during which Nikita Khrushchev denounced the \\"cult of personality\\" surrounding Joseph Stalin, Casanova became a Soviet representative to the governing bodies of PCF, a reaction favorable to Casanova based on a liberalizing change of style and thought in Russia. He had the support of Khrushchev he received the Lenin Peace Prize in 1960. However, Thorez managed to block the \\"aggiornamento\\" (trend to \\"bring things up to date\\") and eliminated Casanova from all governing bodies in May 1961. Marcel Servin and Maurice Kriegel-Valrimont were also victims of the purge. Personal life He married Danielle Casanova (born Vincentelli Perini), who died heroically at Auschwitz, and later, he married Claudine Chomat, whom he had also known, before the war, in the communist youth movement. His book Casanova wrote a book named The Communist Party, the intellectuals, and the nation.

The German post office was closed and the occupying forces used German stamps at first, with \\"Anglo- French Occupation\\" overprints. From 1915, overprinted British stamps of the Gold Coast and overprinted French stamps of Dahomey were in use.

Under the official name of a Berlin Industrial Exposition (German \\"Berliner Gewerbeausstellung\\") - borrowing the name from earlier exhibitions - the Universal Exposition of Berlin took place between May 1 and October 15, 1896 in the Treptow borough of Berlin. The exposition featured one of the largest and longest Great refractors up-to that time, and it was preserved after the exposition and survived to the 21st century.  Precursors  The first Berlin Industrial Exposition was initiated by the Prussian Minister Christian Peter Wilhelm Beuth. The trade fair took place from September 1 to October 15, 1822, as an exhibition of regional trades in the House of Industries in the Klo√üterstra√üe. There were 182 exhibition companies showing 998 different products to 9514 visitors. The second trade fair took place in 1827 at the same place. In 1844 the General German Industrial Exhibition (in German Allgemeine Deutsche Gewerbe-Ausstellung) took place in the old arsenal house, the Zeughaus of Berlin. Among 3040 exhibition companies there were 685 Berlin companies showing a large variety of German industrial goods - the exhibition saw 260,000 visitors.  Berlin Industrial Exposition 1879  In 1879 a large exhibition was set in an exhibition park created near the Lehrte Station. The exhibition was not only a show of technological advancements but it was also created as an amusement park. One of the main attractions of the event was the first electric locomotive from Siemens & Halske. Originally built for use in a coal mine, it pulled three small cars fitted with wooden benches, each car being capable of carrying six passengers for a ride along a 300-meter circular track. Electrical power was supplied to a third rail from a nearby generating station. During the four months of the exhibition, it carried 90,000 passengers. The original locomotive is now displayed at the Deutsches Museum in Munich and a replica is shown at the German Museum of Technology (Berlin).  Background  The Great Refractor of the Great Industrial Expo, survives today at Archenhold Observatory After the successful world fairs in London and Paris the Berlin press argued at large for a world fair to be held in Berlin as well. Especially the \\"Verein Berliner Kaufleute und Industrieller\\" (Association of Merchants and Industrialists) was on the forefront - the association had been founded for the industrial exposition of 1879. Its chairman Max Ludwig Goldberger took it as a personal aim of life to make a world fair happen in Berlin. Goldberger had lived in the USA for a time and he had written a book called \\"Land der unbegrenzten M√∂glichkeiten\\" (literally \\"country of boundless possibilities\\", the German wording for the catch phrase of \\"the land of opportunity\\"). He knew quite well of the international benefits for the industry deriving from a world fair. With the Eiffel Tower showing the industrial strength on the world fair in Paris of 1889 the national press was nearly frantic about a German world fair to show off to the \\"Erbfeind\\" (hereditary enemy). Despite eager proposition around, the national chamber of commerce as well as the council of ministers rejected the idea multiple times due to the financial situation of the Reich. Even though the emperor Wilhelm II was well known for some grandstanding in his time, he was very opposed to the idea of a world fair. On July 20, 1892, he wrote to his chancellor Leo von Caprivi: On every occasion thereon that the topic was brought up he came to be used to say \\"Ausstellung isnich\\" (\\"Exposition is nada\\"), taking up a wording from the Berlin dialect. In a kind of defiance action the \\"Association of Berlin Merchants and Industrialists\\" (VBKI) took over the tasks and they founded an interest group to prepare the exhibition. Due to the political conflict the exposition could not be called world fair however - instead they related the project to the earlier industrial expositions in Berlin and the project was run under the name of \\"Industrial Exposition of Berlin 1896\\". The year 1896 was chosen as it was the 25th anniversary of Berlin as the capital of the Reich so that it could find support by authorities. Although the name could well be taken for a regional fair it was supposed from the start to create a fair that should eclipse all other world fairs before - so it was nothing but an intentional fraudulent labeling.  The exhibition  fairground map (showing a length of about 2 km with the river Spree at the top) across the river Spree The construction work started in 1894 with the intention to create a show room for the German industry - Germany was at the height of technological advancements and Berlin was at the center of science, industry and services. When the area was completed it occupied over 900,000 square meters - larger than any other fair in the world before. The \\"New Lake\\" (\\"Neuer See\\") in the middle was created as an artificial water basin occupying 10,000 square meters (it was roughly situated where the central area of the Soviet War Memorial (Treptower Park) is now). It required its own electrical tramway route to get around on the large fair ground. The 3,780 exhibition companies had areas in 23 different topic groups. The largest building with 13 groups was the \\"Haupt-Industrie-Geb√§ude\\" (Main Industry Building) at one end of the New Lake while others were run in pavilions along the lake sides. The electrification of the area required a dedicated power plant on the fair ground - the electric illumination of the complete area was a sensation of its own at the time. The exhibition was marketed worldwide - although it was rainy on 120 of the 168 exhibition days there were seven million visitors coming to the fair ground.  Notable attractions  The main restaurant The exhibition was not a simple trade fair but it was more cast as a piece of art. It was not only about showing industrial advancements but at the same time it show the world to visitors of Berlin. The colonial exhibition The German food industry not only showed its products, but they were also sold in the many restaurants. Beer gardens as well as high class gastronomy were present all around. In the lake haven one could use Venetian gondolas to other side of the lake. A circus showed animals from the tropics and a large panorama showed north pole impressions. One could use a balloon to look at the place from above that had also a large water slide, the American Theatre and long series of other funfair rides. Old Berlin Show The German Colonial Exhibition (Deutsche Kolonial-Ausstellung) showed recreations of villages from East Africa, Togo, Cameroons and New Guinea complete with more than 100 natives that were brought to Berlin for the real authentic impression.Die Deutsche Colonial-Ausstellung von 1896 im Treptower Park, (DHM) dhm.de (PDF, 5 S.) In the \\"Kairo\\" section the small bazaar streets of the Cairo Old Town were recreated complete with an Arabic Caf√© and a mosque. A pyramid was erected along with a small Egyptian peasant village. A lift ran alongside the pyramid to the top to be used as a high viewpoint. The large telescope The Old Berlin Exhibition showed a Berlin impression as it had existed in the Middle Ages, complete with a market, a town hall and a theater. Otto Lilienthal was showing his steam engines - he was not allowed to demonstrate his airplanes but he gave a lecture on practical flight experiments on June 16. The large telescope was a major success despite only being completed in September. Due to the large interest it was later moved to its own building, today the Archenhold Observatory today. All the other buildings had to be torn down as the fair allowance included a requirement that the installations were only to be temporary.  The Great Telescope  The expo telescope tube rising above the observatory in the modern day The Great telescope of the exhibition was noted as the most popular exhibit of the expo. A the time the biggest telescope in Germany was an 18 inch aperture refractor, while the exhibit telescope had a 27 inch lens. The tube is about 68 feet long (21 meters), the focal length of the lens. The lens was made by Schott and also Steinhell attended the lens grinding.

MacDonald, The Burghs and Parliament in Scotland, c1550-1661 (2007), 140-3.

He served from January 1970 to September 1972.  Career  Hoofnagle was appointed to the Fairfax County School Board in 1962 to represent the Centreville District by Supervisor Stuart T. DeBell. In 1964, Hoofnagle became chairman of the school board, a position he would hold until 1969. In November 1969, Chairman of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors Frederick A. Babson resigned, citing his frustration with the low pay of $10,000 per year for the part-time office. Fairfax County Circuit Court Judge Arthur W. Sinclair appointed Hoofnagle to serve out the rest of Babson's term on December 10, 1969, and Hoofnagle took office in January 1970. Although Hoofnagle was a Democrat, his position as an employee of the Federal Government forbade him from holding partisan political office, so he renounced his party affiliation and became an independent. It was as an independent that Hoofnagle sought election to the office of Chairman in a special election held in November 1970. Running with the endorsement of the Fairfax County Democratic Committee, Hoofnagle defeated Republican Walter S. Boone. Hoofnagle sought reelection as the Chairman in 1971. Running unopposed, Hoofnagle was elected again in November 1971. After only nine months into his term, Hoofnagle resigned from the Board of Supervisors. Although he publicly stated his reason for resigning was the need to travel for his job as an economist for the United States Department of Agriculture, he had privately stated his frustration with the limited power of the position, which allowed him to vote only on matters before the board in the case of a tie.

Hiemer's three main books were all published in the Second World War and had anti-Semitic themes. Biography Hiemer began working with Julius Streicher in the 1920s, as a journalist for Streicher's weekly anti-Semitic newspaper Der St√ºrmer, for which he reported on trials of Jewish offenders.Claudia Koonz, The Nazi Conscience (Harvard University Press, 2003), p. 230. Using the knowledge and experience he had gained working as a teacher, Hiemer wrote two anti-Semitic books for children which were both published by Julius Streicher's St√ºrmer publishing house.Gregory Wegner, Anti-semitism and Schooling Under the Third Reich (Routledge, 2002), p. 158. The first of these was Der Giftpilz (The Poisonous Mushroom), published in 1938. This was a collection of 17 short stories, illustrated by 'Fips' (Philipp Rupprecht). It was followed in 1940 by another collection, Der Pudelmopsdackelpinscher und andere besinnliche Erzahlungen (The Poodle-Pug-Dachshund-Pinscher and other contemplative stories), which compared Jews to various forms of animals. These publications were amongst the most extreme anti-Semitic items produced for children under the Nazi regime, causing them to be the subject of negative comments from some Nazis. During this time, Hiemer was also the chief editor of Der St√ºrmer. In 1942, he published a collection of anti-Semitic proverbs entitled Der Jude im Sprichwort der V√∂lker. After the war, Hiemer was interned for three and a half years at Stalag XIII-D, and banned from teaching for life. He died on 29 July 1974 in Alt√∂tting, Bavaria.

In October 2014, President Nicol√°s Maduro made Bernal head of a newly created presidential commission concentrated on police reform. President Maduro stated that the goal of the commission led by Bernal was to review both CICPC and the Bolivarian National Police.

Also at Punto de Corte and El Nacional The sanctions were for behaviors that undermined democracy after at least 125 people will killed in the 2017 Venezuelan protests and \\"in response to the government of Venezuela's deepening descent into dictatorship\\". Canadians were banned from transactions with the 40 individuals, whose Canadian assets were frozen. The sanctions noted a rupture of Venezuela's constitutional order. =United States= In 2011, four Hugo Ch√°vez allies were sanctioned by the United States Department of the Treasury for allegedly helping FARC obtain weapons and smuggle drugs. Bernal, one of the sanctioned, dismissed the charges as \\"an aggression\\", saying he would not be frightened by the sanctions. In November 2017, Bernal was again sanctioned by the United States Office of Foreign Assets Control after the 2017 Venezuelan Constituent Assembly election; the Treasury Department described the individuals sanctioned as being \\"associated with undermining electoral processes, media censorship, or corruption in government-administered food programs in Venezuela\\". =Panama= In March 2018, Panama sanctioned 55 public officials, including Bernal; Also at Panama Economic and Finance Ministry the officials were sanctioned by the Panamanian government for their alleged involvement with \\"money laundering, financing of terrorism and financing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\\". =European Union = On 25 June 2018, the European Union sanctioned eleven Venezuelan officials, including Bernal, in response to the May 2018 Venezuelan presidential election, which the E.U. described as \\"neither free nor fair\\". =Switzerland= On 10 July 2018, he was among 11 Venezuelans previously sanctioned by the European Union in June 2018 added to the sanctions list of Switzerland.

Babson came to the area in 1958 to work for Turney & Turney, a law firm in Washington, D.C. In June 1960, Babson was appointed by the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors to coordinate the county's defense against the City of Falls Church, which sought to annex roughly 4.5 square miles of the county. After several months gathering evidence to fight the suit, Babson resigned in February 1961 to return to private practice with what was now the law firm of Turney, Major, Markham and Sherfy. In 1963, Babson was elected to the Falls Church District seat on the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, defeating incumbent Republican Robert C. Cotten. In January 1966, he was elected Chairman of the Board by his fellow supervisors. Fairfax County voters approved a referendum in November 1966 that changed the county's plan of government from the county executive form, under which the county had operated since 1952, to the new urban county executive form. A significant change to the Board of Supervisors was the change of the chairmanship from a single year term selected by the supervisors from among their membership to an at-large office directly elected by the voters of the county. Babson declared his candidacy for this newly created chairmanship in January 1967. Babson won the chairmanship the November 1967 election, defeating former Mason District Supervisor Stanford E.

Hoofnagle to serve out the rest of Babson's term on December 10, 1969, and Hoofnagle took office in January 1970. Babson's resignation from the Chair effectively put an end to his political career. In 1974, he attempted to mount a campaign as an independent for Virginia's Eighth Congressional District. He also unsuccessfully sought the seat of retiring Senator William L. Scott in 1978, but did not receive his party's nomination. He died after brain surgery in 1999.

Alfred A. Knopf, 1949) The Fruits of the Earth () is a prose-poem by Andr√© Gide, published in France in 1897. The book was written in 1895 (the year of Gide's marriage) and appeared in a review in 1896 before publication the next year. Gide admitted to the intellectual influence of Nietzsche's Thus Spoke ZarathustraCatherine Hill Savage, ' and ' but the true genesis was the author's own journey from the deforming influence of his puritanical religious upbringing to liberation in the arms of North African boys. Andre Maurois draws attention to the similarity of moral outlook between the two works in these words: \\"Like Thus Spake Zarathustra, ' is a gospel in the root sense of the word: glad tidings.

Menalque has two lessons to impart through the narrator. The first is to flee families, rules, stability. Gide himself suffered so much from \\"snug homes\\" that he harped on its dangers all his life. The second is to seek adventure, excess, fervor; one should loathe the lukewarm, security, all tempered feelings. \\"Not affection, Nathanael: love ...\\" A subtly structured collection of lyrical fragments, reminiscences, poems, travel notes, and aphorisms, the book came to command such a following after World War I that Gide wrote a preface stressing the work's self-critical dimension.

He held the diplomatic rank of Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary. He was also the Head of the Department of the Near East of the USSR Ministry for Foreign Affairs (before 1946 known as NKID, i.e. People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs). In his work he specialized in China, Turkey, Afghanistan, Near and Middle East (including the Palestine question 1944-1947) and the countries of Africa. He is historically known as a leading Soviet specialist in Soviet-Chinese relations. Origin and early years Ivan Samylovskii was born on 5 September 1905 in Tupanovo, a small village in the Babushkinsky District of Vologda Oblast, to a Russian peasants family.Encyclopaedia of the Vologda Oblast, Editorial Board chaired by Sudakov G.V., ‚ÄúRus‚Äù, 2006. He graduated in political sciences at the Gubernia school with Cum laude. Ivan then went on to do political and pedagogical work in the Vologodskaya oblast. In 1927 he joined the Army. When his military service was completed he moved to St. Petersburg where he studied in the Leningrad Institute of Oriental Studies Faculty of Political Sciences. He graduated in 1932.

After a brief spell in 1939 at the central office of the NKID (until 1946 People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs; Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the USSR thereafter) he was appointed Consul-General in Kashgar where he served until 1942. In 1942 he was appointed Counselor of the USSR Embassy in Afghanistan, which during World War II became an important strategic region for the Soviet Union. In 1943 he participated in the Tehran Conference. Head of the Near East Department In 1944, at the age of 39, Samylovskii was promoted and appointed Head of the Near East Department of the NKID.Essays on the history of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Russia, 1802‚Äì2002, Editorial Board chaired by Igor S. Ivanov, vol. 2. p. 294. The Near East Department emerged in 1944 from the larger Middle East Department headed by Sergey Kavtaradze. In 1944 it comprised the Arab countries, the territory of Palestine and countries of Northern Africa. =Main activities= During this time he participated in two major international fora: the February 1945 Yalta Conference and the Potsdam Conference in July 1945. An ardent patriot, he initiated steps which led to the strengthening of the role of the Soviet Union in the region of the Near East and elsewhere in the international arena. Relations with the countries of the region became more active, in particular with Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Egypt. He also chaired the Commission on national minorities in the countries of the region and Turkey. He continued to work on issues of security regarding some of the principal frontiers, including the Black Sea/Mediterranean Straits of the Bosporus and the Dardanelles (Turkish Straits). =The Palestine question 1944 ‚Äì June 1947= Palestine, at that time under the British Mandate of 1922, was the responsibility of Samylovskii as Head of the Near East Department. During and immediately after World War II the Palestine question was on the USSR's diplomatic agenda through the NKID's Commission for the Preparation of Peace Agreements and Postwar Settlements during 1943-45, chaired by Maxim Litvinov. By July 1945 this Commission had drafted a series of conclusions on the Palestine question which were considered as the basis of Soviet policy immediately after World War II. Not resolved in 1945, the Palestine question became more and more acute during 1946, requiring a highly sensitive diplomatic approach. Early in 1947 it was brought formally to the attention of the United Nations and it was decided as a matter of urgency to convene the First Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly in the Spring of 1947, exclusively on Palestine. The main aim of Soviet policy regarding the Palestine question was to find a just solution for both the Arab and the Jewish populations of Palestine, to secure equal rights for both, to guarantee their independence by terminating the British Mandate and to obtain the withdrawal of foreign troops from Palestine. Samylovskii signed the directives, prepared by his Department, to the Soviet delegation at the First Special Session of the UN General Assembly.Documents on Soviet-Israeli relations.

In discussions at the First Special Session, New York 28 April to 15 May 1947, the Soviet stand on the Palestine question was confirmed, i.e. preferably the establishment of an independent single Jewish-Arab State with equal rights for both the Arab and Jewish populations. The Soviet delegation conceded that in case this plan could not be implemented, and the Jewish and Arab populations could not be reconciled, and only then, should a ‚Äúsecond plan be considered, which would provide for the partition of Palestine into two independent single states, one Jewish and one Arab‚Äù. Following the decisions of the First Special Session, the Special Committee on Palestine, established by this session, elaborated two proposals and submitted them to the Second Session of the UN General Assembly in November 1947, where a majority of countries, including the Soviet Union, voted in favour of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, and by this voting, on 29 November 1947, the U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution recommending the adoption and implementation of the Plan as the United Nations Resolution 181. End of diplomatic career In June 1947, Samylovskii received a new appointment ‚Äì he was sent to Afghanistan and on the 20th of June he was presented with his credentials as Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Ambassador of the USSR in Afghanistan. He served in this position, his final diplomatic service, less than a year. Post-diplomatic service At the end of 1948 Samylovskii was appointed Chief radio-broadcast editor and Head of the Department of Broadcasting to countries of the East (i.e. Middle, Near and Far East) of the State Radio-Committee . In 1957 he was appointed Head of the Department for the Near and Middle East and Africa of the State Committee on Cultural Cooperation with Foreign Countries under the USSR Council of Ministers, where he worked until 1968.

Despite the fact that his diplomatic career ended early Samylovskii continued, from a different rostrum, to contribute to the relations of the USSR with countries of Asia, Africa and the Near and Middle East. He published six books (listed in the section \\"Bibliography\\") and numerous articles on this subject.

TFSDA members are part of the Sabbatarian adventist movement, and believe that as a result of the decisions the European church leaders took, the Seventh-day Adventist Church had apostatized and had become \\"Babylon\\". Overview The group related its origins to the Seventh-day Adventist Reform Movement which formed in Germany during the period of World War I, when its European church leaders determined it was permissible for Adventists to bear arms and serve in the military, and to disregard the Sabbath during the war, which went against what the church believed.Murray, Katharine, \\"Soviet Seventh-day Adventists,\\" Religion, State and Society 5:2 (Summer 1977), p.88‚Äì93. The Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement formed as the result of a schism within the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Europe during World War I over the position its leadership took on Sabbath observance and in committing Seventh-day Adventist Church members to the bearing of arms in military service.Holger Teubert, ‚ÄúThe History of the So called ‚ÄòReform Movement‚Äô of the Seventh-day Adventists,‚Äù unpublished Manuscript, 9. The Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement was formerly organised on an international level in 1925 at Gotha, Germany and appears to have been the catalyst for the formation of the TFSDA and both held to the core belief of a Protestant Christian denomination, part of the Sabbatarian adventist movement. Both the TFSDA and the Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement formed as the result of the controversy within the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Europe during World War I over the position its leadership took on Sabbath observance and in committing Seventh-day Adventist Church members to the bearing of arms in military service.Holger Teubert, ‚ÄúThe History of the So called ‚ÄòReform Movement‚Äô of the Seventh-day Adventists,‚Äù unpublished Manuscript, 9. The movement group in Germany adopted the name \\"Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement\\" while that in Russian appears to have adopted the similar \\"True and Free Seventh-day Adventists\\". While the ‚ÄòReform Movement‚Äô in Germany registered as a General Conference association in 1929, the TFSDA was organized but did not do the same. However, much like in Russian the crackdown on the 'Reform Movement‚Äô in Germany began with the General Conference association's dissolution by the Gestapo in 1936 but it was re- registered in Sacramento, California, United States in 1949 so was more familiar and became better known in America than the TFSDA.See on \\"The Name of Our Church\\", official SDARM Website, http://www.sdarm.org/origin/his_12_name.html Both the TFSDA and the Seventh Day Adventist Reform movement's beliefs largely reflect its distinctive Seventh-day Adventist Church heritage, with some small divergences.  History of the schism = 1914‚Äì1918 Seventh-day Adventist Church Schism (Europe)  The Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement came about as a result of the actions of L. R. Conradi and certain European church leaders during the war, who decided that it was acceptable for Adventists to take part in war, which was in clear opposition to the historical position of the church that had always upheld the non-combative position. Since the American Civil War, Adventists were known as non-combatants, and had done work in hospitals or to give medical care rather than combat roles.http://www.sidadventist.org/lead/index.php/resources/essent/89-leadership The General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists sent Seventh-day Adventist minister and General Conference Secretary William Ambrose Spicer to investigate the changes, but was unable to change what L. R. Conradi and the others had done during the war. After the war, the Seventh-day Adventist Church sent a delegation of four brethren from the General Conference (Arthur Daniells, L. H. Christian, F. M. Wilcox, M. E. Kern) in July 1920, who came to a Ministerial Meeting in Friedensau with the hope of a reconciliation. Before the 200 Pastors and the Brethren from the General Conference present at this meeting, its European church leaders G. Dail, L. R. Conradi, H. F. Schuberth, and P. Drinhaus withdrew their statement about military service and apologized for what they had done. The Reformers were informed of this and the next day saw a meeting by the Adventist brethren with the Reform-Adventists. Daniells urged them to return to the Seventh-day Adventist Church, but the Reform- Adventists maintained that the European church leaders had forsaken the truth in their changes during the war and the reconciliation failed.http://www.sidadventist.org/lead/index.php/resources/essent/89-leadership The movement's beliefs largely reflect its distinctive Seventh-day Adventist Church heritage, with some small divergences. TFSDA group of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Russia Leaders of the TFSDA movement were vigorously hunted by the KGB (national security agency) and almost without exception, pastors and leaders of this church spent many years in prison, their children were taken from them and forced into exile. Three prominent leaders of the TFSDA were V. A. Shelkov,Sapiets, Marite \\"V. A. Shelkov and the true and free Adventists of the USSR,\\" Religion, State and Society 8:3 (1980), p.201‚Äì217 and two brothers named Murkin. One of the great accomplishments of the TFSDA was to smuggle out of the Soviet Union documents chronicling their persecution, which became an international embarrassment to the Soviet Union. Key points of doctrine and controversy for the TFSDA were: * They did not allow their children to attend school on Saturday (Sabbath), while many families in the official Seventh-day Adventist Church in the Soviet Union did * They did not allow their young people to serve in the Soviet military * They rejected the requirement for pastors and religious groups to register with the government * They believed that because the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists did not dis-fellowship those who bore arms in World War I, that the General Conference had officially compromised its principles and had joined with \\"Babylon\\" (Revelation 18:1-5; compare Seventh-day Adventist eschatology) * They believed that because the General Conference continued to accept the official Seventh-day Adventist Church in the Soviet Union as legitimate, the General Conference had joined with Babylonian * The group saw itself as a \\"Remnant of the Remnant\\" (see: Adventist remnant belief) The True and Free Seventh-day Adventists continue today in small numbers. The group focuses its outreach on members of the regular Seventh-day Adventist Church and expects to see an imminent return of religious persecution.

It has smooth bark, broadly lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of nine to fifteen, white flowers and cup-shaped, hemispherical or conical fruit. Description Eucalyptus tenuiramis is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth white to grey or yellowish bark. Young plants and coppice regrowth have sessile, egg-shaped leaves that are long, wide and arranged in opposite pairs. Adult leaves are broadly lance- shaped to elliptical, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of nine to fifteen on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval to club-shaped, long and wide with a conical or rounded operculum. Flowering occurs from November to February and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody cup-shaped, hemispherical or conical capsule long and wide with the valves near rim level. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus tenuiramis was first formally described in 1856 by Friedrich Anton Wilhelm Miquel in the journal Nederlandsch Kruidkundig Archief. The specific epithet (tenuiramis) is from the Latin tenui- meaning \\"slender\\" or \\"thin\\" and ramus meaning \\"branch\\". This eucalypt is reported as being an older form of its sister species, E. risdonii. Distribution and habitat Silver peppermint grows in open forest, often in pure stands, on lowlands and hills in south-eastern Tasmania especially in the Derwent River valley, but also on the Freycinet Peninsula and on Flinders Island.

Career=Early career He started his coaching career as youth coach for Virescit Boccaleone (who later merged with Alzano to form Alzano Virescit) in 1991, and then as head coach and technical director of amateur clubs Stezzanese and Verdello. He was appointed head coach of Alzano Virescit in January 1997, and guided the club to a Serie C1/A championship title in 1999, with consequent promotion to Serie B. Alzano's tenure in the Serie B league lasted only a lone season, as his side was relegated in 1999‚Äì2000 and Foscarini himself was sacked later in March 2001 after failing to bring his side back to the top. Foscarini then served as head coach of Serie C2 club Rimini, where he failed to win the promotion playoffs with the Romagna side. Cittadella In 2003, he was appointed youth coach of Cittadella, being then promoted as head coach later in July 2005, after Rolando Maran left to become Brescia's new boss. In 2008, Foscarini guided Cittadella to a second Serie B promotion in the whole club history, after entering the promotion playoffs as outsiders and then defeating Cremonese in the final. He was confirmed for the club's first campaign back to the Italian second division in 2008‚Äì09, in which he managed to save Cittadella from relegation. Cittadella's second Serie B season in 2009‚Äì10 proved to be far more successful, as Citta' found themselves well into the battle for a potentially historical promotion to the top flight, qualifying for the promotion playoff, then lost to Brescia in the semi-finals. In 2010‚Äì11, Cittadella maintained their place in the second division, ending the season in 14th place and ensuring him a one-year contract extension. He left Cittadella by the end of the 2014‚Äì15 season, after failing to save his team from relegation to Lega Pro. Pro Vercelli and Livorno In October 2015, Foscarini returned into management as the new head coach of Serie B strugglers Pro Vercelli, guiding them to safety by the end of the season. Not confirmed by Pro Vercelli, in June 2016 he accepted an offer from Livorno with the goal to bring the recently relegated Lega Pro club back to Serie B. Avellino He was appointed manager of Serie B club Avellino on 3 April 2018. After saving Avellino from relegation by the end of the season, he was not confirmed due to the club's exclusion from the league because of administrative issues. Padova On 6 November 2018, he was named head coach of newly-promoted Serie B club Padova to replace Pierpaolo Bisoli. He was sacked on 28 December 2018 following a series of negative results.

Delacorte Press) Sky of Stone is the third in a trilogy of memoirs by Homer Hickam, Jr. about his hometown of Coalwood, West Virginia, that began with October Sky. In Sky of Stone, Hickam has gone off to college at Virginia Polytechnic Institute. His mother, who is living separated from her husband in Myrtle Beach, contacts him and asks him to return home to Coalwood to help his father. He arrives to find his father, the mine superintendent, is being investigated by the coal company because of a fatal mining accident. After wrecking the family car the young Hickam needs to pay for the repairs, and he takes a job in the coal mine for the summer in a program set up by the United Mine Workers of America for college students. His father, who although he wanted to see his son grow up to be a mining engineer is fervently anti-union, and his mother, who swore her sons would never work in a coal mine, are both against this. He defies the wishes of his parents to take the job. His father in response cuts off his college funds. A female mining engineer (Rita) is in town, as is the standard practice of the parent company sending new engineers to gain experience working in the mine. Due to superstition ingrained in local custom, she is not allowed in the mine unlike the male engineers. She vows to be the first woman in the mine, and tries to get young Hickam to sneak her in one night. They are caught and this fails. Meanwhile, she unveils a plan to replace all the track inside the mine. Two teams will work from opposite ends of the mine replacing track, one from Coalwood and the other from Caretta (the two mines adjoin). Homer Hickam, Jr. is one of three people working on the Coalwood team, which is led by a devout Pentecostal Christian (Johnny Basso). The work becomes a race and a contest between the two teams, with the other miners placing bets on whether Coalwood or Caretta will win. As the race goes on over the summer, so does the investigation of Hickam Sr. As the investigation unfolds, more mysteries are revealed, including the identity of a disabled worker still secretly on the coal mine's payroll, and the fate of the Hickam family's pet fox 'Parkyacarcass'. In the end, Hickam Sr. is cleared, the Hickam family is reunited, and Rita is allowed in the mine, but the Coalwood team loses the contest by a hair.

Description and history Comstock's Bridge is located in southeastern East Hampton, near the junction of Comstock Bridge Road and Colchester Avenue (Connecticut Route 16). The bridge consists of two spans: its main span is a Howe truss, long, with a roadbed wide. That span is covered by a gabled roof and sheathed in vertical board siding. Gates at either end of the bridge limit access to pedestrians. A secondary span, in length, connects the bridge to the eastern shore. This span is uncovered; its trusses are sheathed in vertical siding with peaked caps. The bridge abutments are a combination of unmortared rubblestone and cut granite. The bridge was built in 1840. The bridge suffered major damage in the 1920s when a truck crashed through the floor. It underwent major restoration work in the 1930s by a Civilian Conservation Corps crew, which replaced some bridge materials with parts in part recycled from old buildings, and added the gates at either end.

The story ends with Perkins having injured his leg and the narrator meeting a dead friend, Stanley, who tells him that he himself died in the accident. A central theme in this story is loyalty and companionship; the chauffeur, Perkins, offers to take control of the car, which would have allowed the narrator to escape the vehicle. However, the narrator refuses to leave his chauffeur behind and remains in the car until the end, even offering to take the wheel himself and allow Perkins to jump.

Although the prospect of having a child to continue his name and livelihood appeals to the father, the day-to-day realities soon irritate him.

Built in 1915, it is a well-preserved example of period railroad-related architecture. It now serves as a station on the resurrected Connecticut Valley Railroad, which provides excursion steam train trips. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 19, 1994. Description and history The Essex Freight Station is located at the southern end of Railroad Avenue, a spur road off Connecticut Route 154 just west of the limited access highway of Connecticut Route 9. The setting includes the railyard, now used by the heritage Connecticut Valley Railroad, which includes operable early 20th-century equipment including switches and signals. The station is located on the west side of the railyard. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a low-pitch roof that has wide eaves supported by large brackets. Its walls are finished in vertical board siding on the lower part, and clapboards on the upper. The station was built in 1915 by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad along the former Connecticut Valley Railroad line, which had been serving the Connecticut River valley since 1871. The line saw passenger service along at least part of its line until 1933, and freight service until 1961, when the NYNH&H; went bankrupt. A passenger station of similar appearance was originally located nearby, but was demolished. The station and yard were acquired in 1970 by the heritage Connecticut Valley Railroad, a nonprofit organization of railroad aficionados, which has been operating steam-powered excursion trains on portions of the CVR line since 1971.

Description and history The Deep River Town Hall is located near the southern end of the main village of Deep River, located in a triangular plot on the south side of the junction of Connecticut Routes 80 and 154, with a west-bound one-way street immediately to its south. In contrast to other village architecture, it is a three-story brick building, set up against the sidewalk on the main roads. A single bay faces the intersection, housing the main entrance in an arched recess, flanked by sidelight windows and topped by a semicircular transom window. The side elevations are nine bays, divided into groups of three; some of these groups have doors at the center, while others have windows. Upper level windows are organized as pairs of sash windows topped by half-round transom windows. The building's roof has a projecting cornice lined with modillion blocks. The town of Deep River's previous town hall was located adjacent to its post office, which was destroyed by fire in 1891.

Background  D√ºsseldorf-based rapper Farid Bang explained after the release of his debut album Asphalt Massaka, in 2008, that he won't record an album in 2009. As well Kollegah confirmed not to record for his own. Later, many rumors were on the internet saying that both rappers had teamed up to record an album together. Following these rumors, Farid Bang appealed to Kollegah the idea of recording an album. Then both rappers began working on their album, in spite of their statements not to record in 2009.:de:Jung, brutal, gutaussehend#Entstehung, Accessed 2012-02-26 Farid Bang was also featured on the Selfmade Records album Chronik 2 on the track \\"Westdeutschlands Kings\\" with Kollegah and Favorite The finishing process of the album took three months.Interview von Jan Neuhaus f√ºr Selfmade Records (PDF-Dokument) Singer Billy13 was the only guest appearance on the album, that had been involved in the production.

The box features the album, a T-shirt signed by Kollegah and Farid Bang, a poster and a bonus CD with a new song, titled \\"Miami Vice\\".  Reception  In a review by Max Brandl for the E-Zine Laut.de was Jung, brutal, gutaussehend two out of five possible evaluation points and was considered so much worse than Kollegah's previous solo albums Alphagene and Kollegah. Compared to these are his contributions to the album \\"nearly disastrous\\". The instrumentals were all being judged negatively, except for the beats to Schwarzgeld, Mitternacht and Der H√§rteste im Land. Overall, the cooperation of Farid Bang and Kollegah did not work quite well: \\"Not that both would steal the show from each other ‚Äì unfortunately no. Both forfeit their particular strengths.\\" Furthermore, Brandl criticized Kollegah's arrogant talk would abate bored fatigue. As a result of dissing many German rappers such as Samy Deluxe, Farid Bang would irritate and seem embarrassing. Despite all the negative criticism, Kollegah would show in songs like Banger und Boss or Die H√§rtesten im Land that he remains one of the best rappers in Germany and that publishing a solo album in 2010 would more reasonable for both Farid Bang and Kollegah.Laut.de. Jung, brutal, gutaussehend The desk of Rap.de noted that the multifacetedness of Jung, brutal, gutaussehend can also be seen positively because the album would be \\"uncompromising\\" and thus counter the zeitgeist. The tracks Banger und Boss and Sonnenbank Pimps have been emphasized positively due to the double time skills of both rappers. The tracks Alphamassaka, Flaschen auf die T√ºrsteher and Crime Time as well as the contribution of Billy13, whose voice did not fit into the context of the album were evaluated negatively by the editors. Farid Bang would sound like Kollegah most intensive, regarding to his flow and lyrical comparisons. Kollegah would rap entertaining and well-made verses but still, they can not reach the high level of his previous albums.Rap.de. ‚ÄûJung, brutal, gutaussehend\\" The hip-hop magazine Backspin rated three out of five possible rating points to the album. The two rappers would fulfill the low expectations that came up before the release due to the low thematic variety. Although there is not much substance, Farid Bang and Kollegah still \\"entertain on a high level\\". Backspin ascribes this to the humorous lyrical comparisons. According to the opinion of Backspin the tracks Gangbanger, Die H√§rtesten im Land and Jung, brutal, gutaussehend are the best tracks of the album. Finally, they have stated that the audience should not take the album tracks too seriously.backspin.: Criticism of hip-hop magazine] Juice (2009) The album received positive feedback from the magazine Juice. The album would unite \\"the best of both ganglands.\\" Especially Kollegah's verse in Gangbanger was praised that its lyric would be so technically advanced, as it is almost never in German rap. However, what turns out more negative are the opinions on Farid Bang's double-time verse, the contribution of Billy13 and the less variety of composition.

Wall Street is the home of the country's two largest stock exchanges, and \\"Wall Street\\" is a metonym for the American financial sector. Major Wall Street reform bills include the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, the Glass- Steagall Act of 1933, the Truth in Lending Act of 1968, the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, the Gramm‚ÄìLeach‚ÄìBliley Act of 1999, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The most recent Wall Street reform bill, the Dodd‚ÄìFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, was signed by President of the United States Barack Obama on July 22, 2010, following a global financial crisis.  The Glass-Steagall Act of 1933  The Glass- Steagall Act of 1933 placed a \\"wall of separation\\" between banks and brokerages, which was largely repealed by the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999. The bill was enacted during the Great Depression, which began with the Wall Street Crash of 1929. The Gramm‚ÄìLeach‚ÄìBliley Act of 1999 repealed the \\"wall of separation,\\" allowing companies to simultaneously act as commercial banks, investment banks, and insurance companies. Though some commentators regard the restoration of the 1933 bill as crucial, even calling it \\"the most vital element of Wall Street reform\\", House Democratic leaders refused to allow an amendment by Rep. Maurice Hinchey (D-NY) to restore Glass- Steagall as part of the 2009 Frank bill. Hinchey introduced his proposal as a separate bill, the Glass-Steagall Restoration Act of 2009. Nonetheless, the \\"Volcker rule\\" proposed by the Obama administration has been described as a \\"new Glass-Steagall Act for the 21st century\\", as it establishes stringent rules against banks using their own money to make risky investments.  Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, by Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD) and Rep. Michael G. Oxley (R-OH), was signed into law by George W. Bush in July 2002. The bill was enacted as a reaction to a number of major corporate and accounting scandals including those affecting Enron and WorldCom.  Dodd-Frank (2010) As of May 2010, both the House and Senate bills had been passed, but the differences between the bills were to be worked out in United States congressional conference committee. Differences which must be resolved include:Indiviglio D. (2010). The Conference Challenges Congress Faces for Financial Reform. The Atlantic. whether the new consumer protection agency would be independent (Senate) or part of the Federal Reserve; whether to require banks to issue credit derivatives in separately capitalized affiliates (Senate); how exactly the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) will wind down or bail out large institutions which fail; the circumstances under which large institutions could be broken up; a 15 to 1 leverage limit in the House bill; the terms of a Fed audit (continuous as in the House bill or one-time as in the Senate bill); both bills include the Volcker rule which prohibits proprietary trading by bank holding companies, but both have a caveat which allow for regulators to overrule the rule; both bills propose to regulate credit rating agencies, but the Senate's bill is much stronger.  House bill  H.R. 4173, the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2009 by Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA), passed by the House of Representatives in December 2009, and awaiting action by the Senate as of April 2010.  Senate bill  S.3217 was introduced by Senate Banking Committee chairman Chris Dodd (D-CT) on April 15, 2010. Dodd's bill included a $50 billion liquidation fund which drew criticism as a continuing bailout, which he was pressured to remove by Republicans and the Obama administration. The Senate bill passed on May 20, 2010.  Volcker Rule  The \\"Volcker Rule\\" was proposed by President Barack Obama based on advice by Paul Volcker, and a draft of the proposed legislation was prepared by the U.S. Treasury Department. It limited any one bank from holding more than 10% of FDIC-insured deposits, and prohibited any bank with a division holding such deposits from using its own capital to make speculative investments. The Volcker rule faced heavy resistance in the Senate and was introduced as part of the subsequent Dodd bill only in a limited form.  Financial Stability Oversight Council  Chaired by the United States Secretary of the Treasury, a new multi- authority oversight body called the Financial Stability Oversight Council of regulators will be established. The council will consist of nine members including regulators from the Federal Reserve System, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Federal Housing Finance Agency, and many other agencies. The main purpose of the council is to identify risk in the Financial system. Also, the council will look at the interconnectivity of the highly leveraged financial firms and can ask companies to divest holdings if their structure poses a great threat to the Financial system. The council will have a solid control on the operations of the leveraged firms and also help in increasing the transparency.  Wall Street Reform Plan (2016) for a new 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act  In 2016, 170 Economists, Financial Experts, and Academics Back Bernie Sanders' Wall Street Reform Plan. In the letter supporting Bernie Sander's Financial Reform Plan , Economists and Financial Experts in Favor of Sen. Sanders' Wall St. Reforms \\"In our view, Sen. Bernie Sanders' plan for comprehensive financial reform is critical for avoiding another \\"too-big-to-fail\\" financial crisis. The Senator is correct that the biggest banks must be broken up and that a new 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act, separating investment from commercial banking, must be enacted. Wall Street's largest banks are now far bigger than they were before the crisis, and they still have every incentive to take excessive risks. No major Wall Street executive has been indicted for the fraudulent behavior that led up to the 2008 crash, and fines imposed on the banks have been only a fraction of the banks' potential gains. In addition, the banks and their lobbyists have succeeded in watering down the Dodd-Frank reform legislation, and the financial institutions that pose the greatest risk to our economy have still not devised sufficient \\"living wills\\" for winding down their operations in the event of another crisis. Secretary Hillary Clinton's more modest proposals do not go far enough. They call for a bit more oversight and a few new charges on shadow banking activity, but they leave intact the titanic financial conglomerates that practice most shadow banking. As a result, her plan does not adequately reduce the serious risks our financial system poses to the American economy and to individual Americans. Given the size and political power of Wall Street, her proposals would only invite more dilution and finagle. The only way to contain Wall Street's excesses is with reforms sufficiently bold and public they can't be watered down. That's why we support Senator Sanders' plans for busting up the biggest banks and resurrecting a modernized version of Glass Steagall.\\"''  See also  * Monetary reform  References  Category:United States federal banking legislation Category:Reform ","title":"Wall Street reform"},{"id":"26989301","text":"Macropis is a genus of bees. Description Macropis species are of moderate size, not exceeding 15 mm. They have a livery predominantly black; males are characterized by conspicuous yellow markings on the head, but the females show morphological adaptations related to their foraging habits of flower oils, posterior tibiae with very developed, covered with a dense velvety hairs. Unlike most Melittidae, the wing has only two submarginal cells. Biology They are solitary bees that dig their nests in the ground. Most species are oligolectic and feed on pollen and floral oils of Lysimachia spp. They make a single generation per year. The males emerge from the ground in spring, just before the females, and await the females in the vicinity of the flowers of the host plant. After mating, the females dig a nest in the ground, ending with one or two rooms in which is collected the pollen, which is placed on the egg. The larvae, feeding on the pollen, develop rapidly, and within 10 days turn into pupae, spending the winter in this stage. Macropis nests are often parasitized by bee cleptoparasites such as Epeoloides.Bogusch P. Biology of the Bee Cleptoparasitic Epeoloides coecutiens (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Osirini) .

A Subject Matter Expert (SME) Committee, representing a diversity of practice, experience, geographic regions, and education was appointed to provide content expertise, and charged with determining Job/Task Analysis(JTA) of a professional organizer. From a comprehensive search of the relevant literature, SMT developed an exhaustive list of knowledge and skill elements required for competent practice, and presented it to the JTA Committee for review and approval. An online survey instrument was developed that combined a demographic questionnaire with measurements of the importance of each knowledge and skill element that had been identified. Statistical analysis of survey results from more than 3,000 professional organizers was used to differentiate important from unimportant elements of professional organizing practice. SMT then translated the JTA-approved list of knowledge and skill elements into an examination content outline. One committee was charged with identifying reference material to support the content outline, and another with writing legally defensible questions that could be associated with specific references. Finally a Program Definition Team (PDT) set eligibility criteria and related policies. The PDT determined that, based on characteristics of the professional organizing industry, the largest component of eligibility criteria would be interaction with clients. Future plans According to the BCPO web site, the organization's intention is that the CPO credential eventually be recognized by ANSI or a similar authority.

Latvia has already lost EUR 12.2 million (LVL 8.54 million) of EU funds due to hesitation over the Rail Baltica project, and the EU Transport Commissioner has stated there is no chance that the EU will contribute funds to the proposed Moscow link despite Augulis' assertion that the EU could contribute up to 85%.

Established in 1863 and significantly enlarged in 1914, it was one of the principal sites of ivory processing in Connecticut, production combs, buttons, and piano keys. The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 30, 1984. It has been converted to residences. Description and history The former Pratt, Read factory consists of two clusters of mainly brick buildings lining the Deep River north of the town center, west of Main Street and bounded on the north by Spring Street and on the south by Bridge Street. The main building of the complex is set close to Main Street, rising five stories, with an architecturally elaborate entry tower near its center. Wings extend from this building toward the river. The second complex stands across the river, and is dominated by a four-story concrete building. The eastern half of the complex was developed by the Pratt-Read Company beginning in 1863, although no buildings survive that predate 1881. George Read first began processing ivory in this area in 1809, which were taken over by Pratt, Read in 1863. The older buildings were all destroyed by fire in 1881, with the present main structure built immediately after the fire. These facilities were used to process ivory, notably for combs, buttons, and piano keys, and eventually entire piano keyboard actions. In 1914 the company expanded on the western bank of the river, developing the complex that stands off Bridge Street. It was one of the works of a pioneer of the use of reinforced concrete in factory construction, Ernest J. Ransome.

The rail facilities are built partly on the archaeological remains of Fort Saybrook, the main fortification of the 17th- century Saybrook Colony, and are the only surviving remnant of what was once a large facility, with an icehouse, coal bin, steamboat dock, depot, and signal tower. Archaeological remains of these other facilities are believed to lie under other parts of the park and adjacent properties. The exposed facilities were excavated in 1981-2. Both structures were added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 28, 1994. The Connecticut Valley Railroad was chartered in 1868, and began operations three years later, providing service between Saybrook Point and Hartford, with a connection to the Shore Line Railway at the Saybrook Junction station. The extension to Saybrook Point ceased operations in 1922, and its facilities were abandoned. The roundhouse was a quarter-round structure housing six bays, with foundations of brick and stone, supporting both the structure and the tracks on which the railroad cars ran. The turntable had a concrete base. Portions of these features are exposed in the park, with interpretive signage explaining the use and history of the site.

Even though cancer should be far behind him, Jeff still worries that it will return. He has got normal teen stuff to deal with, too - friends, parents, girls, school. Normally, he would ask his older brother, Steven, for advice. But Steven, always the trusty, responsible one, is finally rebelling and has taken off to Africa to join a drumming circle and \\"find himself.\\" Jeff feels abandoned. Meanwhile, his best friend, Tad, is hatching some kind of secretive, crazy plan involving eighth-grade graduation. He gets a letter in the mail that says he must pass the test or else he'll get held back. And Lindsey Abraham, away from a hot girl who is new to the school, thinks Jeff is cute . . . which totally freaks him out and they become close friends. There is a lot about life that cancer has prepared Jeff, but there is a lot that is brand-new. Now it is time for him to learn not only how to fight for himself but to stick up for the people he loves. However, in the end, he has to prepare to let go of some of his memories and accept the meaning of death. Jeff has brain damage and cannot remember intricate things such as math rules, and the state just passed a law that every eighth-grader has to take a standardized end-of-grade test and pass in order to be able to graduate. His friend Thaddeus (Tad) needs a wheelchair to move, so Jeff and Tad make a deal, which was letting Tad tutor Jeff, while Tad exercises to be able to walk across the stage at graduation. The year passes, and Tad has cancer again. Tad will be unable to be at the school during graduation because he will be in the hospital. Jeff reacts by hosting a bike-a-thon to make Tad feel cared about. The bike-a-thon starts out smoothly, but when it ended, Jeff's mother tells him that right after he started riding, Tad went into sudden liver failure, and died soon after. The story ends with Jeff passing the tests, at graduation, and accepting both his and Tad's diplomas. In the epilogue, he is at Tad's headstone, having a \\"conversation\\" with him.

The Security Council once again reiterated its commitment to the holding of a referendum on self-determination for the people of Western Sahara as accepted by both Morocco and the Polisario Front.

The mastaba is in a chain of three mastabas, north of the king's pyramid. It is closest to the pyramid.

It is Volume One of the Nomad Series. The album's name translates in Chinese as \\"People's Park\\".  Album development  In late 2008, Michael Timmins got an opportunity to live in China for three months with his wife and three children. Two of his children were adopted from China. They stayed in Jingjiang, a city on the Yangtze that only has about 650,000 people, relatively small and obscure for China. Timmins' wife taught English at the elementary/middle school they were staying at, his kids attended a few classes, and Timmins explored the town, and the whole family travelled when his wife's teaching schedule allowed. They visited the birth village of each of his Chinese born adopted daughters. The music that inspired Michael Timmins the most during the visit was found at Renmin Park, where a variety musicians would gather throughout the day, bringing their erhus, pipas, shangxians and various percussion instruments, and a mix of singers would perform. Timmins found most of the musicians to be great, most but not all singers were not as great, but all performed with passion. About half way through their visit, Timmins was introduced to Eric Chen, who was passionate about music, and had taught himself English by watching American movies. Chen told Timmins that he was \\"not only the only person in Jingjiang who had ever heard the music of Radiohead, but the only person who had ever even heard the name Radiohead\\". The two became friends and spent time together. Chen brought Timmins a variety of CDs and videos that showcased the Chinese rock scene, such as He Yong, Dou Wei, The Tang Dynasty, Xu Wei, and Zuoxiao Zuzhou (ZXZZ), plus others. The two which appealed to Timmins the most were Xu Wei (Cure-meets-Steve Earl pop) and ZXZZ (Leonard Cohen meets Nick Cave by way of Tom Waits). When the Cowboy Junkies were making Renmin Park, they decided to cover a song by those two, with lyrics translated by Chen. The Junkies also asked ZXZZ to contribute an original lyric and vocal performance for a track on the album, \\"A Walk in the Park\\". Another inspiration that struck Timmins was the sounds of the community, which was loud, unrelenting, and had textures that were foreign to Timmins' Western ears. He had Peter Timmins send him a high-end portable recorder, which he carried everywhere he went, and recorded music, conversations, exercise classes, badminton games, traffic, students chatter in classrooms, street hawkers, and more. He sent the recordings to Joby Baker in British Columbia with instructions to create loops of the sounds, just use his imagination. Alan Anton, who also lives in British Columbia, got involved in the looping exercise, and the two built music structures which used some of Michael Timmins' community noise recordings as the foundation. Baker sent the recordings back to Timmins in Toronto, where Michael and Peter Timmins worked on the sounds in their studio, removing some elements and adding some of their own elements. Once the basic structure was complete, Michael Timmins wrote out melodies and lyrics, which Margo then came in and transformed into Cowboy Junkies songs. The core story the album is built around is a fictional love story about two people who live in two different worlds that always keeps them apart. Renmin Park is a reflection of Michael Timmins family's adventure in China. It is also a thank-you letter to the people of the city that opened up their arms to his family. The album is the first of four albums to be released in the Nomad series. The overarching theme of the series is just to produce four albums in eighteen months, which forces a creativity on the artists. There is no real theme connecting the albums, but according to Michael Timmins \\"just by the very nature of doing that many songs, that much writing, and doing that much recording in such a short time, there's going to be something that connects them.\\" The title of the series comes from the four paintings that are the covers of the four albums. The paintings are done by a friend of the Junkies, by Enrique Martinez Celaya, and he named his series of paintings the Nomad paintings. The Cowboy Junkies found the name appropriate, since they are a band that has been on the road for 30 years, and the first volume is about Michael Timmins' visit to China, and the second volume, Demons, is about Vic Chesnutt, who was so much a nomad. The series title just rang true for the group.

It was released on November 21, 2007 by Victor Entertainment. Currently, \\"Tamagotchi\\" is the only single in which Kigurumi performs songs as a trio, and was the last single that Rena participated in with Kigurumi. Background After performing \\"Hottottotto na Mainichi\\" in Kigurumichiko, Kigurumi, who had only one member at the time (Rena), was given the opportunity to sing the opening theme to Tamagotchi: The Movie. However, the song required a trio. Auditions for the band were held, and on November 7, two new members, eleven-year-old Miki and seven-year-old Kei, were added to the band. The song was released with two different albums, and was slightly edited and used for the intro of \\"Tamagotchi: The Movie\\". Another version, \\"Tamagotchi: Happy Version\\", was released for use in the second Tamagotchi movie, using only Miki and Kei as singers. Music video A scene from the official music video. A music video was released for the Japanese version only. In it, Rena, Miki, and Kei dance and sing to the song in a white room in which constantly morphing white shapes bounce around them. Occasionally, they will sit on white inflatable balls, appear on TVs, or watch a scene from the movie. Their outfits consist of short-sleeve, button up, knee-length dresses with white, puffed-out collars and sleeves, white boots with fringes matching the color of their dresses, and headwear that resembles characters from the movie; Rena stands in the middle and wears a yellow dress and a hat shaped like Mametchi's head, Miki stands to her left while wearing a green dress and a hat shaped like Kuchipatchi's head, and Kei stands to Rena's right while wearing an orange dress and a hat shaped like Memetchi's body. Additionally, a flash video of Mametchi dancing to \\"Rena's Version\\" of the song was released on the official site and on the press-release version of the CD. In Other Languages=English An English version of the song was written by Stephanie Sheh for the English-language release of \\"Tamagotchi: The Movie\\". The song differs slightly from the Japanese version; one noticeable difference is at the beginning of the second verse. In the Japanese version, two full lines are sung by the first singer (Rena) and the next two by the second (Miki). In the English version, the first singer sings the first line and part of the second, but the last part of the second line is sung by the second singer. Another difference is that the second and fourth lines of the Japanese version of the song end in \\"ƒ´ desh≈ç\\", which roughly translates as \\"it's great\\". The first part of the first verse and its translation is as follows in Japanese: :Minna issho :Issho wa ƒ´ desh≈ç :Onaji jinsei :Ikiteru ƒ´ desh≈ç Which can translate into: :We're all together :Being together is great :We live together :On the same Earth, and it's great However, the English version goes as follows: :Everyone come :Come and join us, take my hand :Where we can share life :Share it with you, hand in hand This version was not released on any CD. French A French version of the song was written for the French release of Tamagotchi: Happiest Story in the Universe!. This version has lyrics that bear more resemblance to the original Japanese version, and is based on \\"Tamagotchi: Happy Version\\", but also has some noticeable differences. One difference is that at the end of the fourth line in each verse, the Japanese singers (who were Miki and Kei for the second movie's version) stay on the same note for the last word of the line. However, in the French version, the singers begin on the same note, but then drop down two notes in an arpeggio. Another difference is that the last line of each verse is held out a shorter time than in the English or Japanese versions. The first French verse, which translates almost exactly as the Japanese one does, goes as follows: :On et tous ensem :Ensemble, c'est g√©nial :La vie tous ensem :Ensemble, c'est g√©nial Again, this wasn't released on CD.

Description and history The New Haven County Courthouse is located in downtown New Haven, facing the New Haven Green from the northwest corner of Elm and Church Streets, It is a three-story stone structure, finished in white Vermont marble. Its principal mass is basically rectangular, with projecting sections of differing depths on each side. The two street-facing projections house its main entrances, which are fronted by Ionic porticos. A central section rises a full extra story to provide additional height to the central atrium. The interior is finished in richly ornamented finishes of marble, mahogany, brass, and plaster. Some doors have heavy brass knobs bearing the county seal. and The courthouse was designed by William H. Allen and Richard Williams. Their Beaux Arts architecture design won a design competition over submissions from several well-known architects, and contributed to the city's adoption of the City Beautiful movement to improve its public spaces and facilities. The building was under threat of demolition in 1956. The building's exterior underwent a $10.5 million renovation project, with work beginning in January 2013.Mary E.

Founded in 1992, it was influential as the first such \\"pure PK\\" MUD, and has met with positive critical response. Game characteristics A screenshot from Genocide showing the War Complex Genocide's gameplay is based around \\"wars\\", sessions of PvP conflict, that restart at frequent intervals. Character development as it is normally known on MUDs is completely absent, with the only advantages that experienced players have consisting of knowledge of the game structure. Genocide's setting is the \\"Island of Genocide\\", which is subdivided into domains and, within domains, areas. The world is vaguely medieval fantasy in theme, with a tremendous variety of character options available within that context. Player character death on Genocide inflicts no lasting harm. However, kill and death statistics are tracked, and the kill-to- death ratio is the main way in which relative social status of players is measured. The social atmosphere on Genocide, not atypically of a highly competitive gaming environment, is noted as hostile and replete with crass language. Technical infrastructure In 1992, Genocide served as a crucial development testbed for the MudOS LPMud driver., though in 1994, Genocide abandoned the MudOS driver and was ported to the main LPMud branch, citing speed concerns. Genocide uses a game driver derived from the LPMud 3.2.1 server software, also known as the Amylaar driver. Its mudlib is homegrown. Influence Genocide's ideas influenced a number of MUDs that emulated its pure player-versus-player orientation.

Biography Gold coin of Byzantine emperor Constantine VI (r. 780‚Äì797), depicting him and his mother and co-regent, Irene. Mosele supported Constantine against Irene in 790, but was imprisoned and blinded when she returned to power in 792. Alexios is the first known member of the Mosele/Mousele family of Armenian origin.. In 790, he was the commander of the Vigla guard regiment, being the first known occupant of the office. In September of that year, he was sent by the Empress- regent Irene of Athens (r. 797‚Äì802) to deal with the soldiers of the Armeniac Theme, who had refused to swear an oath of loyalty which placed her before her son, Emperor Constantine VI (r. 780‚Äì797). The Armeniacs, however, imprisoned their own general Nikephoros, declared Mosele their new commander, and acclaimed Constantine as the sole emperor. At the news of this, the other themes of Asia Minor followed suit in deposing their commanders and affirming Constantine as sole emperor.... The thematic troops then assembled in Bithynia, where they demanded from Irene to release Constantine from his de facto house arrest. Bowing to the pressure from the troops, Irene released her son. Emperor Constantine shortly after assumed the reins of government, dismissing Irene's counselors and confining her to a palace in Constantinople.. Mosele was confirmed as the Armeniacs' commander by Constantine, and later summoned to Constantinople and raised to the rank of patrikios. Constantine, however, soon proved incapable to rule the empire effectively, and the military successes, which the soldiers who supported him had hoped for, did not materialize. In January 792, moreover, he recalled his mother from her banishment, restored her to her titles and position of co- ruler, and demanded from the army to acclaim her along with him. The Armeniacs once again refused to comply, and demanded the return of Mosele from Constantinople. Despite having guaranteed his personal safety, Constantine, who suspected him of designs on the throne, had him flogged, tonsured, and imprisoned... This was followed soon after by the disastrous defeat of the Byzantine army, led by the emperor himself, at the Battle of Marcellae against the Bulgars. As the imperial army grumbled and even the usually loyal tagmata plotted to replace him, Constantine, on the advice of his mother and her eunuch adviser Staurakios, had Mosele blinded. Constantine's uncle, Nikephoros, whom the tagmatic soldiers planned to make emperor, was also blinded, while four other uncles had their tongues cut.. At the news of this, the Armeniacs rose in open rebellion. They defeated a loyalist army in November, and were defeated only in May 793 by an expedition under Constantine himself..

The carousel was built about 1905, and is one of a shrinking number of early 20th-century carousels left in the state, featuring the carvings of Charles Looff and Charles Carmel. The carousel and its 1916 building were together listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 15, 1983. Description and history The Lighthouse Point Carousel is located in New Haven's Lighthouse Point Park, near the southeastern top of the city on Long Island Sound. It is located in a rectangular building, about inland from the Five Mile Point Light which gives the park its name. The building is about in size, with a high-ceilinged square section housing the carousel, and a lower-roofed extension that houses concessions. The building has Renaissance Revival styling, with tall window bays articulated by pilasters, and round-arch window bays surrounding the carousel section. The roof above the carousel is topped by a monitor with clerestory windows. and The carousel itself is a platform style device, about in diameter. It includes 70 figures and two chariots, some of the figures mounted on fixed metal columns, and some on columns that rise and fall with the carousel's motion. The figures appear to have originated from different sources, including figures carved in a diversity of styles. Some of them have been attributed to Charles Carmel of Brooklyn and others to Charles Looff. A figure of George Washington can be seen directing the carousel with a baton. The mechanism that drives the carousel is located at the center, with a decorative fiberglass surround. The carousel was constructed about 1905 by Timothy Murphy. Murphy is known to have \\"reworked\\" materials from other carousels, and is believed to have hired Carmel to make some alterations to the figures here. The present building was erected in 1916 by Thomas Shanley, the proprietor who developed Lighthouse Point Park as a trolley park. The park was purchased by the city in 1925, which reduced the number of attractions, but continued to operate the carousel for many years. All of the other park buildings were demolished in 1957, but the carousel was retained, its figures placed in storage. It has since been restored to operation.

Torney was dating Inez Milholland, the noted suffragette who was then a law student at New York University, and had attended the protest with her.

Personal He received a bachelor's degree in History and Literature from St. Mary's University (1988), a master's degree in Creative Writing from Ohio State University (1989), and a PhD in American Literature from Stanford University (1997). He teaches American Literature, Chicano Studies, and Creative Writing at the Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. Novels Crossing Plot Summary: Luis Lomos, a sixteen-year-old boy from a small Mexican town, undertakes the journey to the United States. Trapped in a railroad car with twelve other undocumented workers, he meets an old man named Berto Morales who has a terrible secret that he feels he must confess before he dies. The short trip becomes interminable as the men slowly suffocate to death. The tale is based on a true event. Drift Plot Summary: Robert Lomos, a troubled young man, decides to run away from his grandmother's care in San Antonio, Texas, to find his estranged mother who has left for Los Angeles. His plan is to convince her that he will assume the responsibilities of a \\"man\\" and that he will care for her and his infant brother. Day of the Dead Plot Summary: A prequel to Crossing. Berto Morales, a major character in Martinez's first novel, narrates the year he spends searching for the murderer of his pregnant wife during the Mexican Revolution. The novel begins in 1912 on the Day of the Dead and ends on the same date in 1913. Bent on revenge, Berto finds that what he most wants is a form of redemption. He gets that opportunity when he meets Isabella, a young widow with a daughter in need of protection during the uptick in violence that follows the assassination of President Francisco Madero in 1912. Los Duros Plot summary: Two young men living in a California shantytown must deal with the effects of a double murder. Critical Work Countering the Counterculture: Rereading Postwar American Dissent from Jack Kerouac to Tomas Rivera Martinez explores the theme of \\"movement\\" and \\"mobility\\" in defining the American counterculture. He argues that Mexican and Chicano migrant writers practice a form of dissent that emphasizes the role of forced movement that underscores the limitations of democratic discourse. His central critique of the \\"American counterculture\\" centers on the work of several Beat writers whom Martinez claims ignore the political limits of individualism thus subverting their own social criticism of American corporatism and conformity.

The firehouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 17, 1994. It has been converted to offices. Description and history The Charter Oak Firehouse is located in downtown Meriden, at the northwest corner of Hanover and Butler Streets. It is a two-story masonry structure, built with load-bearing brick walls featuring Romanesque styling, and it is covered by a gabled roof. Its most prominent feature is a square tower, set at near the left front, which is four stories in height. It was originally covered by an open wood-frame belfry, but is now covered by a flat roof. It has rounded-arch window openings near the top. A single equipment bay faces Butler Street, with glazed double-leaf wooden doors set in a segmented-arch opening. A pedestrian entrance is located between it and the tower. Additions extend the building to the west and south. The firehouse was built in 1876, and originally housed a pumper that was pulled by manpower. It was built by James Kane, a local bricklayer noted for the speed at which he worked. When the city acquired a horse-drawn steam pumper in the 1890s, the building was extended to the rear to house not only the new machine, but stabling for the horses. The building remained in use as a fire station until 1979, and was then adapted to house a state motor vehicle office. In 1992 it was converted to commercial office space.

The screenplay involves a boy who is traumatized after seeing his mother being terrorized by thugs. Plot Upon seeing his mother Linda terrorized by three thugs, young Petey (Jerry Mathers) is traumatized and wanders off. Truck drivers find him and the boy is taken to police headquarters, where he is recognized as the son of detective Tony Atlas (Philip Carey). Petey is in shock and cannot even recognize his dad, much less explain what happened. Three young men - Joey (Gerald Sarracini), Gil (Corey Allen), and Jess (John Drew Barrymore) - are holding Linda Atlas hostage in the home of a man named Canfield (Watson Downs), for whom she had been working freelance as a stenographer. In the course of robbery, Canfield has been killed and the three are now arguing incessantly about whether to also kill Linda; they think she is the only eyewitness and do not believe her when she tells them she has a son and is worried about where he has gone. At one point, Canfield's niece and her husband come looking for him, because he had missed his regular dinner date at their home. When the couple sees Linda's car, they assume the man is entertaining a woman; they leave. Gil slips away to retrieve a gun from his mother's and stepfather's apartment. Tony and the police, in the meantime, have had some investigative success and arrive at the apartment while Gil is there. The young man runs, exchanges gunfire with Tony and is ultimately killed. Tony finds Linda's wallet in Gil's pocket. Eventually, the truckers are located and are able to provide an idea of the general vicinity where they found the boy. The police take Petey to this area and he recognizes a tractor; on the ground they find one of his toy cowboy guns. Tony's men surround the house and, when they enter, they find Canfield's body and discover that Joey, too, is dead. Jess had located a gun upstairs in the home and the two had struggled for it. Jess holds Linda at gunpoint, but Tony manages to disarm him. At the sight of his mother, Petey emerges from his state of shock.

Lisbeth Longfrock (Sidsel Sids√¶rk og andre kj√¶rringemner ) is a classical work of Norwegian literature, by the author Hans Aanrud, published in 1903. It was translated into English in 1907 by Laura E. Poulsson, and illustrated by Norwegian artist Othar Holmboe. Aanrud's classic novel was translated again in 1935, under the title Sidsel Longskirt: A Girl of Norway. Illustrated by the famed artists Ingri and Edgar Parin d'Aulaire, this later translation was produced by The John C. Winston Company of Philadelphia. Plot The story follows its title heroine, from childhood to confirmation. After her mother's death, Lisbeth (given the nickname Longskirt, or Sids√¶rk in the original Norwegian, because of her overlong skirt, a Christmas present given her by her brother) as she moves from her original home at New Ridge farm (called \\"Peerout Castle\\" for its fine view of the valley), to Hoel farm, one of the central farms of the area. Her brother, Jacob, also goes to Nordrum farm to become a herdsman there. At Hoel, Lisbeth is cared for by Kjersti Hoel, the farm's owner, who has made a promise to Lisbeth's mother before she died. Lisbeth works with livestock both at the farm, and at the seter (s√¶ter in the book's transliteration), a mountain pasture used during the summertime. At the seter, Lisbeth meets two other herdsmen from neighboring farms, and spends the summer with them, getting to know them as she grows up. The content of the book concerns the difficult conditions of the work of the country children who had to eke out a poor existence far away from their parents. In spite of this account of their hard lot an optimistic kind of portrayal is predominant. Style The story, as is the case for most of Aanrud's tales, depicts an Eastern Norwegian environment, similar to the author's homeland in Gausdal. In its original publication, the book utilized local dialects, an effect lost in translation to English. Aanrud writes in omniscient third-person perspective, and depicts a rural community with the \\"harmonic realism\\"The expression was used by the Swedish literary scholar Peter Hallberg (1963), quoted by Birkeland, Vold, Risa, Norges barnelitteraturhistorie, 2nd. ed., 2005. In his stories, farmers show a patriarchal care and kindness, and poor children get the space and opportunity to develop. The author emphasizes the depiction of nature, tradition on the farm and the healthy characteristics such as job satisfaction and sense of duty. An undercurrent of sensitivity appears in the chapter where Lisbeth and her brother meet a year after her mother's death. Aanrud gained fame by his realistic and folksy descriptions of the rural life of his home valley before the industrial age. The way of thinking of the ordinary peasants is presented in partly dialect dialogues and in their simple and friendly mode of expression. The landscape is atmospherically described and most parts of the stories are humorous; there are sometimes also tragic features. The characters, plot and description of the landscape always form an integrated whole. Often children are the protagonists of Aanrud's stories, which therefore became popular children‚Äôs books. But Aanrud himself had intended his tales for older readers. A street in Oslo, Sidsel Sids√¶rks vei, bears the name of this well-known book.

It is a volatile, yellow liquid that forms a colorless vapor and has an intolerable odor. The compound readily decomposes upon melt and in absentia of high CO partial pressures forms Co2(CO)8. Despite operational challenges associated with its handling, the compound has received considerable attention for its ability to function as a catalyst in hydroformylation. In this respect, HCo(CO)4 and related derivatives have received significant academic interest for their ability to mediate a variety of carbonylation (introduction of CO into inorganic compounds) reactions. Structure and properties left HCo(CO)4 adopts trigonal bipyrimidal structure with the equatorial CO ligands slightly bent out of the equatorial plane. The hydride ligand occupies one of the axial positions, thus the symmetry of the molecule is C3v. The Co‚ÄìCO and Co‚ÄìH bond distances were determined by gas-phase electron diffraction to be 1.764 and 1.556 √Ö, respectively. Assuming the presence of a formal hydride ion, the oxidation state of cobalt in this compound is +1. Unlike some other transition-metal hydrides complexes, HCo(CO)4 is highly acidic, with a pKa of 8.5. It readily undergoes substitution by tertiary phosphines and other Lewis- bases. For example, triphenylphosphine gives HCo(CO)3PPh3 and HCo(CO)2(PPh3)2. These derivatives are more stable than HCo(CO)4 and are used industrially to improve catalyst selectivity in hydroformylation. These derivatives are generally less acidic than HCo(CO)4. Preparation Tetracarbonylhydrocobalt was first described by Hieber in the early 1930s. It was the second transition metal hydride to be discovered, after H2Fe(CO)4. It is prepared by reducing Co2(CO)8 with sodium amalgam or a similar reducing agent followed by acidification. :Co2(CO)8 \\\\+ 2 Na ‚Üí 2 NaCo(CO)4 :NaCo(CO)4 \\\\+ H+ ‚Üí HCo(CO)4 \\\\+ Na+ Since HCo(CO)4 decomposes so readily, it is usually generated in situ by hydrogenation of Co2(CO)8. :Co2(CO)8 \\\\+ H2 2 HCo(CO)4 The thermodynamic parameters for the equilibrium reaction were determined by infrared spectroscopy to be ŒîH = 4.054 kcal mol‚àí1, ŒîS = ‚àí3.067 cal mol‚àí1 K‚àí1. Applications Tetracarbonylhydridocobalt was the first transition metal hydride to be used in industry. In 1953 evidence was disclosed that it is the active catalyst for the conversion of alkenes, CO, and H2 to aldehydes, a process known as hydroformylation (oxo reaction). Although the use of cobalt- based hydroformylation has since been largely superseded by rhodium-based catalysts, the world output of C3‚ÄìC18 aldehydes produced by tetracarbonylhydrocobalt catalysis is about 100,000 tons/year, roughly 2% of the total.

The preamble of the resolution expressed dissatisfaction over international terrorism which resulted in innocent deaths, the deterioration of international relations and put the security of countries at risk. There was a need to strengthen international co-operation in adopting measures to prevent, combat and eliminate all forms of terrorism. The Council noted OAU's earlier considering the attack as aimed not only at Mobarak, but at the sovereignty of Ethiopia, and at Africa as a whole. It was regretting that Sudan had not complied with OAU requests to extradite suspects. The Security Council condemned the assassination attempt and deplored the violation of Ethiopia's sovereignty and the attempt to disturb the peace and security in that country and the region as a whole. The efforts of Ethiopia to resolve the issue bilaterally and regionally was welcomed, while Sudan was called upon to extradite the 3 suspects to Ethiopia in accordance with the 1964 Extradition Treaty between both countries, and not to support forms of terrorism or shelter terrorist suspects. The international community were urged to encourage Sudan respond positively to the OAU's requests, while the Secretary- General Boutros Boutros-Ghali was requested to report on the situation within 60 days to the Council.

Description and history A 1912 postcard of the station Forestville station is located in the heart of Forestville village, on the west side of Central Street, between the former railroad right-of-way it served and the Pequabuck River. It is a small single-story wood frame structure, with a bracketed cornice and a hipped roof topped by a louvered cupola with finial. A platform shelter extends east from the station, supported by square posts with angle brackets. The building originally had a two-story tower, which was lost to fire in 1900. Its footprint is now occupied by a slightly projecting section that historically acted as a vestibule. The station was built in 1881 by the New York and New England Railroad on a railroad line originally owned by the Hartford, Providence and Fishkill Railroad. Local lore says that the building was prefabricated and delivered to the site by the railroad. If this method was used, it was the only instance in which the railroad employed this construction method. The station was served at the outset by 13 trains per day, greatly enhancing the village's economic prosperity. Service to the station was discontinued in 1960.

A new commuter rail station named Newington, to be located adjacent to the bus station, is also planned as later phase of the CTrail Hartford Line. The construction of the commuter rail platforms at Newington Junction is not currently funded, but it, along with the other infill stations, are planned to be completed by 2022. The bus station and surrounding neighborhood are named for the NRHP listed Newington Junction Railroad Depot building and freight house, built on the site in the 1890s to replace an 1850s station. Passenger rail service lasted until approximately 1959. The CTfastrak busway follows the previously rail banked right-of-way for the NY&NE; Newington Secondary branch that joined the New Haven‚ÄìSpringfield mainline at the eponymous rail junction. History=Railroad service 1916 valuation image of the 1890-built NYNH&H; station The 1891-built NY&NE; station building in 2014, shortly after it was moved and restored during the busway project The Hartford and New Haven Railroad opened through Newington in 1839, but the railroad did not immediately establish a station there. The Hartford, Providence and Fishkill Railroad opened in 1850; it shared the H&NH; right of way north of Newington, but diverged to the south and ran to New Britain. The H&NH; then moved its New Britain station, built two years before, to serve as Newington station for both railroads. For four decades the two railroads shared the station; by 1872, the Boston, Hartford and Erie Railroad (the 1863 successor to the HP&F;) paid the H&NH; $100 per year to share it. Later in 1872 the H&NH; was merged into the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, and the next year the BH&E; became part of the New York and New England Railroad. The depot was served for years by a single agent, John C. Sternberg, who sold tickets, handled freight and Adams Express packages, and threw switches to direct trains at the junction. From 1865 it was the site of church services, the beginnings of what in 1875 became nearby Grace Episcopal Church. The development of Newington Junction as a result of the railroad was instrumental in the separation of the town of Newington from its mother town of Wethersfield. Around 1890, the two railroads decided to build separate stations to serve growing numbers of riders. The NYNH&H; built a depot and freight house on the east side of the right of way in 1890; the NY&NE; built a nearly identical depot on the west side in 1891. but could not obtain land for a planned freight house. The NY&NE; was merged into the NYNH&H; in 1898; its depot thenceforth served passengers traveling south towards New Haven and west towards New Britain, while the NYNH&H-built; structure served passengers headed north toward Hartford. Passenger service to New Britain ended in 1959, and Newington closed completely at this time - trains to and from New Haven no longer stopped. The 1890 NYNH&H; station was demolished sometime after the end of service. The remaining buildings were added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 22, 1986, as one of five sections of the Newington Junction Multiple Resources Area. The listing of \\"Newington Junction Railroad Depot\\" includes the 1891 NY&NE; station, 1890 NYNH&H; freight house, and a short section of the Amtrak-owned right of way between them. As part of the CTfastrak project, the 1891 station building was restored, repainted, and moved slightly to the center of new landscaping in 2014. Bus rapid transit Newington Junction is a bus rapid transit stop on the CTfastrak line, which follows the original HP&F; route from Hartford to New Britain. The station consists of two side platforms serving built level with the bus entrances, with two center lanes to allow express buses to bypass the station. It opened with the line on March 28, 2015. Two Connecticut Transit Hartford routes which do not use the CTfastrak busway, 69 and 140, also stop at the station. Hartford Line In 2004, the Recommended Action of the New Haven Hartford Springfield Commuter Rail Implementation Study included the construction of a new Newington station as part of the New Haven-Hartford-Springfield Commuter Rail Line. A preliminary design in that report included two side platforms serving the line's two tracks, with a 200-space parking lot on the east side. However, Newington and other infill stations were not included in early funding for the line; when the busway station was built nearby, neither commuter rail platforms nor the parking lot were constructed. The 2012 environmental assessment included preliminary plans for infill stations at North Haven, Newington Junction, West Hartford, and Enfield; although they were not yet funded, this would allow future planning and construction to be expedited. The 2012 plans included a design very similar to the 2004 report. On January 12, 2015, the state announced that $5.75 million in funding would be made available for environmental mitigation and design at ten Hartford Line and New Haven Line stations, including design funding for Hartford Line platforms at Newington Junction. In February 2017, the state announced an additional $50 million in funds, including money to complete design of Newington station. Design will be completed by 2020. The state aims to construct all infill stations on the line by 2022. In 2018, the state proposed to build the station further south, at 565 Cedar Street, which is closer to Central Connecticut State University and downtown Newington, due to concerns from neighbors about noise and traffic.

Built in 1875, it is a distinctive example of a railroad station with Italianate styling. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 26, 1976. Presently, it houses a restaurant, called \\"Plan B\\". Description and history The former Simsbury Railroad Depot stands on the east side of Simsbury's downtown area, on the east side of Railroad Street between Station Street and Phelps Lane. It is a narrow rectangular single-story brick building, oriented north-south, with the road to the west and the former railroad right-of-way to the east. The street-facing facade is divided into six bays, each slightly recessed with a band of brick corbelling at the top, and brick pilasters between. As built, there were three window bays, two pedestrian entrances, and a freight door in these bays; they have since been altered for use by the restaurant. Simsbury was first served by the Farmington Canal in 1826. The canal failed in 1846, and its route was overbuilt by a railroad line in 1850. This line provided service between New Haven and points further north on the Connecticut River. A second line was run through the town in 1871, connecting Hartford with Albany, New York. A station is documented as standing on this site in 1873, but the records of the Connecticut Western Railway indicate the present building was constructed in 1875. The styling is particularly unusual for the period, as most stations built at the time were wood frame structures that had more Gothic Revival elements.

BUilt in 1893, it is a well-preserved example of a late 19th-century rural firehouse with Queen Anne Victorian features. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 28, 1983. It presently houses a muster vehicle for Tunxis Hose Company No. 1, a local volunteer fire company. Description and history The Tunxis Hose Firehouse is located in the center of the Unionville village of Farmington, on the east side of Lovely Street north of its junction with Main Street and Farmington Avenue. It is a two-story brick building with Queen Anne features. It has a single garage bay, a cross-gable roof with decorative corbelled brickwork below the roofline, and a three-story tower with a pyramidal roof. The Tunxis Hose Company was founded in 1893, in response to fires at major local employers in 1890 and 1892 that threatened the community's economic vitality. Land for its firehouse was purchased that year, and this building was completed soon afterward. Its architect is unknown; the brickwork was laid by Joseph Jetner, a local mason. The building and the hand-drawn hose reel that first occupied it cost the company $4,000. In addition being used by the fire company, the building has also historically been used for social events. It served as the community's only firehouse until 1960, when a new station was built nearby. The company continues to use the building for storage and as a staging area.

In 2001 the bank was privatised and merged into Stanbic Bank (Uganda) Limited. History Uganda Commercial Bank (UCB) was established by an Act of Parliament, \\"The Uganda Commercial Bank Act, 1965\\". The new bank was to replace the Uganda Credit and Savings Bank. The bank extended banking services to rural areas, and steadily expanded its branch network throughout the 1960s and 1970s. In 1971/72, following the nationalisation of foreign-owned businesses by the government of Idi Amin, the bank's branch network expanded rapidly when it took over most of the branches of foreign-owned banks - leaving Uganda Commercial Bank with nearly a monopoly in banking markets outside Kampala. The fall of Amin's government in 1979 brought a revival of foreign development assistance to Uganda, some of which was channelled through Uganda Commercial Bank, leading to an increase in its share of medium-term financing and its loan portfolio. The bank's branches were also used to perform functions for the government, such as the handling of payments of taxes and school fees. In the late 1980s, then chairman and managing director Dr. Frank Alfred Mwine led the bank in opening 130 new branches and further expanding its investments. Dr. Mwine was a Harvard Law educated Ugandan and a World Bank executive. By the 1990s UCB held around 50% of commercial bank deposits and had 190 of the 270 bank branches in the country. The second largest branch network at that time, the Co-operative Bank, had 24 branches. Sale and merger In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the government of Uganda adopted private sector development (PSD) policies and decided to divest itself of the majority of government-owned corporations.U.S. Library of Congress.

However, in 1998, after Westmont failed to pay the agreed fee and was accused of acting fraudulently, the transaction was nullified. In 2001, 80% shares of the bank was bought by the South African investment bank Standard Bank. Standard Bank merged Uganda Commercial Bank with its existing bank Stanbic Bank Uganda Limited.

A 1935 graduate of the Royal Military College, Duntroon, where he was the Corps Sergeant Major and was awarded the Sword of Honour, and of the University of Sydney, where he earned a Bachelor of Engineering degree, Brogan served in the Second World War on the staff of New Guinea Force during New Guinea Campaign, and as an observer with the British Army during the Western Allied invasion of Germany. After the war he was commandant and chief instructor at the School of Military Engineering during the 1949 Australian coal strike, and, as Director of Military Training, reopened the Land Warfare Centre at Canungra in 1954. When he was appointed the Chief of the General Staff in 1971, he was the first occupant of that position to possess a university degree. He presided over the withdrawal of Australian troops from the Vietnam War, the ending of the National Service scheme, and the consequent reduction of the size of the Army, and sweeping organisational changes. Early life Mervyn Francis Brogan was born in Crows Nest, New South Wales, on 10 January 1915, the son of Bernard Brogan and his wife Hilda. He had an older brother, Bernard Alwyn, who later became a wing commander in Royal Australian Air Force. Upon receiving his leaving certificate, he was awarded a scholarship to study at the Sydney Technical College; but as part of the Combined Schools team, he played rugby against the Royal Military College, Duntroon, which had moved from Canberra to the Victoria Barracks, Sydney, due to the Great Depression, and decided to go there instead. His application was accepted, and he entered the Royal Military College on 25 February 1932. In his final year, Brogan was the Corps Sergeant Major, the senior cadet appointment, and on graduation was awarded the Sword of Honour. He was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Australian Staff Corps on 11 December 1935. On 16 March 1936, he entered the University of Sydney, where he earned a Bachelor of Engineering degree. He did some work on the fortifications on Rottnest Island guarding the city of Perth. He was on the university's swimming and water polo teams, and was a blue in rugby. After graduation he was posted to Melbourne as the Adjutant and Quartermaster, 3rd Division Engineers on 7 August 1938, and then to Army Headquarters at Victoria Barracks, Melbourne, on 23 March 1939. He played rugby for Victoria in 1938 and 1939, and attended tryouts for the Wallabies. Second World War When the Second World War broke out in 1939, he sought an appointment with the Second Australian Imperial Force (AIF), but instead was sent to Duntroon as an instructor on 11 November 1939. He became a temporary captain on 1 July 1940. On 25 June 1941, he married Shiela Jones, the daughter of David Samuel Jones, a teacher at the Duntroon School. Her brother gave the bride away, and his acted as his best man. They had two children, Edward and Daryl. He joined the AIF on 22 September 1941, and was allotted the AIF service number NX76403. He was appointed GSO2 of Home Forces on 22 December 1941. This became Second Army on 6 April 1942. He was promoted to the temporary rank of major on 1 July 1942; this became substantive on 1 September. On 8 November 1942, he became Deputy Assistant Quartermaster General (DAQMG) of New Guinea Force. He became Assistant Quartermaster General (AQMG) of I Corps and New Guinea Force with the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel on 2 August 1943, and AQMG of New Guinea Force on 27 August 1943. He was involved in organising the air supply in support of the Salamaua‚ÄìLae campaign, for which he was mentioned in despatches on 23 December 1943, and was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire on 27 April 1944. He was GSO1 of the Military Training Branch at Allied Land Forces, South West Pacific Area (LHQ) from 5 January 1944 to 6 November 1944. He represented the ACT in rugby in 1941 and 1944. In 1945, Brogan was sent as an observer with the British Army during the Western Allied invasion of Germany. Soon after he arrived, he came down with malaria, a legacy of his service in New Guinea, to the surprise of the doctors, who were not used to seeing a tropical disease in North West Europe. Post-war Brogan remained in Europe until 1947, when he returned to Australia to become commandant and chief instructor at the School of Military Engineering. He assisted in organising Royal Australian Engineers to mine coal during the 1949 Australian coal strike. He then went back to Britain as a student at the Joint Services Staff College there from 1950 to 1952. In 1954, he became Director of Military Training. In the years since the Second World War, the Australian Army had lost most of its expertise in jungle warfare, as it concentrated on Australia's commitment to the Korean War, and plans to support the British Army in the Middle East. Brogan reopened the Land Warfare Centre at Canungra, incorporating lessons from the British Army's experience in the Malayan Emergency. Brogan served as a brigadier on the staff of the British Army's Far East Land Forces from 1956 to 1958, and went back to Britain once more to attend the Imperial Defence College in 1959. He then became the commandant of the Australian Staff College. He was General Officer Commanding Northern Command from 1962 to 1965, and was upgraded to a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1963 Birthday Honours. In 1965 he was an Australian Representative on the Military Committee of the South East Asia Treaty Organisation. He was Director of Joint Service Plans from 1965 to 1966, when he became the Quartermaster-General and Third Member of the Military Board. In December 1968, he became General Officer Commanding Eastern Command, vice Sir James Harrison, who had been appointed Governor of South Australia. He was made a Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1970 New Year Honours. Chief of the General Staff On 19 May 1971, Brogan reached the pinnacle of his career when he was appointed as the Chief of the General Staff (CGS) with the rank of lieutenant general. He was the first occupant of that position to possess a university degree. He was upgraded to a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his service in that role in the 1972 Birthday Honours. Australian troops were serving in the Vietnam War at that time, but the commitment was winding down. In response to the American Vietnamization policy, the 8th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment was withdrawn in 1970 and not replaced. The last infantry battalion, the 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, was withdrawn in December 1971, and the 1st Australian Logistic Support Group followed. With the election of the Whitlam Government in December 1972, the last troops, the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam were withdrawn. It fell to Brogan to implement sweeping changes. The Whitlam government swiftly terminated the National Service scheme, causing the manpower of both the Australian Regular Army and the CMF to rapidly shrink. The number of battalions in the Royal Australian Regiment was reduced from nine to six, but Brogan clung to the divisional structure, which would remain until the 1990s. The Department of the Army was abolished, replaced by the new Department of Defence. The old regional commands were abolished, replaced by four functional commands, and the number of bodies reporting to Army Headquarters was reduced from 140 to just four. Brogan revived the position of Vice CGS, appointing Major General Francis Hassett, who would become his successor, to the post. Brogan's term as CGS ended on 19 November 1973. He retired in January 1975. He was Colonel Commandant of the Royal Australian Engineers from 1974 to 1978, and Honorary Colonel of the University of New South Wales Regiment from 1975 to 1980. He died in Sydney on 8 March 1994.

Adler was a one-time collaborator with Sigmund Freud in the early days of the psychoanalytic movement who split with Freud to develop his own theories of psychology and human functioning. In the late 1940s a group of psychiatrists and psychologists in Chicago, under the leadership of Rudolf Dreikurs, among others, founded an informal group to carry on discussion and teaching of the theories and techniques of Adler.Dreikurs, R.

Members are primarily concentrated in the United States and Canada, but there are also members from Uruguay, Brazil, Mexico, and countries in Europe, the Middle East (esp. Israel), and Japan. The Society holds annual conventions at cities in North America where practitioners share techniques and experiences.

Early career Dorn began running as a sophomore at Chattanooga Christian School in 2001, but did not make the varsity team until his junior year. In his junior year, Dorn placed 20th at the TSSAA A-AA Cross Country State Championship Meet with a time of 16:51 for 3 miles. He was the third-place finisher for Chattanooga Christian School and the Chargers finished in 2nd place in the championship. As a senior, Dorn was an All State finisher, running 16:55 for 3 miles and finishing in 14th place. Chattanooga Christian, however, only finished in 4th place at that championship. On the track his senior year, Dorn set a Chattanooga Christian School record for 800 m when he ran 2:03. That record stands today. After graduating from high school in May 2004, Dorn matriculated to Lee University in Cleveland, TN, where he competed for two years before transferring to Bryan College in Dayton, TN. College cross country career In 2005, his sophomore year of college, at the NAIA Region XIII Cross Country Championship meet in Rome, GA, Dorn finished in 26th place, 3rd-place finisher for Lee University, when he ran 32:15 for 8000 m. After a disappointing two years at Lee University, Dorn transferred to Bryan College. In 2006, his first year at Bryan, Dorn was forced to take a medical redshirt after he ripped his Achilles tendon in the first cross country meet of the year. In 2007 he finished in 16th place at the NAIA Region XII Cross Country Championship meet in Elizabethton, TN, the 6th-place finisher for Bryan College, and he ran 27:33 for 8000 m. Bryan won the Region Championship that year and at the NAIA National Championship Meet in Kenosha, WI finished in 27th place. Dorn struggled and finished in 202nd place and was the fourth finisher for Bryan when he ran 27:14 for 8000 m. In 2008, his senior year, Dorn was the only runner from Bryan to qualify for the NAIA National Championship meet, when he finished in 9th place at the Appalachian Athletic Conference Championship Cross Country Meet in Elizabethton, TN. Dorn ran 27:14 for 8000 m at the AAC Championship that year, while Bryan finished in 5th place as a team. At the 2008 NAIA National Championship meet, Dorn again struggled when he finished in 289th place and ran 28:32 for 8000 m. College track career Dorn qualified for the NAIA Outdoor Track and Field Championships in 2008 as a marathoner. Dorn qualified at the 2008 Scenic City Half Marathon in Chattanooga, TN, when he ran 1:15:44 and finished in 2nd place. However, Dorn was forced to miss the National Championship meet due to a reoccurrence of his previous Achilles tendon injury. The 2009 track and field season, his final semester of collegiate eligibility, brought about many frustrations for Dorn as he repeatedly posted abysmal results. After running 4:55 and 9:42 for one mile and 3000 m indoors, coach Rodney Stoker elected to end Dorn's season, and his college career ended in disappointment. Postcollegiate career Andrew Dorn raced one cross country race in 2009, the Southeastern Classic in Louisville, KY where he competed as an unattached athlete and finished in 160th place when he ran 8000 m in 30:00. Dorn's last race as an unattached athlete came on New Year's Eve, when he finished in 7th place at Chattanooga's Karen Lawrence Race for St. Jude's 4 Miler. He ran 22:25 that night, a step towards a return to his old form. In January 2010, Dorn joined the newly formed Team Fast Break, a professional distance running team sponsored by Fast Break Athletics based in Chattanooga, TN. In his first race as a Team Fast Break runner, Dorn finished in third place at the Gateway Bank & Trust 5k road race in Ringgold, GA when he ran 16:27 on March 20, 2010.Gateway Bank 5k Results: http://www.chattanoogatrackclub.org/raceResults/results/raceResults_134.pdf He made his debut at the 10 mile distance a few weeks later at the Papa John's 10 Miler in Louisville, KY.

The station, as well as the former fire equipment maintenance house, which is located behind it at 36 John Street, were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. The station presently houses Engine Company 1 and Ladder Company 6 of the Hartford Fire Department. Description and history The South Green Fire Station is located in downtown Hartford, on the west side of Main Street, between Charter Oak Avenue and Park Streets. It occupies the eastern half of a lot that extends west to John Street. The station is a two- story masonry structure, built out of brick with limestone trim. Its front facade is three bays wide, with equipment bays in the two right bays, and a pedestrian entrance to the left. The equipment bays have pointed-arch openings, squared off by limestone trim with carved depictions of firefighting equipment. Above each of these bays is a band of three sash windows, each of which has a tone panel with a diamond shape at its center. The left bay has an oriel window above it. The station was the second to be built for Engine Company 1, established in 1864 when the city created a paid professional fire service. The company's first building also occupied this site: an Italianate structure, it was replaced to better meet the requirements of motorized fire equipment. The former maintenance building is a rectangular brick building with modest Classical Revival features. It was built in 1920 and originally housed specialized equipment for servicing fire engines. It now houses professional offices.

It presently houses Engine Company 15 and Ladder Company 2 of the Hartford Fire Department. Description and history The Engine Company 15 Fire Station is located in southwestern Hartford, at junction of Fairfield and New Britain Avenues. It is a two-story brick building with Colonial Revival features. It is roughly rectangular in shape, three bays wide, with the leftmost pedestrian entrance bay recessed. The right two bays house equipment, and have rectangular garage door openings. Windows on the second floor are in groups of three, with splayed lintels that have stone keystones. Stone stringcourses run at the top of the first-floor windows and at the bottom of the second-floor windows. A stone panel above the equipment bays is carved with the company identification. The upstairs rooms feature original woodwork, including door and window trim. Wooden doors conceal the slide pole, and the rear of the story contains exposed elements of what originally served as a hay loft. Behind the equipment bays on the ground floor is a kitchen space that is built into what were originally horse stalls. The basement includes an area formerly used for hose drying. Engine Company 15 was organized in 1909, and this was its first station. It was designed by the Hartford firm of Zunner and Sellew. It has lost a number of its exterior architectural features, particularly around the equipment bay openings, which have been enlarged, and the roof, which used to have a more elaborate cornice.

He left office in March 2010 when Acting President Goodluck Jonathan dissolved his cabinet. Background Babalola gained a PhD in Energy Economics from the University of Surrey, United Kingdom. He was an investment banker with Lead Bank in charge of the Public Sector and Infrastructure Department. Babalola joined the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) in November 2001 as head of the Power Sector Team. Under a program assisted by USAID and later the World Bank, he was responsible for reform measures including setting up the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission, and unbundling the Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN). After leaving the BPE, he was Deputy General Manager at the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission for a short period. He then joined the Economic Advisory Team of President Umar Yar'adua. Minister of Power Appointed Minister of Power in December 2008, Babalola faced a challenging job, with severe lack of power generation and transmission facilities, tangled regulations and a highly ambitious program to expand capacity. In February 2009 Babalola suspended the Executive Chairman of the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission, Ransome Owan, and six commissioners. They had been arrested by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on 3 February 2009 for allegedly misappropriating N1.54 billion in 2008. Babalola had initiated the action. In March 2009, he said President Yar'Adua has approved removal of the Executive Vice chairman of PHCN, Bello Suleiman, and two executive directors, due to disagreements about how the massive investment in the power industry by the Federal Government should be allocated. In September 2009 Babalola argued that delivering 6000MW of generating capacity was highly ambitious but attainable. In February 2010 it was revealed that power supply had in fact fallen to 2,700 mW from 3,710 mW at the end of the previous year. Babalola blamed the problem on inadequate natural gas supply for the new generators. Failure to meet the target resulted in calls for his dismissal. In January 2010 Babalola said that there would be a slow-down in the process of unbundling the Power Holding Company of Nigeria due to concerns about the viability of private power generation in the current tariff and regulatory structure, and the need to establish rules to ensure a level playing field in the competitive market. He announced plans that included construction of additional gas-fired generation stations near the source of supply in the Niger Delta, reducing vulnerability to pipeline disruptions, and major projects to build transmission and distribution facilities to eliminate bottlenecks in the grid. He also said the government was encouraging private- sector power generation projects. Babalola left office on 17 March 2010 when Acting President Goodluck Jonathan dissolved his cabinet. When a new cabinet was formed on 6 April 2010, President Jonathan took personal responsibility for the Ministry of Power, and did not name a minister.

It is a brick structure built in the early 20th century, the second firehouse built for the company. Architect Russell Barker, who designed many public buildings in the city, used the Italian Renaissance Revival style, unusual for a firehouse. The front facade boasts intricate brickwork. It is one of two remaining firehouses in the city originally designed to accommodate both men and horses. In 1989, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places along with several other city firehouses. It continues to serve its original function, housing Engine Company 2 of the Hartford Fire Department. Building The firehouse is in the Clay‚ÄìArsenal neighborhood north of downtown Hartford. It is on the southwest corner of the intersection, a block north of the five-way intersection of Main, Ann and High streets with Albany Avenue and the railroad tracks beneath Tunnel Park. The Interstate 84/U.S. Route 6 freeway one block further south divides Clay‚ÄìArsenal and downtown. This section of Clay-Arsenal is a transition from downtown to outer residential neighborhoods. Main has a concrete divider here, creating separate roadways on both sides of the intersection. The firehouse's neighboring buildings are commercial structures of similar height on Main, and houses on Belden. Across Main is a newer housing development. Exterior The building is a two-story seven-by-five- bay structure on a foundation of brownstone on the east (front) elevation and concrete on the other three. Load-bearing walls of wood frame and masonry rest on it. Five-bay pavilions project from the east and west, with the latter having an additional three-bay pavilion projecting further. The two combine to make the building cross-shaped. On all sides the masonry is faced in brick. It is beige on the east (front) facade. At the corners projecting courses are laid to resemble quoins. Along the ground level of the pavilion at the first story are three large garages with metal overhead doors. A smooth concrete apron runs down to the street. Above the garages, on an entablature of brick laid in stretcher bond, are metal letters spelling out \\"CLAY-ARSENAL STATION ENGINE CO. 2 LADDER CO. 3\\". It in turn is topped by a course of four bricks laid vertically, all but the third from the bottom headers, with separate stone blocks carved with letters. From south to north they \\"HFD\\", \\"FIRE\\" and \\"DEPT.\\" They set off a second story with a smooth stone face set with five round-arched windows. On either side of the central window are stone panels. The south one has a \\"2\\" and the north one \\"1910\\". The windows are set with double-hung sash. At the springline of the arches another brick course sets off the stone, with the brick above it laid in a basketweave pattern. The arches themselves are segmental, consisting of four vertically laid headers. Above them another projecting stretcher course ends the basketweave, topped by vertical stretchers, two rows of projecting stretchers, two rows of stretchers and finally a top row of projecting stretchers below a stone cornice. The otherwise flat roof has a hipped section in the front of the main block behind the pavilion. The other three facades are faced in red brick and fenestrated with nine-over-one double-hung sash trimmed with brownstone lintels. There are two bay windows on the north and south faces, toward the west corners. Around the base of the hipped roof is a cornice of corbeled brickwork. Interior On the inside much original trim remains. The apparatus room has narrow wainscoting, part of which is now concealed by a dropped ceiling. Semicircular openings in the walls house the sliding poles. In the rear a row of large doors once served as the stables, with another set on the south opening into the former harness room. Two rooms behind the stables also once served horse- related functions. One retains the iron hitching posts and wood flooring. The other has been converted into a kitchen, with those features removed. Most of the original woodwork remains on the second floor, particularly window and door surrounds. Double wooden doors set off the upper ends of the poles. A dropped ceiling has been added to the front dormitory. Over the stables is a largely unfinished room that once served as the hayloft. History Engine Company 2 was established in 1864 when the city of Hartford decided to combine its existing volunteer fire companies into a single paid citywide department. It had originally been the Neptune company, based near the present location at 1161 Main Street. That firehouse was used for the remainder of the 19th century. In 1910, the city decided to build a new firehouse for the company. Architect Russell Barker, who had begun as a draftsman in another local architect's office and had had no formal training otherwise, received the commission. It was the first of a group of buildings he designed in the Hartford area, including five schools, through 1930. His design used the Italian Renaissance Revival architectural style, not commonly used for firehouses. Originally a projecting cornice with a pent tile roof supported by brackets ran the length of the east facade. It is not known when, or why, that was removed. It was meant to accommodate both men and horses, reflecting a distinct era in the fire department's history when it had its own horses but had not yet begun to motorize. It and the Engine Company 4 building on Ann Street, which housed the last two department horses until 1920, are the only two left in Hartford with that design feature.

In the early years of his reign, this former viceroy of Prome (Pyay) was forced to deal with raids from the Shan State of Mogaung as well as the Ming Chinese intrusions into Avan territory (1444‚Äì1446). In the wake of renewed Chinese determination to pacify the Yunnan frontier region, Narapati was able to maintain Ava's control of northern Shan States of Kale and Mohnyin, and gained allegiance of Thibaw. However, he continued to have trouble with Toungoo which was in revolt between 1451 and 1459. One of his grandsons attempted on his life in June 1467. The king fled Ava for Prome and died there in July 1468. Ancestry and early life Narapati was born to Mohnyin Thado, then Governor of Mohnyin, and his wife (later chief queen) Shin Myat Hla on 7 June 1413.Zatadawbon Yazawin (Zata 1960: 46, 76) says he was born on Wednesday, 9th nekkhat (10th day) of the 4th month (1st Waso) of 765 ME, which translates to Wednesday, 13 June 1403. But 1403 is a typographical error as his parents were not married until late 1409/early 1410 per Hmannan Yazawin (Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 81). (Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 99) instead suggests he was born in year 775 ME, or 10th waxing of Waso 775 ME (Wednesday, 7 June 1413). He was the second child of the couple's four children. He has an elder brother and two younger sisters. He was given Wuntho in fief.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 61‚Äì62 Viceroy of Prome In 1429, he was appointed by his father, who had become king of Ava, Viceroy of Prome (Pyay), the southernmost and most important territory of Ava. His new title was Thihathu. He continued to rule Prome when his father died in 1439, and was succeeded by his brother and heir- apparent Minye Kyawswa. Accession In January 1442 (Tabodwe 803 ME), Minye Kyawswa suddenly died.(Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 80): Tabodwe 803 ME = 12 January 1442 to 9 February 1442 At that time, Ava's forces had been laying siege to Mogaung, the capital of the Shan State of Mogaung. When the king died, the ministers at Ava first chose Minye Kyawswa's son-in-law and brother-in-law Thihapate who was at the front at Mogaung. Thihapate was recalled to Ava by ministers to assume the throne, but he declined the offer, declaring that he was neither a son nor a brother of the deceased king. He suggested they recall the king‚Äôs brother Thihathu from Prome. The ministers then invited Thihathu who ascended to the throne with the reign name of Narapati on 25 April 1442 (1st waning of Kason 804 ME).Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 82 Thihapate, having refused the throne, went back to the front, and captured Mogaung the very same day, the new king, who was also Thihapate's brother-in-law, ascended the throne. Their leader Thonganbwa was captured, and brought back to Ava.Fernquest 2006: 62‚Äì66 Reign As customary with all Ava kings, Narapati after becoming king, first had to assert his rule over the kingdom. With Mogaung defeated, Narapati gained the allegiance of the saopha of Onpaung Hsipaw (Thibaw) in the northeast. He made Thihapate the new saopha of Mohnyin, and his son-in-law the new saopha of Kale. Despite his success in peripheral regions, Narapati continued to have problems with regions much closer to Ava. In late 1443, he sent his armies to Yamethin and Pinle, both of which had been in revolt since the start of his brother's reign in 1441. While his armies were laying siege to Pinle, the new king was forced to deal with a far larger threat from the north: China. Ming invasions The Ming Chinese had conquered Yunnan after their campaigns of 1380‚Äì1388, but never completely controlled the frontier which was still occupied by several Shan States. The Chinese were forced to send troops back to the region due to the constant Shan raids into Yunnan by Thonganbwa, the saopha of Mogaung. In 1443, Zhengtong Emperor sent yet another expeditionary force (third campaign since 1436) to punish the pesky Shan raiders. After learning that Ava had already defeated and captured Thonganbwa at Mogaung, the Chinese forces, encamped at the frontier, demanded that Ava surrender Thonganbwa, and send a payment of tribute, or it would face attack.Phayre 1967: 84‚Äì85 Narapati refused the Chinese demand. In 1444, Ava forces marched north to meet the Chinese. The Burmese Chronicles report that the Chinese forces numbered three million, and that the Ava forces numbered 200,000. The numbers clearly were an exaggeration but an exaggeration that does indicate a grave threat. (Noted historian of Burmese history, GE Harvey, believes that the military numbers reported during the Ava-Pegu era were an order of magnitude higher.) Chinese troops descended on Bhamo, and war broke out. The Burmese met the invaders at Kaungton near Bhamo and held their ground. The Chinese soon faced a food supply problem, and retreated to Mong Wan (Mo Wun). Narapati appointed the saophas of Mogaung and Mong Nai (Mone) to watch over Bhamo and returned to Ava. The Chinese forces, having regrouped, invaded again in the following year. On 3 November 1445, (Tuesday, 3rd waxing of Nadaw 807 ME), the Burmese troops evacuated Bhamo.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 87 The Chinese forces penetrated all the way down to the fortified city of Ava, and threatened to attack if Thonganbwa was not handed over to them. Narapati negotiated a deal to hand over Thonganbwa if the Chinese helped him subdue Yamethin first. The Chinese agreed, and together with a contingent of troops from Ava, conquered Yamethin. Thonganbwa, rather than being handed over to the Chinese, committed suicide. His dead body was handed over to the Chinese in early 1446. Narapati maintained that he did not accept Chinese suzerainty. But the Chinese considered the handover of the body as Ava's recognition of Chinese suzerainty.Htin Aung 1967: 94‚Äì95 Mohnyin rebellion (1450) The death of Thonganbwa did not solve the problem of Shan raids for the Chinese. The Maw Shans, now under the leadership of Thokyeinbwa (Chinese: Si Ji-fa), son of Thonganbwa, moved to the region west of Mogaung, and continued the raids into both Ava and Yunnan territories. In 1448, the Chinese chased them to near Bhamo but were defeated by the Shans. In 1450, the Burman saopha of Mohnyin, Thihapate, died. Thihapate's son Min U Ti in alliance with Maw Shan raiders Thokyeinbwa and Thopawbwa (Si Bu-fa) raised a rebellion. Narapati sent an army under the command of the crown prince to Mohnyin. The rebel leader Min U Ti was executed. The two Shan leaders then surrendered and took an oath of allegiance. Narapati made a son of Thopawbwa the new saopha of Mohnyin. He kept Thokyeinbwa and Thopawbwa at Ava. In 1454, Narapati handed over Thokyeinbwa over six people including Thokyeinbwa and his family at a village on the Irrawaddy in exchange for China's explicit recognition of Ava's control of Mohnyin.Mohnyin had been under Ava's control since 1406. (Fernquest 2006): The Nanzhao Chronicle of Yunnan claims that the Ming recognized Mohnyin as Avan territory in 1452, not 1454. Thokyeinbwa arrived at Beijing in a cage on 30 August 1454 and was executed on 2 September 1454. Toungoo rebellion (1452‚Äì1459) In 1452, Viceroy of Toungoo Minkhaung I was assassinated, and the town entered a state of rebellion against Ava. Narapati tried in vain to recover the territory but could not. However, the rebellious Toungoo king was assassinated by his servant in 1459 (821 ME). Ava regained nominal control. Narapati gave his brother-in-law who already had Taungdwingyi as an appanage to rule Toungoo.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 170 Death On 12 June 1467 (12th waxing of Waso 829 ME), Narapati was stabbed by his grandson whom he had reproved for a love intrigue with his cousin; the wound was not mortal. The king fled to Prome in where his son Mingyi Swa was governor.

He scored his first three victories there, on 24 and 29 July, and on 4 September. On 9 September, he was reassigned to fly fighters for Jagdstaffel 39 in Italy. He received the Iron Cross First Class on 22 September. During October and November 1917, he scored five more wins. He was also promoted again, to Vizefeldwebel, on 28 October. On 31 December, he was awarded the Austro-Hungarian Silver Bravery Medal. In February 1918, he was transferred back to the Western Front and stationed with Jagdstaffel 77. He had a couple of unconfirmed wins in March, followed by a couple that were confirmed. Then, on 5 May, he was wounded in action, and off duty until 22 August. He came back for two last wins in September 1918. Also during September, he was awarded the Bavarian Military Merit Cross Second Class with Swords.

Rosenzweig is a professor of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences at Northwestern University. She was born in 1967 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She received her BA in chemistry from Amherst College in 1988, and her Ph.D. from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1994. At MIT, Rosenzweig worked under the supervision of Stephen J. Lippard where she pioneered the structural studies of the hydroxylase component of methane monooxygenase from methyloccous capsulatus. Her current research interests include structural biology and bioinorganic chemistry, metal uptake and transport, oxygen activation by metalloenzymes, and characterization of membrane protein. For her work, she has been recognized by a number of national and international awards, including the MacArthur \\"Genius\\" Award in 2003. Biological Methane Oxidation Structure of pMMO Rosenzweig determined the molecular structures of Nature's main methane oxidation catalysts. Methane monooxygenases (MMO) are metalloenzymes found in the family of methanotrophic bacteria. These enzymes belong in the oxidoreductase class. They activate carbon-hydrogen bonds to selectively install oxygen onto their substrate. Two major species of MMO exist‚Äîsoluble MMO (sMMO) and particulate MMO (pMMO). Despite mediating the same chemical reaction, these two enzymes' structure and mechanism are significantly different. Since the early 1990s, Rosenzweig has studied MMO enzymes in various biological systems. Her team was the first to solve the crystal structure of particulate MMO in 1993. In the following years, she made major advances in determining the enzyme's bioactivity and chemical constitution, including vast contributions to research on the metal- coordinated active site. The currently proposed mechanism for sMMO involves an Iron (II) coordination complex that is twice oxidized to form a metalloperoxide species. This species then undergoes reduction in the presence of substrate methane to afford the oxidized alkyl methanol. The crystal structure of the sMMO protein-protein complex has been determined. Active site of pMMO Currently, there remains a mystery in the direct understanding of pMMO-substrate interaction, particularly in diagnosing a complex mechanism. According to Rosenzweig, this elusive problem remains \\"one of the major unsolved problems in bioinorganic chemistry.\\"  Metal Transport  In her work with pMMOs, Rosenzweig elucidated the molecular basis for safe handling of potentially toxic metal ions through direct handoff between protein partners. Methanotrophs secrete methanobactin. Methanobactin chelated with high affinity to copper, and forms a complex (CuMbn) that can be reinternalized by the cell through active transport. There are specific interactions between CuMbn and proteins MbnT and MbnE. These findings reveal mechanisms for recognition and transport of CuMbn.  Metalloprotein Function  Rosenzweig determined structures of important metalloproteins, exerting sustained influence on the field of bioinorganic chemistry. Particular proteins which she determined the structure of are E. coli Mn (II) 2-NrdF and Fe (II) 2-NrdF, which have different coordination sites. This suggests distinct initial binding sites for oxidants during cofactor activation with E. coli and nucleotides.

Predecessor to current day club BSC Kickers 1900 Berlin, it was established 1 November 1900 ‚Äî which Kickers take as their foundation date ‚Äî and was active as an independent side until 1912. The German term Elf is the number 11 and refers to the month of the club's founding. From 1904 to 1906 BTuFC Elf was part of the M√§rkischen Meisterschaft, one of two competing top-flight city leagues, where they earned only lower table finishes. In 1912, they merged with Berliner Fu√üballclub Hubertus 05 to form Berliner Sportclub Hubertuself. A second merger in 1923 with Ballspielverein Sportlust Borussia 1899 Sch√∂neberg created Sch√∂neberger FC Kickers 1900 which won promotion to the Oberliga Berlin-Brandenburg (I). BSV was the product of an earlier 1920 union between TuFC Sportlust 1904 and Sch√∂neberger FC Borussia which had been formed 1 March 1899 as Berliner TuFC Borussia. Kickers finished the 1926‚Äì27 campaign atop the Oberliga's Staffel B and played Hertha Berlin for the overall league title and were beaten (1:4, 2:6) although both clubs advanced to take part in the national playoffs. Kickers were eliminated in the quarterfinals by defending champion SpVgg F√ºrth (0:9), while Hertha continued on to the second of what would be six consecutive final appearances. The following season the Sch√∂neberg team adopted the name Berliner Sportclub 1900 Kickers. In 1931, the team was bankrupted and on 1 July was reformed as Berliner SC Gr√ºn-Wei√ü-Rot. They were again named Kickers on 1 January 1934. After World War II, occupying Allied authorities disbanded organizations throughout the country, including sports and football clubs. The membership became part of the community-based SG Sch√∂neberg Nord and played in the Amateurliga Berlin (II). They re-adopted their historical identity as Kickers in 1949 and remained a second division club through most of the next two-and-a-half decades with single season appearances in the Oberliga Berlin (I) in 1953‚Äì54 and 1960‚Äì61.Gr√ºne, Hardy (2001).

In addition to playing football the original club fielded a cricket team. Thorball or Torball was a German word in use in the 1890s and early 1900s for the sport. Several early clubs playing the new \\"English\\" games of football, rugby, and cricket incorporated it into their name. The term never caught on and did not enter into common usage, although some clubs still carry the term as part of their names as part of their tradition. Today torball may refer to a form of football played by the blind or vision-impaired.

He has been on the editorial board of a number of journals, including the Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics. He has been a member of the Council of the London Mathematical Society. He has written 12 books and over 100 papers on mathematical topics, many of them in algebraic combinatorics and its applications. He became Emeritus Professor in 2006 and continue to teach History of Mathematics in Finance and Economics for undergraduates. He is also Vice-President of the British Society for the History of Mathematics. Family Biggs married Christine Mary Farmer in 1975 and has one daughter Clare Juliet born in 1980. Interests and Hobbies Biggs' interests include computational learning theory, the history of mathematics and historical metrology. Since 2006, he has been an Emeritus Professor at the London School of Economics. Biggs hobbies consist of writing about the history of weights and scales. He currently holds the position of Chair of the International Society of Antique Scale Collectors (Europe), and a member of the British Numismatic Society. Work=Mathematics In 2002, Biggs wrote the second edition of Discrete Mathematics breaking down a wide range of topics into a clear and organised style. Biggs organised the book into four major sections; The Language of Mathematics, Techniques, Algorithms and Graphs, and Algebraic Methods. This book was an accumulation of Discrete Mathematics, first edition, textbook published in 1985 which dealt with calculations involving a finite number of steps rather than limiting processes. The second edition added nine new introductory chapters; Fundamental language of mathematicians, statements and proofs, the logical framework, sets and functions, and number system. This book stresses the significance of simple logical reasoning, shown by the exercises and examples given in the book. Each chapter contains modelled solutions, examples, exercises including hints and answers. Algebraic Graph Theory In 1974, Biggs published Algebraic Graph Theory which articulates properties of graphs in algebraic terms, then works out theorems regarding them. In the first section, he tackles the applications of linear algebra and matrix theory; algebraic constructions such as adjacency matrix and the incidence matrix and their applications are discussed in depth. Next, there is and wide-ranging description of the theory of chromatic polynomials. The last section discusses symmetry and regularity properties. Biggs makes important connections with other branches of algebraic combinatorics and group theory. Computational Learning Theory In 1997, N. Biggs and M. Anthony wrote a book titled Computational Learning Theory: an Introduction. Both Biggs and Anthony focused on the necessary background material from logic, probability, and complex theory. This book is an introduction to computational learning. History of Mathematics Biggs contributed to thirteen journals and books developing topics such as the four-colour conjecture, the roots/history of combinatorics, calculus, Topology on the 19th century, and mathematicians. In addition, Biggs examined the ideas of William Ludlam, Thomas Harriot, John Arbuthnot, and Leonhard Euler. Chip-Firing Game The chip-firing game has been around for less than 20 years. It has become an important part of the study of structural combinatorics. The set of configurations that are stable and recurrent for this game can be given the structure of an abelian group. In addition, the order of the group is equal to the tree number of the graph.

It is located in the Bharmour subdivision of the Chamba district in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. The peak is from Bharmour in the Budhil valley. It is one of the major pilgrimage sites as well as a popular trekking destination in Himachal Pradesh. The Manimahesh Lake is at the base of the Kailash peak at and is also held in deep veneration by people of Himachal Pradesh, particularly the Gaddi tribe of the region. In the month of Bhadon, on the eighth day of the new moon period a fair is held in the precincts of the lake that attracts thousands of pilgrims. Manimahesh Kailash has not been successfully summitted by mountaineers and is thus remains a virgin peak. An attempt to climb the peak in 1968 by an Indo‚ÄìJapanese team led by Nandini Patel was aborted. This failure is attributed to the divine prowess of the peak since it is revered as the holy mountain of Chamba according to the staunch devotees of the Manimahesh Lake and the peak. The peak in the photo is as seen from near the Manimahesh Lake. There are two trekking routes to the lake. One is from Hadsar village that is mostly frequented by pilgrims and trekkers. This route is easier and have adequate arrangement for basic food and accommodation during the pilgrimage season. The other one is from village Holi, which is for the more adventurous ones. This route climbs up further and then descends to the lake, providing a beautiful view. There is no other habitation, except for a small village on this route.  Legends  There are several mythical legends narrated on the sanctity of this peak and the lake at its base. In one popular legend, it is believed that Lord Shiva created Manimahesh after he married Goddess Parvati, who is worshipped as Mata Girja. There are many other legends narrated linking Lord Shiva and his show of displeasure through avalanches and blizzards that occur in the region. According to a local myth, Lord Shiva is believed to reside in Manimahesh Kailash. A rock formation in the form of a Shivling on this mountain is considered as the manifestation of Lord Shiva. The snow field at the base of the mountain is called by the local people as Shiva's Chaugan (play field). It is also believed that Manimahesh Kailash is invincible as no one has so far scaled it, in spite of claims to the contrary and the fact that much taller peaks have been scaled, including Mount Everest. According to one legend, a local tribe, a Gaddi, tried to climb along with a herd of sheep and is believed to have been turned into stone along with his sheep. The series of minor peaks around the principal peak are believed to be the remnants of the shepherd and his sheep. Another legend narrated is that a snake also attempted to climb the mountain but failed and was converted into stone. Devotees believe that they can view the peak only if the Lord wishes so. Bad weather covering the peak with clouds is also explained as a displeasure of the Lord.  Geography  Manimahesh Kailash or Mountain Kailash is in the watershed of the Budhil valley, which forms part the mid-Himalayan range of hills near Kugti pass and at Harsar. The perpetually snow-covered glacial peak, at the head of its own range, is the source of the sacred lake of Manimahesh situated beneath it. Manimahesh Ganga River originates in a cascade from the lake and joins the Budhil River on its left bank. This hill range is a contiguous spur that conjoins the main range near the Bara Banghal pass of the Pir Panjal range. After the Budhal River rises from the slopes of the Kukti (Kugati) pass and Bada Bangal pass, the watershed formed by the Budhil and Ravi rivers takes the form of an inverted triangle with its base at Khadamukh. Budhil itself is formed by several streams which rise from different faces of the Manimahesh Kailas peak. The streams which rise from the peak are: the 'Bhujla' (derived from Bhuja meaning the arm) from the left flank of the peak, which meets Bhudil (also spelt Budhal) below Kukti village; the Dhancho nala, rising from the snowy ranges of the southern flank of the peak, flows in northward direction; Androl stream carrying holy waters of the Manimahesh Lake flowing to the north of the peak and through the Barachundi Meadow, the Siv Karotar stream rises from the foot of the peak and joins Androl; and the Gauri stream from the Gauri Kund joins Androl. All these streams constitute the Dhancho nala that confluences with Budhil at Hadsar. In view of so many streams originating from the Manimhesah Peak and the Manimhaesh Lake, and all of which are also linked to legends and the annual yatra pilgrimage, the Budhal or Budhil River is also highly venerated by the Gaddi elders and is nicknamed as 'Bhujl'. Pir Pinjal lies in the lesser Himalayan Zone, which forms the central part of the state of Himachal Pradesh. The peak lies along the water shed between the Chenab River on the one side and Ravi and Beas on the other side. A research study has been carried out on the glacial status of this peak and its range by the Geological Survey of India. It indicated that the Manimahesh Kailash peak is part of the range, which is long. The average elevation of the studied peaks is . The glacial melt from this range flows towards the north and extends over an area of . The ice content of the glacier has been assessed as 0.137 cubic km. The composition of this proglacial region is reported to be a mixture of ground/recessional moraines with linear country outcrops protruding out. The glaciation must have extended up to a little downstream of Dhanchu as revealed by the terminal moraine hump. During the last 37 years, the glacier receded by with an average retreat of /year. The area vacated is estimated at .  Climb  It is said that no one could climb this pure peak because it is said to be abode by Lord Shiva. Once a Gaddi tried to climb the peak it was believed that he dreamt of Lord Shiva calling him on the peak and Lord Shiva asked him to cut the sheep on every step he takes but asked not to look back. He started to climb the peak steps after steps he kept cutting the lambs he was carrying with him but few steps before reaching the peak he got confused that he was not carrying many sheep he killed and turned back. As soon as he looked back he turned into stone and couldn't climb. Since then, no one has ever tried to climb this peak and thus it is a virgin peak.html+History+of+first+mountain+climb+to+Manimahesh+Kailash+in+Himachal+Pradesh&cd;=5&hl;=en&ct;=clnk‚â∑=intitle=Trekking Chamba Valley in Himachal Pradeshaccessdate=2010-04-2010publisher=Himalayan Journeys}}  See also  * Bharmour * Chamba, Himachal Pradesh * Lake Manasarovar * Pir Panjal Range * Himalaya * Manimahesh Lake * Manimahesh Yatra 2017  References  Category:Mountains of Himachal Pradesh Category:Geography of Chamba district Category:Hindu pilgrimage sites in India Category:Five-thousanders of the Himalayas ","title":"Manimahesh Kailash Peak"},{"id":"26991262","text":"Nejla ( ; ) is an Arabic given name for females, which means 'large-eyed'.

The line begins in Biederitz near Magdeburg and runs via G√ºtergl√ºck towards Dessau. According to Deutsche Bahn, the line ends at Trebnitz on the former border between the Duchy of Anhalt and Prussia.  History  In order to link the town of Zerbst to the rapidly growing railway network, the parliament of the Duchy of Anhalt decided to build a 13 kilometre long railway from Ro√ülau an der Elbe to Zerbst. This was opened on 1 November 1863. The operator was the Berlin-Anhalt Railway Company who purchased the line on 1 October 1871 for a million marks and extended it on 1 July 1874 to Magdeburg. Until 1871 the section from Zerbst to Ro√ülau was called the Anhalt Leopold Railway (). In 1882 the Prussian state railways took over the route. The Biederitz‚ÄìTrebnitz was opened eleven years later together with the Ro√ülau‚ÄìTrebnitz section of the Trebnitz‚ÄìLeipzig railway. Both sections are operated today as one route with timetable number 254\\\\. The two-track line was electrified in 1923 as part of the Leipzig‚ÄìDessau‚ÄìMagdeburg route. In 1946, the electrification was restored throughout the central German rail network, but the infrastructure was abruptly dismantled and delivered together with the locomotives to the USSR as war reparations. At the same time the second track was dismantled. In the 1970s, the second track was restored. On 15 April 1975, electrical operations were resumed between Magdeburg Neustadt and Zerbst.  Route  End of line at Trebnitz block post The line passes the junction of the branch line to Altengrabow and then runs for its entire length to the southeast. After crossing federal highway 1, it runs largely parallel with federal highway 184, which it passes under at Gommern. It has already crossed a level crossing over federal highway 246 in K√∂nigsborn. At the former ‚Äútower station‚Äù (Turmbahnhof, that is two-level interchange station) of G√ºtergl√ºck, it crosses a disused section of the Berlin-Blankenheim railway (Kanonenbahn). After about three kilometres, the line ends at the former Trebnitz block post, north of the village of the same name and continues with a change of line number as the Trebnitz‚ÄìLeipzig railway. Operations  From 1993 to 1995, the section from Biederitz to the connecting curve to the Berlin-Blankenheim railway at G√ºtergl√ºck was part of a long-distance route served by Intercity-Express and Intercity trains from western Germany to Berlin during the upgrading of the Berlin‚ÄìMagdeburg Railway, when the G√ºtergl√ºck‚ÄìBelzig‚ÄìBerlin-Wannsee was used as a detour at speeds up to 160 km/h. From 1994 there was also a pair of InterRegio trains with almost annual changes in route between Saxony and eastern Thuringia and north-west Germany. This long-distance train stopped between Magdeburg and Dessau only in Zerbst. Currently passenger services on this line are operated by DB Regio. It is served every two hours by Regional-Express service RE 13 (Magdeburg‚ÄìDessau‚ÄìLeipzig) and by Regionalbahn service RB 42 (Magdeburg‚ÄìDessau). In the peak hour there are additional services operating as RE 15 (Magdeburg‚ÄìLutherstadt Wittenberg).

In 2010, the government alleged that Drake mishandled documents, one of the few such Espionage Act cases in U.S. history. Drake's defenders claim that he was instead being persecuted for challenging the Trailblazer Project. He is the 2011 recipient of the Ridenhour Prize for Truth-Telling and co-recipient of the Sam Adams Associates for Integrity in Intelligence (SAAII) award. On June 9, 2011, all 10 original charges against him were dropped. Drake rejected several deals because he refused to \\"plea bargain with the truth\\". He eventually pleaded to one misdemeanor count for exceeding authorized use of a computer; Jesselyn Radack of the Government Accountability Project, who helped represent him, called it an act of \\"civil disobedience.\\"Jesselyn Radack, Daily Kos blog, 2011 6 11  Biography  Drake's father was a World War II veteran and his mother a secretary for Pearl S. Buck. He entered the U.S. Air Force in 1979, becoming an Airborne Voice Processing Specialist, with a fluency in German, and went on ELINT (electronic intelligence) missions. It was in that capacity that he encountered the surveillance state of East Germany and the Stasi, which informed his worldview and to which he compares developments in the United States since the September 11 attacks. Drake left the Air Force in 1989. He was also in the U.S. Navy, where he analyzed intelligence for the National Military Joint Intelligence Center. According to the Washington Post, he also at one time worked with the CIA. In 1989, Drake began work as an NSA contractor, evaluating software. As a contractor, he worked on projects like JACKPOT and LIBRARIAN, becoming an expert in the quality-testing of software and working on a system for measuring the quality of computer code at the NSA. Drake also continued his academic studies. In 2000, he was hired as a software systems quality specialist and management and information technology consultant for Columbia, Maryland-based Costal Research & Technology Inc. (CRTI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Alexandria, Virginia-based Computer Systems Management, Inc. (CSMI). In late 2001, he went to work at the NSA as a full-time employee at the Signals Intelligence Directorate at Fort Meade with his actual first day on the job as an NSA employee being September 11, 2001. In 2002, he became a Technical Director for Software Engineering Implementation within the Cryptologic Systems and Professional Health Office. In 2003, Drake became a Process Portfolio Manager within NSA's newly formed Directorate of Engineering. He held a Top Secret security clearance. During the congressional investigations into 9/11, he testified about NSA failures. In 2006 he was reassigned to the National Defense University, where he became the NSA Chair and an Assistant Professor of Behavioral Sciences within the Industrial College of the Armed Forces (ICAF). Drake was forced to leave the NDU in 2007 when his security clearance was suspended, and he resigned from the NSA the next year. Drake then went to work at Strayer University but was forced from that job after his indictment of April 2010. He found work at an Apple Store. He then founded Knowpari Systems, a consulting firm. In 2011, Drake was awarded the Ridenhour Prize for Truth Telling and was co-recipient of the Sam Adams Associates for Integrity in Intelligence (SAAII) award. Accepting the SAAII award he said, with references to an 1857 speech of Frederick Douglass: > \\"Power and those in control concede nothing ... without a demand. They never > have and they never will. ...each and every one of us must keep demanding, > must keep fighting, must keep thundering, must keep plowing, must keep on > keeping things struggling, must speak out and must speak up until justice is > served because where there is no justice there can be no peace.\\"  Whistleblowing on Trailblazer, and government response = Drake action within the NSA  In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the NSA desired new tools to collect intelligence from the growing flood of information pouring out of the new digital networks like the internet. Drake became involved in the internal NSA debate between two of these tools, the Trailblazer Project and the ThinThread project. He became part of the \\"minority\\" that favored ThinThread for several reasons, including its theoretical ability to protect the privacy of US individuals while gathering intelligence. Trailblazer required billions of dollars, dwarfing the cost of ThinThread. Drake eventually became \\"disillusioned, then indignant\\" regarding the problems he saw at the agency. Around 2000, NSA head Michael Hayden chose Trailblazer over ThinThread; ThinThread was cancelled and Trailblazer ramped up, eventually employing IBM, SAIC, Boeing, CSC, and others.James Bamford, The Shadow Factory, Chapter \\"Trailblazer\\", published by Doubleday, 2008 Drake worked his way through the legal processes that are prescribed for government employees who believe that questionable activities are taking place in their departments. In accordance with whistleblower protection laws such as the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act, Drake complained internally to the designated authorities: to his bosses, the NSA Inspector General, the Defense Department Inspector General, and both the House and Senate Congressional intelligence committees. He also kept in contact with Diane Roark, a staffer for the Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee of the U.S. Congress (the House committee responsible for oversight of the executive branch's intelligence activities). Roark was the \\"staff expert\\" on the NSA's budget, and the two of them had met in 2000. In September 2002, Roark and three former NSA officials, William Binney, J. Kirk Wiebe, and Ed Loomis, filed a DoD Inspector General report regarding problems at NSA, including Trailblazer. Drake was a major source for the report, and gave information to DoD during its investigation of the matter. Roark tried to notify her superior, then-Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Porter Goss. She also attempted to contact William Rehnquist, the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court at the time. In addition, Roark made an effort to inform Vice President Dick Cheney's legal counsel David Addington, who had been a Republican staff colleague of hers on the committee in the 1980s. Addington was later revealed by a Washington Post report to be the author of the controlling legal and technical documents for the Bush administration's warrantless surveillance program, typing the documents on a Tempest-shielded computer across from his desk in room 268 of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building and storing them in a vault in his office. Roark got no response from all three men.  NSA own inquiry and acknowledgement  By 2003, the NSA Inspector General (IG) had declared Trailblazer an expensive failure. It cost more than 1 billion dollars. In 2004, the DoD IG produced a final report of its investigation that had been prompted by Roark & the others in 2002. The report basically agreed with their assertions and found very serious flaws at NSA. For a time, the NSA was even banned from starting projects over a certain size, for fear it would waste the money. However, there were no plans to release this DoD IG report to the public at the time.  Eventual whistleblowing  In a 2011 New Yorker article, journalist Jane Mayer wrote that Drake felt the NSA was committing serious crimes against the American people, on a level worse than what President Nixon had done in the 1970s. Drake reviewed the laws regarding disclosure of information, and decided that if he revealed unclassified information to a reporter, then the worst thing that would happen to him was probably that he would be fired. In November 2005, Drake contacted Siobhan Gorman of The Baltimore Sun newspaper, sending her emails through Hushmail and discussing various topics. He claims that he was very careful not to give her sensitive or classified information; it was one of the basic ground rules he set out at the beginning of their communication. This communication occurred around 2006. Gorman wrote several articles about waste, fraud, and abuse at the NSA, including articles on Trailblazer. She received an award from the Society of Professional Journalists for her series exposing government wrongdoing. Judge Richard Bennett later ruled that \\"there is no evidence that Reporter A relied upon any allegedly classified information found in Mr. Drake's house in her articles\\".  2007 FBI raids  In July 2007, armed FBI agents raided the homes of Roark, Binney, and Wiebe, the same people who had filed the complaint with the DoD Inspector General in 2002. Binney claims they pointed guns at his wife and himself. Wiebe said it reminded him of the Soviet Union. None of these people were charged with any crimes. In November 2007, there was a raid on Drake's residence. His computers, documents, and books were confiscated. He was never charged with giving any sensitive information to anyone; the charge actually brought against him is for 'retaining' information (). The FBI tried to get Roark to testify against Drake; she refused. Reporter Gorman was not contacted by the FBI. Drake initially cooperated with the investigation, telling the FBI about the alleged illegality of the NSA's activities. The government created a 'draft indictment' of Drake, prepared by prosecutor Steven Tyrrell. It listed charges as \\"disclosing classified information to a newspaper reporter and for conspiracy\\". Diane Roark, Binney, Wiebe, and Loomis (the complainants to the DoD IG in 2002) were also allegedly listed as \\"unindicted co-conspirators\\". In 2009 a new prosecutor came on the case, William Welch II, and changed the indictment. Some charges were removed, as was any naming of 'co-conspirators'. The new case only contained charges against Drake. Prosecutors wanted Drake to plead guilty, but he refused. He believed that he was innocent of the charges against him. The government wanted him to help prosecute the other whistleblowers. He refused this as well. He later explained his motivations to the Ridenhour Prizes organization:  Indictment  In April 2010, Drake was indicted by a Baltimore grand jury on the following charges: * Willful Retention of National Defense Information (5 counts) ** (793(e) is a modification of the Espionage Act of 1917 made under the McCarran Internal Security Act of 1950) * Obstructing justice (1 count) * Making a False Statement (4 counts) The indictment contained many other allegations, but most of them did not relate to the actual charges against him. He was not specifically charged with unauthorized disclosure of classified information, nor was he charged under , the \\"SIGINT\\" statute. The indictment gave details about his communications with Roark and with Gorman, but he was not charged with any crime directly relating to those communications. The indictment also did not list the names of Gorman or Roark, but they were confirmed by reporters (e.g. Mark Hosenball of Newsweek). Roark's lawyer claimed that the indictment contains a \\"mischaracterization of the facts\\" about the relationship between her client and Drake. Roark herself later spoke out in support of Drake and the other whistleblowers of the Trailblazer project. The \\"willful retention\\" charges regarded five documents allegedly \\"related to the national defense\\" that were found at Drake's residence. The five documents in question were referred to as \\"What a Success\\", \\"the Regular Meetings\\", \\"Volume is our Friend\\", \\"Trial and Testing\\", and \\"Collections Sites\\". \\"What a Success\\" was declassified a few months after Drake was indicted, and should never have been classified in the first place, according to an official complaint filed by J. William Leonard, a former director of the Information Security Oversight Office. \\"Regular Meetings\\" was marked \\"UNCLASSIFIED\\" and posted on NSANet but prosecution argues the defendant should have known it was really classified. Drake's team also argued that the latter three of the five named documents were part of a collection of thousands of unclassified papers related to the DoD Inspector General Report (mentioned above). Drake's defense attorneys argued this meant that the defendant brought home the material accidentally, not \\"willfully.\\" The obstruction charge was related to Drake allegedly deleting documents while he was purportedly aware that the FBI was investigating leaks to the media, and that the FBI was contemplating investigating leaks to Siobhan Gorman of The Baltimore Sun. The false statements charge was filed in relation to the FBI's questioning of Drake without a lawyer present in the initial stages of the investigation when he was cooperating with them. One count is for alleged statements made by him regarding whether he had willfully taken certain documents home. Another count is for allegedly lying about the purported transmission of classified information to Gorman. Drake's defenders point out that the government's own expert found that he had not destroyed any evidence. They also point out that Drake was careful not to give any classified information to Gorman, and that many of the documents in question were 'retroactively classified' after they were seized from his home by the FBI. The federal offices involved in filing the indictment included the DOJ Public Integrity Section, DOJ Criminal Division, DOJ National Security Division, the FBI, and the NSA Office of Security & Counterintelligence. Drake was represented by James Wyda and Deborah Boardman, federal public defenders. Drake was also a client of the Government Accountability Project, a whistleblower non-profit. Jesselyn Radack, director of Homeland Security and Human Rights for GAP, worked with Drake. Author and NSA authority James Bamford was a consultant for Drake's defense as well. Government prosecutor William M. Welch II, who had previously been charged with contempt and removed from the Ted Stevens case, served as the government's initial Senior Litigation Counsel, John P. Pearson of the DOJ Public Integrity Section was the government's Trial Attorney, and Lanny A. Breuer was in charge of overseeing the prosecution. Federal Judge Richard D. Bennett was responsible for hearing handling the case, and initially set trial for June 2011. The Drake case has been written about in the Washington Post, the New York Times, Agence France-Press, Newsweek, Wired, the Washingtonian.com, the Federation of American Scientists' Secrecy News, Politico, and elsewhere.See other refs Jesselyn Radack, of the Government Accountability Project, has also discussed the case.The Huffington Post: Why Thomas Drake Is Not an Enemy of the State. May 19, 2011. The U.S. government publicly stated that the prosecution of Thomas Drake was not intended to deter government employees from reporting problems. \\"Whistle-blowers are the key to many, many department investigations‚Äîwe don't retaliate against them, we encourage them\\", a spokesman for the Justice Department said. \\"This indictment was brought on the merits, and nothing else.\\" = Court proceedings = In the spring of 2011, the prosecution made several moves to restrict the normally open proceedings of a jury trial in a United States courtroom, as reported by Gerstein at Politico and others. This was done under the legal auspices of the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA), which attempts in theory to prevent the release of classified information during open trials. The prosecution also moved to use the controversial \\"silent witness rule,\\" in which exhibits are hidden from the public by the use of \\"code words\\" in court. The government had only attempted to use the rule a handful of times previously; its legality has been challenged under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. The government also moved to restrict cross-examination of witnesses, to restrict jurors from reading the Siobhan Gorman Baltimore Sun articles about problems with NSA and Trailblazer, and to prevent the defense from making arguments or introducing evidence to the courtroom about whistleblowing or overclassification.See under \\"external links,\\" the FAS website of the court documents In addition, the prosecution also had the court seal two exhibits the defense had already published in one of its public court filings, which listed various documents the prosecution would try to use at trial. The prosecution argued that the CIPA also applied to non-classified information and attempted to have unclassified information presented at trial in redacted form only.  Government arguments  Referring to Siobhan Gorman's Baltimore Sun news stories, the government legally pleaded that the \\"newspaper articles are unduly prejudicial. The only purpose for the admission of these newspaper articles is to put NSA on trial.\\" The prosecution also contended that it had no legal obligation to prove Drake's intent to harm national security, saying that it \\"does not have to prove that defendant intended to harm the country\\" under the specific part of the Espionage Act that Drake was charged with; . As for the 'overclassification' defense, the government argued that such a defense claim would be 'confusing to the jury' and thus irrelevant to the charges. The government also argued that any discussion at trial of the legal concept of whistle-blowing would likewise be irrelevant to the charges.  Final disposition  In early June, shortly after the May 22, 2011, broadcast of a 60 Minutes episode on the Drake case, the government dropped all of the charges against Drake and agreed not to seek any jail time in return for Drake's agreement to plead guilty to a single misdemeanor of misusing the agency's computer system. At the July sentencing hearing the presiding judge, Richard D. Bennett of Maryland's Federal District Court, issued harsh words for the government, saying that it was \\"unconscionable\\" to charge a defendant, two years after his home was searched, with a list of serious crimes that could have resulted in 35 years in prison, only to drop the 10 counts of the indictment on the eve of trial. Expressing his \\"irritation\\" with the prosecution, Bennett also completely rejected the government's request for a $50,000 fine, despite the sentencing guidelines recommending a fine of $500-$5,000. He noted that Drake had been financially devastated, spending $82,000 on his defense, losing his $154,600 job at the NSA and his pension, and being fired from his university teaching position. He sentenced Drake to one year of probation and 240 hours of community service.  Since 2012  Drake appeared on The Daily Show on August 6, 2012, to talk about the history of his case,Episode #17135: A Leak of Their Own - License to Spill and in September sent an audio message of support to CryptoParty. On March 15, 2013, Drake spoke at a National Press Club Luncheon about the national intelligence community and its attitude towards whistle-blowing. Drake inspired Edward Snowden to leak information on the NSA spying program PRISM in June 2013.WNYC June 26, 2013, The Takeaway. available at http://www.thetakeaway.org/2013/jun/26/nsa-leaker-thomas-drake- edward-snowdens-case/ accessed 7-7-13 Snowden went public rather than reporting within the system due to the reprisals against Drake (and other whistleblowers), which led the Assistant Defense Dept Inspector General (DoD IG) in charge of the whistleblower unit, John Crane, to himself become a whistleblower when it became apparent that Drake's identity had been leaked by DoD IG to the Justice Dept.\\"Blowing the Whistle: Former US Official Reveals Risks Faced by Internal Critics\\", by Mark Hertsgaard, Felix Kasten, Marcel Rosenbach, and Holger Stark; Der Spiegel 05/22/2016 Drake has become an activist against the surveillance state, frequently giving interviews and speaking at events such as Restore the Fourth and Stand Up For Truth. One of the themes of his speeches and interviews is a \\"privacy exercise\\" as follows \\"Put your entire life in a box, your documents, bank accounts, your passwords, everything‚Äîand give it to a complete stranger‚Äîa fellow American for safekeeping. Would you do it?\\" he states that he has yet to encounter a \\"yes\\". In a September 2013 interview, Drake reaffirmed his belief that the problems of the NSA are so chronic and systemic that the only solution would be to completely dismantle and subsequently rebuild the entire organization. On July 3, 2014, Drake along with former Technical Director of the NSA William Binney gave testimony to the German Parliamentary Committee investigating the NSA spying scandal. He described the close cooperation between the NSA and the German secret service BND.Bundesnachrichtendienst \\"ein Wurmfortsatz der NSA\\", FAZ July 4, 2014 On November 10, 2015, Drake appeared on a PEN American Center panel at the Newseum about \\"Secret Sources: Whistleblowers, National Security and Free Expression.\\" In 2014 Drake supported the international launch of The Whistler founded by Eileen Chubb and Gavin MacFadyen. In 2015 The Whistleblower Interview Project published Drake's contribution to the project.  Espionage Act and whistleblowing  Drake is one of four individuals in the history of the United States who has been charged specifically with \\"willful retention\\" of \\"national defense\\" information under . Most prosecutions are for \\"delivery\\" of classified information to a third party‚Äîsomething that Drake was not charged with. This particular portion of the Espionage Act was created in 1950 during the Second Red Scare, as part of the McCarran Internal Security Act. Anthony Russo and Daniel Ellsberg were the first to be prosecuted for the \\"retention\\" of what came to be known as the Pentagon Papers, which Ellsberg gave to the New York Times, eventually resulting in another landmark Espionage Act case in 1971, New York Times Co. v. United States. The prosecution of Russo and Ellsberg was dismissed in 1972 because of government misconduct. The second prosecution was of Samuel Loring Morison in 1985, a Navy analyst who sold satellite photographs to Jane's Defence Weekly; he was later pardoned by President Bill Clinton. The third was the American Israel Public Affairs Committee case in 2005, United States v. Franklin, Rosen, and Weissman. Founding member of the Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity Drake is a founding member of the Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity. In September 2015, Drake and 27 other members of VIPS steering group wrote a letter to the President challenging a recently published book, that claimed to rebut the report of the United States Senate Intelligence Committee on the CIA's use of torture.  Related media works  In 2014, a documentary called Silenced, in which Drake was featured, was released. It was nominated for an Emmy Award in 2016. Having an analogous theme as the Oscar-winning documentary Citizenfour, which portrays similar treatment of Edward Snowden, Silenced has been the official selection and recipient of several awards from multiple film festivals even before its release to major cable networks in March 2015. Also in 2014, Drake's involvement with Thinthread, his subsequent indictment, etc., along with others associated with his activities (Roark, Binney, Wiebe, Loomis), and Snowden were featured in a PBS documentary, \\"United States of Secrets\\". Drake is featured throughout the 2016 documentary Nothing to Hide, regarding government surveillance and internet privacy.

It is a National Natural Landmark managed by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources. Located close to the northern border of the state of Iowa, the nearest towns are Chester and Lime Springs. History The prairie commemorates botanist Ada Hayden (1884‚Äì1950). An Iowa farm girl, Hayden studied at the Missouri Botanical Garden (MBG) and Iowa State University (ISU) and earned a PhD in biology in 1918, one of the first women to earn this distinction in the U.S. She became an assistant professor of botany at ISU, devoting her personal and professional life to the defense of the fast- disappearing tallgrass prairies of her native state. During her working lifetime, most of the remaining patches of tallgrass that had survived the rush of Euro-American settlement in the 1800s were falling to the plowshare. Finally in 1940, the state of Iowa allocated $100 to Hayden for gasoline to drive around Iowa and identify what was left. A small number of remaining prairie patches were identified, including the parcel of land that was to become Hayden Prairie. In 1945, the state of Iowa purchased this parcel for $10,001, approximately $42/acre.. After Hayden's death in 1950, the Hayden Prairie was renamed in her honor. It was listed as a National Natural Landmark in 1965, and as an Iowa State Preserve in 1968. It has been managed by controlled burning since 1971. Ecology The Hayden Prairie is a remnant of the tallgrass prairie ecosystem that once made up 75 to 80 percent of Iowa‚Äôs landscape. Although this remnant is only in size ‚Äì less than a half section of land ‚Äì it is the largest remaining parcel of tallgrass prairies surviving in Iowa outside of the Loess Hills on the western border of the state. More than 200 plant species, including 100 species of wildflowers, have been identified in Hayden Prairie. Hayden Prairie is especially noted for a display of shooting stars peaking around the U.S. holiday of Memorial Day. 46 species of birds, and over 20 species of butterflies, have also been identified in Hayden Prairie.

He was an influential figure in 19th-century Gujarati literature, and was one of several Gujarati writers and educators involved in the debate over social reforms, focusing on issues such as the status of women, child marriage, and the question of whether widows could remarry. He held Eastern civilisation in high esteem, and resisted the influence of Western civilisation, a position which drew him into conflicts with other social reformers of a less conservative outlook. He considered himself a \\"reformer along religious lines\\". Manilal's writings belong to the Pandit Yuga, or \\"Scholar Era\\" ‚Äì a time in which Gujarati writers explored their traditional literature, culture and religion in order to redefine contemporary Indian identity when it was subject to challenge from the influential Western model introduced under colonial rule. His works include Atmanimajjan, a collection of poems on the theme of love in the context of Advaita (non-duality) philosophy; Kanta, a play combining Sanskrit and English dramatic techniques; Nrusinhavatar, a play based on Sanskrit dramatic traditions; Pranavinimaya, a study of yoga and mysticism; and Siddhantasara, a historical critique of the world's religious philosophies. His faith in Shankara's Advaita philosophy provided the fundamental underpinning for his philosophical thought. He was invited to present a paper at the first Parliament of World Religions, held in Chicago in 1893, but financial considerations made his participation there impossible. Manilal's beliefs led him to search for perfection and love in his friendships with men and women, though he was often disappointed by his experiences. He married at the age of thirteen and had two children, but his wife left him in 1890. He had multiple sexual relationships with women, and also visited brothels, where he contracted syphilis. He suffered from frequent bouts of serious illnesses throughout his life and died prematurely at 40. Narmad, the founder of modern Gujarati literature, considered Manilal his intellectual heir. Manilal elaborated upon Narmad's line of thinking through his writings in the monthlies Priyamvada and Sudarshan, which he edited from 1885 until his death. Biography Manilal Nabhubhai Dwivedi was born on 26September 1858 at Nadiad, Gujarat, to a Sathodara Nagar family. His grandfather, Bhailal Dave, left eleven thousand rupees and a house to Manilal's father, Nabhubhai, who worked as a moneylender and sometimes as a temple priest. Nabhubhai had little education but desired that his son learn enough to work as a clerk, and therefore had him attend school from age four. Manilal obtained his Bachelor of Arts from alt=Building of Elphinstone College, Bombay alt=Building of Shamaldas College, Bhavnagar He showed good progress at secondary school; he was ranked first in the annual examination of the second standard and won a prize. His teacher promoted him to the fourth standard, but Manilal was unhappy with the promotion and requested to be returned to the third standard. He was not proficient in Sanskrit and geometry, and failed Sanskrit in his matriculation examination in 1875. However, he was ranked second in examinations at Bombay University the following year, winning the James Taylor Prize. He joined Elphinstone College in 1877 and graduated with a bachelor of arts in history and politics in 1880. Under pressure from his father to earn a wage, he left the college and completed his master of arts studies as an autodidact. He returned to Nadiad, and in July 1880, became an assistant teacher at the government high school. In 1881, he was transferred to Bombay as a deputy education inspector of girls' schools. He joined Samaldas College in Bhavnagar as a professor of Sanskrit in 1885 but retired in 1889 due to health problems. From November 1892 to July 1893, he stayed at Patan, Gujarat, preparing a catalogue of more than two thousand manuscripts from Jain libraries. This resulted in the establishment of the Baroda State Archaeology Department, which he headed from December 1893 to July 1895. Manilal was a delegate from Nadiad to the Indian National Congress's Bombay convention in 1889. In 1890 he was elected as secretary of the Congress committee of Kheda district, and that year he was also hired by the Universities of both Bombay and Punjab to be an Sanskrit examiner for their BA and MA examinations. He retained both positions until 1892, and was chairman of the Nadiad Municipality school committee from 1891 to 1893. Dhirubhai Thaker, a biographer of Manilal, noted that Manilal had an impressive personality and was tall and handsome in appearance. He habitually wore a long coat, a brahmin-style dhoti, a red turban and a long loose scarf hanging over his shoulders. Personal life In 1871 or 1872 Manilal married Mahalaxmi; he was then thirteen years old and she was four. She gave birth to two sons, one in 1882 and the other in 1887; but the marriage was unhappy and she frequently returned to her parents' house, leaving Manilal permanently in 1890. Manilal was obsessed with the idea of a perfect loving relationship, and was demanding of his friends, expecting them to treat the friendship as more important than their other relationships. The resulting strain cost him several friendships. He was equally demanding of his women friends; in some cases the relationship included sex, though again he was often disappointed by the outcomes. While he was in Bombay, he fell in love with the wife of an acquaintance, and spent hours each day with her. He composed poetry for her, but gave up the relationship and left for Bhavnagar when he discovered he was not her only lover. Another affair was with Diwalibai, a teacher in a Bombay girls' school; Manilal initially rejected her but she persisted, sending him a series of love letters, and he finally wrote back, agreeing to a written correspondence. He refused to see her in person, however, and she died of tuberculosis in January 1886. Manilal's obituary for her in his magazine Priyamvada was unemotional, but his journal records his regret that he did not respond to her: \\"Fool that you were, you did not respond nor could you enjoy!\\". Diwalibai's letters were first published by Ambalal Purani in the November 1936 issue of Kaumudi, a Gujarati monthly. They were reproduced in Manilal's autobiography Atmavrittanta as an appendix. In 1891, Manilal began an affair with Ramlakshmi, the wife of his pupil Chhotu, which lasted two-and-a-half years. He also had a brief affair with Chhotu's mistress, Ladi. In his autobiography, he admitted to having had sexual relationships with a close friend's wife, his wife's aunt, a woman seeking a job, a local woman, several prostitutes, servants, and the daughter of a close friend. Long term health problems and death In his autobiography, Atmavrittanta, Manilal says that he visited brothels during his college years, and contracted syphilis as a result. As early as his first term there in 1877, he became aware he had genital chancres, but, unfamiliar with syphilis and its long-term effects, he failed to seek treatment as they healed on their own. Later, he suffered from a severe bout of rheumatism. Four years later, he again began to suffer from penile ulcers, and by the following year, 1882, a rash of secondary syphilitic lesions erupted all over his body, with cysts forming on both his hands and feet. He put up with this painful condition for well over a year, and eventually gained a measure of relief. When the symptoms resurfaced in 1886, he consulted doctors who diagnosed him as suffering from tertiary syphilis. The advance of the disease caused an ulceration of his nostrils and sinuses, and further damage to his respiratory tract. Due to the corrosive effects of the infection on his tonsils and soft palate, he lost his ability to articulate and found it difficult to swallow food. He was treated over the following two years in Bombay and then Nadiad, and experienced a slight alleviation of his symptoms by 1888, after a successful operation for a plate implant. The operation enabled him to recover his speech and resume his job at Bhavnagar, though his painful nasal and throat ulcerations persisted and required follow-up treatment in Bombay. Manilal's confidence returned to the point that by January 1889, he felt sure a complete cure was possible, and indeed, by June, he experienced a notable improvement in both his general health and his speaking ability. In September 1898, he developed jaundice and pleurisy. He died on the morning of 1October 1898 while writing at his home in Nadiad. Philosophy and social reform Manilal was an adherent of Advaitism, a Hindu philosophical school that considers only Brahman to be ultimately real. He believed that the self and God are not different in any way, and he argued that the Bhagavad Gita teaches this point of view rather than being a philosophical precursor of Advaitism. He believed that withdrawal from the world, as a religious practice, was wrong, and that instead one should fulfil one's duties, and sacrifice oneself for love of the world. Without a dualism between the self and the world, self-sacrifice becomes its own reward, and there is no expectation of a worldly reward: instead the soul receives \\"the joy of self-realization\\" in discovering that it and the world are not different. Manilal's beliefs were the basis of his ethics and of his approach to the social reform questions of the day. By the late nineteenth century, a social reform movement was well established in Bombay and Gujarat, including early Gujarati writers such as Narmad, Dalpatram, Karsandas Mulji, and Navalram Pandya. Many reformers ‚Äì the \\"modernists\\" ‚Äì wanted to abandon traditional customs and adopt Western practices, these were \\"outer reforms\\", in Thaker's words, directed at such things as equal rights for women and the elimination of caste restrictions. Manilal was associated with the orthodox reaction to this movement, known as revivalists, who believed in \\"reforms along national lines\\". Manilal was often critical of old customs, but he argued that true reform should not begin with simply abandoning Indian culture; his message, in the words of K.M. Munshi, was \\"No surrender to the West\\". Despite his vehement opposition to much of the social reformers' agenda, he considered himself to be a reformer ‚Äì \\"a reformer along religious lines\\", since he believed that reforming religious ideas would lead to appropriate social reform. For example, he agreed with those arguing against caste-restrictions on social behavior, but did not approve of achieving this goal by concealing or lying about someone's caste. He argued that although the caste system was harmful, abolishing it without changing the underlying social attitudes would fail, as social discrimination would continue in a different form. The difference between Manilal's approach and that of the modernists was apparent in the controversy over marriage customs in the 1880s. In 1885, Manilal published his essay Nari Pratishtha. In this essay, he opposed widow- marriage, which was traditionally forbidden even if the prospective husband died after betrothal but before the wedding, and argued that a woman who understood her moral duties would not wish to remarry should she become a widow. The reformer Behramji Malabari was attempting to move the government to legally establish an age of consent for women, and to legislate in favour of widow-remarriage. Manilal believed that marriage between Hindus was a religious, rather than worldly act, and hence the government had no standing to determine what was right. He and Malabari entered into a public disagreement on the issue which continued for six months in the pages of Advocate of India and The Indian Spectator. Malabari tried to persuade Manilal to give up his opposition to this; Manilal refused. A meeting of orthodox Hindus in the Madhav Baug which discussed some of these issues concluded that the help of the Government was not welcome with regard to marriage customs; an attempt to amend this statement to acknowledge that some changes to marriage customs were necessary, though the government should not be involved, was unable to gain support. Manilal defended the Madhav Baug meeting, arguing that it would be wrong for the government to enforce changes. Instead, Manilal found support for changes in the rules of widow-marriage in his reading of scriptures: by a controversial interpretation of a sentence from the Parasharasmriti, a work on legal code and conduct, he asserted that a betrothed woman who has not yet married can marry another man if her intended husband dies. In Manilal's view, child-marriage was harmful but it was rare for the woman in such a marriage to actually go to her husband's household before puberty, and he felt that the reformers were exaggerating the problem in order to gain support. It was during the controversy over the Madhav Baug meeting that the case of Rukmabai became public. Rukmabai had been married at thirteen years of age, but had refused to live with her husband for nine years. Her husband filed suit to force her to live with him, and the Bombay High Court found in his favour; Manilal wrote articles attacking the reformist position, which further estranged him from the modernists. Reformers such as Ramanbhai Neelkanth spoke out against Manilal's conservatism. Manilal criticised the Prarthana Samaj for importing the concept of God as a transcendental creator from Christianity, which, according to him, was \\"the fifth edition of Aryadharma (Indian religion)\\". On behalf of the Prarthana Samaj, Neelkanth entered into a seven-year dispute with Manilal on numerous topics related to religion, philosophy, social reform, education and literature. Their public debates, carried on in the pages of Manilal's Sudarashan and Neelkanth's Jnanasudha, are considered unparalleled in Gujarat's history of reflective literature. Overall, Manilal was critical of both the modernists' approach and of cultural orthodoxy in isolation; he argued that \\"there is no antagonism between the Old and the New. Both are essential qualities ‚Äì inherent in everyone. The world cannot go on if the two were not blended together\\". His unwillingness to support legislative reforms that did not address the underlying cultural and religious beliefs led him to be labelled as a conservative, despite his belief that the caste system, traditional marriage customs, and the inequality of men and women in Indian society were problems that needed to be resolved.  Social reform organizations  At the age of 15, he, along with his friends, started a small local group of Prarthana Samaj in Nadiad. In Bombay, he was associated with the Gujarat Social Union, an association of Gujarati graduates. He took a keen interest in mesmerism and occultism. He came into contact with Colonel Henry Steel Olcott, the first President of the Theosophical Society, and became a member in 1882, writing a series of articles on theosophy. Manilal was the secretary of Buddhi Vardhak Sabha, a group of Bombay intellectuals interested in social reform issues that had been founded in 1850 but which had become inactive. Manilal relaunched it at the suggestion of his friend Mansukhram Suryaram Tripathi and the group's activities brought him in contact with Narmad, who later saw Manilal as his successor in the field of social reform. Works Manilal's writings belong to the Pandit Yuga ‚Äì an era in which Gujarati writers explored the traditional literature, culture and religion to redefine contemporary Indian identity when it was challenged by the Western culture brought by the colonial rule. His writing career began in 1876 with the poem Shiksha Shatak and continued until his death. He contributed to almost all popular forms and published poems, plays, essays, an adaptation of an English novel, book reviews, literary criticism, research, edited works, translations, and compilations. His autobiography was not published until 1979. His prose writings have been collected in Sudarshan Gadyawali (1909). He was an exponent of Advaita philosophy; throughout his life, he interpreted all aspects of human life and civilisation in the context of Advaita Vedanta, writing several articles and books on the topic. Literary works In 1882, Manilal published his play Kanta. A fusion of Sanskrit drama and Shakespearean tragedy, the play had the first tragic hero in Gujarati drama. Manilal wrote another play, Nrusinhavatar (1896), at the request of the Mumbai Gujarati Natak Company. It was based on Hindu mythological episodes, and was staged in 1899 after his death. Amar Asha, a ghazal by Manilal Dwivedi, in his handwriting Manilal based his poetry collection Atmanimajjan (1895) on his own experiences, with the theme of love. It largely consisted of ghazals in the style of Persian Sufis. Despite flaws of language, such as the misuse of Persian words, they were held to capture the spirit of the ghazal according to critic Mansukhlal Jhaveri. Through them, Manilal illustrated the concepts of the Advaita Vedanta, and expressed his disappointments and his cravings for love. His ghazal \\"Amar Asha\\" is popular in Gujarati. He adapted Edward Bulwer-Lytton's novel Zanoni into Gujarati as Gulabsinh (1897). According to Thaker, \\"Gulabsinh occupies an important place in Gujarati literature as a unique adaptation of an English novel, and as a novel of occult interest and a rare love-story of a human and a superhuman character.\\" It was later adapted into the Gujarati plays Prataplakshmi (1914) by Mulshankar Mulani and Siddha Satyendra (1917) by Chhotalal Rukhdev Sharma. After his death, the manuscript of Manilal's autobiography, Atmavrittanta, was in the possession of Manilal's disciple, the scholar Anandshankar Dhruv, who never allowed it to be published for fear that it would damage Manilal's reputation. It was finally published in 1979, eighty years after Manilal's death. It created a stir due to its outspoken nature and its unreserved accounts of his moral lapses, including his extramarital sexual relationships. Religious and philosophical writings Manilal made Vedantic philosophy popular among the Gujarati community, examining the main features of Indian philosophy and of Hinduism. He imparted to Gujarati readers an awareness of the foundation of their religion and culture. He argued in his writings that the native culture of India was superior to that of the West. He was recognised both in India and in abroad as a staunch proponent of ancient Hindu traditions and as a learned Indian philosopher. Shortly after moving to Bhavnagar, Manilal published a book in English entitled Raja Yoga (), in 1885. This reproduced a lecture he had delivered on the topic of 'The Logic of Commonsense', together with an introduction to theosophist Tookaram Tatya's English version of the Bhagavad Gita. The book also contained his English versions of the Vakyasudha and the Aparokshanubhuti. The English orientalist Edwin Arnold, who met with Manilal in Bhavnagar and conversed with him at length, admired the book for its content and clarity. Shortly after its publication, Manilal received a letter inviting him to speak in the 7th Oriental Congress in Vienna, which was to be held in December 1886. However, the political agent of Saurashtra decided to replace Manilal with another candidate, R. G. Bhandarkar. Manilal wrote two articles for later Oriental Congresses: the first on The Purans (Philosophy verses Symbology), which was written for the 8th Oriental Congress held in Stockholm in 1889; and another on Jain philosophy for the 9th Oriental Congress held in London in 1892. He was awarded a certificate of merit for the second article. Manilal wrote two books intended as a response to the Westernised reformist movement of his age. The first, Pranavinimaya, contained practical expressions of spiritualism according to Hindu philosophy. It was written from 2 August to 9 September 1888 and published in December. It addresses mesmerism and presents a study of yoga and mysticism; it attempts to establish a similarity between mesmerism and yoga, and to establish the superiority of spiritualism over materialism. The second book, Siddhantasara, was a discourse on the theoretical aspects of Advaita philosophy in the context of other world religions. Manilal began writing it shortly after Pranavinimaya, though his work was delayed by illness. It was completed in March 1889 and published in June. It outlines the development of Indian philosophy and makes a case for the superiority of Advaita philosophy over all other religious philosophies. It created prolonged controversy; many were particularly critical of what they regarded as logical lapses and inconsistencies in Manilal's arguments. He was invited to present a paper at the first Parliament of World Religions, held in Chicago in 1893, but he could not afford to go. His paper on Hinduism was read there by Virchand Gandhi. Manilal wrote several books in English which were well received in India, Europe and America, including Monism or Advaitism? (1889) and Advaita Philosophy. He published an anthology of the aphorisms of Vedanta under the title The Imitation of Shankara (1895), with simultaneous publication in Gujarati as Panchashati. Social reform and educational writings In 1884, Manilal published Nari Pratishtha in eight installments in the weekly periodical Gujarati. It was republished, with additions, in book form in 1885. It deals with the status of women in Hindu tradition, and lays out Manilal's beliefs: in his view women were more capable of love and more dutiful than men, and that should be the focus of their education, though he also believed they should be taught subjects such as science and history. He believed that \\"a couple joined in love is undivided by death\\", so he considered widow remarriage a sin. He was opposed to teaching women English, and he believed that women's menstruation meant that they should not work outside the home. In 1885, Manilal founded and edited a magazine called Priyamvada to discuss the problems faced by Indian womanhood. At the time, most Gujarati women were uneducated, and the magazine did not draw the response he had hoped for from the women's community, so in 1890 he renamed it Sudarshan, and made it wider in scope. He elaborated upon Narmad's line of thinking through his writings in these magazines which he edited until his death. Sudarshan Gadyawali (1909) collects these articles, which cover subjects such as religion, education, sociology, economics, politics, literature and music. According to Jhaveri, with these magazines, Manilal emerged as the acknowledged master of Gujarati prose. Bal Vilas (1897) is a collection of Manilal's essays on religion and morality, written for schoolgirls. Translations Manilal translated the Sanskrit plays Malatimadhava and Uttararamacarita by Bhavabhuti into Gujarati. Of these, Uttararamacarita was considered an excellent translation by Jhaveri. Manilal also translated Samuel Smiles's Character into Gujarati as Charitra (1895), and Samuel Neil's Culture and Self-Culture as Shikhsna ane Svashikshan (1897). He translated the Bhagavad Gita with commentary into Gujarati. He prepared with translation and notes the English editions of Patanjali's Yogadarshan and Mandukya Upanishad for the Theosophical Societies of India and America respectively.  Reception  Plaque at Manilal's birth place Manilal, along with his fellow Gujarati writer Govardhanram Tripathi, significantly contributed to Gujarati literature. The period of their activity (1885‚Äì1905) is recognised as the Mani-Govardhan Era rather than by a general terms such as Sakshar Yuga or Pandit Yuga. Anandshankar Dhruv publicly described Manilal as a Brahmanishtha (one who always keeps his mind fixed on the Supreme Brahman, the ultimate reality). Thaker wrote a biographical play, Uncho Parvat Undi Khin (1993; 'Lofty Mountain, Cavernous Valley'), based on Manilal's life. Manilal occupies a distinctive place in Gujarati literature. Throughout his life, he struggled at both a personal and public level to live up to the practical principles he elicited from his reading of the Advaita Vedanta tradition. His vision combined an ardent advocacy of Aryan philosophy with a Hindu worldview. He endeavoured to publicise his opinions to counteract what he saw as the blind enthusiasm of his fellow Indians for Western culture. Manilal thought that the non-dualistic philosophy of Advaita Vedanta, despite its complexity, contained important values which could inspire people to lead practical lives while remaining faithful to its ideals. Mahatma Gandhi, during his first stint in gaol in South Africa in January 1908, read widely in the literature of Western writers such as Tolstoy, Thoreau and Emerson to enlarge his vision and, \\"among the masters of Indian philosophy\\", he turned to Manilal's book on Raja Yoga and his commentary on Bhagavad Gita.

The battle is significant for being the last occurrence of any major resistance during the English Peasants' Revolt of 1381. Despenser succeeded in suppressing the rebellion that broke out throughout East Anglia that summer. His force at first consisted of his own retinue, but numbers swelled as aristocrats saw both his victories and the harsh retribution meted out to the rebels. He moved across East Anglia towards Norwich and then onwards to North Walsham to deal with the rebels, led by Geoffrey Litster, the so-called 'King of the Commons'. At North Walsham the rebels were decisively defeated by Despenser's men. Medieval chroniclers differ in their accounts of exactly what happened at North Walsham. After the battle, Litster was captured and executed by Despenser, but the records of the time and subsequent histories disagree on the fate of his rebel army. Background The Black Death played a key part in producing the conditions for the Peasants' Revolt. Fragment of a miniature from The Chronicles of Gilles Li Muisis (Biblioth√®que royale de Belgique). The Peasants' Revolt of 1381 was a major rebellion that spread throughout medieval England during the summer of that year. Its causes are complex. The drop in population caused by the Black Death, which arrived in England in 1348, resulted in an acute labour shortage and consequently, higher wages. The Statute of Labourers (1351) was a law enacted during the first parliament of Edward III, to make labour laws and their intended enforcement more precise and detailed, and also to allow the government to control wages. It had the effect of making life more difficult for peasants, but more profitable for the wealthy landowners. Further discontent erupted from the behaviour of those nobles who ruled on behalf of the boy-king Richard II, and also from the position of the church; as many priests were ill-educated, and the bishops and abbots themselves were landowners, it was generally hated by the common people. Feelings were stirred up by rebellious priests such as John Ball, who criticised the church wherever the common people flocked to him to listen to his words. The Revolt began in Essex, following the introduction of a succession of highly unpopular poll taxes levied against the English population. In 1377 the expense of the Hundred Years' War had caused the government to introduce a poll tax of four pence. By 1380 this had tripled, but as many refused to pay, revenues dropped. The imposition of a third poll tax in 1381 prompted unrest in Essex and Kent, which then spread all over England. According to the Anonimalle Chronicle, the 'evil actions' of the commons in both Essex and Kent were 'because of the exceptionally severe tenths and fifteenths and other subsidies lightly conceded in parliaments and extortionately levied from the poor people'. Most serious of all were events that occurred in London on 13‚Äì15 June. During the summer, rebels from Kent and Essex marched to London and, once admitted to the city, managed to capture the Tower of London. Richard, who had promised to agree to all the demands of the peasants, met the rebels outside the city, where the peasants' leader, Wat Tyler, was killed and the rebellion was ended. Once they were defeated it became clear to the rebels that they had failed to gain Richard's support. Whilst the king was at Waltham, in Essex, a proclamation was issued condemning the rebels and denying that he had ever approved of their actions. At Waltham, Richard refused to ratify the promises he made, as he believed they had been extorted by force, adding, \\"Villeins ye are still, and villeins ye shall remain\\", and threatening vengeance upon those who had rebelled. The rebellions in Essex, Kent and London spread to many other English counties. In Norfolk, the rebellion started on 14 June, when a group of rebels from Suffolk reached the county, and spread westwards towards the Fens and north-eastwards towards Norwich and Yarmouth. As in other parts of the country there was widespread unrest, during which property and official documents were destroyed and several individuals were summarily executed.An Historical Atlas of Norfolk The leaders Henry le Despenser, the 'Fighting Bishop', depicted on a misericord in King's Lynn Minster Henry le Despenser (c. 1341‚Äì1406) was an English nobleman who in his early life had been a soldier in Italy, and who in 1370 became Bishop of Norwich. He obtained a reputation as the 'Fighting Bishop' after playing his part in suppressing the Norfolk rebels during the Peasants' Revolt, and later embarking on an ill-fated enterprise for Pope Urban VI, who in 1382 employed him to lead a crusade in Flanders against the supporters of the anti-pope Clement VII. For his defeat at the siege of Ypres (1383), Despenser was impeached in Parliament, attainted and deprived of his lands. He later regained his lands and favour with the king. In 1399 Henry Bolingbroke landed at Ravenspur in Yorkshire and the military campaign that followed resulted in Richard's abdication. Despenser remained true to Richard: he was subsequently imprisoned, but was afterwards reconciled with the new king. Henry le Despenser died in his diocese at North Elmham on 23 August 1406. Little is known of Geoffrey Litster (also named by medieval chroniclers as Iohanne Lyttestere and Jekke Litster), a moderately wealthy dyer from the village of Felmingham in Norfolk. He is first recorded in the returns made by the collectors of the 1379 poll tax in Norfolk. As peasants, he and his men would have been both untrained and unequipped to fight Despenser's fully armed and trained force. Geoffrey Litster was captured after the battle and executed soon afterwards at North Walsham. Events in Norfolk before the battle During the summer of 1381, insurrection spread from the south-east of the country to other parts of England, including the diocese of Norwich, where the rebellion lasted less than a fortnight. On 14 June a group of rebels reached Thetford, and from there the revolt spread over south-western Norfolk towards the Fens. At the same time the rebels, led by Geoffrey Litster, moved across the north-eastern part of the county and tried to raise support throughout the local area. Over the next few days, the rebels converged on Norwich, Lynn and Swaffham. Norwich, then one of the largest and most important cities in the realm, was taken and occupied by Litster and his followers, who caused considerable damage to the property and possessions of anyone they perceived as an enemy (such as poll tax collectors and important officials) once they managed to enter the city. The Norwich rebels then travelled to Yarmouth, destroying legal records and landowners' possessions, while other insurgents moving across north-east Norfolk destroyed court rolls and taxation documents. There were numerous incidents of pillage and extortion across the whole county. The Anonimalle Chronicle gives a clear account of the unrest in East Anglia. On hearing of the rebellion, Henry le Despenser acted swiftly, moving through Cambridgeshire, Suffolk and Norfolk from his home in Burley, Rutland. His armed force initially consisted of his personal retinue, but ultimately became a much larger force consisting of many knights and other men who had previously not dared to confront the rebels. According to the historian Edgar Powell, Henry Dispenser undertook the task of dealing with the revolt in his diocese and punishing the rebels. He was involved in crushing rebellions at Peterborough and elsewhere, before moving on to suppress the revolts in Cambridge. The authorities were alerted to the call in Norfolk for men to join the revolt in the name of Litster. On 17 June the rebels from the north and east of the county assembled on Mousehold Heath, outside Norwich: shortly afterwards, Sir Robert Salle, who had come out of the city to speak with the commons, was killed. According to Thomas Walsingham, the knight died soon after he was 'knocked on the head by a rustic who was one of his own serfs'. The rebels then entered Norwich and wreaked havoc, destroying property and killing several prominent citizens. Other houses and church properties within the county (such as at Yarmouth) were attacked by the rebels at this time. Geoffrey Litster was at Thorpe Market on 21 June and by the next day Despenser had reached nearby Felmingham. Hearing that the rebels were close, Despenser travelled the short distance from Felmingham to North Walsham Heath, where he encountered Litster and his men. The battle and its aftermath There are no eyewitness accounts of the battle that was fought at North Walsham on 25 or 26 June 1381. The contemporary chronicler Thomas Walsingham related that there was a fierce engagement at North Walsham Heath, south of the town, in which \\"the warlike Bishop\\" led a successful attack on the rebels' entrenched position. The Escheators' Inquisitions for the period that name Litster also included the names of rebels from North Walsham who were killed, giving strong evidence that the rebels suffered a severe defeat. According to Thomas Walsingham, the rebels were routed as they fled through woodland and cut down as they were found. Writing in the 19th century, Walter Rye quoted a local man, \\"They dew say a'mazin' lot of men are buried in that pightle\\".pightle = A small field or enclosure; a paddock, a close. (\\"pightle, n.\\". Oxford English Dictionary Online. November 2010. Oxford University Press. (accessed 25 December 2010).'The scene of the massacre, and possibly of Litester's execution, was on the Norwich side of North Walsham, whither, no doubt, most of the rebels were driven out by the Bishop's rush from the Antingham side of the town. The shaft of a stone cross still stands in the crook of the road to mark the spot. \\"They dew say a 'mazin' lot of men are buried in that pightle,' as a rustic told me once.\\" (Rye, W., A Popular History of the County of Norfolk, p. 55 (Stock, 1885)) The local belief that the parish church at North Walsham was the scene of a bloodbath after the battle cannot be substantiated using historical documents.Many sources of information tell of a massacre in North Walsham, in Chase's account of events: 'The rebels ... fled in confusion back to the town, many seeking refuge in the church which, perhaps, they had helped to build. The wayside cross ... is said to mark the spot where the battle was fought. There are the remains of two other crosses on the supposed battle site, which was then all heath. Bishop Le Spencer followed the rebels, and slew all who were captured, showing no respect for the sanctuary to which they had retreated.' According to The Book of Illustrious Henries, written by the 15th-century historian John Capgrave, very little fighting took place. The chronicler related that, \\"But by the good management of the bishop, and of other men who had assembled there, the whole people surrendered, rejoicing that they might withdraw in peace. Jack Litster himself, leaping over a wall, hid himself in a corn-field\\". Inevitably the rebels' 'king' was found. Walsingham and Capgrave agree that after Geoffrey Litster's capture, he was taken to North Walsham and was there drawn, hanged and quartered. According to Capgrave's chronicle, \\"The traitor was sought and found; he was captured and beheaded; and, divided into four parts, he was sent through the country to Norwich, Yarmouth, and Lynn, and to the site of his mansion; that rebels and insurgents against the peace might learn by what end they will finish their career\\". Walsingham wrote an account of the mercy shown by the bishop to Litster during his execution: \\"After hearing his confession and absolving him by virtue of his office, he followed him to the gallows, showing, although he had overcome him, a deed of kindness and piety, for he supported his head lest it should be bruised by the ground when he was being drawn to the hanging\\". Litster's widow Agnes was later pursued by the authorities and was made to settle his outstanding debts (for the sum of 33 shillings and nine pence).http://www.open2.net/historyandthearts/history/tax_script_p.html Transcript from the OU/BBC programme Breaking The Seal.

The site of the battle is one of only five battlefields in Norfolk that are recognised by Norfolk County Council. Norfolk Heritage Explorer website (search results for battlefields in Norfolk) The battle was commemorated by three medieval stone crosses: one is on private land; another (now a stump) was relocated by North Walsham Urban District Council in 1932 and can be found near the roadside by the town's water towers; the third cross was moved and used as a parish boundary marker. It is situated on Toff's Loke, off Norwich Road.http://www.country.griffon.org.uk/_GC/documents/85.doc A sculpture in the Memorial Park, North Walsham, carved in 1999 by Mark Goldsworthy from the trunk of a 120-year-old oak tree, commemorates the 1381 battle. North Walsham's town sign contains a mosaic depicting the Peasants' Revolt. An over- the-top reenactment of the battle appears in the second episode of This Time with Alan Partridge.

He left office in March 2010 when Acting President Goodluck Jonathan dissolved his cabinet. Gada was born in 1954. He attended Bayero University, Kano and Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria. He was elected Senator for Sokoto East on the All Nigeria People's Party (ANPP) platform, holding office from May 1999 to May 2003. He served as the Minority Whip during his term in office. Later, he defected to the ruling People's Democratic Party (PDP), where he became chairman of the Sokoto State People's Democratic Party. A few weeks after being appointed Minister of Culture and Tourism, in January 2009 Gada gave his support to the Nigerian Tourism Development Corporation (NTDC), which was concerned about the rapidly growing number of tourism operators that were not accredited by the NTDC. Speaking at the National Festival of Arts and Culture (NAFEST) held in Minna, Niger State in December 2009, Gada said the festival was much more than a dancing jamboree, but served as a vital tool for fostering unity in the country, showcased the country's diverse culture and promoted tourism. In a February 2010 press briefing, Gada listed the achievements of his ministry in the past year which included establishing six cultural industry centres, creating the Institute for African Culture and International Understanding, Abeokuta and establishing a committee on National Archives and National Museums. He outlined plans for the future such as increased public / private partnership and rehabilitation and reconstruction of abandoned and dilapidated museums and archives projects. He did not discuss the National Tourism Master-plan. In March 2010 Gada inaugurated various committees of the Federation of Tourism Associations of Nigeria to help put the country at par with other African tourist nations.

The accident killed 37 passengers and crew; three passengers and a crewmember survived the crash, and were rescued shortly after the crash. Bermuda's Director of Civil Aviation, E. M. Ware, said at the time that the take-off apparently had been normal. It is believed no message came from the plane before it plunged into the sea, probably while still pushing the engines hard to gain altitude. Four survivors were taken to the Kindley base hospital. The cause of the accident was not determined; it remains the worst aviation accident in Bermudian history.

It was founded in 1929 under the banner of Royal Medico Psychological Association. Its current president is Dr P.K. Dalal http://indianpsychiatricsociety.org/  Founding  The organisation holds its origins in 1929, when Berkeley Hill founded the Indian Association for Mental Hygiene. In 1935, the Indian division of the Royal Medico Psychological Association was formed due to the efforts of Banarasi Das. In 1946, Dr. Nagendra Nath De consulted Major R. B. Davis of the Hospital for Mental Disease, Kanke, Ranchi and Brigadier Thomas Arthur Munro, Advisor in Psychiatry to the Indian Army and decided to revive the association. Due to their efforts, the Indian Psychiatric Society was inaugurated.  Indian Journal of Psychiatry  The IPS operates the Indian Journal of Psychiatry whose chief editor is Dr. Om Prakash Singh. It has for once discussed the widely held practice of covert medication in its July 2012 issue of its publication due to the effort of Anirudh Kala. Overview & Objectives IPS is the largest professional body of psychiatry in India, whose stated aim is to: *promote and advance the subject of Psychiatry and allied sciences in all their different branches, *promote the improvement of the mental health of the people and mental health education, promote prevention, control, treatment and relief of all psychiatric disabilities, formulate and *advise on the standards of education and training for medical and auxiliary personnel in psychiatry and to recommend adequate teaching facilities for the purpose, *promote research in the field of psychiatry and mental health, propagate the principles of psychiatry and current development in psychiatric thought, *deals with any matter relating to mental health concerning the country and *to do all other things as are cognate to the subjects of the Indian Psychiatric Society, *safeguard the interest of psychiatrists and fellow professionals in India and *promote ethical standards in the practice of psychiatry in India Publication The Indian Psychiatric Society is publishing its own journal, Indian Journal of Psychiatry.  Controversies  It was reported in 2013 that the then-incoming president of IPS, Indira Sharma had delivered a speech which recommended marrying off men at a younger age to prevent sexual crimes against women. Subsequently, it was also reported that high-ranking IPS officials were ordering IPS members to abstain from communicating with media houses to prevent any further controversy and negative press.State Times, 30-02-2013, Jammu The IPS officials also convened a meeting to discuss whether to publish her speech on the IPS website, or to censor the controversial sections. At the January 2014 annual meeting of the Indian Psychiatric Society, and in subsequent remarks to the press, Dr. Sharma, then the Immediate Past President, engendered even more controversy by stating that homosexuality was unnatural, homosexuals can be cured, and that - by talking openly about sex - homosexuals were making everyone else uncomfortable. Dr. A.K.Kala, a senior member and Chairperson of Mental Health Legislation Committee requested the IPS President to post the official position of the IPS about homosexuality on its website. When that didnot happen Dr.Kala resigned from the membership of IPS, possibly the only Psychiatrist to have ever done so. In response, the IPS stated in newspaper reports that Dr. Sharma's views are not to be construed as the professional stance of the Society but didnot post its position on its official website.

He served as the first Bishop of Iowa from 1854‚Äì1874. He also served as Provisional Bishop of Nebraska from 1857‚Äì1859 and Provisional Bishop of Kansas, 1860‚Äì1864. Biography=Early life & Ministry Lee was born in Hamden, Connecticut, but the family soon moved to Springfield, Massachusetts, where he grew up and was educated. His father was Roswell Lee, who was a colonel and the superintendent of the Springfield Armory. He was ordained a deacon at Grace Church in New Bedford, Massachusetts and a priest in the Episcopal Church by Alexander Viets Griswold in October, 1839. That same year he married Lydia Mason Morton of Tauton, Massachusetts. They raised two sons and a daughter.Horton, 46 He spent four years as rector of Christ Church in Springfield, and eleven years as rector of St. Luke's Church in Rochester, New York. He received a Doctor of Divinity (DD) degree from Hobart College in 1850, and the University of Rochester in 1852. He received an honorary Doctor of Laws (LLD)from the University of Cambridge, England in 1867. Bishop of Iowa Lee was elected the first bishop of the Diocese of Iowa on June 1, 1854, and he was consecrated by John Henry Hopkins, Bishop of Vermont; Samuel A. McCoskry, Bishop of Michigan; and William H. DeLancey, Bishop of Western New York, on October 18, 1854 in St. Luke's Church, Rochester. The bishops Massachusetts, Maine, and Illinois were also in attendance. Lee was the 61st Episcopal bishop consecrated in the United States, and represented the Evangelical wing of the church. Grave at Oakdale Cemetery Before Lee arrived in Iowa he visited several large and wealthy churches on the east coast and solicited necessary funds for his new diocese. He then made a visitation of the principal churches of his diocese and then took up residence in Davenport. There were at the time 200 Episcopalians in the state.Horton, 31 He invested money he had obtained from donors in the eastern United States by purchasing six thousand acres (24 km¬≤) of land. With the sale of this land over time he was able to build an episcopal residence and start Griswold College in Davenport. The diocese was also able to realize an endowment of $53,000. Lee‚Äôs hard work in Iowa was recognized by the national church. He played an active role on the Board of Missions. Lee was also selected to serve as Provisional Bishop of Nebraska from 1857‚Äì1859 and he served as Provisional Bishop of Kansas from 1860 to 1864. Lee was bishop during the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865) and he refused to make a public statement or even discuss the matter in private. He also urged those who attended the diocesan convention to do likewise.Horton, 36 Lee did, however, preach to the Union soldiers at Camp McClellan and Camp Hendershoot at Davenport, as well as the Confederate prisoners of war at Rock Island. Through an interpreter he also preached to members of the Dakota Tribe who were held prisoner in Davenport following the New Ulm Uprising in Minnesota. In 1867, Lee made a trip to Europe to attend the first Lambeth Conference. While he was there he preached in some of the largest churches in England, Ireland and France. That same year he laid the cornerstone for Grace Cathedral, later renamed Trinity Cathedral, in Davenport. He lived long enough to see the church completed in 1873, but without its steeple. It was one of the first cathedrals built by the Episcopal Church in the United States.Horton, 44 Lee died at his home in Davenport on September 26, 1874. His funeral was held in Grace Cathedral and he was laid to rest in Oakdale Cemetery in Davenport.

During the 1970s and 1980s, Levin subjected many homosexual men to electroshock or chemical castration, and over 900 conscripts were forced to undergo involuntary sexual reassignment surgery. In 1995 Levin moved to Canada and acquired a license to practice medicine. He became professor of clinical psychiatry at the University of Calgary. In 2010 he was arrested for sexual assault of a patient; thirty men claimed they were assaulted by Levin during counseling. Levin was tried and convicted for assault, sentenced to five years in prison, and his medical license was suspended. Early life Levin was born on December 18, 1938 in Johannesburg, South Africa His father was the first Jewish member of the National Party This was first published in South Africa's The Sunday Independent on March 28, 2010. ‚Äîa party that promoted white Afrikaner nationalism and ruled as the leading governing party in South Africa until the end of apartheid. Education Levin completed high school in 1954 and began his medical studies at the University of Pretoria supported by a South African Defence Force (SADF) scholarship. In 1968, while he was completing his studies to earn his license as a psychiatrist, he submitted a letter to the Secretary of the South African Parliament in Cape Town, to request that he present his work using electric shocks as a treatment for \\"homosexuals and lesbians\\", before the Select Committee on the Immorality Amendment Act. Some of his colleagues called him Dr. Shock. He qualified as a psychiatrist in 1969. South African Defence Force Because of his license as a psychiatrist, he was given the rank of Colonel when he joined the South African Defence Force (SADF). In 1971 he became Team Leader at SADF's Drug Rehabilitation Program at Ward 22 of 1 Military Hospital at Voortrekkerhoogte, near Pretoria. The Aversion Project It was at 1 Military Hospital, Voortrekkerhoogte, which is now known as Thaba Tshwane, that Levin developed combinations of electric shock and drug treatments for SADF conscripts that had been classified as \\"deviant.\\" This included those who were smoked marijuana or who were homosexual. Levin's work for the SADF, in which he used aversion therapy, became the subject of much scrutiny at the end of the apartheid era. While working at Voortrekkerhoogte, Levin travelled to Greefswald, in an isolated region of northern South Africa, where he was the attending psychiatrist. The Greefswald military detention barracks had a \\"notorious reputation for the harsh treatment of conscripts,\\" intended to cure conscripts of supposed vices and conscientious objections. Life in Greefswald has been described in detail by one of his former patients, Gordon Torr, in his 2014 novel, Kill Yourself and Count to 10. In 2013, members of the Greefswald Facebook group followed Levin's 4-month long trial in Alberta, Canada and were overjoyed when he was found guilty. A Global New journalist interviewed some of the members who were then living in Australia, Denmark, among other countries. They still bear psychic scars from their Greefswald experiences, which some described as \\"torture\\". They said that they had called Greefswald \\"The Vault\\". Levin, whom they called \\"Bubbles\\" for his weight, was known for his \\"brutal authority to the young men.\\" Many of them were only teenagers when they were traumatized at Greefswald and the \\"focus of their anger was Aubrey Levin.\\" From 1975 through 1981, Levin also worked at Addington Hospital in Durban, South Africa and at Fort England Psychiatric Hospital in Grahamstown‚Äînow called Makhanda, Eastern Cape. Updated April 8, 2020 He performed chemical castrations at the hospitals. A 2014 Salon article said that up to 900 people, who had been involuntarily drafted into the South African army, many of them very young‚Äîranging in age from 16 to 24 years old‚Äîwere \\"subjected to forced sexual reassignment surgeries\\" (SRS). Following these forced, invasive, and often incomplete SRS, for example, by removing male organs, those forced to go through the SRS, who could not afford the \\"expensive hormones\\" intended to \\"maintain their new sexual identities\\", were left without any further assistance. Over a period of about 18 years‚Äîfrom 1971 through 1989‚Äîpeople‚Äîcharacterized as homosexual‚Äîwere \\"submitted to chemical castrations and electric shock treatment\\" as an alleged cure for homosexuality. Publications documenting Levin's role in the Aversion Project In 1994, with the end of apartheid, South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) heard testimony regarding the controversial nature of The Aversion Project Levin ran while in the SADF, details of which were published in 1999. In the report he was referred to as the \\"Colonel.\\" In June 1997, the Health and Human Rights Project (HHRP) submitted its report to the TRC in which Levin was singled out as a key figure in the \\"torture\\" of gay men in the SADF. In an interview with The Guardian in 2000, Levin said that his aversion therapy only caused slight pain and all his patients wanted to be cured. The HHRC, a collaborative program, was established in 1997 by the University of Cape Town's School of Public Health and Family Medicine‚Äîwhere it is located‚Äîand the Cape Town-based NGO, the Trauma Centre for Survivors of Violence and Torture. In October 1999, the 132-page report entitled \\"The aVersion Project: human rights abuses of gays and lesbians in the SADF by health workers during the apartheid era\\", funded by the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust and commissioned by commissioned by South Africa's medical research council and human rights groups, was published. The report was commissioned by on behalf of Gay and Lesbian Archives, Health and Human Rights Project, Medical Research Council, National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality. In 2000, the The Daily Mail and Guardian published a \\"chilling investigative series\\", including a July 2000 article published by The Guardian which provided details on the report. The same journalist also reported on Levin's sexual abuse trial in 2012 in Alberta, Canada. In an interview with The Guardian in 2000, Levin said that his aversion therapy only caused slight pain and all his patients wanted to be cured. In March 2001, Robert M. Caplan published his article on the report in the South African Medical Journal (SAMJ). In it Levin was referred to as the Colonel.url The report \\"detailed castration and electric shocks\\". Starting in 2010, journalists in South Africa began to publish in-depth articles about Levin role during the apartheid era, providing a backdrop to charges brought against him in Canada. Headlines included \\"Dr Shock is in the dock\\", Terry Bell, the author of the 2003 non- fiction, Unfinished business: South Africa, apartheid, and truth , wrote an article entitled \\"In pursuit of 'Dr Shock'\\" in which he decried the way in which Levin had evaded justice in South Africa. A 2014 AlterNet article, republished in Salon, listed the Aversion Project, which was undertaken in South-Africa during the apartheid era, as one of the top ten \\"most evil medical experiments\\". In 2014, one of Levin's former patients, Gordon Torr, wrote a novel entitled Kill Yourself and Count to 10 about a fictional SADF conscript who was mistakenly thrust into a brutal reeducation program, run by a rogue psychiatrist who used the young men as his experimental toys. Torr based the novel on his own experience in the real apartheid era Greefswald camp in the \\"Northern province where anyone considered unfit for the Nationalist army‚Äôs Calvinist-scripted needs was sent for rehabilitation.\\" Saskatchewan, Canada In 1995 Levin was working at the Fort England Hospital in Grahamstown, when he learned that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) report had named him as one of the abusers of human rights. His successor said the Levin had \\"left in such a hurry\\" that he did not pack his office\\". His belongings had to be sent by post to Saskatchewan, Canada where he had emigrated. He said that his reason for emigrating was \\"only because of the high crime rate\\" in South Africa and he \\"denied the accusations against him.\\" In 1995, the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Saskatchewan, Canada gave Levin a license to practice in Saskatchewan. In Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Levin served for a short time as the Regional Psychiatric Centre's regional director. In the late 1990s, the TRC requested that Levin testify in South Africa to respond to the claims against him in the submission made by the Health and Human Rights Project (HHRP). Levin threatens legal action and refuses to appear at the TRC hearings. The final TRC report does not identify Levin by name. He was referred to as a psychologist, not a psychiatrist who \\"practiced aversion therapy\\". Alberta, Canada In 1998 the HHRP sent a letter to the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta (CPSA) in which they inform the CPSA of Levin's background. They do not receive any response. In the same year, the CPSA gave Levin a license to work in the practice medicine in Alberta. He worked as a psychiatrist and academic in Alberta from 1998 until his license was suspended in 2010. By 2000, Levin was working in a teaching hospital in Calgary, Alberta. Sexual assault charges In March 2010, the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta suspended Levin's license over accusations of abuse after a male patient secretly filmed the psychiatrist allegedly making sexual advances.< By July 2010, 30 other men had come forward, claiming they were assaulted by Levin during counseling sessions, according to the police. On October 11, 2012, Levin went to trial at the Court of Queen's Bench in Calgary. His legal defense had failed to convince pre-trial hearing that Levin was mentally unfit to stand trial. The Crown decided to go ahead with nine of the original 21 cases. During the trial, a jury was shown the graphic video of Levin touching a patient, which had been secretly recorded on the patient's [camera wristwatch]. On January 28, 2013, a jury found Levin guilty of three charges of sexual assault against male patients, not guilty of two other charges of sexual assault, while a mistrial was declared in reference to a further four counts. He was convicted of \\"sexual assaulting three of his patients between 2008 and 2010.\\" A May 2013 CBC article questioned how \\"justice officials, the academic community\\" and the Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons had not been aware of Levin's history. A crown prosecutor said that the right hand did not know what the left hand was doing. Obstruction of justice February 7, 2013, police arrested Levin's wife Erica Levin, then aged 69, and charged her with obstruction of justice for alleging attempting to bribe a juror. The juror said she was approached on a train platform in January and offered $1000 or $10,000 in a white envelope, to bring in a not-guilty verdict. The juror informed police and was subsequently dismissed. Although Court of Queen's Bench Justice Karen Horner said that Levin's actions were both \\"selfish\\" and \\"reckless\\", she considered Levin's plea of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, and sentenced her to an \\"18-month conditional sentence with house arrest and 180 hours of community service.\\" Release on bail Despite a 5-year prison sentence, Levin was released on $15,000 bail on February 13, 2013. The judge said that since his license to practice medicine has been suspended, he is \\"not a danger to the public.\\" Court of Appeal of Alberta On April 23, 2014 the Court of Appeal of Alberta, in a unanimous decision, upheld the 2013 conviction. Levin was ordered to report, within 48 hours, to begin a five-year sentence at an unnamed institution. Respondents: C.J.A. C.A. Fraser, J.A. C.M. Conrad, J.A. J.D.B. McDonald Appellant: Aubrey Levin Docket: 1301-0019-A Early release from prison In 2016, CBC obtained information that the Parole Board of Canada had granted Levin day parole. By March, 2016 he was living in a halfway house. The 76-year-old had requested full pardon. Levin told the Parole Board that the \\"victims lied and that the police and the courts...had it in for [him]\\". Assessments included a \\"scathing\\" psychological evaluation, and statements that Levin appeared to \\"have little concern for [his] victims, that he was \\"manipulative\\" and presented himself as \\"victim of the system.\\" Levin denied that he had \\"any sexual motive or basis for your sexual offences\\" and that he was not \\"aware that what he was doing was a criminal act in Canada as it's allowed in his home country of South Africa.\\" ReferencesExternal links * The report was commissioned by on behalf of Gay and Lesbian Archives, Health and Human Rights Project, Medical Research Council, National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality. *url Category:University of Calgary faculty Category:1938 births Category:Living people Category:South African psychiatrists Category:Military psychiatrists Category:Sexual orientation change efforts Category:South African military personnel of the Border War Category:South African Jews Category:White South African people Category:South African emigrants to Canada ","title":"Aubrey Levin"},{"id":"26991756","text":"83rd may refer to: *83rd Academy Awards, a ceremony that honored the best films of 2010 in the United States and took place on February 27, 2011 *83rd Grey Cup, the 1995 Canadian Football League championship game *83rd meridian east, a line of longitude 83¬∞ east of Greenwich *83rd meridian west, a line of longitude 83¬∞ west of Greenwich *83rd parallel north, a circle of latitude that is 83¬∞ north of the Earth's equatorial plane, in the Arctic *83rd Street (disambiguation) Military units * 83rd Division (disambiguation), several units * 83rd Regiment (disambiguation), several units * 83rd Squadron (disambiguation), several units Politics *83rd Delaware General Assembly, a meeting of the Delaware Senate and the Delaware House of Representatives *83rd United States Congress, a meeting of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives **List of United States Senators in the 83rd Congress by seniority *Lindner Ethics Complaint of the 83rd Minnesota Legislative Session See also * 83 (number) * AD 83, the year 83 (LXXXIII) of the Julian calendar ","title":"83rd"},{"id":"26991758","text":"Domestic Import is a 2006 comedy film directed by Kevin Connor and written and produced by Andrea C.

By virtue of his title as Pasha, the Bey came to enjoy the prestige of connection with the Sultan-Caliph in Constantinople. In 1640, at the death of the Dey, Hamuda Bey maneuvered to establish his control over appointments to that office. Under Murad II Bey (reigned 1666-1675), son of Hamuda, the Diwan again functioned as a council of notables. Yet in 1673 the janissary deys, seeing their power ebbing, rose in revolt. During the consequent fighting, the urban forces of the janissary deys fought against the Muradids with their largely rural forces under the tribal shaykhs, and with popular support from city notables. As the Beys secured victory, so did the rural Bedouins and the Tunisian notables, who also emerged triumphant. The Arabic language returned to local official use, although the Muradids continued to use Turkish in the central government, accentuating their elite status and Ottoman connection. At Murad II Bey's death, internal discord with the Muradid family led to the outbreak of armed struggle.http://www.persee.fr/doc/etaf_0768-2352_1967_mon_1_1 p.15 accessed 1/5/2027 known as the Revolutions of Tunis. This period of unrest lasted from the death of Murad II Bey in 1675 until the seizure of power by the Husainid Al-Husayn I ibn Ali at-Turki in 1705. The Turkish rulers of Algeria intervened on behalf of one side in the conflict; the Algerian forces did not withdraw and proved unpopular. The last Muradid Bey, Murad III, was assassinated in 1702 by Ibrahim Sharif, who then ruled for several years with Algerian backing.

General form of the Kronecker sum of discrete Laplacians In a general situation of the separation of variables in the discrete case, the multidimensional discrete Laplacian is a Kronecker sum of 1D discrete Laplacians. Example: 2D discrete Laplacian on a regular grid with the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition Mathematically, using the Kronecker sum: :L = \\\\mathbf{D_{xx}}\\\\oplus\\\\mathbf{D_{yy}}=\\\\mathbf{D_{xx}}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{I}+\\\\mathbf{I}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{D_{yy}}, \\\\, where \\\\mathbf{D_{xx}} and \\\\mathbf{D_{yy}} are 1D discrete Laplacians in the x- and y-directions, correspondingly, and \\\\mathbf{I} are the identities of appropriate sizes. Both \\\\mathbf{D_{xx}} and \\\\mathbf{D_{yy}} must correspond to the case of the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition at end points of the x- and y-intervals, in order to generate the 2D discrete Laplacian L corresponding to the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition everywhere on the boundary of the rectangular domain. Here is a sample OCTAVE/MATLAB code to compute L on the regular 10√ó15 2D grid: nx = 10; % number of grid points in the x-direction; ny = 15; % number of grid points in the y-direction; ex = ones(nx,1); Dxx = spdiags([ex -2*ex ex], [-1 0 1], nx, nx); %1D discrete Laplacian in the x-direction ; ey = ones(ny,1); Dyy = spdiags([ey, -2*ey ey], [-1 0 1], ny, ny); %1D discrete Laplacian in the y-direction ; L = kron(Dyy, speye(nx)) + kron(speye(ny), Dxx) ; Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of multidimensional discrete Laplacian on a regular grid Knowing all eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the factors, all eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Kronecker product can be explicitly calculated. Based on this, eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Kronecker sum can also be explicitly calculated. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the standard central difference approximation of the second derivative on an interval for traditional combinations of boundary conditions at the interval end points are well known. Combining these expressions with the formulas of eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the Kronecker sum, one can easily obtain the required answer. Example: 3D discrete Laplacian on a regular grid with the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition :L = \\\\mathbf{D_{xx}}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{I}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{I}+\\\\mathbf{I}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{D_{yy}}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{I}+\\\\mathbf{I}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{I}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{D_{zz}}, \\\\, where \\\\mathbf{D_{xx}},\\\\,\\\\mathbf{D_{yy}} and \\\\mathbf{D_{zz}} are 1D discrete Laplacians in every of the 3 directions, and \\\\mathbf{I} are the identities of appropriate sizes. Each 1D discrete Laplacian must correspond to the case of the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition, in order to generate the 3D discrete Laplacian L corresponding to the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition everywhere on the boundary. The eigenvalues are : \\\\lambda_{jx,jy,jz} = -\\\\frac{4}{h_x^2} \\\\sin\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi j_x}{2(n_x + 1)}\\\\right)^2 -\\\\frac{4}{h_y^2} \\\\sin\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi j_y}{2(n_y + 1)}\\\\right)^2 -\\\\frac{4}{h_z^2} \\\\sin\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi j_z}{2(n_z + 1)}\\\\right)^2 where j_x=1,\\\\ldots,n_x,\\\\,j_y=1,\\\\ldots,n_y,\\\\,j_z=1,\\\\ldots,n_z,\\\\,, and the corresponding eigenvectors are :v_{ix,iy,iz,jx,jy,jz} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{n_x+1}} \\\\sin\\\\left(\\\\frac{i_x j_x \\\\pi}{n_x+1}\\\\right) \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{n_y+1}} \\\\sin\\\\left(\\\\frac{i_y j_y \\\\pi}{n_y+1}\\\\right) \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{n_z+1}} \\\\sin\\\\left(\\\\frac{i_z j_z \\\\pi}{n_z+1}\\\\right) where the multi-index {jx,jy,jz} pairs the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors, while the multi-index {ix,iy,iz} determines the location of the value of every eigenvector at the regular grid. The boundary points, where the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition are imposed, are just outside the grid.

Born in 1767, Carter spent his early years in Warren, Connecticut. Where he visited the local library frequently and developed an appreciation of books. When his father, Lieut. Elazer Carter enlisted in the Continental Army when Lorenzo was 11 years old, he came home from his temporarily disbanded unit and died of smallpox. About seven years later when his widowed mother remarried and moved to Vermont, the 18-year-old Lorenzo struck out on his own. Within four years, Lorenzo Carter bought his own land, cleared it, farmed it and married Rebecca Fuller. Lorenzo Carter is described as a swarthy, muscular man whose \\"gaze and speech were as direct as his actions\\" (Ellis, 1979, p. 42) Carter was a natural leader whose \\"interests transcended farming or making a living.\\" (Ellis, 1979, p. 42) In 1797 he left with his brother-in-law for the New Connecticut settlement of Cleaveland (now Cleveland) via Canada. Lorenzo Carter bought Lot 199, nearly of land for $47.50. Carter made friends with the local Native Americans and it was his friendship with Chief Seneca (also known as Stigwanish) that kept the Cleaveland colony alive through years of disease, floods and poor crops. Legacy After building a frame house and preparing to move in Lorenzo Carter's new home was burned down by children playing with wood shavings and only in 1803 was a two-room log cabin home finished for the family. In 1802 he also built the Carter Tavern which became a somewhat informal town hall, hotel, and religious meeting house. In 1804 the state of Ohio promoted Carter to Major and he was given the responsibility of the Cleaveland battalion. In 1808 he built a trading vessel 30 ton schooner called the Zephyr that traded furs for goods like salt. Carter was also an active member of the first library association in Cleveland which was formed in 1811 but quickly dissolved under the pressures of the War of 1812. Lorenzo's father, Lt. Elazer Carter handed down to him and the generations that followed the flag he carried during The Revolutionary War. The flag passed to Lorenzo's grand daughter, Selena Silsby Brockway who in turn passed it to her grand daughter Alice Henderson. The flag eventually ended up being passed to her grandson John (Jack) Penty Jr. The flag is one of the original flags made when there were still 13 British colonies. The Revolutionaries determined the stars and stripes would signify the Republic they were fighting to form. It is made of homespun linen and handstitched. The red stripes were dyed with cranberries and the blue with elderberries. Thirteen stars are scattered across a light blue background. This flag is about 8' by 10'. This flag was made during the Revolution before this country was even formed. It was 1775 and emotions ran high, many of them caught and spurred higher by the word \\"LIBERTY\\" sewn onto the flag. The flag now resides with The Western Reserve Historical Society. Law The common saying that \\"Major Carter was all the law Cleveland had.\\" (Wickham, 1914) is seen in two documented incidents. After hearing from his wife that a local Native American teen named John Omic had chased her around her home with a knife after she told him to stop taking vegetables from her garden, Carter visited the Omic home on the west bank of the Cuyahoga River. He told John Omic's father that if John ever crossed the river again \\"I‚Äôll hang him up to the first tree in five minutes.\\"(Johnson, 1879, p. 232) In another exhibition of frontier justice, Lorenzo Carter prevented two Kentuckians from returning an African named Ben to slavery. In the spring of 1806 Ben survived a shipwreck that killed everyone else on board just after setting sail from the nearby community of Rocky River. Starving, frostbitten and suffering from rheumatism Ben was taken to Carter's tavern where the ravages of frostbite took some of his toes. Under Lorenzo Carter's care, Ben was allowed to recover and regained his strength. In October two Kentuckians arrived in Cleaveland claiming to own Ben. Carter responded them saying \\"I don‚Äôt like Niggers, but I don‚Äôt believe in slavery, and Ben shan‚Äôt be taken away unless he chooses to go.\\" (Johnson, 1879, p. 232) Carter allowed a parley between the Kentuckians and Ben over a stream and it ended peaceably. However, in a move that no historian has been able to explain, Ben was taken out of Cleaveland by the Kentuckians the next day. In what has been termed a rescue, two men who worked for Carter stopped them at gun point and told Ben to make a break for the woods. Ben jumped off the horse and ran into the woods while the two men covered him and then followed him. The Kentuckians never returned and Ben settled in the Brecksville/Independence area of Ohio until he left for Canada. Death Major Lorenzo Carter died at his tavern in February 1814 after an arduous battle with cancer. The cancer first manifested itself on his face and after consulting physicians in the East, he withdrew to an upper room where he refused all visitors. He even refused the ministrations of his wife who would sit on the stairs outside of his door and pray, while he loudly agonized from the pain. (Wickham, 1914) He was 47 when he died. Lorenzo Carter is buried at the Erie Street Cemetery. References *1. Wickham, Getrude Van Rensselaer.

Rising to prominence as an unconventional anti-imperialist, he was briefly opposition leader, before becoming parliamentary Speaker.http://www.moltenofamily.net/people-and- places/whos-who/ He was the last Speaker for the Parliament of the Cape Colony, and the first Speaker of Parliament of South Africa.Molteno, J.T.: The Dominion of Afrikanerdom. London: Methuen & Co. Ltd, 1923. p.9 Early life The son of Prime Minister Sir John Molteno, James was born on 5 January 1865 at his family's Claremont estate. He matriculated with honours from Diocesan College and read law at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was noted not just for his academic diligence but for his unusual strength and physical fitness (An extremely athletic man, he excelled in sports from horseracing and boxing to swimming and shooting). He was elected first president of the Trinity College Debating Society and was active on the committee of the Union. Otherwise he divided his time at university between frenzied study, and backpacking around Europe attending drunken parties with fellow students. He also acquired a passion for card-playing that remained with him for the rest of his life. When he graduated with honours he was called to the Inner Temple in London, before returning to Cape Town to become an Advocate of the Supreme Court in 1889.D. W. Kruger:Dictionary of South African Biography. Vol II. Human Sciences Research Council, Pretoria. Tafelberg Ltd, 1972. . p.481 Political career James Molteno as a young MP in the 1890s. Molteno entered the Cape Parliament in 1890, at the age of 25, and became Speaker of Parliament in 1908. He was in fact to be the last speaker before the Cape Parliament dissolved itself on the act of Union. Early parliamentary career (1890‚Äì1899) He was initially a supporter of Prime Minister Cecil John Rhodes, but after the \\"Logan Scandal\\" in 1893 revealed the degree of corruption in Rhodes's business dealings, Molteno left his government and immediately joined the opposition. From then on he became increasingly suspicious of Rhodes for what he considered his unscrupulous craving for power. Capture of Leander Starr Jameson by the Boers, after his failed 1896 raid. The raid turned out to have been secretly engineered by Cecil Rhodes ‚Äì a fact known by Molteno from the beginning. When the Jameson Raid took place, Molteno immediately accused Rhodes of engineering it, calling Leander Starr Jameson a \\"fool\\". He wrote that the raid was the beginning of the divide between Boer and British that would eventually culminate in the Boer War. In 1899, he organised and chaired a commission to draw up a petition to Queen Victoria, from anti-War politicians and intellectuals of Southern Africa, stressing the seriousness of the impending conflict. It included key information that was not disclosed to London by the British High Commissioner in South Africa, Sir Alfred Milner, who was intent on taking the Cape to war. Consequently Milner avoided delivering it. Molteno then used his family connections to take the petition ‚Äì as well as Milner's private statements on his warlike intentions ‚Äì to the British press and parliament, causing great embarrassment to Milner and the Colonial establishment in South Africa. Molteno was an exceptionally skilled debater and public speaker. In parliament however, he quickly gained a reputation as a jovial tease, with an uncanny ability to both foment and soothe disagreements in the house ‚Äì while all the time taking an amused backseat. His friends and colleagues in parliament gave him the nickname \\"Baby Molteno\\", as he was the youngest of his extended family to be politically active at the time. The Boer War and its aftermath (1899‚Äì1908) Anglo-Boer War prisoner transit camp on Green point common, Cape Town. When War broke out, Molteno chaired the anti-war South Africa Conciliation Committee in Cape Town. Like his brother (and fellow MP) John Molteno Jr., he was a fierce critic of the malpractices that took place in the Cape under British martial law, and regularly smuggled evidence of them out of the country via his family connections, to sympathetic MPs in the British House of Commons. In fact, on many occasions he recklessly flouted martial law, seemingly without fear of repercussions, possibly because of the influence of these same connections. He even went so far as to act as the legal counsel for the so-called \\"Cape rebels\\", successfully defending them from the charge of high treason in a series of high-profile military tribunals set up across the country, over a period of 2 years. He then joined several other powerful politicians in successfully fighting the attempt to suspend the Cape's constitution, managing once again to bypass martial law and travel to the Imperial Conference in London to do so.http://uir.unisa.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10500/3942/funda_v15_n1_a6.pdf?sequence=1 When democratic government finally resumed in 1902 and Molteno cheerfully re- entered parliament, his arrival provoked a storm of controversy. Some parliamentarians hailed him as a hero; others saw him as a type of terrorist. After his first move of supporting an inquiry into the excesses of military rule, he went on to chair a number of committees and was at the centre of the work to re-establish parliamentary governance. As a leader of the opposition, his outspoken criticism and sharp repartee was a constant thorn in the side of the Jameson government. At this time, as the next election (1907/8) was approaching, Molteno was exceptionally active and led nationwide campaigns for the election of his old friend and liberal ally John X. Merriman, making hundreds of speeches across the country. The effort paid off and the election was a resounding victory for Merriman and Molteno's \\"South African Party\\".Illustrated History of South Africa. The Reader's Digest Association South Africa (Pty) Ltd, 1992. .http://dspace.nwu.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10394/5266/TD_7%282%29_2011_167-184.pdf?sequence=1 Molteno was a strong proponent of women's suffrage and, on 4 July 1907, together with fellow MPs J.W. Sauer and Dr Antonie Viljoen, made the first parliamentary attempt to give women (of all races) the right to vote, in the last session before the new government. In the long and bitter parliamentary debate that ensued, which Molteno later described as the most painful of his career, Merriman himself joined the parliamentary majority in opposing women's suffrage and the motion was eventually defeated.Molteno, J.T.: Further South African Recollections.

Speaker of the Cape Colony Parliament (1908‚Äì1910) Map of southern Africa just prior to Union. The Cape Colony is shaded red, the Boer republics orange. After the elections of 1908, when the Merriman government came to power, Molteno was the unanimous choice as Speaker. As Speaker of Parliament, Molteno abandoned his jovially anarchic style of politics, and became solemn and decisive. With the political storms of the Boer War and the upcoming Union, controlling Parliamentary procedure was a challenge. The Cape House had also more than doubled in size since its creation and was considerably more politically diverse. It was therefore essential to wield a firm and detached authority over sessions that were often very raucous. However, remaining aloof and serious seemed to have sometimes been a challenge for Molteno. Parliamentary writer Ralph Kilpin found the contradictory Speaker rather amusing, and described in his book, The Old Cape House, how Molteno once firmly silenced disruptive parliamentarians who were roaring with laughter in the backbenches, only to whisper audibly to the culprit as he passed the Speaker's seat later: \\"You can tell me the joke afterwards\\" Kilpin, R.: The Old Cape House, being pages from the history of a legislative assembly. Cape Town: T.M. Miller, 1918. In 1909, at the Prime Minister's request, he joined the South African delegation as legal adviser, and submitted the draft South Africa Act at the National Convention in London. This was in spite of his voicing considerable problems with many of its provisions, particularly those pertaining to franchise. The South African Parliament building in Cape Town First Speaker of the South African Parliament (1910‚Äì1915) Nevertheless, when the new Union House of Assembly was created, Molteno, now representing the constituency of Ceres, was asked to take up his office again, having defeated the Transvaal's candidate for Speaker, General C.F. Beyers. He thus became the first Speaker of the South African Parliament. In the ensuing year, he was responsible for compiling the initial rules of procedure for Parliament, as well as the constitution of the Empire Parliamentary Association, of which he was president.H.E. Fripp: Men we Know. Cape Town. 1892. In 1911, he led the South African Parliamentary Delegation to London for the coronation of King George V. He was knighted in the same year.Selections from the Correspondence of PA MoltenoThe Old Cape House, by R Kilpin High Commissioner for South Africa and later life He resigned from Parliament in 1915, after 25 years, and served briefly as the High Commissioner for the Union of South Africa, in London.P. Lewsen: Selections from the Correspondence of John X. Merriman, Vol II: 1890‚Äì1898. Cape Town:Van Riebeek Society. 1963. p.267. Upon his final retirement, he moved to Elgin, outside Cape Town, where much of his extended family lived. Here he settled down to write two racy volumes on the political life of the Cape, a collection of rather random trivia and recollections, and a protracted denouncement of Rhodes, Milner and other imperial figures which he claimed was a warning to South Africa of its future direction. He was also marginally involved in the highly successful syndicate that his family ran on South Africa's agricultural exports, dominated at the time by his oldest brother John. Known as an eccentric (never seen without his umbrella), he spent his last years on his farm and died on 16 September 1936 while on a visit to Europe. He was survived by his wife, Clare (Clarissa Celia Holland- Pryor), and his four children.

The estate of Cartsburn, also known as Crawfurdsburn, incorporated the lands of Cartsdyke and part of the lands of Easter Greenock Castle. The Barony of Cartsburn is a feudal Barony of Scotland. The seat of the Barony was the House of Cartsburn, built in the 17th century near Greenock, Renfrewshire. Excerpts from the Baron Court Book of Cartsburn have been published, rendering it one of the few Baronies with comprehensive evidence for research into the social history of the area. George Crawfurd, the compiler of the notable and esteemed work The Peerage of Scotland, belonged to the family of Crawfurd of Cartsburn and was the brother of the second Baron. It is suspected that it was through George Crawfurd's genealogical writings that the manuscript of Sir Ewen Cameron of Lochiel's memoirs came into the possession of the Crawfurds of Cartsburn, which William Macknight Crawfurd of Ratho, the seventh Baron, then donated for publication. Other people associated with the Barony include the inventor James Watt, the nation's bard Robert Burns, and the poet Jean Adam. The famous inventor, James Watt grew up within the Barony. His father and namesake, James Watt, was contracted to enlarge the mansion house of Sir John Shaw, 2nd Baronet at Greenock, and his grandfather, Thomas Watt, was Bailie of the Barony of Cartsburn. Robert Burns was invited to stay at the estate at the invitation of the 4th Baron, Thomas Crawfurd of Cartsburn. He later mentioned the Baron in his work. Jean Adam's published poems of 1734 were dedicated to the Baron of Cartsburn. Notable Barons Thomas Crawfurd of Cartsburn, 4th Baron of Cartsburn, invited Robert Burns to stay at his country estate at Cartsburn. Burns himself writes of Thomas Crawfurd of Cartsburn's \\"ingenious, friendly, and elegant epistle\\". In his Preface to the Memoirs of Sir Ewen Cameron of Lochiel, Chief of the Clan Cameron, James Macknight describes Thomas as \\"a person of superior literary attainments\\", who \\"collected a considerable library\\". Thomas Macknight Crawfurd of Cartsburn and Lauriston Castle, 8th Baron of Cartsburn was credited with a number of ameliorations to the grounds of Lauriston Castle, a property which he acquired in 1871. He made general improvements to Lauriston, including the bringing of a number of architectural features from his estate at Cartsburn. Mark Lindley-Highfield of Ballumbie Castle, the 14th Baron of Cartsburn, when a student and editor of Gaudie, the newspaper of the University of Aberdeen, resigned in protest at editorial interference from the University's Students' Association. His campaign for editorial independence received the support of Orkney & Shetland MP Alistair Carmichael and Moray MP Angus Robertson, who tabled an Early Day Motion in Parliament criticising the Students' Association's \\"ill-advised move\\".

The C++ language standard generally allows implementations to perform any optimization, provided the resulting program's observable behavior is the same as if, i.e. pretending, the program were executed exactly as mandated by the standard. The standard also describes a few situations where copying can be eliminated even if this would alter the program's behavior, the most common being the return value optimization. Another widely implemented optimization, described in the C++ standard, is when a temporary object of class type is copied to an object of the same type.ISO/IEC (2003). ISO/IEC 14882:2003(E): Programming Languages - C++ ¬ß12.8 Copying class objects [class.copy] para. 15 As a result, copy- initialization is usually equivalent to direct-initialization in terms of performance, but not in semantics; copy-initialization still requires an accessible copy constructor. The optimization can not be applied to a temporary object that has been bound to a reference. Example #include int n = 0; struct C { explicit C(int) {} C(const C&) { ++n; } // the copy constructor has a visible side effect }; // it modifies an object with static storage duration int main() { C c1(42); // direct-initialization, calls C::C(42) C c2 = C(42); // copy-initialization, calls C::C(C(42)) std::cout << n << std::endl; // prints 0 if the copy was elided, 1 otherwise } According to the standard a similar optimization may be applied to objects being thrown and caught,ISO/IEC (2003). ISO/IEC 14882:2003(E): Programming Languages - C++ ¬ß15.1 Throwing an exception [except.throw] para. 5ISO/IEC (2003). ISO/IEC 14882:2003(E): Programming Languages - C++ ¬ß15.3 Handling an exception [except.handle] para. 17 but it is unclear whether the optimization applies to both the copy from the thrown object to the exception object, and the copy from the exception object to the object declared in the exception-declaration of the catch clause. It is also unclear whether this optimization only applies to temporary objects, or named objects as well. Given the following source code: #include struct C { C() = default; C(const C&) { std::cout << \\"Hello World! \\"; } }; void f() { C c; throw c; // copying the named object c into the exception object. } // It is unclear whether this copy may be elided (omitted). int main() { try { f(); } catch (C c) { // copying the exception object into the temporary in the // exception declaration. } // It is also unclear whether this copy may be elided (omitted). } A conforming compiler should therefore produce a program which prints \\"Hello World!\\" twice. In the current revision of the C++ standard (C++11), the issues have been addressed, essentially allowing both the copy from the named object to the exception object, and the copy into the object declared in the exception handler to be elided. GCC provides the \`‚Äëfno‚Äëelide‚Äëconstructors\` option to disable copy- elision. This option is useful to observe (or not observe) the effects of return value optimization or other optimizations where copies are elided. It is generally not recommended to disable this important optimization. Return value optimization In the context of the C++ programming language, return value optimization (RVO) is a compiler optimization that involves eliminating the temporary object created to hold a function's return value. RVO is particularly notable for being allowed to change the observable behaviour of the resulting program by the C++ standard.  Summary  In general, the C++ standard allows a compiler to perform any optimization, provided the resulting executable exhibits the same observable behaviour as if (i.e. pretending) all the requirements of the standard have been fulfilled. This is commonly referred to as the \\"as-if rule\\".ISO/IEC (2003). ISO/IEC 14882:2003(E): Programming Languages - C++ ¬ß1.9 Program execution [intro.execution] para. 1 The term return value optimization refers to a special clause in the C++ standard that goes even further than the \\"as-if\\" rule: an implementation may omit a copy operation resulting from a return statement, even if the copy constructor has side effects.ISO/IEC (2003). ISO/IEC 14882:2003(E): Programming Languages - C++ ¬ß12.8 Copying class objects [class.copy] para. 15 The following example demonstrates a scenario where the implementation may eliminate one or both of the copies being made, even if the copy constructor has a visible side effect (printing text). The first copy that may be eliminated is the one where a nameless temporary \`C\` could be copied into the function \`f\`'s return value. The second copy that may be eliminated is the copy of the temporary object returned by \`f\` to \`obj\`. #include struct C { C() = default; C(const C&) { std::cout << \\"A copy was made. \\"; } }; C f() { return C(); } int main() { std::cout << \\"Hello World! \\"; C obj = f(); } Depending upon the compiler, and that compiler's settings, the resulting program may display any of the following outputs: Hello World! A copy was made. A copy was made. Hello World! A copy was made. Hello World!  Background  Returning an object of built-in type from a function usually carries little to no overhead, since the object typically fits in a CPU register. Returning a larger object of class type may require more expensive copying from one memory location to another. To avoid this, an implementation may create a hidden object in the caller's stack frame, and pass the address of this object to the function. The function's return value is then copied into the hidden object. Thus, code such as this: struct Data { char bytes[16]; }; Data F() { Data result = {}; // generate result return result; } int main() { Data d = F(); } may generate code equivalent to this: struct Data { char bytes[16]; }; Data* F(Data* _hiddenAddress) { Data result = {}; // copy result into hidden object *_hiddenAddress = result; return _hiddenAddress; } int main() { Data _hidden; // create hidden object Data d = *F(&_hidden); // copy the result into d } which causes the \`Data\` object to be copied twice. In the early stages of the evolution of C++, the language's inability to efficiently return an object of class type from a function was considered a weakness. Around 1991, Walter Bright implemented a technique to minimize copying, effectively replacing the hidden object and the named object inside the function with the object used for holding the result: struct Data { char bytes[16]; }; void F(Data* p) { // generate result directly in *p } int main() { Data d; F(&d;); } Bright implemented this optimization in his Zortech C++ compiler. This particular technique was later coined \\"Named return value optimization\\", referring to the fact that the copying of a named object is elided.  Compiler support  Return value optimization is supported on most compilers. There may be, however, circumstances where the compiler is unable to perform the optimization. One common case is when a function may return different named objects depending on the path of execution: #include std::string F(bool cond = false) { std::string first(\\"first\\"); std::string second(\\"second\\"); // the function may return one of two named objects // depending on its argument. RVO might not be applied return cond ? first : second; } int main() { std::string result = F(); }  See also  * Copy elision on cppreference.com  References  Category:Compiler optimizations Category:C++ Category:Articles with example C++ code ","title":"Copy elision"},{"id":"26991954","text":"Mother Bridget Sequeira, F.M.C.K., was a Franciscan Religious Sister who founded the Franciscan Missionaries of Christ the King, a missionary religious congregation for women, in Karachi, Pakistan. It is the only Catholic religious institute for women to have been founded for women in that nation. It is currently headquartered in Goa, India. Early life Sequeira was born in Bushehr, Persia, on 12 December 1905. Her parents were Joao Felipe Sequeira and Matilda de Melo from the Sonarbhatt section of Saligao, in the District of North Goa, then part of Portuguese India, now part of the Republic of India.Sister Ursula, F.M.C.K. Foot Prints on the Sands of Time. Lourdes Convent, Saligao, North Goa, India In 1913 she was sent to Karachi, then still part of the British Raj, where she studied at St Joseph's Convent School and passed the Senior Cambridge examination in 1921. She then joined the staff of St Joseph‚Äôs School. She later passed the Secondary Teachers' Certificate Examination and went on to a teaching job at St Joseph's Convent School in the same city. Religious life In 1937 she founded the Congregation of the Franciscan Missionaries of Christ the King in Karachi. The congregation has grown and spread through various parts of India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. In 1939 Sequeira was also elected as a member of the Municipal Council by the people of Karachi. In 1946 Sequeira sailed to her ancestral city of Saligao, accompanied by three Sisters of her congregation, landing in Goa on 13 May. They arrived at the house in Cotula where her aunt, Etelvina de Melo, operated St. Mary's Girls School, which had been founded in 1900 by Joshino Sequeira as the first English school for girls in Goa. Mother Bridget then took control of the school from her aunt. With this the Franciscan Missionaries became established in India. Later the Sisters would build their own modern structure on a hill in Donvaddo in Saligao, called the Lourdes Convent High School. It was built in three stages and finally completed in 1968. On 1 July 1987 Mother Bridget died in the novitiate house in the Malir Town sector of Metropolitan Karachi. Legacy The congregation has constructed schools, orphanages, and hospitals, as well as homes for the aged and disabled. During their 10th General Chapter held in 2005, the Sisters decided to move the motherhouse from Karachi to Old Goa and to divide the administration of the congregation into two provinces: the Province of St Francis of Assisi in Pakistan and St Clare's Province in India, as well as three Regions, which are expected to develop into full provinces. To date this is the only Roman Catholic religious institute originating in Pakistan, actually predating the better known Missionaries of Charity founded by Mother Teresa in Kolkata (Calcutta), India, in 1950. In 2010 there were 61 sisters in Pakistan, still working in their various institutions and ministries.

Its common names in English include southern emerald damselfly, shy emerald damselfly, and migrant spreadwing.Clausnitzer, V. 2009. Lestes barbarus. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Downloaded on 28 January 2016.  Distribution and habitat  L. barbarus is a southern European species with a rapidly expanding range. It is found across southern Europe in a band across Spain, France, Italy and Greece to India and Mongolia. It is less common in northern Europe. It breeds in the Netherlands in coastal dunes and is increasing in number. It is at the edge of its range in the Channel Islands, where it has been breeding since 1995. It is also found in North Africa; it gets its Latin name as the first specimen was found in Barbary, North Africa. It is a damselfly of still water and can be found in stagnant and slightly brackish water. This species was first recorded in Britain at Winterton Dunes, Norfolk, on 30 July 2002.Nobes, G. (2003). Southern Emerald Damselfly Lestes barbarus (Fabr.) - The First British Record. Atropos No. 18, pp. 3‚Äì6. In 2003 and 2004 it was noted at Sandwich Bay, Kent.Forrest, P. J. (2005). Southern Emerald Damselfly Lestes barbarus (Fabr.) at Sandwich Bay, Kent. Atropos No. 24, pp. 24‚Äì25. In 2018 it was proven to have bred in Britain for the first time. Identification This species has the typical appearance of a Lestes damselfly with a metallic green body and wings held away from the body at rest. It differs from the other European Lestes in having bicoloured pterostigmata, which is diagnostic. The male abdominal appendage and female ovipositor are also characteristic and unlike those of L. sponsa or L. dryas. Immatures have pale pterostigmata and only develop the characteristic two- coloured pterostigmata when mature. Behaviour The flight period is from March to October in the south of its range but in north it flies mainly from June to August. Its behaviour is similar to that of L. sponsa, but it is more likely to be found away from water. After mating the pair usually remain in tandem while the female lays eggs on waterside plants. The eggs overwinter in diapause and the larvae hatch in spring. The larvae develop within two months, the adults emerging in late spring. NotesReferences * Askew, R. R.

The Musk√∂ tunnel Musk√∂ Naval Base is a Swedish underground naval facility on the island of Musk√∂ just south of Stockholm in Haninge Municipality (Haninge Kommun). The construction of the base started in 1950 and was completed 19 years later in 1969. During the construction about 1.5 million tons of rock were removed. It has 3 docks, originally designed for destroyers and submarines. The underground base itself has an area of several km¬≤ and is connected by of underground roads. In order to connect the base to the mainland, the was built at the same time as the base. This crosses several bridges and intermediate islands before finally accessing the island of Musk√∂ through the , a long, dangerously narrow road tunnel running some under the sea. During the Cold war the underground facility was kept highly secret and not much information about it was known to the public. In 2004 the Swedish government decided that the navy should be concentrated to two bases only, the Karlskrona Naval Base and the Berga Naval Base, and much of the Musk√∂ base was closed. However some parts of the facility were still used by the military. The underground shipyards were being operated under contract by Kockums AB and Musk√∂varvet AB. In the autumn of 2019, as part of an upgrade of defence facilities and manpower, the naval base was revived, and it was announced that it would also serve as seat of the main headquarters of the Swedish Navyhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/30/swedish-navy-returns-to- vast-underground-hq-amid-russia-fears. One of the Swedish submarine incidents in October, 1982, took place just off Musk√∂ naval base. A survey carried out in 2000 concluded that sedimentation in the tunnels leading to docks contained PCBs, organotin compounds and heavy metals, mainly mercury and copper. In 2019, Swedish naval command in the form of the Naval Staff returned to Musk√∂. In early 2020 it was confirmed that the base would be fully reactivated.

It is known commonly as the emerald damselfly or common spreadwing. Both males and females have a metallic green colour and when resting its wings are usually half opened.  Behaviour  One of the larger damselflies, this species is most common in July and August. It is often found by ponds and lakes, and is very rarely seen along flowing water. Emerald Damselflies like to perch among reeds, their colour providing good camouflage. They are not as strong fliers when compared to other common damselflies such as the common blue or large red damselflies, but they are more likely to be seen on misty, rainy days then those species. When disturbed they usually do not fly very far away, landing on another perch a few yards away. Their habit of perching with their wings half open is characteristic of the family Lestidae and gives rise to their other common name of spreadwings. A population can consist of several hundred insects. L. sponsa mate in the usual dragonfly manner and will form tandem pairs away from water. Copulation lasts from 30‚Äì60 minutes and after mating they stay paired for egg-laying. The female usually lays eggs in submerged vegetation and whilst egg-laying the female can remain submerged for 30 min. The female pierces the tissue of aquatic plants and inserts her eggs. Occasionally females lay their eggs in vegetation above the water surface in places that will become submerged when the water level rises. The eggs start to develop and will continue to develop for the next few weeks. Then due to changing environmental conditions the development of the eggs slows down. In this state of slow development, called diapause the eggs overwinter. L. sponsa is an obligatory univoltine species. The prolarva stage hatches from the egg in spring. This is a specialised short lived stage often lasting only minutes. The prolarva has no limbs and cannot feed but it can move by jumping or wriggling and if a prolarva is not in water when it hatches it will move about until water is found. Once in water the prolarva molt to the second stadia stage. The larvae are active and actively hunt prey leading to rapid larval growth. The larvae molt from one stadia to the next until growth is complete; in dragonflies the larval stages are the only stages where growth occurs. The number of stadia is not fixed and in good conditions the last larval stage, called F-0 can be reached in as little as 8 weeks. The adults emerge in July and are on the wing until September. Adults are not sexually mature when they emerge and need a week or more, depending on conditions, before they can breed. In L.sponsa in Japan the length of the summer maturation period is correlated with temperature and lasts on average 20 days in the north where it is cooler up to 120 days in the hotter south. This stops egg laying early in summer, which could lead to egg not entering diapause and hatching in autumn. This would disrupt the normal cycle as larva hatched in autumn would not survive the winter. Description All species in the genus Lestes are very similar and are hard to separate in the field. The shapes of the anal appendages are characteristic. In L. sponsa the anal appendage is black with the superior appendage (which are the ones on the outside) with two internal teeth. The inferior appendage is elongated and cylindrical. In northern Europe five species of Lestes occur whilst in Europe as a whole there are six species, so identification can be problematical and it is best to look at as many features as possible. L. sponsa is a typical member of the genus with a green metallic body and wings held away from the body at rest. The abdomen is 26-33mm long and the wings are 19-23mm long. Mature males have a powder blue colour on the prothorax and on segments 1‚Äì2 and 9‚Äì10 of the abdomen. Mature males have blue eyes. Females lacks the blue colour. Immature males also lack the blue pruinescence and have greeny brown eyes. The pterostigmata of immature males are almost white.

The emerald damselfly has a large Palaeartic distribution, and is found in a band across central Europe and Asia from Spain to the Pacific. It is not found in the far north in Europe and Asia or in the extreme south, being absent from southern Spain, southern Italy and Greece. It probably occurs in some areas of north Africa; where it occurs around the Mediterranean it is found at altitude. In Great Britain it is the only Lestes species that is common.

The gallery has operated four locations since its inception: first on La Cienega Boulevard in Los Angeles, then on Santa Monica Boulevard in West Hollywood, later at Bergamot Station in Santa Monica, and finally in the Arts District, Los Angeles in Downtown Los Angeles.http://www.glasstire.com/socal/2015/03/13/rosamund-felsen-leaves- santa-monica-for-downtown/ History=1970s Rosamund Felsen Gallery was established in 1978 on N. La Cienega Boulevard in Los Angeles, California. In the gallery's first year, the artists exhibited were Guy Dill, Richard Jackson, Keith Sonnier, Peter Lodato, Alexis Smith, Maria Nordman, and William Wegman. In the second year, Karen Carson and Grant Mudford were added to the gallery's program, and Chris Burden‚Äôs Big Wheel was exhibited for the first time, now in the Permanent Collection of Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles' collection. The La Cienega space had been formerly occupied by gallerist, Riko Mizuno and later by Gagosian Gallery. 1980s In 1980, Richard Jackson exhibited his first installation of stacked paintings, Big Ideas, at Rosamund Felsen Gallery. Later versions of stacked paintings, would be exhibited at his retrospective at Orange County Museum of Art. In 1981, the four out of sixteen artists who were in Los Angeles County Museum (LACMA)‚Äôs exhibition, The Museum as Site ‚Äì Sixteen Projects,http://www.lacma.org/sites/all/themes/custom/lacma/reading_room/The_Museum_as_Site_Sixteen_Projects.html#page/n0/mode/2up an exhibition devoted to significance of site-specific art in the 1970s, included Richard Jackson, Chris Burden and the only women artists in the exhibition, Karen Carson and Alexis Smith, were represented by Rosamund Felsen Gallery. On New Year‚Äôs Eve, 1981, a black tie opening was held at the gallery for the exhibition of Robert Rauschenberg‚Äôs photographic series, In + Out City Limits: Los Angeles, one of several series the artist has made of specific cities. Also, in 1981, Jeffrey Vallance was shown, then in 1983 the gallery had its first exhibitions with Mike Kelley and Lari Pittman. In, 1983, Mike Kelly showed \\"one of his breakthrough works\\", Monkey Island, \\"a performance/installation\\" which had been shown at Metro Pictures Gallery in New York the year prior. Later, in 1987, Mike Kelly had another notable exhibition, where he \\"splayed blankets across\\" Rosamund Felsen Gallery's \\"floor and arranged tattered animals around them in formal groupings, like they were attending a picnic without people.\\" The largest piece in this show, More Love Hours Than Can Ever Be Repaid, \\"composed of animals and afghans and stretched 10 feet wide\\" hung next to The Wages of Sin, \\"a pedestal table dripping with candles in rainbow hues, as though audiences were standing before a holy shrine at mass, a nod to his Catholic upbringing.\\" Both those pieces were in included in the Whitney Biennial that year and they were purchased by the Whitney Museum of American Art. The 1980s and the 90s also saw the additions of prominent women artists such Ren√©e Petropoulos, Erika Rothenberg, Meg Cranston, Ann Preston, Joan Jonas, Marnie Weber, and Laura Owens, as well as male artists Tim Ebner and Jason Rhoades. 1990s In 1990, after 12 years at the La Cienega site, Rosamund Felsen Gallery moved to West Hollywood on Santa Monica Boulevard to a space that had previously been the studio of entertainment photographer, Tom Kelley, and where Jason Rhoades had his first gallery exhibition, Swedish Erotica and Fiero Parts. In 1992, for Helter Skelter: L.A. Art in the 1990s, the historically significant exhibition curated by Paul Schimmel at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, four of the seventeen artist chosen to be in the show were Rosamund Felsen Gallery artists Richard Jackson, Mike Kelley, Paul McCarthy, and Lari Pittman. In 1994, Rosamund Felsen Gallery moved to Bergamot Station in Santa Monica, and the important New York video artists Judith Barry and Joan Jonas were added to its list of exhibiting artists, as well as M. A. Peers, Mindy Alper, Jacci Den Hartog, Andrew Falkowski, Steven Hull, Steve Hurd, Nancy Jackson, Gegam Kacherian, Mary Kelly, Jean Lowe, Kim MacConnel, Patrick Nickell and Pauline Stella Sanchez. 2010s In 2011, Rosamund Felsen Gallery saw the addition of Charles Arnoldi to its roster of exhibiting artists,http://artweek.la/issue/jan-17-2011/article/charles-arnoldi-at- rosamund-felsen-gallery and for the gallery's November‚ÄìDecember show, Charles Arnoldi would show influential artworks from the 1970s as part of the Getty Center's Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A. art program throughout Los Angeles. In 2012, for the gallery's end of the year show, Mary Kelly had a gallery exhibition which framed \\"an epoch ‚Äî the period from World War II through the Cold War ‚Äî in a few shrewd conceptual strokes, employing as she often has in her work, the voice of the individual bystander as a mirror to the broader forces of history.\\" From this exhibition, the piece Mimus, Act I (Posner) - which was \\"made of sheets of compressed lint from domestic dryers affixed to variously colored cardboard\\" using language which had been \\"sourced from the court transcripts of the red-baiting House Committee on Un-American Activities and centers on the depositions of activists in the 1950s movement Women Strike for Peace.\\" \\\\- was acquired by the Hammer Museum and would later be shown in the museum exhibition, Take It or Leave It: Institution, Image, Ideology, two years later. In 2013, Rosamund Felsen Gallery was featured in Los Angeles Magazine as one of the top galleries in Los Angeles.Harvey, Doug. \\"Art of the City.\\" Los Angeles Magazine April (2013): 136. Print. In 2014, two of the gallery artists, Mary Kelly and Judith Barry, had works that were included in the exhibition, Take It or Leave It: Institution, Image, Ideology at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles. Take It or Leave It would be \\"the first large-scale exhibition to focus on the intersection of two vitally important genres of contemporary art: appropriation (taking and recasting existing images, forms, and styles from mass-media and fine art sources) and institutional critique (scrutinizing and confronting the structures and practices of our social, cultural, and political institutions).\\" In 2015, Tanya Haden was added to the roster of exhibiting artists and had her first one-artist exhibition while gallery artist Joan Jonas was selected to represent the United States in at Venice Biennale 56th International Art Exhibition. In April 2015, the gallery moved from its Bergamot Station location to a new space in the Arts District, Los Angeles in Downtown Los Angeles. The inaugural exhibition, which ran from April 18 through May 16, 2015, consisted of paintings by Pattern and Decoration pioneer Kim MacConnel. In April 2016, the gallerist Rosamund Felsen received a four-page profile in the culture section of the Los Angeles Times by writer Caroline A. Miranda, documenting Rosamund Felsen Gallery's move along with the cultural migration eastward in Los Angeles & the transitioning cultural landscape of Los Angeles during this time. In June 2016, Rosamund Felsen Gallery announced that it would be closing its Downtown Los Angeles location with the show Celebration, slating it as a ‚Äútribute not only to all the extraordinary artists who have filled both the gallery space and the gallery‚Äôs identity over the years, but also as a marking point for the current gallery artists' ongoing careers.‚Äù Celebration would include pieces by each of the Rosamund Felsen Gallery artists at the time. Rosamund Felsen Gallery continues to represent its artist and maintains a presence online.

A usually paraphrased or abridged version of the Bible, it is a devotional volume whose name refers to its size. Many thumb bibles were intended for children and were decorated with pictures. The first Thumb Bibles were published in the early seventeenth century, with several hundred different editions being printed in subsequent centuries. History The first known Thumb Bible was written by John Weever in verse form. Entitled An Agnus Dei, it appeared in London in 1601. It measured 3.3 by 2.7 cm (1.3 by 1.1 in) and contained 128 pages of six lines. In 1614, John Taylor published his Verbum Sempiternum, which also summarised the Bible in verse form. These were designed to provide instruction to children who were not old enough to read the Bible itself. The first Thumb Bible in prose was published in London in 1727, under the title Biblia or a Practical Summary of ye Old & New Testaments. This contained 300 pages and measured 3.6 by 2.4 cm (1.4 by 0.9 in). The term 'Thumb Bible' was first coined by Longman and Co. of London in the mid-nineteenth century, when they used it on the title page of an edition in 1849. Thumb Bibles continued to be printed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Approximately 300 different editions survive. As well as being published in English, versions were printed in French, German and Dutch.

One of the first fiberglass sailboat manufacturers, they grew rapidly during the 60s and 70s, while also developing and designing new boats. However, the company changed ownership throughout the 1980s, after which the company filed for bankruptcy, and was eventually sold to Grumman Allied Industries in 1991. The rights to the name are now held by the Pearson Marine Group. History=Founding In 1955, cousins Clinton and Everett Pearson began building fiberglass dinghies in their garage on County Street in Seekonk, Massachusetts. The fiberglass material and their methods of construction was brand new and untested. However, Tom Potter from American Boat Building approached the Pearsons with a project to build an auxiliary sailboat that would sell for under $10,000. Naval architect Carl Alberg was given the task of designing the boat. The result was the Triton 28 sailing auxiliary. The first boat was built in the cousins' garage, in time for the 1959 New York Boat Show. Going public In 1959, the Triton 28 was launched at the New York Boat Show. The cousins had to borrow money to pay for the transport of the boat from their garage to the show. The boat proved to be a hit, and the cousins had deposits for 17 orders by the end of the show. To raise the capital to acquire facilities to meet the demand, the cousins made Pearson Yachts public in April 1959. Upon returning to Rhode Island, the cousins purchased the old Herreshoff Yard as an additional production site. Pearson Yachts introduced a number of new models, most of which were also designed by Carl Alberg. By the end of the year, the newly founded Pearson Yachts had over one hundred employees and was turning out nearly one boat per day. This rapid corporate expansion led to cash flow problems. They attempted to get approval for an additional stock offering to raise much needed capital, but were unsuccessful. Grumman takeover (1961‚Äì1991) In 1961, Grumman Allied Industries purchased a controlling interest in Pearson Yachts. The Pearson cousins left the company in the 1960s, and Bill Shaw became the chief designer. One of Shaw's most notable designs is the flush decked Pearson 40, introduced in 1977. Pearson filed for bankruptcy in 1991. At that time TPI Composites, formerly known as Tillotson-Pearson, purchased the rights to the Pearson Yachts brand name.

It is found in Southern Europe, North Africa, and Asia. Description It is a crepuscular dragonfly, active in the dusk. This species can be easily distinguished by the multicolored upper surface of frons and by the shape and relative lengths of the anal appendages. Its labium and labrum are golden- yellow and face and frons are greenish yellow and eyes are green, bluish when aged. Its thorax is pale olivaceous brown with dark brown sutures. Its segment two of the abdomen is turquoise blue. Segment three has a large blue patch at each side. Segments 4 to 9 have an irregular black middorsal stripe. Segment 10 is black. A. parthenope showing blue S2 and S3 and green eyes Comparison with Anax imperator A. parthenope is smaller and less colourful than Anax imperator. In general appearance, especially when seen on the wing, A. parthenope is similar to A. imperator, but A. parthenope tends to hold its abdomen straighter than A. imperator. A large dragonfly seen in flight with a bent abdomen is most likely to be A. imperator rather than A. parthenope. A. parthenope has a blue saddle at S2 and S3 which can be seen in flight, which is in contrast to the rest of the abdomen, which is brown. A yellow ring is at the base of S2. The eyes are green. It is similar to A. ephippiger, although A. ephippiger is slightly smaller and slenderer and its blue saddle does not wrap around S2, but is mostly blue on top. A. ephippiger has brown eyes. Distribution and habitat This species occurs in much of southern and central Europe, including most Mediterranean islands, across Asia to Japan, the Korean Peninsula, and China, and on to North Africa. It has been found on the Canary Islands and the Madeira Archipelago. It is spreading north and was first seen in Great Britain in 1996, where it has since bred. Behaviour Larva of A. parthenope In the south of its range A. parthenope can be on the wing in March. It is most commonly seen from June to September, but can still be around in November. Often seen patrolling around ponds, lakes, and other still water, it occurs with A. imperator, but it is usually less abundant. When A. parthenope and A. imperator occur at the same ponds, A. imperator is dominant. Males and females mate in the normal dragonfly manner and after mating, the pair stay in tandem and egg-laying usually occurs whilst still in tandem. This behaviour not seen in other European hawkers with the exception of Aeshna affinis, although two migrants to Europe, A. ephippiger and A. junius also oviposit in tandem. Eggs are inserted into plants or in mud and hatch out in two months. Larval development takes two years. ReferencesFurther reading * Askew, R.R. (2004). The Dragonflies of Europe. (revised ed.)

He was the eldest son of Maharaja Ranjit Singh and Maharani Datar Kaur. He succeeded his father in June 1839. Background He was born in Lahore in 1801, the first legitimate son of Ranjit Singh and his second wife Datar Kaur.C. Grey, European Adventurers of Northern India, 1785 to 1849, Asian Educational Services, 1996, In 1812, at the age of 11 he was married to Chand Kaur, daughter of Sardar Jaimal Singh, chief of the Kanhaiya Misl. Their son Nau Nihal Singh was born in 1821. In 1816 he married again when he was still a prince, to Bibi Khem Kaur Dhillon, a Jat Sikh daughter of Jodh Singh Kalalvala and grand daughter of Sahib Singh Dhillon. After the Second Anglo-Sikh War in 1849, Bibi Khem's jagirs were reduced by the British raj due to her anti-British role in the war. Early life Kharak received the principality of Jammu as his jagir in 1812. In 1818, together with Misr Diwan Chand he commanded an expedition against the Afghan ruler of Multan Nawab Muzaffar Khan, achieving a decisive victory at the Battle of Multan.He was born into Sandhawalia Jat family.Kartar Singh Duggal, Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the Last to Lay Arms, Abhinav Publications, 2001, p.82 In 1819, he held nominal command of the expedition to conquer Kashmir. Shashikant Nishant Sharma, International Journal of Research (IJR) Three months before his death, Ranjit Singh awarded Kashmir to Kharak, which was seen as a check on the ambitions of Gulab Singh.Vanit Nalwa, Hari Singh Nalwa, \\"champion of the Khalsaji\\" (1791-1837), Manohar, New Delhi, 13 Jan 2009 Maharaja of the Sikh Empire Though courageous and good in battle, Kharak was regarded as simple minded to succeed his father as Maharaja.Bobby Singh Bansal, Remnants of the Sikh Empire: Historical Sikh Monuments in India & Pakistan, Hay House, Inc, 1 Dec 2015, It was believed he lacked his father's diplomatic skills, and wasted himself by consuming excessive amounts of alcohol and opium. He developed a close relationship with his tutor Chet Singh, who gained such an ascendancy over him as to render him a puppet. This relationship with Chet Singh created tensions with Prime Minister Raja Dhian Singh, and in 1839, Chet Singh was murdered. On the death of his father he was proclaimed Maharajah and installed on the throne at Lahore Fort on 1 September 1839. Following his accession, a series of lavish parties, and escalation of his indulgence in drink, drugs and dancing girls alienated many of his advisers and generals.William Dalrymple, Anita Anand, Koh-i-Noor: The History of the World's Most Infamous Diamond, Bloomsbury Publishing, 15 Jun 2017 The Austrian physician Johann Martin Honigberger who was present at court, described his coronation as a dark day for the Punjab, and referred to the Maharajah as a blockhead who twice a day deprived himself of his senses and spent his whole time in a state of stupefaction. Raja Dhian Singh had previously resisted attempts to allow Kharak training in state craft, and on 8 October 1839 he instigated his removal from the throne with Nau Nihal Singh becoming de facto ruler.J. S. Grewal, The Sikhs of the Punjab, Volumes 2-3, Cambridge University Press, 8 Oct 1998, p.120 Death Kharak Singh was poisoned with white lead and mercury. Within six months he was bedridden, and eleven months after the poisoning he died on 5 November 1840 in Lahore.G. S. Chhabra, Advance Study in the History of Modern India (Volume-2: 1803-1920), Lotus Press, 2005, p.176 The official announcement blamed a sudden mysterious illness. Though never proven, most contemporaries believed Raja Dhian Singh to be behind the poisoning. At his funeral, three of his wives committed sati.

Rearranging terms, we get : v_{k+1} = (2 + h^2 \\\\lambda)v_k - v_{k-1}. ! Now let 2 \\\\alpha = (2 + h^2 \\\\lambda) . Also, assuming v_1 eq 0 , we can scale eigenvectors by any nonzero scalar, so scale v so that v_1 = 1 . Then we find the recurrence : v_0 = 0 \\\\,! : v_1 = 1. \\\\,! : v_{k+1} = 2 \\\\alpha v_{k} - v_{k-1} \\\\,! Considering \\\\alpha as an indeterminate, : v_{k+1} = U_k (\\\\alpha) \\\\,! where U_k is the kth Chebyshev polynomial of the 2nd kind. Since v_{n+1} = 0 , we get that : U_n (\\\\alpha) = 0 \\\\,!. It is clear that the eigenvalues of our problem will be the zeros of the nth Chebyshev polynomial of the second kind, with the relation 2 \\\\alpha = (2 + h^2 \\\\lambda) . These zeros are well known and are: : \\\\alpha_k = \\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\frac{k \\\\pi}{n+1}\\\\right). \\\\,! Plugging these into the formula for \\\\lambda , : 2 \\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\frac{k \\\\pi}{n+1}\\\\right) = h^2 \\\\lambda_k + 2 \\\\,! : \\\\lambda_k = -\\\\frac{2}{h^2}\\\\left[1 - \\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\frac{k \\\\pi}{n+1}\\\\right)\\\\right]. \\\\,! And using a trig formula to simplify, we find : \\\\lambda_k = -\\\\frac{4}{h^2}\\\\sin^2\\\\left(\\\\frac{k \\\\pi}{2(n+1)}\\\\right). \\\\,! Neumann case In the Neumann case, we are solving : \\\\frac{v_{k+1} -2v_k + v_{k-1}}{h^2} = \\\\lambda v_{k}, \\\\ k = 1,...,n, \\\\ v'_{0.5} = v'_{n+0.5} = 0. \\\\,! In the standard discretization, we introduce v_{0}\\\\,! and v_{n+1}\\\\,! and define : v'_{0.5} := \\\\frac{v_1 - v_0}{h}, \\\\ v'_{n+0.5} := \\\\frac{v_{n+1} - v_n}{h} \\\\,! The boundary conditions are then equivalent to : v_1 - v_0 = 0, \\\\ v_{n+1} - v_n = 0. If we make a change of variables, : w_k = v_{k+1} - v_k, \\\\ k = 0,...,n \\\\,! we can derive the following: : \\\\begin{alignat}{2} \\\\frac{v_{k+1} -2v_k + v_{k-1}}{h^2} & = \\\\lambda v_{k} \\\\ v_{k+1} -2v_k + v_{k-1} & = h^2 \\\\lambda v_{k} \\\\ (v_{k+1} - v_k) - (v_k - v_{k-1}) & = h^2 \\\\lambda v_{k} \\\\ w_k - w_{k-1} & = h^2 \\\\lambda v_{k} \\\\ & = h^2 \\\\lambda w_{k-1} + h^2 \\\\lambda v_{k-1} \\\\ & = h^2 \\\\lambda w_{k-1} + w_{k-1} - w_{k-2} \\\\ w_{k} & = (2 + h^2 \\\\lambda) w_{k-1} - w_{k-2} \\\\ w_{k+1} & = (2 + h^2 \\\\lambda) w_{k} - w_{k-1} \\\\ & = 2 \\\\alpha w_k - w_{k-1}. \\\\end{alignat} with w_{n} = w_{0} = 0 being the boundary conditions. This is precisely the Dirichlet formula with n-1 interior grid points and grid spacing h. Similar to what we saw in the above, assuming w_{1} eq 0 , we get : \\\\lambda_k = -\\\\frac{4}{h^2}\\\\sin^2\\\\left(\\\\frac{k \\\\pi}{2n}\\\\right), \\\\ k = 1,...,n-1. This gives us n-1 eigenvalues and there are n. If we drop the assumption that w_{1} eq 0 , we find there is also a solution with v_{k} = \\\\mathrm{constant} \\\\ \\\\forall \\\\ k=0,...,n+1, and this corresponds to eigenvalue 0. Relabeling the indices in the formula above and combining with the zero eigenvalue, we obtain, : \\\\lambda_k = -\\\\frac{4}{h^2}\\\\sin^2\\\\left(\\\\frac{(k-1) \\\\pi}{2n}\\\\right), \\\\ k = 1,...,n. Dirichlet-Neumann Case For the Dirichlet-Neumann case, we are solving : \\\\frac{v_{k+1} -2v_k + v_{k-1}}{h^2} = \\\\lambda v_{k}, \\\\ k=1,...,n, \\\\ v_0 = v'_{n+0.5} = 0., where v'_{n+0.5} := \\\\frac{v_{n+1} - v_n}{h}. We need to introduce auxiliary variables v_{j + 0.5}, \\\\ j = 0,...,n. Consider the recurrence : v_{k+0.5} = 2 \\\\beta v_{k} - v_{k-0.5}, \\\\text{ for some }\\\\beta \\\\,!. Also, we know v_0 = 0 and assuming v_{0.5} eq 0 , we can scale v_{0.5} so that v_{0.5} = 1. We can also write : v_{k} = 2 \\\\beta v_{k-0.5} - v_{k-1} \\\\,! : v_{k+1} = 2 \\\\beta v_{k+0.5} - v_{k}. \\\\,! Taking the correct combination of these three equations, we can obtain : v_{k+1} = (4 \\\\beta^2 - 2) v_{k} - v_{k-1}. \\\\,! And thus our new recurrence will solve our eigenvalue problem when : h^2 \\\\lambda + 2 = (4 \\\\beta^2 - 2). \\\\,! Solving for \\\\lambda we get : \\\\lambda = \\\\frac{4 (\\\\beta^2 - 1)}{h^2}. Our new recurrence gives :v_{n+1} = U_{2n + 1}(\\\\beta), \\\\ v_{n} = U_{2n - 1}(\\\\beta), \\\\,! where U_{k}(\\\\beta) again is the kth Chebyshev polynomial of the 2nd kind. And combining with our Neumann boundary condition, we have : U_{2n + 1}(\\\\beta) - U_{2n - 1}(\\\\beta) = 0. \\\\,! A well-known formula relates the Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind, T_k(\\\\beta), to those of the second kind by : U_{k}(\\\\beta) - U_{k - 2}(\\\\beta) = T_k (\\\\beta). \\\\,! Thus our eigenvalues solve : T_{2n + 1} (\\\\beta) = 0, \\\\ \\\\lambda = \\\\frac{4 (\\\\beta^2 - 1)}{h^2}. \\\\,! The zeros of this polynomial are also known to be : \\\\beta_{k} = \\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi (k - 0.5)}{2n + 1}\\\\right), \\\\ k=1,...,2n + 1 \\\\,! And thus : \\\\begin{alignat}{2} \\\\lambda_{k} & = \\\\frac{4}{h^2}\\\\left[\\\\cos^2\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi (k - 0.5)}{2n + 1}\\\\right) - 1\\\\right] \\\\ & = -\\\\frac{4}{h^2}\\\\sin^2\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi (k - 0.5)}{2n + 1}\\\\right). \\\\end{alignat} Note that there are 2n + 1 of these values, but only the first n + 1 are unique. The (n + 1)th value gives us the zero vector as an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0, which is trivial. This can be seen by returning to the original recurrence. So we consider only the first n of these values to be the n eigenvalues of the Dirichlet - Neumann problem. : \\\\lambda_{k} = -\\\\frac{4}{h^2}\\\\sin^2\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi (k - 0.5)}{2n + 1}\\\\right), \\\\ k = 1,...,n.

Biography Nexhip Draga was born in 1867 in Mitrovi√ßa (now Mitrovica), then a town of the Ottoman Empire. His brother was Ferhat Draga and their father was Ali Pasha Draga, a notable local of Mitrovi√ßa who owned lands in the Sanjak of Novi Pazar. He finished his elementary studies in his home town before going to Constantinople (Istanbul), where he studied at an idadiye school and the Mekteb-i M√ºlkiye (modern Ankara University). While in Istanbul Draga was recruited as one of the first members of the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) by its founder and fellow Albanian Ibrahim Temo. During his lifetime Draga was well educated and had a reputation of being a cultured man. Apart from Albanian Draga spoke and wrote French, Turkish, Serbian and Bulgarian. He owned large landholdings in the Mitrovica area and in the town had a modern German manufactured steam powered sawmill. He completed his administrative studies in √úsk√ºp (Skopje), Monastir Province. From 1896 to 1902 he was kaymakam (sub-governor) at Kratovo, Yeni Pazar (Novi Pazar) and K√∂pr√ºl√º (Veles). Draga was one of the leaders of the Committee of Union and Progress in √úsk√ºp. He had been approached by one of the Young Turk organisations The Ottoman Freedom Society to establish in √úsk√ºp a local branch. Draga at his house along with Adjutant-Major Cafer Tayyar (Eƒüilmez), Colonel Galib (Pasinler) Bey, S√ºreyya Bey, a clerk of the √úsk√ºp court, Islam Bey, a tax office director and Mazhar Bey the general secretary to the governor's office founded a local CUP branch. The √úsk√ºp CUP branch pushed for restoration of the Ottoman constitution and it became an important centre due to the involvement of many Albanian notables with its membership by April 1908 exceeding 100 people. In √úsk√ºp, Draga was also an influential figure of the Albanian club (founded 1908). During the Young Turk Revolution (1908), Galib Bey managed to get Albanian leaders Nexhip Draga, Ferhat Draga and Bajram Curri to attend a meeting at Firzovik (modern Ferizaj) and use their influence to sway the crowd through fears of \\"foreign intervention\\" to support constitutional restoration. Draga's CUP branch played a prominent role in rousing Albanians at the Albanian assembly of Firzovik (1908). The same year, during the Second Constitutional Era of the Ottoman Empire, he was elected deputy for Skopje, Monastir Province. Along with Ismail Qemali, Hasan Prishtina and Shahin Kolonja he was a member of the group of deputies promoting Albanian issues such as the use of a Latin character based Albanian alphabet in the Ottoman parliament and opposing the Young Turks. Toward the end of 1908 Draga and other notables in Kosovo viewed Isa Boletini as a nuisance, threat and loyalist of sultan Abdulhamid II and lobbied the new Young Turk government for his arrest and destruction of his kulla (tower house). Class differences of Draga, a landowner wanting law and order and Boletini, a chieftain preferring maintenance of old privileges and autonomy along with the disagreement in Ferizovi√ß about the restoration of the constitution resulted in the rift. Unable to convince CUP members in Mitrovica to take action, Draga traveled to Salonika and pleaded his case to the local CUP committee who approved and got the Ottoman government to act against Boletini. Like some educated Albanians with nationalist sentiments of the time, Draga supported the unity of Albanians from different religions under the banner of Skanderbeg and was in favour of government reforms that benefited Albanians. In 1912, due to the deteriorating situation between Albanians and Ottoman authorities, Draga alongside other Albanian leaders were present at a meeting in Junik on 20 May where a besa (pledge) was given to wage war on the Young Turk government. In 1912 he became a prominent member of the Albanian Revolt of 1912. On 18 August 1912, Draga was part of the moderate faction that managed to convince other leaders of the revolt Idriz Seferi, Curri and Boletini of the conservative group to accept the agreement with the Ottomans for Albanian sociopolitical and cultural rights. During the Balkan Wars he was imprisoned in Belgrade by the Kingdom of Serbia and then was released in 1914. In 1920 he formed a political organization named D≈æemijet and was elected deputy in the Yugoslav parliament along with six other members of his party. He died a few months later in Vienna, Austria, after undergoing an operation for cancer. After Draga's death, the leadership of the party was assumed by his brother Ferhat, under whose leadership the party managed to get fourteen deputies elected in the 1923 elections.

Its common names include emerald spreadwing, scarce emerald damselfly and robust spreadwing.Boudot, J. 2014. Lestes dryas. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Downloaded on 28 January 2016. An alternate name in Ireland is the turlough spreadwing. This species is native to the Holarctic, especially northern parts of Eurasia and North America. It is relictual in North Africa. L. dryas can tolerate extreme conditions that few other dragonflies can survive.  Identification  This damselfly is about 35 to 42 millimeters long, the males are generally longer than the females. The males' wingspan is about 45 millimeters and the females' about 47 millimeters.Watson, L., and Dallwitz, M. J. 2003 onwards. Lestes dryas (Kirby, 1890). British insects: Dragonglies and Damselflies (Odonata). Version: 1st January 2012. Like the other members of the genus Lestes, both sexes of L. dryas have largely metallic green bodies with a bronze iridescence. They usually rest with their wings half spread. L.dryas is very similar in appearance to the emerald damselfly Lestes sponsa and care must be taken to tell the two species apart. The male has blue eyes. Powder blue pruinescence develops on the front and end of the abdomen, the pronotum and the sides of the thorax. However all Lestes are very similar in appearance and it is the shape and colour of the anal appendage that is characteristic. The anal appendages in L. dryas and L. sponsa are black whilst in the other European Lestes they are white or light coloured. L. dryas and L. sponsa have slightly different shaped appendages as show in the photographs. {  L. dryas male, anal appendage  L. sponsa male, anal appendage } The female has a more robust abdomen than the male. She has no blue colouration on her body and has brown to green eyes. Females have beige underparts. L. dryas female Habitat and distribution L. dryas is found in a band around the world from 40¬∞ north to 60¬∞ north across central Europe and Asia from France to the Pacific and across North America. L. dryas is the only Lestes that occurs in Europe and in North America. Around the Mediterranean it is found at altitude. It is found in still, shallow water in well vegetated ditches, ponds, bogs and lakes. It can be found near the coast in slightly brackish water. It is widespread in Europe but is never as common as L. sponsa. It was believed to be extinct in Britain before being rediscovered in 1983. Since then it has been found at several sites in south-east England. They breed mainly round the Thames Estuary and in a few inland lakes in Norfolk and Ireland. Behaviour L. dryas male, with crippled left hind wing Adults fly from April in the south of its range to late May in the north but are on the wing mostly in July and August. They tend to live in dense vegetation and rarely fly over open water, staying near the margins of the pond or lake. They mate in the normal damselfly manner by forming the wheel position and after copulation the male stays in tandem, guarding the female while she lays her eggs. Elongated eggs are laid, usually above water, into plant stems, such as rushes, which are covered as water levels rise in winter. The eggs develop for a few weeks when, in response to environmental conditions the rate of development slows down and the eggs are said to be in diapause. In this state the eggs overwinter. The eggs hatch in spring and give rise to the prolarval stage. This is a specialised short lived stage often lasting only minutes. The prolarva has no limbs and cannot feed but it can move by jumping or wriggling and if a prolarva is not in water when it hatches it will move about until water is found. Once in water the prolarva moult to the second stadia stage. The larvae are active and actively hunt prey leading to rapid larval growth. The larvae moult from one stadia to the next until growth is complete; in dragonflies the larval stages are the only stages where growth occurs. The number of stadia is not fixed and in good conditions the last larval stage, called F-0 can be reached in as little as 8 weeks. The newly emerged adults are not able to breed until a period of sexual maturation occurs and it is during this period that the blue pruinescence develops. NotesReferences * Askew, R. R. (2004).

He served as Chief of the General Staff (CGS) from 1958 to 1960. Born in Western Australia, Garrett graduated from the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in 1921. He was adjutant and quartermaster in several regiments of the Australian Light Horse before undertaking staff training in England, which he completed just as the Second World War broke out. Garrett joined the Second Australian Imperial Force soon afterwards, and commanded the 2/31st Battalion in England before seeing action with Australian brigades in Greece and Crete in 1941. Promoted to colonel the following year, he held senior positions with I Corps in New Guinea and II Corps on Bougainville in 1944‚Äì1945. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his staff work. After the war, Garrett served two terms as commandant of the Staff College, Queenscliff, in 1946‚Äì1947 and 1949‚Äì1951. Between these appointments he was posted to Japan with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. Promoted to major general, he took charge of Western Command in August 1951, and became Deputy Chief of the General Staff in January 1953. He took over Southern Command as a lieutenant general in October 1954, and was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1957. As CGS from March 1958, Garrett focused on rearmament and reorganisation, initiating the Army's short-lived restructure into a \\"pentropic\\" formation. He was knighted in 1959. After retiring from the military in June 1960, Garrett became honorary colonel of the Royal Australian Regiment, and was principal of the Australian Administrative Staff College until 1964. He died at Mornington, Victoria, in 1977. Early life Born on 12 February 1900 in Northam, Western Australia, Alwyn Ragnar Garrett was the son of accountant Alwyn Garrett and his Swedish wife Maria Carolina (n√©e Wohlfahrt). Ragnar attended Guildford Grammar School before entering the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in 1918. He graduated in 1921 and was posted to the Australian Light Horse as a lieutenant.The Army List, p. 439 In November 1922, Garrett was appointed adjutant/quartermaster of the 23rd Light Horse Regiment. The following month he served as an extra aide-de-camp to the new Governor of South Australia, General Sir Tom Bridges. In November 1923, Garrett was seconded to the British Army, and spent the next twelve months attached to the 2nd Dragoon Guards in Bangalore, India. On his return to Australia in January 1925, he was reappointed adjutant/quartermaster of the 23rd Light Horse. He married Shirley Lorraine Hunter, a nurse, on 9 September at St Peter's Anglican Church in the Adelaide suburb of Glenelg; the couple had a son and a daughter. Garrett became adjutant/quartermaster of the 9th Light Horse Regiment at Jamestown, South Australia, in February 1926. He was promoted to captain in November 1929. In March 1930, Garrett was posted as adjutant/quartermaster to the 3rd Light Horse Regiment at Mount Gambier, South Australia. As a speaker at Mount Gambier's Anzac Day commemorations on 25 April 1934, he was reported as warning of the poor state of Australia's preparedness for war, admonishing: \\"We shall not have the time that we had before the last war, and we shall not be fighting for our homes thousands of miles away. We shall be fighting at our own back door. That is what we have to prepare for.\\" In August that year he was transferred to the 4th Light Horse Regiment at Warrnambool, Victoria, as adjutant/quartermaster. Garrett was posted to the staff of Army Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1936, and departed for England in November the following year to attend the Staff College, Camberley. He was promoted to major in July 1938, and returned to Australia upon the outbreak of the Second World War. Second World War Kanda at the Japanese surrender on Bougainville, 8 September 1945. Vice Admiral Samejima sits opposite, and Lieutenant General Savige is at the head of table. Garrett joined the Second Australian Imperial Force in November 1939, and was appointed brigade major of the 18th Brigade under Brigadier Leslie Morshead in January 1940.Long, To Benghazi, pp. 44, 48 The brigade departed for the Middle East in May but, owing to the military situation following the Fall of France, it was diverted to Britain, arriving in June.Long, To Benghazi, pp. 85‚Äì86 Garrett was promoted lieutenant colonel on 16 September and took command of the 2/31st Battalion the same day; he handed over to Selwyn Porter in February 1941, and departed England for the Middle East.Pratten, Australian Battalion Commanders in the Second World War, p. 327 From March to June he served as General Staff Officer Grade 2 (Operations) of I Corps under Lieutenant General Sir Thomas Blamey.Keating, The Right Man for the Right Job, pp. 63‚Äì64 In April Garrett was briefly seconded to Savige Force, which fought in Greece under Brigadier Stanley Savige. Savige recorded that when Garrett was posted back to corps headquarters, it \\"affected me more than the bombing ... I was very sorry to lose Garrett, who served me splendidly over the hectic days of the recent past\\".Keating, The Right Man for the Right Job, p. 67 Garrett was also attached to the 19th Brigade in Crete. Returning to Australia, Garrett was promoted to temporary colonel in April 1942 and became senior operations officer in the 1st Armoured Division, which served as a garrison force in case of Japanese invasion. He was posted to Army Headquarters, Melbourne, in October as Director of Armoured Fighting Vehicles. In September 1943, he was appointed General Staff Officer Grade 1 (Operations) of I Corps under Lieutenant General Sir Edmund Herring in New Guinea.Dexter, The New Guinea Offensives, p. 279 Three months later he was promoted to temporary brigadier and became Brigadier General Staff of I Corps. He continued to serve in that position as I Corps was redesignated II Corps in April 1944, New Guinea Force the following month, and finally II Corps again in October 1944 for the campaign on Bougainville under Lieutenant General Savige.Dexter, The New Guinea Offensives, pp. 780, 788Long, The Final Campaigns, pp. 24‚Äì25, 97 The campaign was controversial in that it appeared to have little impact on the main drive against Japan; Garrett was quoted as calling it \\"an absolute waste of time\\".Keating, The Right Man for the Right Job, p. 146 Garrett was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his \\"skill, direction, and supervision of the highest order\\" in having \\"prepared and guided all staff work to meet every conceivable requirement in the complete reorganisation of forces in New Guinea\\"; the honour was promulgated in The London Gazette on 19 July 1945. Garrett was also responsible for interrogating the first Japanese peace envoy to make contact with the Australians on Bougainville, on 18 August 1945, and was present when the instrument of surrender was signed on 8 September.Long, The Final Campaigns, pp. 557‚Äì558James, The Hard Slog, pp. 253‚Äì254 In November 1945, he took command of the 8th Brigade in New Guinea. He oversaw the brigade's return to Australia before its disbandment in March 1946. His \\"exceptional service in the field\\" in the South West Pacific Area earned him a mention in despatches, which was gazetted on 6 March 1947 and backdated to 2 November 1946. Post- war career Brigadier Garrett (left) with Air Vice Marshal alt=Two uniformed men in peaked caps Following a three-month course at the Staff College, Camberley, Garrett was appointed commandant of the Staff College, Queenscliff, Victoria, in June 1946. He was posted to Japan in March 1947, becoming Brigadier-in-Charge of Administration for the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in July. The size and scope of the occupation declined considerably during his tour, which finished in October 1949. Approximately 2,400 Australians, most from the 67th Battalion, remained by late 1948, compared to 11,000 in October 1946.Palazzo, The Australian Army, p. 201Grey, The Australian Army, pp. 164‚Äì166 In December 1949, Garrett resumed command of the Staff College, Queenscliff. Promoted temporary major general, he was appointed General Officer Commanding (GOC) Western Command, which covered the state of Western Australia, in August 1951.Palazzo, The Australian Army, p. 224 He became Deputy Chief of the General Staff in February 1953. In December 1953, Garrett succeeded Major General Eric Woodward as Adjutant-General and Second Military Member of the Military Board. He was promoted temporary lieutenant general in October 1954 and appointed GOC Southern Command, which covered Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania and was, as of April 1953, the superior headquarters for several major Citizen Military Forces (CMF) formations including the 3rd Infantry Division, the 4th and 6th Infantry Brigades, the 2nd Armoured Brigade, and two artillery groups.Palazzo, The Australian Army, pp. 224, 238 His elevation to lieutenant general was made permanent in December 1954. Garrett was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the Queen's Birthday Honours on 13 June 1957. He succeeded Lieutenant General Sir Henry Wells as Chief of the General Staff (CGS) on 23 March 1958. Garrett was raised to Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1959 New Year Honours. The Army underwent significant change during Garrett's term as CGS. In March 1959, he chaired the first meeting of the Military Board at the new Army Headquarters in Canberra, following its move from Melbourne. Alan Stretton, executive officer to the Military Board at the time, recalled Garrett's sense of humour and \\"most informal\\" manner.Stretton, Soldier in a Storm, pp. 134, 138 In August, the CGS announced to his senior officers a radical reorganisation of the Army that would strengthen the regular forces and reduce reliance on the CMF, which since Federation had formed the backbone of Australia's military. This plan included the abolition of National Service, to which the Federal government had already agreed, and the introduction of a \\"pentropic\\" divisional structure.Horner, Strategic Command, pp. 176‚Äì177 Garrett championed the pentropic structure to overcome what he saw as the weakness of the traditional battalion for overseas deployments, and to ensure compatibility with the US Army's pentomic formations. The Australian Army's traditional \\"triangular\\" divisional structure of three infantry battalions under a brigade headquarters was to be replaced with an organisation consisting of five larger battalions (hence \\"pentropic\\") without a brigade layer between division and battalion headquarters.Grey, The Australian Army, pp. 204‚Äì207 The plan was opposed by CMF officers as it would result in the disbandment of the citizens' brigades and many of the old militia battalions. Under the new structure the CMF would not only shrink, its units would lose traditional ties to local communities through the establishment of new multi-battalion state-based regiments, leading to suspicion in some quarters that the entire process was designed to demolish the CMF.Palazzo, The Australian Army, pp. 257‚Äì258 Garrett was concerned not only with changing the Army's organisation but with upgrading its equipment; by the early 1960s the Army would acquire the FN 7.62mm rifle, the M60 machine gun, the M101 105mm howitzer, the M113 armoured personnel carrier, and new mortars and radios. He also advocated strongly for the Army to operate its own helicopters and light aircraft; the Australian Army Aviation Corps was eventually established in July 1968.Horner, Strategic Command, pp. 295, 302 Garrett was scheduled to retire from the Army on his sixtieth birthday in February 1960 but the government extended his term. He retired on 30 June 1960 and was succeeded by Lieutenant General Reg Pollard, whom Garrett had recommended for the post in the face of opposition from the Minister for the Army, John Cramer, who had attempted to appoint Major General Ivan Dougherty, a retired CMF officer.Horner, Strategic Command, pp. 194‚Äì195 Although Garrett's proposed reorganisation of the Army along pentropic lines went ahead under Pollard, it proved short-lived. The US Army abandoned the system in June 1961, and the Australian Army returned to the triangular formation following a review commissioned by Pollard's successor as CGS, Lieutenant General Sir John Wilton, in October 1964.Grey, The Australian Army, pp. 209Dennis et al, Oxford Companion to Australian Military History, pp. 419‚Äì420 Later life On retiring from the military, Garrett became principal of the Australian Administrative Staff College, a private institution delivering courses to senior business and government personnel at Mount Eliza, Victoria. During his four-year tenure, he lobbied for the reintroduction of conscription, and when the Federal government brought in a new selective service scheme in 1965, he was invited to draw the first ballot of names. Garrett also recommended that the Army should have a division prepared for war at all times. He served as honorary colonel of the Royal Australian Regiment and the Royal Western Australia Regiment from 1960 until 1965, when he was appointed Chairman of the Western Australian Coastal Shipping Commission, a position he held until 1970. He died on 4 November 1977 at Mornington, Victoria, and was cremated. His wife had died earlier, and he was survived by his two children.

It can be found in temperate regions, mostly in Korea, in lawns, on roadsides, and other areas with moist soils. Korean starwort is a Korean endemic plant and was first named in the genus Aster in 1909. In Korea, its young leaves are used in food preparation. Description Aster koraiensis is a perennial herb. The height is about 50~60 cm. The leaves are green color, alternate, lanceolate and pinnately lobed. They are 12~19 cm length and 1.5~3 cm width of leaves. The main stem grows from rhizome, a horizontal stem of plant that is found underground. The leaves on the roots, radical leaves, fall when flowers begin to open. Leaflike bracts can be found. The flower is bisexual and pale violet color and has an inflorescence head which diameter is about 4~5 cm (Only one flower per stem). The involucre is 13 mm length, and 8 mm diameter and has four lines of involucral scale. The achene has about 4 mm length and 1.3 mm diameter and lanceolate shape. There is no pappus. It blooms from June to September; the fruits (achenes) mature in November. Distribution M. koraiensis originated in Korea and also is naturalized throughout Korea peninsula (South Korea and North Korea). It can be easily found anywhere in Korea (around flower gardens, roadsides, mountains, valley, etc.). Economic value The characteristic of tenacious hold on life of M. koraiensis makes it possible for massive breeding. The roots are strong to hold on to the ground firmly, and easily grow in most environments, even in barren soil. It has ability to prevent soil runoff so that sometimes these flowers are planted on roadsides, and places where need erosion control. Origin of the name In the name Aster koraiensis, 'Aster' means \\"star\\" in Greek, and 'koraiensis' means \\"from Korea\\". Due to the star shape of flower, it got this name. In Korea, M. koraiensis is called \\"Beolgaemichui\\". 'Beol' means bee in Korean so some people think the name \\"Beolgaemichui (Î≤åÍ∞úÎØ∏Ï∑®)\\" came from the belief that bees love this flower. Language of flowers In the language of flowers, sometimes called floriography, this flower means \\"I will never forget the memory, nostalgia, and you.\\" References koraiensis Category:Plants described in 1909 ","title":"Miyamayomena koraiensis"},{"id":"26992271","text":"Old Wives is an unincorporated community in the Rural Municipality of Hillsborough No. 132, Saskatchewan, Canada.  History  The village that became Old Wives was formed about 1900 but it was not until 1929 that the community official got the name. Mail delivery began 1911, when Tom Lundrigan began bringing in the mail from the post office in Mortlach. Eventually, a post office was open January the 1st 1912 and remained open until it closed on October 10, 1969. The area was home to several schools with the first having opened in 1916. Bay Island School, officially Bay Island School District #4362, was a one-room school on Highway 363 just east of Old Wives, served the community from 1919 to 1950. The building still stands today. The first general store in town opened in Mr. Bill Sheldon‚Äôs house in 1920. In 1930 a new store was built at the town site and it would operate for nearly 40 years, before closing in 1968. In 1931 the CPR laid tracks from Archive to Shamrock and in 1933 a Saskatchewan Wheat Pool elevator was built alongside the tracks. On Jul 4, 1930, a De Havilland DH.60 Moth crashed on takeoff from Old Wives. The fate of the pilot is unknown but the aircraft was destroyed by the post- crash fire. Old Wives has been a ghost town for several decades and while the town briefly prospered, The Great Depression and severe droughts in 1937, 1951 and 1959 began an irreversible downward spiral. Many businesses closed in the 1950s and 60s. The final nail in the coffin for the community came in 1973 when the railroad was abandoned, followed by the Pool elevator being moved to Bateman in 1975. Today, very little remains of Old Wives.  Legend  Old Wives and nearby Old Wives Lake were named after a local Cree legend. According to traditional stories recounted by M√©tis guides accompanying the North West Mounted Police in 1874, sometime around 1840 a band of Cree hunters followed a herd of bison into Blackfoot territory and made camp near the lake. Blackfoot scouts discovered this band and attacked. Although the Cree were able to defend themselves, they anticipated an attack by a larger Blackfoot war party the next morning. The older women volunteered to stay behind to tend the fires through the night in the hope of fooling the Blackfoot into believing that they were not abandoning their camp to escape. Using this diversion as cover, the rest of the Cree successfully fled back to their home territory in the Qu'Appelle valley. When the Blackfoot arrived that morning they found only the old women, whom the Blackfoot killed in vengeance. This commonly recited version of the lake's naming has been commemorated by a historical marker situated beside Highway 2 near the lake. A variant telling of this narrative states that the Blackfoot warriors were so impressed by the women's courage that they left them alone and allowed them to rejoin their own people. Another First Nations oral tradition describes how a band of Assiniboine fleeing from pursuing Blackfoot warriors abandoned the old women in their band who could not keep pace with everyone else. The women continued their effort to escape by wading across the lake. However, they misjudged the water's depth and drowned. An Assiniboine tradition associates the name with a battle which occurred at the lake around the beginning of the 19th century in which Assiniboines vanquished their Blackfoot enemies. According to some First Nations traditions, the spirits of the dead women continue to haunt a small island in the lake from which their voices can be heard at night.

Part Two, entitled \\"The Journey Through Consciousness,\\" contains ten chapters of commentary. Most correspond to particular concepts from the Katha that are expounded by the author: :3. City of Eleven Gates. \\"If the body is a city... we are the ruler.... Unfortunately, however.... we begin to identify ourselves with the walls and gates.\\" (pp. 59-60) :4. Gross and Subtle. Distinguishes the \\"gross\\" physical body (sth≈´la-sharƒ´ra) from the \\"subtle body\\" (s≈´kshma-sharƒ´ra), that \\"corresponds roughly to what we call the mind - our feelings, desires, intellect, and will\\" (p. 73) :5. A field of Forces. The Upanishadic conception of the mind as regulated by conditioned, automatic ways of thinking (samskaras) is explained as analogous to viewing the mind as a field of forces. Also explains the Upanishadic concept of energy (prana), and describes its relation to health. :6. Will and Desire. Presents ways that the human \\"will-quotient\\" can be gradually trained to match, and then co-opt, the power of desire. :7. Clear Seeing. Provides practical insight into psychological constructs, both Western and Indian, such as the 'higher' and 'lower' minds, 'manas,' 'buddhi,' and 'citta.' :8. Stream of Thought. Introduces theoretical concepts about the mind with their practical consequences: the quantum nature of thoughts (\\"...between two successive thoughts there is no connection at all\\"), the speed of thinking and how it can be regulated, acting versus reacting, and managing one's likes and dislikes. This section ends with a description of the \\"still mind\\" as the goal of meditation. :9. Shadow and Self. Speaks of a real and very grand identity within everyone, which people are generally not aware of, but which can be realized. :10. Death and Dreaming. Deals with the process of dying, and of death, as states that people can learn to transcend. :11. Waking Up. Describes what the author calls the \\"unitive state,\\" again emphasizing that people can strive to reach such an exalted state through practical means. :12. Lesson of the Lilac. Summarizes the import of the book. Says the author: \\"Life is too short to play for nickels and dimes... This book was written for men and women with the daring and dedication to break the bank.\\" Reviews and influence Reviews have appeared in the Los Angeles Times, Ottawa Citizen, (NB: The article states that \\"Radhika Sekar has a PhD in Religious Studies and taught Hinduism at Carleton University for several years.\\") Yoga International, (NB: In, 2006, this journal was renamed as Yoga + Joyful Living, ) Library Journal, Yoga Journal, and elsewhere.Frederic Brussat & Mary Ann Brussat. Untitled review of Essence of the Upanishads: A key to Indian spirituality, by Eknath Easwaran Spirituality & Practice (website), accessed 16 April 2010. The Los Angeles Times wrote that the author \\"has given us a clear, almost controversial book that draws on the text and teachings of an ancient mystical faith and applies them to the concerns of contemporary life. His insights into the use of meditation to overcome the fear of death are comforting, reassuring, invigorating... [and this] is as much a book about the richness of life as it is about the end of living.\\" In the Ottawa Citizen, Radhika Sekar wrote that \\"There are several English versions of this Upanishad, most of them dry translations from Sanskrit by Hindu monks. [This translator and commentator,] however, was a householder... He thus had a grasp of both spiritual and secular worlds and... was firmly rooted in traditional wisdom and family values. He therefore co-relates the spiritual message to the everyday dilemmas faced by ordinary laity and presents the lofty Upanishad as a practical guide.\\" Yoga International stated that the author \\"often personifies philosophical and spiritual principles, thus removing them from the realm of the abstract. One of the central points in the Katha Upanishad is the distinction between the good (shreya) and the pleasant (preya) and the importance of choosing shreya.\\" In imagery used in the commentary, the author > transforms these two principles into persistent door-to-door sales > representatives, who will seek you out, even if you \\"retire to a cave in the > Adirondacks.\\".... Similarly, the gross body and subtle bodies are portrayed > as a married couple.... [and] Will and desire are portrayed as competitors > in \\"a really long marathon, one that goes on for years...\\" (p. 68) Yoga Journal stated that \\"After years of meditation and practice 'living out' the Katha in the modern world, Easwaran is intimate in his writing. 'I write not as a scholar,\\" he says, \\"but as an explorer back from a long, long voyage, eager to tell what he has found.'\\" Psychiatrist Aaron Beck and his colleagues quoted from the commentary portion of the book. They stated that \\"E. Easwaran uses the metaphor of channels in the brain to describe how a person's major concern develops.... Patients respond well to this metaphor.\\" Aaron T.

Early life Walters was born on the Juniata River in Liverpool, Pennsylvania on May 23, 1820. He was the son of the Scotch-Irish banker Henry Walters. Walters studied civil engineering at the University of Pennsylvania. Career While educated as a civil engineer, he became interested in the coal and iron industry. While directing a smelting establishment in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, Walters produced the first iron manufactured from mineral coal in the United States. In 1841, he moved to Baltimore, where he worked as a grain merchant and, in 1847, became a liquor wholesaler by establishing the importing firm of William T. Walters & Co. He spent much of the American Civil War in Europe, where he studied and purchased art. After the end of the war, he returned to the United States, where he invested in banking and railroads, founding the Atlantic Coast Line. He was appointed as the United States commissioner at the Paris expositions of 1867 and 1878, and also to that at Vienna in 1873. In the late 1880s, he took in business in the horse trade, importing Percheron horses with his partner Samuel Hopkins. Personal life Ellen Harper Walters (George Augustus Baker, circa 1859)Gravestone detail In 1846, Walters married Ellen Harper (1822‚Äì1862), daughter of a prosperous Philadelphia merchant and his wife. Together, they were the parents of two children that survived to adulthood, a son and daughter: * Henry Walters (1848‚Äì1931), who married Sarah Wharton Green (1859‚Äì1943), the widow of Pembroke Jones, in 1922. * Jennie Walters (1853‚Äì1922), who married Warren Delano (1852‚Äì1920), a son of Warren Delano Jr. and a brother of Frederic Adrian Delano and Sara Ann Delano Roosevelt, in 1876. Ellen died young of pneumonia, contracted when they were traveling in England, in 1862. Walters lived another thirty-two years until his death on November 22, 1894 at his home, Mount Vernon Place in Baltimore. He was buried at Green Mount Cemetery, also in Baltimore. Art collector With his success in business secured, Walters turned to art collection, purchasing contemporary American and European works. During the American Civil War, he took his wife to Europe and lived in Paris. (Their children were in boarding school in the US part of the time.) They traveled widely in Europe, where Walters cultivated his interest in art, and purchased numerous additions for his collection. In addition to contemporary European work, Walters began to collect Asian art and ceramics. His private collection became one of the largest and most valuable in the United States. From 1874 onwards, Walters opened his house in Mount Vernon Place to the public most springs, with a 50 cent entrance fee; all proceeds went to charity. This annual exhibit of his gallery netted $30,000 for the poor of Baltimore. Brayton Ives, a New York financier, made a well known collection of rare and historical swords. When he ceased collecting, the historical swords were sold, and through the efforts of Mr. Heber R. Bishop, William Thompson Walters and the American Art Association, the valuable sword collection, valued at $15,000, was donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.Kunz, George F. \\"Heber Reginald Bishop and his Jade Collection. American Anthropologist. New Series, Volume #5, January‚ÄìMarch 1903. Page 116. At his death in 1894, Walters had bequeathed his estate, estimated at $10,000,000, to his children. His collection was left to his son Henry Walters, who had also been collecting art. He added to it greatly, and founded the Walters Gallery (now the Walters Art Museum) in Baltimore at Mount Vernon Square. He donated this to the city of Baltimore at his death in 1931 for the benefit of the public.William R.

He formulated Szpiro's conjecture and was a Distinguished Professor at the CUNY Graduate Center and an emeritus at the CNRS. Early life and education Lucien Szpiro was born on 23 December 1941 in Paris, France. Szpiro attended Paris-Sud University where he earned his Ph.D. under Pierre Samuel. His doctoral work was heavily influenced by the seminars of Maurice Auslander, Claude Chevalley, and Alexander Grothendieck. He earned his Doctorat d'√âtat (DrE) in 1971. Career From 1963 to 1965, Szpiro worked as an assistant high school teacher in Paris. From 1965 to 1969, he was an assistant professor (ma√Ætre assistant) at the University of Paris. From 1969 to 1999, Szpiro worked at the CNRS, initially as an attach√© at Paris Diderot University before rising to the rank of a distinguished professor (Directeur de Recherche de Classe Exceptionnelle) at Paris-Sud University. In 1999, he became an emeritus professor (Directeur de Recherche √©m√©rite) at the CNRS and moved to the CUNY Graduate Center as a Distinguished Professor. He also held visiting positions at several institutions including Columbia University and the Institute for Advanced Study. Szpiro was the editor-in-chief of Ast√©risque from 1991 to 1993 and an editor of the Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© Math√©matique de France from 1984 to 1990. He was also head of the commission that oversaw the Soci√©t√© math√©matique de France libraries. Szpiro advised 17 doctoral students, including Emmanuel Ullmo and Shou-Wu Zhang. Research In the 1970s, Szpiro's research in commutative algebra led to his proof of the Auslander zero divisor conjecture. Together with Christian Peskine, he developed the liaison theory of algebraic varieties. In the 1980s, Szpiro's research interests shifted to Diophantine geometry, first over function fields and then over number fields. The Institut des hautes √©tudes scientifiques described Szpiro as being \\"the first to realise the importance of a paper by Arakelov for questions of Diophantine geometry\\", which ultimately led to the development of Arakelov theory as a tool of modern Diophantine geometry exemplified by Gerd Faltings's proof of the Mordell conjecture. Szpiro also showed the link between the positivity of the dualising sheaf of a curve and the Bogomolov conjecture. In 1981, Szpiro formulated a conjecture (now known as Szpiro's conjecture) relating the discriminant of an elliptic curve with its conductor. His conjecture inspired the abc conjecture,. which was later shown to be equivalent to a modified form of Szpiro's conjecture in 1988. Szpiro's conjecture and its equivalent forms have been described as \\"the most important unsolved problem in Diophantine analysis\\" by Dorian Goldfeld, in part to its large number of consequences in number theory including Roth's theorem, the Mordell conjecture, the Fermat‚ÄìCatalan conjecture, and Brocard's problem. After moving to the CUNY Graduate Center in 1999, Szpiro began working on new research in algebraic dynamics. Awards In 1987, Szpiro received the Prix Doistau‚ÄìBlutel from the French Academy of Sciences \\"for his work in Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry and for his contribution to G. Faltings‚Äô proof of the Mordell conjecture.\\" In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society, retrieved 5 August 2013.

Hanke, along with two others, Irving A. Leonard and John T. Lanning, presented a revisionist narrative of colonial history that focused on the role of Bartolom√© de las Casas, who famously advocated for the rights of Native Americans, and searched for just resolutions to the tensions between the conquistadores and the natives during the colonial period of Spanish rule. Hanke's writings documented Las Casas' work as a political activist, historian, political theorist, and anthropologist. His scholarship also uncovered evidence to support Hanke's claim that Las Casas did not act as the sole voice of conscience during the colonial era, but actually constituted the head of what was a larger reform movement by a number of Spanish colonists to prevent \\"the destruction of the Indies.‚ÄùBenjamin Keen.

Biography Born in 1905 in Oregon City, Oregon, Hanke received his B.S. and M.A. in history from Northwestern University. He went on to complete his Ph.D from Harvard University in 1936. He served as the first chief of the Hispanic Division of the Library of Congress,Handbook of Latin American Studies. \\"Thank You, Lewis Hanke.\\" Available from: http://memory.loc.gov/hlas/hanke.html (Accessed 4/13/10) and headed the Hispanic Foundation until 1951. He began his teaching career at the University of Texas, then moved on to Columbia University. Hanke later joined the faculty of the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 1969, where he remained until his retirement in 1975.University of Massachusetts - Special Collections and University Archives. Lewis Hanke Papers 1939‚Äì1992. Available from http://www.library.umass.edu/spcoll/umarmot/?tag=history (Accessed 4/13/2010) To many, Hanke is considered the father of the field of Latin American studies in the United States. He created the Handbook of Latin American Studies, and that, along with his considerable historiographical achievements in Latin American history, continue to figure among the foundational works of Latin American studies research and library collections in both the U.S. and abroad.Handbook of Latin American Studies.

She was \\"la Querida Compa√±era de Mi Vida.\\" Lewis Ulysses Hanke, Obituary, The Hispanic American Historical Review, Vol. 73, No. 4 (Nov. 1993), pp. 663‚Äì665. Career At Harvard, Hanke studied under Clarence H. Haring. During that time, Hanke published the first of his works on Bartolom√© de las Casas, Las teor√≠as pol√≠ticas de Bartolom√© de Las Casas and The First Social Experiments in America: A Study of the Development of Spanish Indian Policy in the Sixteenth Century. In 1936, Hanke graduated from Harvard with a degree in history. Unable to get an academic job during the Great Depression, Hanke was appointed director of the Hispanic Foundation of the Library of Congress in 1939, where he served for 12 years. His most influential work, The Spanish Struggle for Justice in the Conquest of America (1949), argues that ‚Äú‚Ä¶ the Spanish conquest of America was far more than a remarkable military and political exploit; that it was also one of the greatest attempts the world has seen to make Christian precepts prevail in the relations between peoples.\\"Lewis Hanke in Benjamin Keen.

Hanke went on to pen works that continued to explore the concept of \\"the Spanish struggle for justice\\", as well as on topics ranging from the city of Potosi to the Good Neighbor policy.Lewis Hanke in Benjamin Keen, p. 665 Awards and accolades In 1974, Hanke was elected President of the American Historical Association, the first Latin Americanist to hold the position.

He was born in Burlington, Ontario and competed in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens Greece. He is the founder of a Canada-based charity known as \\"I Challenge Diabetes\\" and provides significant grass roots support to the Canadian Public. Overview Jarvis was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 1 at age 13.Starkman, Randy. \\"Rower rises to the top - Diagnosed with diabetes at 13, Chris Jarvis battles the odds to claim gold in Pan Am pairs \\", The Toronto Star, July 18, 2007. He wears a Medtronic insulin pump while competing, in order to mitigate the effects of his condition. When he was rowing in college at Northeastern University, his coach told him that the diabetes would prevent him from ever rowing for the varsity team. Despite this, Jarvis not only made the team, but was also selected as its captain in his senior year. He went on to race for Canada for eight years including racing at the Olympics, winning gold medals and podium finishes for many world stage events and is a reputable leader of non-profit work in diabetes. Founder of I Challenge Diabetes Jarvis has taken his passion for sports, coaching principles and his knowledge of the science behind diabetes and built a charity the Globe and Mail says \\"helps people take control of their diabetes while challenging themselves physically\\" - Inspire, Globe and Mail, Nov 18th, 2011 by Marjo Johne. Jarvis and a team of community leaders take on activities from basic community programs to the most extreme races Canada has to offer. Director of a diabetes youth expedition, in 2006, Jarvis took teens to Peru to find \\"diabetes maturity\\".Reference Needed In 2011 Jarvis' team ran over 40 not-for profit programs with over 1500 participants. A direct focus still remains on teens in transition with diabetes however I Challenge Diabetes is running programs for all ages. Jarvis feels there is an extreme gap in the system that leaves these teens overburdened and in need of support. A similar position he found himself in and feels grateful for the sport that forced his growth and the luck he had to find stability on his own. As such, Jarvis' team continues to strive forward as leaders of social and educational support for all peoples, building community and sharing insight with a particular focus on teens with diabetes. Programs currently span the provinces of BC, AB, ON and QC however participants have been known to travel from other provinces and even other countries. Rowing and not-for-profit back ground Despite challenges from University coach, Jarvis determined to reach his potential pushed hard to succeed. Leaping beyond the boundaries of University rowing he quickly realized his potential on Canada's national rowing team. Bringing home Silver in 2002 from the under 23 world rowing championships he returned to University to make a difference. While studying chemical engineering and practicing the maximum number of hours in NCAA legislature, Jarvis found the time to join the universities \\"Student Athlete Advisory Committee\\" (SAAC) and over his four- year career spent two years as the university co-chair of SAAC bringing in new initiatives for athletes to engage in the community. Jarvis was quickly recruited to represent the Universities Conference as the America East Chair of SAAC where he learned and developed as a leader in sport in the community. Returning to train in 2003 Jarvis began training for Athens and supported his teammates to an undefeated rowing streak that was 17 races long for Canada. The final World Cup circuit before Athens Greece Jarvis was in the eight and concluded the final six race circuit with an impressive win in Lucerne Switzerland against the entire field that would be racing in Athens. With five weeks remaining before the Olympics a shift in the team moved Jarvis and Barber out of the eight, Jarvis joining Dave Calder in the pair who showed promise for Athens. With little time to train and synchronize, there was an unprecedented amount of speed out of the gates and down the course with Jarvis and Calder moving straight on to the Semi-final from the opening heats in the Olympics and taking down a serious medal contender, the Skelin brothers who had been training together for 17+ years. Both Jarvis and rower Dave Calder were disqualified during the Semi-final after a near flawless race just after qualifying the pair for the grand final in striking distance of a podium finish. The pair was accused of striking the South African team after crossing over the line of buoys in the final 60m of their 2000m race. The pair appealed the disqualification to FISA, the governing body, the officials refused to look at any evidence and their appeal was not successful. After this disappointment, the pair continued to dispute this to the court of Arbitration of Sport, where a video was finally brought forward from the Olympic Committee showing no such evidence of Canada touching the South African pair. The Canadian Pair also had a signed petition from the other athletes qualified for the Grand Final stating their acceptance to the appeal and asking for Canada to be included in the race. The only pair of the six who did not sign the petition was strangely not the South African pair, but the Australians who had beaten all other crews but the Canadians in previous races. The Court saw that Canada had not struck the South African pair and the Canadians were permitted to return to racing however the decision was made too late and the Canadians were ranked 12th overall without a final race. Jarvis has teamed up with other athletes to race the pair since. In the following year after Athens, 2005 Jarvis raced with partner Malcolm Howard to claim the highest percentage in Canada while qualifying for the World Rowing Championships in Gifu Japan. An irritation in Jarvis' lower back emerged to two bulging discs during the travel to Japan and left Jarvis and Howard with little time to for rehabilitation. Howard decided to remain with his partner Jarvis and the pair managed to pull off a 4th-place finish despite the setback. Nearly edging in for a bronze in the closing meters of the race but ran out of room. Since 2004, Jarvis realized his impact on the community of people living with diabetes. A disease he had lived with since 1994 and had served as an extra challenge mentally, physically and financially throughout every day of his training career. Jarvis became an advocate for others with the disease and began building a community in both Canada and the US as a spokesperson, educator and inspiration. Jarvis partnered with fellow diabetic athlete Peter Nerothin, co-founding Insulindependence. This was done in 2005 while competing on the Canadian team and finishing his degree at Northeastern University in Boston. Once completing his degree in Chemical Engineering, 2006, Jarvis returned to Canada causing Nerothin and Jarvis to separate paths to start anew in Canada. Jarvis started another organization in Canada called \\"I Challenge Diabetes\\" while he continued training. Earning immediate recognition in Canada, Jarvis was given a first time award by the Canadian DIabetes Association with they called the \\"National Inspiration Award\\" given to someone effecting the whole countries community with diabetes. Jarvis paired up with Dan Casaca in 2007 to lead the Canadian team to its first gold medal in coxless pairs while 2007 Pan American Games. This was Canada's only gold in the 2007 games for Canada's Rowing Team and the first Gold for Canada of the games. Globe and Mail Jarvis split commitment to the not-for-profit world of both rowing and diabetes ended up costing him big. On top of the 6‚Äì8 hours of training per day, 18 training sessions per week (with growing intensity as Beijing drew near), he also poured his passion into the diabetes community in Canada and tried to remain connected to the US community he had built. Emails came in from parents of children with diabetes and diabetic athletes from around the world, plus squeezing in over 75 speaking events in 2007 alone - Jarvis was stretched thin. In the peak of the racing season, Jarvis was pulled from a team meeting by the team manager to inform him of a \\"whereabouts failure\\". As Jarvis was one of the five members of the Olympic rowing team selected for a new focused initiative to track the whereabouts of the world's top athletes, to insure at any time a spot check on banned substance abuse could be possible, he needed to submit proper documentation to the Canadian Center for Ethics in Sport - a task he neglected to comply with. Jarvis was required to submit daily activities, time and locations 30‚Äì120 days in advance to comply with this legislation. This was something that all Canadian elite athletes were required to do. Jarvis was unable to manage his email stream and had missed two emails from the CCES who had faulted him with inadequate information and given 2 warnings. Jarvis now aware of the problem wrote to the CCES and asked if there was any other means, a simple request for the use of the phone, to deal with such important information as emails can easily be lost in the shuffle of an athlete who burns 7000 Calories a day in training. This is a part of the legislation that insists all efforts are made to insure the athlete is aware of their responsibility to report, regardless, the CCES again decided to use email for another important update request while Jarvis was inaccessible to the internet. Upon returning home and shuffling through emails to find he was one day after the deadline, Jarvis placed an urgent call to the CCES, asking for assistance and for mercy. Claiming that he had been found easily each time he was sought by CCES officers for testing and tested more often than any other teammate in 2007, the accusations were simply blind siding. Regardless Jarvis was suspended for three months from the Canadian rowing team as a result of repeatedly neglecting to report his whereabouts to the Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sport. Although a tribunal found that there was significant neglect of obligations by the CCES case manager and the team manager, the tribunal could not overturn the decision of the CCES who maintained their position. Within the current system there were no repercussions or adjustments for failure. Jarvis returned to row and fought for a spot with the Canadian Olympic Team. While politics played a part as the team needed to be narrowed significantly before Beijing, the nation's best petitioned the coaches to include him and Jarvis was brought overseas to train with the team right up to the games. Jarvis' hope in racing in the Olympic Games was satisfied in part by seeing his teammates win Gold and Silver in the men's eight and pair respectively. He has since retired from rowing and continues to pursue his not-for-profit initiatives which keep him plenty active.

Although Grainger created versions for different types of musical ensembles, its most commonly used version today is for concert band.  Background  Grainger initially wrote Colonial Song in 1911 as a piano piece as a gift to his mother, Rose. Of his piece, Grainger wrote that it was \\"an attempt to write a melody as typical of the Australian countryside as Stephen Foster's exquisite songs are typical of rural America\\".Letter to Frederick Fennell from Grainger. 1959. Quoted in . Although the piece seems to have been intended as part of a series of 'Sentimentals', Grainger never wrote any other pieces in this series. Unlike many of Grainger's other compositions, the melodies of Colonial Song are not based on folk song, but are original melodies.  Versions  Although originally written as a piano solo, Grainger arranged Colonial Song in several other versions. Among the versions published during Grainger's life include:Grainger, P. 1918 Colonial Song.

Early reception  Early reception of Colonial Song was not positive. Fellow composer H. Balfour Gardiner disliked the piece, as did critics. Upon hearing the piece in 1914, Sir Thomas Beecham wrote: \\"My dear Grainger, you have achieved the almost impossible! You have written the worst piece of modern times\\".Grainger, Percy A. \\"Anecdotes\\". Quoted in . However, Colonial Song was received more positively in America. During his service in the United States Army, Grainger re-worked the piece for military band.  Later reception  By the end of the twentieth century, Colonial Song had gained acceptance among wind band conductors. Frank Battisti, conductor emeritus of the New England Conservatory wind ensemble, included it in a list of 73 \\"meritorious\\" compositions. Noted conductor Frederick Fennell identified it as \\"basic band repertoire\\" in The Instrumentalist.

In modern Eastern Orthodox usage, it is distinct from bishop and synonymous with priest. Its literal meaning in Greek (presbyteros) is \\"elder.\\" Holy orders Through the sacrament of holy orders, an ordination to priesthood is performed by the bishop. But this requires the consent of the whole people of God, so at a point in the service, the congregation acclaim the ordination by shouting \\"Axios!\\" (\\"He is worthy!\\"). Orthodox priests consist of both married clergymen and celibate clergymen. In the Orthodox Church a married man may be ordained to the priesthood. His marriage, however, must be the first for both him and his wife. He may not remarry and continue in his ministry even if his wife should die. If a single, or unmarried, or celibate, man is ordained, he must remain celibate to retain his service. A celibate priest is not necessarily the same as that of clergymen who are monastics, as celibacy does not automatically entail monasticism, though Orthodox monasticism does denote a call to celibacy. A priest-monk is called a hieromonk. Ministry It is Church doctrine that the priesthood must strive to fulfill the grace given to them with the gift of the \\"laying on of hands\\" in the most perfect that they can. But the Church teaches that the reality and effectiveness of the sacraments of the Church, ministered by the presbyters, do not depend upon personal virtue, but upon the presence of Christ who acts in his Church by the Holy Spirit. The same as with bishops, it is Christ, through his chosen ministers, who acts as teacher, good shepherd, forgiver, and healer. It is Christ remitting sins, and curing the physical, mental and spiritual ills of mankind. The priest is an icon of Christ. Priests normally exercise the function of pastors of parishes, a function which was normally done by the bishops in early times. They are rectors of the local congregations of Christians. They preside at the celebration of the liturgy and teach, preach, counsel and exercise the ministries of forgiveness and healing. Since the presbyters are assigned by the bishop and belong to the specific congregations they have no authority or services to perform apart from their bishop and their own particular parish community. On the altar table of each parish, there is the cloth called the antimension signed by the bishop, which is the permission to the community to gather and to act as the Church. Without the antimension, the priest and his people cannot function legitimately.  History  The earliest organization of the Christian churches in Judea was similar to that of Jewish synagogues, who were governed by a council of elders (presbyteroi). In Acts 11:30 and 15:22, we see this collegiate system of government in Jerusalem, and in Acts 14:23, the Apostle Paul ordains elders in the churches he founded. Initially, these presbyters were apparently identical with the overseers (episcopate, i.e., bishops), as such passages as Acts 20:17 and Titus 1:5,7 indicate, and the terms were interchangeable. Shortly after the New Testament period, with the death of the Apostles, there was a differentiation in the usage of the synonymous terms, giving rise to the appearance of two distinct offices, bishop and presbyter. The bishop was understood mainly as the president of the council of presbyters, and so the bishop came to be distinguished both in honor and in prerogative from the presbyters, who were seen as deriving their authority by means of delegation from the bishop. The distinction between presbyter and bishop is made fairly soon after the Apostolic period, as is seen in the 2nd century writings of St. Ignatius of Antioch, who uses the terms consistently and clearly to refer to two different offices (along with deacon). Initially, each local congregation in the Church had its own bishop. Eventually, as the Church grew, individual congregations no longer were served directly by a bishop. The bishop in a large city would appoint a presbyter to pastor the flock in each congregation, acting as his delegate.  Modern usage  The Eastern Orthodox Church often refers to presbyters in English as priests (priest is etymologically derived from the Greek presbyteros via the Latin presbyter). This usage is seen by some Protestant Christians as stripping the laity of its rightful priestly status, while those who use the term defend its usage by saying that, while they do believe in the priesthood of all believers, they do not believe in the eldership of all believers. Presbyters are often referred to as Father (Fr.), though that is not an official title. Rather, it is a term of affection used by Christians for their ordained elders. In this context, a priest's first name is generally used after the word Father. Priests are often styled as the Reverend (Rev.) and therefore referred to as the Reverend Father (Rev. Fr.). Higher in bestowed honor and responsibility, Archpriests and Protopresbyters are styled as the Very Reverend (V. Rev.), while Archimandrites can be styled as the Very Reverend (V. Rev.) or as the Right Reverend (Rt. Rev.). It is also appropriate and traditional to refer to a clergyman as \\"the Priest Name\\" or \\"Archpriest Name\\". This latter practice is especially prominent in Churches with Slavic roots, such as the Church of Russia or the Orthodox Church in America. Monastics who are ordained to the priesthood are known as priest-monks or hieromonks.

Taughboyne is located West-South-West from Derry, on the road to Raphoe; containing, with the village and ancient disfranchised borough of St Johnston, 6335 inhabitants (in 1837). St. Baithen, son of Brendan, a disciple and kinsman of St Columba, and his successor in the abbey of Hy, founded Tegbaothin in Tyrconnell: he flourished towards the close of the sixth century. The parish, according to the Ordnance survey, comprises an area of 15,773 statute acres, including a large portion of bog: the land is chiefly arable, and of good quality. There are some extensive slate quarries, but the slates are small and of a coarse quality. Taughboyne Parish Church The River Foyle, which bounds the parish on the east, is navigable for small boats to St. Johnstown, where a fair is held on 25 Nov.. The living is a rectory and vicarage, in the diocese of Raphoe, and in the patronage of the Marquess of Abercorn: the tithes amount to ¬£1569. 4. 7.; and the glebe, comprising , is valued at ¬£260. 6. 5. per annum (in c.1837).

He was born in Batavia, Java, Dutch East Indies, and also died there. He was the son of a Dutch father Pieter Jacobus Adrianus Zaalberg, Secretary at the Department of Education and Religious Affairs in the Dutch East Indies, and Indo (Eurasian) mother Susanna Elisabeth de Bie. He was married to Maria Taunay (born 1878) from 22 April 1899 up to her death in 1911. Both the Zaalberg and De Bie family were of Jewish descent. They had two sons and three daughters, one of whom died young. ING (Institute for Dutch History) ‚Äì Biography overview. P.1 Karel Zaalberg was a self-taught and self-made man. With only primary school he became chief editor of one of the biggest newspapers. Education for the Indo-Europeans of the Dutch East Indies would be his life's personal and political ambition. As a journalist he became a spokesman for the Indo- European (Eurasian) community. ING ‚Äì Biography overview. P.1 He was director of the first organization for Indo-Europeans in the Dutch East Indies ('Indische Bond' of 1898). After 1919 he became a founder and board member of the Indo-European Alliance (Dutch: ‚ÄòIndo Europeesch Verbond'), with over 10,000 members the largest interest group of this population. From 1924 until his death, four years later, he represented the party in the Dutch East Indies People's Council (Volksraad). ING ‚Äì Biography overview. P.1 Zaalberg was a leading figure in the political and social emancipation of the Indo (Eurasian) community of the Dutch East Indies of the late 19th and early 20th century, who had closely befriended famous figures of the time like writer P.A. Daum, E.du Perron and independence activist Ernest Douwes Dekker. Early years Due to a traffic accident his father became disabled and the impoverished family was unable to send their children to any form of higher or even secondary education. Young Zaalberg found a simple and low-ranking job at a big newspaper (copying addresses). It is there, however, where the intelligent Zaalberg learned the ropes of journalism, as well as English and French (by translating foreign newspaper articles and telegrams). The editor in chief P.A. Daum, who was one of the most famous writers and journalists of the time, started to notice Zaalberg's talents and gave him more and more responsibilities. Daum, an autodidact himself, soon made Zaalberg his right- hand man, taking position against the widespread discrimination regarding Indos, who were seldom admitted to the highest layers of the colonial hierarchy. After Daum fell seriously ill Zaalberg replaced him successfully, but after the passing of his mentor the newspaper did not allow Zaalberg to replace him as editor in chief. The new chief editors failed miserably and the position remained vacant for a long time. Only after threatening to quit Zaalberg was appointed Chief Editor of the 'Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad'.Postma, Ulbe: Karel Zaalberg, journalist en strijder voor de Indo. (Publisher KITLV, Leiden, 1997.) Politics Meanwhile, Zaalberg had also emerged himself into politics and became a champion of the interests of the Indo Eurasians. His attention was focused on the acquisition of civil rights, including the right of political association and the right to vote, for native-born (Indo-)Europeans as well as educated Javanese and Chinese. He also published several articles on the need of education for the native population and increasing involvement in the government of the archipelago. The appointment of Ernest Douwes Dekker (an Indo like Zaalberg) as deputy editor in 1907 increased the political momentum of the 'Batavian Newspaper'. It had good contacts with young Javanese intellectuals and was actively involved in the formation of ‚ÄòBoedi Oetomo‚Äô Original spelling, later changed to Budi Utomo. an event which is seen as the beginning of Indonesian nationalism. The close friendship between Douwes Dekker and Zaalberg initially led to joint plans with 'Budi Utomo' to aim for a parliament representing all native communities, including the Indo Eurasians. Even though Zaalberg was opposed to the colonial policy of the Netherlands, that in his opinion seemed ignorant to the inevitable struggle for emancipation of the Indonesian peoples, Zaalberg was not a radical revolutionary. His sharp and biting criticism was always framed in a positivist worldview, in which gradual and reasonable development, also with regard to the colonial relationship, remained paramount. Unlike Dekker who in the tradition of his famous ancestor, the writer of 'Max Havelaar',Multatuli the alias of Eduard Douwes Dekker. did not hesitate to taunt the authorities. This is also where the radical Dekker and the moderate Zaalberg fell out and went their separate ways.Postma, Ulbe: Karel Zaalberg, journalist en strijder voor de Indo. (Publisher KITLV, Leiden, 1997.) Dekker went on to found the 'Indische Party' in 1912 and Zaalberg the 'Indo Europeesch Vebond' in 1919. Final years After his breakup with Dekker, coinciding with a temporary decline of his journalistic career and the death of his beloved wife, his health started failing. He still however experienced his finest hour when he acted as chairman at the founding meeting of the Indo- European Alliance (Dutch: ‚ÄòIndo Europeesch Verbond') in 1919. As board member of the 'IEV' he became a representative in the Dutch East Indies 'Volksraad' (House of Assembly), an infant form of local parliament, where he remained highly vocal about the need for native educational facilities. At age 53 he succumbed to his health issues. Under the leadership of his successor Dick de Hoog his 'IEV' would become the single most important Indo movement in the Dutch East Indies, with close to 15,000 members.Willems, Wim Sporen van een Indisch verleden (1600‚Äì1942). (COMT, Leiden, 1994). Chapter II, P.75 Although he is widely acknowledged as one of the great leaders driving the emancipation of the Indo community in Dutch ruled colonial society, his personal dream of building a large educated political Indo cadre that could lead the East Indies to independence was never realised. In fact in the end his biggest fear came to be. After further detrimental marginalisation the vulnerable Indo community was squashed in the inevitable clash between Dutch colonialism and the Indonesian independence movement.Postma, Ulbe: Karel Zaalberg, journalist en strijder voor de Indo.

WebCitation archive. Financing and distribution The Daily Compass was chiefly financed through the Chicago, Illinois, philanthropist Anita McCormick Blaine, the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company heiress,\\"The Press: Angel in the Wings\\" Time, May 16, 1949 who furnished either $300,000 or $2 million for the start-up (sources differ). She was introduced to Thackrey in late April 1949 by a mutual friend who had intended to put up half the money. When the friend backed out, Blaine invested the whole amount in return for all the preferred stock; Thackrey held 51% of the common stock, and control. Blaine said at the time, \\"My purpose is to help create a better world state. You have only to think of the need for this thing ... look at the press of the world today....\\" The paper was distributed by the Metropolitan News Company and some 16 other distributors. William Peyton Marin was the company treasurer. Bernard Goldstein, the assistant treasurer and controller of the New York Star, was the assistant treasurer. Following the company's dissolution, its books and records were stored at the AAAAAA American City Wide Express Service at 1135 Tiffany Street, The Bronx, for two to three years before prepaid funds ran out and the documents were scheduled to be destroyed. Aftermath After The Daily Compass ceased publication, Thackrey joined the public relations firm Ruder Finn. In 1959, Thackrey and Goldstein testified at the U.S. Senate's \\"Hearings Before the Select Committee in Improper Activities on the Labor or Management Field\\", which investigated alleged improprieties by the newspaper deliverers union and forcible payoffs in order to ensure Compass distribution. Archives Archives of The Daily Compass (OCLC 09316051) are stored at the New York State Library and at Sarah Lawrence College.

It weighs 29 pounds, and belt-drive models use a tooth-belt drive like auto timing belts and Harley-Davidson drive belts, along with a novel two-part chainring that increases belt tension with increasing load. In April 1987, Popular Mechanics described Bridgestone's Beltrex system as follows: \\"Unlike the belt-drive motorcycles, which can slide the rear wheel back to keep the belt taut, the Beltrex uses a floating pulley that's cogged to the drive gear. Tension on the pedal cranks drives the floating pulley forward, taking up belt slack and preventing tooth slippage.\\" A limited number of Picnica folding bikes were imported to Europe. This 1990 belt-drive model in Germany features an extended seat post. The Picnica is a folding bicycle, and part of the appeal of the belt drive is cleanliness. It is a small wheel bicycle, so belt tension may be less than on a bicycle with standard-size wheels. The folding mechanism is extremely simple, which accounts for the fact that the Picnica was marketed as the \\"One-touch Picnica\\" (Japanese: „ÉØ„É≥„Çø„ÉÉ„ÉÅ„Éî„ÇØ„Éã„Ç´). In a review, the Picnica folding mechanism was described as a \\"case of the frame collapsing backwards on itself, with the handlebars and seat post falling to the top of the rear wheel. To this end, the main part of the frame is a quadrilateral with a pivot at each corner, and a rear triangle made collapsible by hinged seat stays. It's those seat stays that hold everything in place. In the riding position they're straight and rigid, as on any bike. The upper part of each seat stay is locked in a retaining channel by spring pressure; squeeze the upper seat stays inwards and they pop out of their channels, and the hinge 'unlocks'. The upper and lower seat stays then fold over as the main frame folds ‚Äì the whole bike collapses under its own weight.\\" The Picnica was apparently commercially successful, but was offered mainly in Japan, where it sold for around 35 000 Japanese yen. The belt-drive version retailed for 45 000 yen. According to the 1985 Bridgestone catalog, the Picnica OPC-14B was the first folding bike with a belt drive.
