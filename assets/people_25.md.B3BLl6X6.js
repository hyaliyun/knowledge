St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 1115. Tannehills Born in Belmont County, Ohio in 1827, James Boggs Tannehill gained prominence during the Civil War as the captain of a company of Ohio Volunteer Infantry. Although he lived more than forty years after the end of the war, he retained the title of \\"captain\\" in the popular mind. In the early 1870s, he moved from his Marietta-vicinity home to Muskingum County; there, he became a prominent farmer and was eventually elected president of a local farmers' society. As he aged, Tannehill chose to move into Zanesville, where he built the present residence as a retirement home in his sixty-fifth year; there he remained until his death in 1909. After his death, his son P. H. Tannehill continued to live on the property; a well-known local attorney, he was elected to the county's common pleas court in 1932, retaining his judgeship until his death in 1948. Recognition In 1979, the James Boggs Tannehill House and a related outbuilding were listed together on the National Register of Historic Places. One of dozens of Zanesville buildings to have been given this distinction, it qualified for inclusion both because of its architecture and its place as the home of the prominent Tannehills. Perhaps its most important element is its place as an early example of the Colonial Revival movement: when Captain Tannehill ordered the house's construction, this style was yet very rare and unknown in general society. Having changed very little since its construction, the Tannehill House is one of the area's best Colonial Revival structures of any date.

Allelopathic studies have led to the commercialization of derivative compounds as HPPD inhibitor herbicides. History Leptospermone was first identified in 1927 and was extracted from a variety of plants in 1965, 1966 and 1968. It was first identified as a chemical in Callistemon citrinus in California in 1977. A biologist at the Western Research Centre of Stauffer Chemical Company noticed that very few plants grew under Callistemon citrinus bushes. After taking soil samples and creating an array of extracts, one was identified as an herbicide. While it did have herbicidal effects, the rate required for sufficient coverage was too high to be of practical use. Leptospermone was optimized into thousands of compounds. Several were extremely effective but were too toxic, environmentally persistent or not selective enough. There are now several members of the triketone class of HPPD inhibitor herbicides on the market. Synthesis Leptospermone can be synthesized from phloroglucinol by a reaction with 3-methylbutanenitrile (isovaleronitrile) in the presence of a zinc chloride catalyst. Phloroisovalerone imine is produced which is then alkylated with iodomethane after initial treatment with sodium ethoxide and methanol to produce an intermediate which is treated with aqueous hydrochloric acid resulting in isovaleroylsyncarpic acid (leptospermone). Biochemically, the plants take a different approach. Despite the fact that the biochemical synthesis has not been specifically investigated, it is clear that leptospermone is not an oxidized terpene (or specifically a sesquiterpene, ei. C15) as the cyclisation of farnesyl pyrophosphate cannot produce two dimethylate carbons that are separated by a single carbon nor would this be consistent with the natural occurrence of similar compounds with different keto-aryl side-chains in the members of the Myrtaceae (eg. flavesone, papuanone, isoleptospermone and grandiflorone). Phloroglucinol is biosynthesized in a single step from malonyl-CoA and could be the intermediate, but other routes of biosynthesis may be possible, such as via isobutyryl-CoA, the result of the decarboxylative condensation of ketoisovalerate (ketone form of valine) (cf. polyketides). Uses Leptospermone was the blueprint for the compound mesotrione which has the trade name Callisto, a Syngenta herbicide.

It was first observed as red vapor in the early 19th century upon heating a mixture of fluorspar (CaF2), chromates, and sulfuric acid. These red vapors were initially thought to be CrF6, although some chemists assumed a CrO2F2 structure analogous to CrO2Cl2. The first moderately successful synthesis of chromyl fluoride was reported by Fredenhagen who examined the reaction of hydrogen fluoride with alkali chromates. A later attempt saw von Wartenberg prepare impure CrO2F2 by treating chromyl chloride with elemental fluorine.von Wartenberg, H. (1941) \\"√úber h√∂here Chromfluoride (, und )\\" [About higher chromium fluorides (, and )], Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. [in German], 247(1‚Äê2), 135‚Äì146, . Another attempt was made by Wiechert, who treated HF with dichromate, yielding impure liquid CrO2F2 at ‚àí40 ¬∞C. Engelbrecht and von Grosse's synthesis of CrO2F2, and most successive syntheses, involve treating chromium trioxide with a fluorinating agent: :CrO3 \\\\+ 2 HF ‚Üí CrO2F2 \\\\+ H2O The reaction is reversible, as water will readily hydrolyze CrO2F2 back to CrO3.

They reported 100% yield when the reactions were conducted at 120 ¬∞C. As expected from the relative reactivities of MoF6 and WF6, the molybdenum reaction proceeded more readily than did the tungsten.Green, P. J.; Gard, G. L. (1977) \\"Chemistry of Chromyl Fluoride. 5.

It can also be used as a reagent in the preparation of other chromyl compounds. Like some other fluoride compounds, CrO2F2 reacts with glass and quartz, so silicon-free plastics or metal containers are required for handling the compound.

Pyramid of Skulls, oil on canvas, c. 1901, 37 cm √ó 45.5 cm. Private collection. Pyramid of Skulls is a c. 1901 oil painting by French Post-Impressionist artist Paul C√©zanne. It depicts four human skulls stacked in a pyramidal configuration. Painted in a pale light against a dark background, Pyramid of Skulls is exceptional in the artist's oeuvre, for \\"in no other painting did C√©zanne place his objects so close to the viewer.\\"Adriani, 254 For art historian Fran√ßoise Cachin, \\"these bony visages all but assault the viewer, displaying an assertiveness very much at odds with the usual reserve of domestic still-life tableaux.\\"Cachin, et al, 491 Working in isolation in the last decade of his life, C√©zanne frequently alluded to mortality in his letters: \\"For me, life has begun to be deathly monotonous\\"; \\"As for me, I'm old. I won't have time to express myself\\"; and \\"I might as well be dead.\\" It is possible that the death of his mother on October 25, 1897‚Äîshe had been a protective and supportive influence‚Äîaccelerated his meditations on mortality, a subject which had obsessed the artist since the late 1870s, but did not find pictorial form for another twenty years.Cachin, et al, 490 C√©zanne's health started to deteriorate at the same time. The dramatic resignation to death informs a number of still life paintings he made between 1898 and 1905 of skulls. These works, some painted in oils and some with watercolor, are more subtle in meaning yet also more visually stark than the traditional approach to the theme of vanitas. Paul C√©zanne. Three Skulls, 1902‚Äì1906, graphite and watercolor on paper. Art Institute of Chicago. C√©zanne's interest in the subject may have had roots in thoughts other than the contemplation of death. He could have been drawn to the skulls' volumetric forms, just as he was to those of fruits and vases, and he supposedly exclaimed \\"How beautiful a skull is to paint!\\" They also share physical similarities with his self-portrayals: \\"the skulls confront the viewer straight-on in a manner reminiscent of the artist's portraits.\\" In both sets of works the mass of the cranium is emphasized: in the self-portraits the lower half of his face is obscured by his beard, while the skulls lack lower jaws altogether. In both series attention is focused on the round pate and eye sockets.Cachin, et al, 492-493 There would have been further reason for the subject to interest C√©zanne: skulls were prominent in the homes of Catholics, and C√©zanne was a devout Catholic knowledgeable in ancient Christian texts. Human skulls had also long been common accessories in artists' studios. Indeed, the contents of C√©zanne's studio were known to include \\"three skulls, (and) an ivory Christ on an ebony cross\\" near one another on the mantelpiece. Joachim Gasquet, a friend of the artist, later recalled: Pyramid of Skulls was painted at C√©zanne's studio in Aix, where he worked prior to his move into the new Les Lauves studio in September 1902. A visitor to the studio in July 1902 wrote: \\"In his bedroom, on a narrow table in the middle, I noticed three human skulls facing one another, three beautiful polished ivories. He spoke of a very good painted study that was somewhere in the attic. I wanted to see it.\\" But C√©zanne could not find the key to the garret, and blamed his maid for its misplacement. A watercolor study, Three Skulls, at the Art Institute of Chicago, is similar in composition, though relatively more graceful in handling.Cachin, et al, 493 The skull studies would serve as inspiration to 20th-century artists like Pablo Picasso and Andy Warhol. Today the skulls themselves remain in C√©zanne's studio outside of Aix-en-Provence.

Troops were trained in infantry tactics including forced night marches, although they also had mock gliders and a tower north of the fort for practice parachute drops. The soldiers at Fort Meade were taken to Alliance, Nebraska, for their airborne training, and the glider pilots received their flight training there as well. In April 1943 the regiment was assigned to the 1st Airborne Infantry BrigadeManeuver and Firepower p190 along with the 507th Parachute Infantry Regiment and the 326th Glider Infantry Regiment. Both the 88th GIR and the 326th GIR were organized as two-battalion regiments.

There are also numerous fragmentsS.A. Stephens and J.J. Winkler, Ancient Greek Novels: The Fragments (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1995). preserved on papyrus or in quotations, and summaries in Bibliotheca by Photius, a 9th-century Ecumenical Patriarch. The unattributed Metiochus and Parthenope may be preserved by what appears to be a faithful Persian translation by the poet Unsuri.T. H√§gg and B. Utas, The Virgin and her Lover: Fragments of an Ancient Greek Novel and a Persian Epic Poem (Leiden: Brill, 2003). The Greek novel as a genre began in the first century CE, and flourished in the first four centuries; it is thus a product of the Roman Empire. The exact relationship between the Greek novel and the Latin novels of Petronius and Apuleius is debated, but both Roman writers are thought by most scholars to have been aware of and to some extent influenced by the Greek novels.  Genre  Most scholars agree that the five surviving Greek novels constitute a coherent if flexible genre, but no name for this genre is known from antiquity. Contemporary literary critics usually omit the extended prose narratives of antiquity from discussions of the novel. There are no clear distinctions of genre between the five 'romantic' novels and other works of Greek prose fiction, such as Lucian's A True Story, the Alexander Romance and the Life of Aesop. B.P. Reardon has the following qualifications to define a novel \\"narrative fiction in prose -- imaginative, creative literature, sufficiently similar to what we call novels to justify the term here\\". This definition allows him to extend the category to include, in addition to the five canon novels, Pseudo-Lucian's The Ass, Lucian's A True Story, Pseudo-Callisthenes' Alexander Romance, and the anonymously written The Story of Apollonius, King of Tyre. B. P. Reardon Collected Ancient Greek Novels (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008) Although the plots of the surviving novels appear to be relatively conventional, entailing the fulfilled heterosexual desire of a beautiful and usually virtuous young couple, this impression of uniformity and moralism may be an illusion created by later Christians, who decided which to copy for posterity. Writers now lost such as Lollianus (the author of Phoenician Tales) and Iamblichus seem to have been much more experimental and lurid. Even so, the surviving texts (arguably with the exception of Xenophon's Ephesian Tale) show great sophistication in their handling of character, narrative and intertextuality.See in general G. Schmeling ed. The Novel in the Ancient World, 2nd ed. (Leiden: Brill, 2003) and T. Whitmarsh ed. The Cambridge Companion to the Greek and Roman Novel (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008). Two stories included by Reardon in his list of novels have survived only as summaries: Antonius Diogenes's The Wonders Beyond Thule and Iamblichus' Babylonian History. Both of these summaries are the work of Photios in his Bibliotheca. B. P. Reardon Collected Ancient Greek Novels (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008) Influences The influence of the novelists is demonstrable on Musaeus' Hero and Leander, the late antique epic by Nonnus titled Dionysiaca, Procopius, the Byzantine novel, and Byzantine historiography in general. Thanks in large part to Jacques Amyot's translations, they were rediscovered in early modern Europe, and played an influential role in the formation of the modern novel, particularly the 'romance' variety.

On March 14, 2019, PEN America announced that Nouf Abdulaziz, Loujain Al-Hathloul, and Eman Al-Nafjan would receive the 2019 PEN America/Barbey Freedom to Write Award, which was presented on May 21 at the 2019 PEN America Literary Gala at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. In late March 2019, the women presented their defence and described physical and sexual abuse they had endured in captivity. Eman al- Nafjan, together with Aziza al-Yousef and Dr Rokaya Mohareb were released on bail. In September 2019, al-Nafjan received \\"The Prize for Courage\\", awarded by Reporters Without Borders.

She earned a bachelor's degree in English at what at the time was the University of Riyadh (KSU). She worked as a school teacher and later a university teaching assistant. She earned a master's degree in Teaching English as a foreign language from the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom. Al-Nafjan taught pre-medical English at KSU. She encouraged students to discuss their opinions freely and write about them, which a student at the time, Omaima al-Najjar, described as \\"unheard of in Saudi schools, where we were not allowed to have an opinion or even question the teacher on any matter that involved religion, culture or politics\\". Al-Nafjan openly stated her strong opinions in favour of women's rights at the time. In 2013, al-Nafjan was conducting research aiming to obtain a PhD in linguistics at KSU. Blogging and activism In February 2008, al-Nafjan began blogging as 'Saudiwoman', writing about Saudi social and cultural issues with a focus on women. Her blog became one of the most popular Saudi blogs read internationally. Al-Nafjan blogged about topics that were taboo in Saudi Arabia at the time, including criticising male-guardianship as an \\"abuse system\\", opposing child marriage and interventions by the religious police, and documenting internet surveillance by Saudi authorities. On 17 June 2011, she drove a car in Riyadh as part of a women's driving campaign during the 2011 Saudi Arabian protests. She began publishing articles in Western media about the campaign to allow women to drive in Saudi Arabia. In September 2016, al-Nafjan signed a petition as part of the campaign against the Saudi male guardianship system. In October 2013, al-Nafjan was arrested while filming a woman driving. Al-Nafjan was highly active in supporting other activists in the women to drive campaign and in contributing to public debate on the issue. Detention Around 15‚Äì18 May 2018, al-Nafjan was detained by Saudi authorities, along with Loujain al-Hathloul, Aziza al-Yousef, Aisha al- Mana, Madeha al-Ajroush and two men involved in women's rights campaigning.Female activists detained ahead of Saudi driving ban reversal, 20th May, The NationalSaudi Arabia arrests female activists weeks before lifting of driving ban, By Sarah El Sirgany and Hilary Clarke, May 21, 2018, CNN Human Rights Watch interpreted the purpose of the arrests as frightening \\"anyone expressing skepticism about the crown prince's rights agenda\\".

Grant Village was planned to allow the removal of development encroaching on the thermal basin at West Thumb.

Grant Village lodging in 1987 By 1960 there was a divergence of opinion on the project's design: the primary concessioner, the Yellowstone Park Company, wanted a compact layout, while the Park Service's Western Office of Design desired a dispersed arrangement. Financial difficulties left the Yellowstone Park Company unable to exert much influence. Construction of the first phase of Grant Village, named after President Ulysses S. Grant, was completed in June 1963, comprising a campground, picnic area and boat ramp. A marina was completed by 1965,Culpin, p. 113 with construction of motel-style lodging, service facilities and restaurants continuing into the 1980s.

It is a type of chromosomal crossover between homologous sequences that are not paired precisely. Normally genes are responsible for occurrence of crossing over. It exchanges sequences of different links between chromosomes. Along with gene conversion, it is believed to be the main driver for the generation of gene duplications and is a source of mutation in the genome. Mechanisms During meiosis, the duplicated chromosomes (chromatids) in eukaryotic organisms are attached to each other in the centromere region and are thus paired. The maternal and paternal chromosomes then align alongside each other. During this time, recombination can take place via crossing over of sections of the paternal and maternal chromatids and leads to reciprocal recombination or non-reciprocal recombination. Unequal crossing over requires a measure of similarity between the sequences for misalignment to occur. The more similarity within the sequences, the more likely unequal crossing over will occur. One of the sequences is thus lost and replaced with the duplication of another sequence. When two sequences are misaligned, unequal crossing over may create a tandem repeat on one chromosome and a deletion on the other. The rate of unequal crossing over will increase with the number of repeated sequences around the duplication. This is because these repeated sequences will pair together, allowing for the mismatch in the cross over point to occur. Consequences for the organism Unequal crossing over is the process most responsible for creating regional gene duplications in the genome. Repeated rounds of unequal crossing over cause the homogenization of the two sequences. With the increase in the duplicates, unequal crossing over can lead to dosage imbalance in the genome and can be highly deleterious. Evolutionary implications In unequal crossing over, there can be large sequence exchanges between the chromosomes. Compared with gene conversion, which can only transfer a maximum of 1,500 base pairs, unequal crossing over in yeast rDNA genes has been found to transfer about 20,000 base pairs in a single crossover event Unequal crossover can be followed by the concerted evolution of duplicated sequences. It has been suggested that longer intron found between two beta-globin genes are a response to deleterious selection from unequal crossing over in the beta- globin genes. Comparisons between alpha-globin, which does not have long introns, and beta-globin genes show that alpha-globin have 50 times higher concerted evolution. When unequal crossing over creates a gene duplication, the duplicate has 4 evolutionary fates. This is due to the fact that purifying selection acting on a duplicated copy is not very strong. Now that there is a redundant copy, neutral mutations can act on the duplicate. Most commonly the neutral mutations will continue until the duplicate becomes a pseudogene. If the duplicate copy increases the dosage effect of the gene product, then the duplicate may be retained as a redundant copy. Neofunctionalization is also a possibility: the duplicated copy acquires a mutation that gives it a different function than its ancestor. If both copies acquire mutations, it is possible that a subfunctional event occurs. This happens when both of the duplicated sequences have a more specialized function than the ancestral copy Genome size Gene duplications are the main reason for the increase of genome size, and as unequal crossing over is the main mechanism for gene duplication, unequal crossing over contributes to genome size evolution is the most common regional duplication event that increases the size of the genome. =Junk DNA= When viewing the genome of a eukaryote, a striking observation is the large amount of tandem, repetitive DNA sequences that make up a large portion of the genome. For example, over 50% of the Dipodmys ordii genome is made up of three specific repeats. Drosophila virilis has three sequences that make up 40% of the genome, and 35% of the Absidia glauca is repetitive DNA sequences. These short sequences have no selection pressure acting on them and the frequency of the repeats can be changed by unequal crossing over.

He also played for the minor league Newport News Shipbuilders during the 1915 season. Berger batted left-handed, while throwing right. During his playing career, he stood at and weighed in at . Before turning professional, Berger attended the University of Richmond in Richmond, Virginia where he played baseball on the school's team. After his baseball career was over, Berger worked as a bookkeeper, and eventually moved in with his brother, Dr. Howard S. Berger. Early life Berger was born on November 1, 1894 in East Cleveland, Ohio to Charles A. and Della E. of West Virginia, and Ohio, respectively. Charles A. Berger worked as a foreman at the local U.S. Naval Yard. Clarence Berger had one sibling, Howard S. Berger. During the spring of 1914, Clarence Berger graduated from the University of Richmond, where he played on the school's baseball team as an outfielder, and catcher. Professional career At the start of the 1914 season, Berger signed with the Class-C Richmond Colts of the Virginia League. With the Colts, he batted .298 with 154 hits, 13 doubles, 12 triples, and two home runs in 136 games played. Berger finished second in the league in hits, and triples. On August 22, the Pittsburgh Pirates purchased Berger's contract from the Richmond Colts for US$2,500, the largest sum a player from the Virginia League had ever gone for. Berger was told to report to the Pirates following the end of the Virginia League season. On September 16, following the Virginia League season, Berger failed to report to Pittsburgh. Eventually, Berger did report, and he made his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut on September 23, 1914. On the season, he batted .077 with two runs scored, and one hit in six games played. Defensively, he played in the outfield for the Pirates. On February 14, 1915, Berger was released by the Pittsburgh Pirates. It was announced that he would join the newly formed Richmond Climbers of the International League that season. However, Richmond farmed Berger to the Class-C Newport News Shipbuilders of the Virginia League that season. Berger had previously made a verbal agreement to join the Class-C Norfolk Tars, but could not break his agreement with Newport News to do so. With the Shipbuilders, be batted .172 with 15 hits, one double, and one triple in 23 games played. Later life In 1930, Berger was working as a bookkeeper in Fairfax County, Virginia.

The episode originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on April 14, 2011. Guest stars in this episode include Rob Riggle, Phil Rosenthal, Steve Cirbus, and Seth Kirschner. In the episode, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) and Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) go on a quest to find Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) now that they know he is not in Africa. Meanwhile, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) is set to star in a torture porn movie called Take My Hand but after several issues with the budget, Jack Donaghy tries to make sure that the movie is profitable by doing almost anything, including adding Wal-Mart and Phil Rosenthal as sponsors. At TGS Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) unexpectedly becomes an arm wrestling champion amongst the crew. Plot With the revelation that Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) is still in New York City somewhere, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) and Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) conduct a search to find him before upper management can cancel TGS in his absence. Their search leads them to a warehouse that Tracy appears to have been hiding out in until recently. Meanwhile, Jenna Maroney is set to star in a torture porn movie called Take My Hand, but upon informing Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) of this, he recognizes it as a failed NBC production from a number of years ago. With the budget threatening to overwhelm, Jack is determined to make the film profitable in some way. In the writers room, Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) argues with Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander) over where they should order their lunch from, which results in the pair having an arm wrestling match which Pete wins. His victory earns him newfound respect amongst the TGS crew but brings him into a confrontation with an unpleasant member of staff named Reggie (Rob Riggle), whom he challenges to a match. Unexpectedly; however, Pete and Reggie end up bonding as they discuss their respective families. It transpires that Reggie has invited his family to watch the arm wrestling match and so Pete decides to let him win so that his son can feel proud of his father. Ultimately, everything turns out to have been a fabrication within his mind and Pete reawakens to find himself losing the original match with Frank. Finally, Jack's quest to make Take My Hand profitable leads him to enlist Wal-Mart as a sponsor and rope in Everybody Loves Raymond producer Phil Rosenthal, before ultimately modifying the film to suit a family audience. Liz decides to stage another webcam conversation between Kenneth and Tracy, in the hope that the latter will in some way give up his location. Despite Kenneth largely giving the ploy away, Liz recognizes where he is hiding ‚Äî the unused upstairs level of her apartment that she had acquired from her upstairs neighbor (\\"Sun Tea\\"). The pair finally apprehend Tracy and convince him to destroy his good reputation so that he can return to TGS.

The village lies surrounded by hills on both banks of a small stream and has a temple dedicated to Ashapura Mata, the household deity of former Jadeja rulers of Cutch State. She is also considered patron deity of Kutch. The village is located about 105 km from Bhuj, the headquarters of Kutch district. Places of interest=Ashapura Mata temple Goddess Ashapura The temple was built in the 14th century by two Karad Vanias, Ajo and Anagor. They were the ministers in the court of the father of Lakho Phulani. The temple was damaged by the earthquake in 1819. The temple was rebuilt by Sundarji Shivji and Mehta Vallabhaji, two Brahmakshatriya in 1823 (Samvat 1880). The temple is 58 ft. long, 32 ft. wide and 52 ft. tall. Except that it has a passage for walking round the deity, it is much the same as the temple at Koteshwar. The temple was damaged again by the earthquake in 2001 but was repaired again. The image of Ashapura Mata in the shrine is a red-painted stone, about six feet high and six feet broad at the base, narrowing to a point in a shape, with some rough likeness to a human form. It is said to have come from Jashod in Marwar. Here every year during the Navaratri, the Rao of Cutch used to offer a sacrifice of seven male buffaloes. The practice of animal sacrifice has been stopped. Kutch in festival and custom By K. S. Dilipsinh Connected with this temple are two classes of people known as Bhuvas and Kapadis, who; though now very different, are said to be sprung from two brothers. The Bhuvas, though not devotees, enjoy the temple revenues and live a life of ease in the village. They (1827) marry, wear long beards, and eat with all except the lowest castes. The Kapadis are devotees who do not marry, wear no hair on their faces, and eat only among themselves. According to their own account, they came from Gujarat around 1100 CE, and of this, they say, they had evidence as late as the battle of Jara (1762), when, leaving their villages, they lost their records. They are chiefly Lohanas, but all, except outcastes, are allowed to join. Around 1680, the succession to the headship of the monastery was disputed, and, on reference to the Rao, it was decided that one of the claimants should be head or Raja, and the other with the title Rorasi be head elect. This custom has ever since been kept up. The Raja and all, except twenty-five Kapdis, live in one court and take their meals together. The Rorasi with his twenty-five disciples lives separate but receives every necessary of life from the Raja's house. If the Rorasi dies, the eldest of his disciples succeeds. If the Raja dies the Rorasi succeeds and the eldest of the Raja's disciples becomes Rorasi. The Raja is treated with much respect and had the privilege of receiving the Rao of Cutch sitting. In past, they owned and held the revenues of the villages of Madh, Netraj, Murchbanu, Kotda, and Dedarani. There are also subordinates priests of Chauhan, who performs pooja of the deity. There is a legend associated with Mian Ghulam Shah Kalhoro of Sindh. In 1762, when his army attacked this temple, his soldiers became blind by the curse of Ashapura. Then, Ghulam Shah took a swear to set up a huge bell in the temple. Finally, his soldiers regained their sight and Ghulam Shah kept his words. The huge bell still stands there in the temple. Jamadar Fateh Muhammad, the military leader of Cutch State, had presented this temple with a deepmala weighing 2 kg silver, and with 41 lamps carved in it. Thousands of devotee from Gujarat and other states visit the temple during auspicious days of Chaitra Navaratri and Ashvin Navaratri of which the later hold more significance. Camps and relief facilities are set up around the road leading to Mata no Madh, every year for this pilgrimage.People turn up in lakhs at Mata no Madh in Kutch Other temples On the top of Jagora, a hill about two miles to the north of Matano Madh in a small cave entered by a narrow opening, is a rough red coloured stone. This, the Jagora Ashapura, is visited by Vanias who come and stay three nights. A bituminous earth found in the hill is burnt before the goddess. The smell is unsavoury, but it pleases the goddess, as it is produced from the body of a Daitya whom she slew. On a hill to the north-east is a second temple to Ashapura built by a Kapdi in 1743 (Samvat 1800). Near the village is another shrine, the temple of Chachara Mata. The lower part of the building is carved out of a sandstone rock; and the roof is supported by rough carved pillars. Except by a lamp always kept burning, the inside is unlighted. From the same rock a stream of water falls into a twenty feet square pool with flights of steps. It is fifteen to twenty feet deep, and the water, which is charged with salts of sulphur, is used for bathing, washing clothes, and in the manufacture of alum in past. Mining industry The village was the major place of the alum manufacture in past.

Israel does not have a constitution, but the Israeli Declaration of Independence states: ‚ÄúThe State of Israel (‚Ä¶) will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex.‚Äù Israeli law prohibits discrimination based on gender in employment and wages, and provides for class action suits; nonetheless, there are complaints of significant wage disparities between men and women. In 2012, Israel ranked eleventh out of 59 developed nations for participation of women in the workplace. In the same survey, Israel was ranked 24th for the proportion of women serving in executive positions. In 2017, Israel was ranked the world's 8th safest country for women by the New World Wealth research group. Women's rights Graduates of Israeli Air Force flight course Even before the state of Israel was created, there were women settlers fighting for women's rights in Palestine. An example of this is the women in the New Yishuv. Yishuv is the term referring to the body of Jewish residents in Palestine before the establishment of the state of Israel, and New Yishuv refers to those who began building homes outside the Old City walls of Jerusalem in the 1860s. In 1919 the first nationwide women's party in the New Yishuv (the Union of Hebrew Women for Equal Rights in Eretz Israel) was created, and Rosa Welt-Straus, who had immigrated there that year, was appointed its leader, as which she continued until her death. One of the members of the union was Ada Geller, the first woman accountant in Eretz Israel. In 1926 the haredim, who preferred not to face the possibility of a plebiscite, left the yishuv's Assembly of Representatives, and that year an official declaration was made (ratified by the mandate government in 1927) confirming \\"equal rights to women in all aspects of life in the yishuv - civil, political, and economic.\\" Israel was the third country in the world to be led by a female prime minister, Golda Meir (1969-1974), and in 2010, women's parliamentary representation in Israel was 18 percent, which is above the Arab world's average of 6 percent and equals that of the U.S. Congress. Still, it trails far behind the Scandinavian countries' 40 percent average The Israeli parliament, The Knesset, has established ‚ÄúThe Committee on the Status of Women,‚Äù to address women‚Äôs rights. The stated objectives of this committee are to prevent discrimination, combat violence against women, and promote equality in politics, lifecycle events and education. In 1998, the Knesset passed a law for \\"Prevention of Sexual Harassment\\". In 2013, the Minister of Religious Affairs and Chief Rabbis issued statements telling ritual bath attendants only to inspect women who want inspection, putting an end to forced inspections of women at mikvehs. In 2018, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in Israel to accept the Genesis Lifetime Achievement award, lamented the segregation of women in Israel at public universities, likening the practice to discriminatory \\"separate but equal\\" laws once applied to blacks in the United States. Ruth Bader Ginsburg Compares Exclusion of Women in Israel to Discrimination Against African-Americans in U.S. Crimes against women Rape, including spousal rape, is a felony in Israel, punishable by 16 years in prison. The Israeli Supreme Court affirmed that marital rape is a crime in a 1980 decision, citing law based on the Talmud (at least 6th century).David Kauzlarich, Introduction to Criminology, 2008, p. 79. The law doubles the penalty if the perpetrator assaults or rapes a relative.2010 Human Rights Report: Israel and the occupied territories. U.S. Department of state. This article incorporates public domain material from this source. There are nine rape crisis centers that operate a 24-hour crisis line for victims to sexual violence. The Israeli Ministry of Social Affairs operates a battered women's shelter and an abuse reporting hotline. The police operates a call center to inform victims about their cases. Women's organizations provided counseling, crisis intervention, legal assistance, and shelters. A major motivation for homicide in Israel is violence against women (including honor killings in Muslim families). Several honor killings occur yearly in Israel within the Israeli Arab community. The indictment and conviction of former president Moshe Katsav for two counts of rape and other charges was interpreted as a victory for women. Rape crisis centers received record number of calls following the verdict. = Sexual harassment = Sexual harassment is illegal but remains widespread. The law requires that suspected victims be informed of their right to assistance. Penalties for sexual harassment depend on the severity of the act and whether blackmail is involved; range from two to nine years' imprisonment. The 1998 Israeli Sexual Harassment Law interprets sexual harassment broadly, and prohibits the behavior as a discriminatory practice, a restriction of liberty, an offence to human dignity, a violation of every person's right to elementary respect, and an infringement of the right to privacy. Additionally, the law prohibits intimidation or retaliation that accommodates sexual harassment. Intimidation or retaliation thus related to sexual harassment are defined by the law as \\"prejudicial treatment\\".Kamir, 2005 According to a survey by the Ministry of Industry published in 2010, 35 to 40 percent of women reported experiencing sexual harassment at work, one- third of whom experienced it in the previous 12 months. Among the women who reported harassment, 69 percent said they had received \\"proposals,\\" 47 percent reported comments of a sexual nature, 22 percent cited physical violation, 10 percent reported humiliation, and 7.7 percent reported extortion and threats. Israel, in accordance with Western ethics, has made polygamy illegal. Provisions were instituted to allow for existing polygamous families immigrating from countries where the practice was legal. =Public harassment= Vigilante \\"modesty patrols\\" have harassed women perceived as immodestly dressed in Haredi neighborhoods. In 2010, police arrested two Haredi men at the Western Wall plaza on suspicion that they threw chairs at a Women of the Wall group that was praying aloud at the site. On September 28, 2010, the Israeli Supreme Court outlawed public gender segregation in Jerusalem's Mea Shearim neighborhood in response to a petition submitted after extremist Haredi men physically and verbally assaulted women for walking on a designated men's only road. Gender segregation and discrimination in public spaces Dan bus labeled ‚Äúmehadrin‚Äù in Bnei Brak In 2013, Israel's attorney general, Yehuda Weinstein, advised ministers across the government to end gender segregation in public spaces. If implemented, the guidelines would change many aspects of daily life in Israel, where gender segregation is allowed on buses, at funerals, in health care and on radio airwaves. The attorney general's guidelines, however, are non-binding.Israel Moves to End Gender Segregation in Public Spaces New York Times, 8 May 2013 In Orthodox Judaism, there are certain situations in which gender separation is practiced for religious and social reasons, with strict rules on mingling of men and women. Before they were banned in 2011, Mehadrin bus lines operated along routes with large Haredi populations, with seats in the front reserved for men passengers. In 2006, Miriam Shear, an American Jewish woman, claims she was attacked by ultra-Orthodox men after refusing to move to the back of the bus on a non-segregated line. Critics likened the ‚Äúmehadrin‚Äù lines to racial segregation in the United States, with Shear compared to African American icon Rosa Parks. In July 2004, American-Israeli novelist Naomi Ragen claims she was bullied for refusing to move to the back of the bus. The Jewish Daily Forward noted that gender segregation has been a tradition in Israel and is actually on the rise, now encompassing gender segregated elevators in some places.[Israel Gets Gender-Segregated Elevator ‚Äî Finally! The Jewish Daily Forward] June 9, 2014 In parts of Jerusalem where ultra-Orthodox live, advertisements and billboard do not have pictures of women, and some supermarkets have different hours for men to shop than women. Some clinics also have separate hours for men and women. [Gender segregation on rise in Israel YNETNews] Nov 15, 2011 Similar problems with gender segregation have surfaced on airlines such as El Al, where ultra-Orthodox male passengers have pressured females to move, and planes have been delayed as a result. The New York Times interviewed Anat Hoffman on the phenomenon of ultra-Orthodox males asking female passengers on airlines to move, noting that IRAC had started a campaign urging Israeli women not to give up their seats. ‚ÄúI have a hundred stories,‚Äù said Hoffman.When a Plane Seat Next to a Woman Is Against Orthodox Faith, The New York Times, 9 April 2015 Controversy has also been created by discrimination against women in public spaces. Women of the Wall have fought for the right of women to pray in their fashion at the Western Wall, including wearing prayer shawls, singing and conducting priestly blessings by daughters of the priestly caste. Women have also been denied the right to sing at some public events, such as memorial services and in the Knesset. The controversy focuses on whether \\"forbidding women to sing is an insulting act of unacceptable discrimination, or a gesture of sensitivity and consideration to Orthodox Jewish men who believe that listening to a woman‚Äôs singing voice is, for them, a violation of religious law. \\" Some believe such policies endorse religious fundamentalism and silence women or restrict their freedom in the public arena.Controversy Rages Over Female Singers at Israeli Memorial Ceremonies Haaretz, May 4, 2016 In 2016, women protested that they had been discriminated against in Holocaust Remembrance Day observance. Bar-Ilan University, for example, announced it would allow women to read passages of text and play musical instruments at its Holocaust Remembrance Day, but would bar women from singing in order not to offend Orthodox Jewish males. The city of Sderot also limited women's singing at public events to appease religious males. Other organizations, such as Ne‚Äôemanei Torah V‚ÄôAvodah (NTA), protested that it is an Israeli custom to sing at national ceremonies and that extreme Jewish religious law should not be imposed on the general public.Bar-Ilan Univ. bans women singing in memorial ceremony The Jerusalem Post, May 4, 2016 In 2017, the Jerusalem Magistrates Court ruled that employees of airlines could not request female passengers change their seats just because men wish them to. Marriage and divorce laws Since the establishment of the state, Israeli law gives jurisdiction for matters of personal status for Jews, including marriage and divorce, to the rabbinical courts. In 1947 David Ben- Gurion agreed that the authority in matters of marriage and divorce of persons registering as Jews would be invested in the hands of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel, and an agreement was signed stating that (among other matters), known as the \\"status quo letter.\\" In 1953 the Knesset enacted the Rabbinical Courts Jurisdiction (Marriage and Divorce) Law, 5713 ‚Äì 1953. Section 1 of the Law states, \\"Matters of marriage and divorce of Jews in Israel, being citizens or residents of the State, shall be under the exclusive jurisdiction of the rabbinical courts.\\" The substantive provision of section 2 of this Law further states: \\"Marriages and divorces of Jews shall be performed in Israel in accordance with Jewish religious law\\" (din torah). In the rabbinical courts, which operate according to halakha (Torah law), a Jewish woman is allowed to initiate divorce proceedings, but her husband must give his consent to make the divorce final. If the husband disappears or refuses to grant the divorce, the wife is considered an \\"agunah\\" (lit. \\"chained woman\\") and may not remarry or give birth to halakhically legitimate children. Rabbinical tribunals may, and sometimes do, sanction a husband who refused divorce, but still do not grant a divorce without his consent. Similarly, a Muslim man is privileged to divorce his wife without her consent and without petitioning the court. Unless a Muslim woman has a marriage contract providing for circumstances in which she may obtain a divorce without her husband's consent, she can only petition for divorce through the Sharia courts, and if her husband elects to withhold consent, she is denied a divorce absent certain conditions, and when these too are lacking she becomes a chained woman, prevented from moving forward with her life based solely on her gender. Christians in Israel may seek official separations or divorces only through the ecclesiastical courts of the denomination to which they belong. Gender discrimination in such courts is not so rigid or codified as under Sharia or orthodox rabbinical rules. In 2010, Israel passed the Civil Union Law, allowing a few couples to marry and divorce civilly in Israel, with men and women enjoying equal rights The Civil Union Law extends this right to only the very small minority of couples in which neither person is registered as a member of any religion. A poll conducted by Tel Aviv University in 2009 revealed that 65% of the Jewish Israeli community supported the availability of civil, gender-neutral marriage, even though 70% of those polled expressed that a religious ceremony was still personally important for their own wedding. In 2015 Tzohar (a Religious Zionist rabbinic organization in Israel), along with the Israeli Bar Association, introduced a prenuptial agreement meant to help ensure divorcing wives will receive a get; under the agreement the husband commits to paying a high sum of money daily to his spouse in the event of a separation. In 2018 the Knesset passed a law, slated to remain in effect for three years, allowing Israel‚Äôs rabbinical courts to handle certain cases of Jewish women wishing to divorce their Jewish husbands, even if neither the wife nor the husband is an Israeli citizen. Politics  Golda Meir, the only woman to serve as the Prime Minister of Israel (1969-1974) Since the founding of the State of Israel, relatively few women have served in the Israeli government, and fewer still have served in the leading ministerial offices. While Israel is one of a small number of countries where a woman-- Golda Meir--has served as Prime Minister, it is behind most Western countries in the representation of women in both the parliament and government. Although the Israeli Declaration of Independence states: ‚ÄúThe State of Israel (‚Ä¶) will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex,‚Äù the Haredi political parties (Shas and United Torah Judaism) have never allowed women on their lists for Knesset elections. However, in December 2014, women activists in the Haredi community have threatened a boycott of Haredi parties in upcoming elections if women are not included in election slates. , women comprised 26.7% of Israel's 120-member Knesset, placing it 54th of 185 countries in which women are included in the legislature. For comparison, the female ratio in Scandinavia is over 40%, the European Union average is 17.6%, while in the Arab world it is 6.4%. Female representation varies significantly by demographics: most female politicians have represented secular parties, while very few have come from religious Jewish or Arab parties. In January 1986 Israeli female teacher Leah Shakdiel was granted membership in the religious council of Yeruham, but the Minister of Religious Affairs Zvulun Hammer canceled her membership on the grounds that women should not serve in that capacity. In early 1987 a petition was submitted to the Israeli Supreme Court regarding this incident. The Supreme Court precedent-setting ruling was unanimously accepted in Shakdiel's favor, and in 1988 Shakdiel became the first woman in Israel to serve in a religious council.Judicial Power and National Politics: Courts and Gender in the Religious-Secular Conflict in Israel, Patricia Woods, SUNY Press, 2008 In 2015, the first Israeli political party dedicated to ultra-Orthodox women was unveiled, called \\"U'Bizchutan: Haredi Women Making Change.\\" Military IDF women officers in 1950 Israel is one of the few countries in the world with a mandatory military service requirement for women. Women have taken part in Israel‚Äôs military before and since the founding of the state in 1948, with women currently comprising 33% of all IDF soldiers and 51% of its officers, fulfilling various roles within the Ground, Navy and Air Forces. The 2000 Equality amendment to the Military Service law states that \\"The right of women to serve in any role in the IDF is equal to the right of men.\\" 88% of all roles in the IDF are open to female candidates, while women can be found in 69% of all positions. On November 8, 1995, while she was a student of aeronautics at the Technion as part of the academic reserve, Alice Miller appealed to the Israeli Supreme Court after being turned down for the pilot selection phase in the Israeli Air Force flight academy. Following her appeal, Israeli president Ezer Weizman, a former IAF commander, made chauvinistic comments that ridiculed the idea of women as fighter pilots: \\"Listen maideleh, have you ever seen a man knitting socks? Have you ever seen a female surgeon or a female being a conductor of an orchestra? Women are not able to withstand the pressures required for fighter pilots.\\" The Israeli Supreme Court eventually ruled in 1996 that the IAF could not exclude qualified women from pilot training. Even though Miller did not pass the exams, the ruling was a watershed, opening doors for women in the IDF. Following the petition, formerly all-male military units began accepting women, including the Israeli Air Force flight academy, the Israeli navy officers' course, various artillery courses, the Israeli air defense and the Israeli Border Police. The Equality Amendment to the Military Service law, enacted in January 2000, completed the Supreme Court ruling as it defined the right of female soldiers to volunteer for combat professions. This law stated that \\"The right of women to serve in any role in the IDF is equal to the right of men.\\" The amendment drafted by female lawmakers granted equal opportunities to women found physically and personally suitable for a job. The question of who and what was \\"suitable\\" was left to the discretion of military leaders on a case-by-case basis. Israeli women soldiers Women began to apply for combat support and light combat roles in the Artillery Corps, infantry units and armored divisions. The Caracal Battalion was formed which allowed men and women to serve together in light infantry. Many women joined the Border Police. Many Israeli women were accepted to the pilot selection phase in the Israeli Air Force flight academy some completed it successfully. The first female jet fighter pilot, Roni Zuckerman, received her wings in 2001. By 2006, the first female pilots and navigators graduated from the IAF training course, and several hundred women entered combat units, primarily in support roles, like intelligence gatherers, instructors, social workers, medics and engineers. When the Second Lebanon War broke out, women took part in field operations alongside men. Airborne helicopter engineer Sgt.-Maj. (res.) Keren Tendler was the first female IDF combat soldier to be killed in action. In November 2007 the Air Force appointed its first woman deputy squadron commander. Nevertheless, there are still positions in the IDF that are off limits to women. In 2003 Yaara Stolberg filed a petition to the Israeli Supreme Court against the IDF's decision not to allow women to serve in the Machbet anti-aircraft unit. About six months after Stolberg completed her two-year mandatory military service, the court denied the petition, stating it has become \\"irrelevant and theoretical\\". On 23 June 2011, Orna Barbivai became the first female Major- General in the IDF upon her promotion to the role of commander of the Manpower Directorate. She is the second woman to serve on the General Staff. In response to several incidents where Orthodox Jewish soldiers objected to women singing during military ceremonies, the IDF Chief of Staff's office ruled that soldiers may not walk out of military assemblies to protest women singing, but may request to be excused from cultural events on those grounds. In October 2011, female soldiers were asked to leave an official event marking the end of the Simhat Torah holiday and dance in a separate area. In November 2011, 19 retired generals sent a letter to Defense Minister Ehud Barak and IDF Chief of Staff Benny Gantz, urging them not to cave in to the demands of religious soldiers. Health , the maternal mortality rate in the country was 7 per 100,000 births, one of the lowest in the world. Women and men were given equal access to diagnostic services and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases. In the workforce  Dorit Beinisch, first woman to serve as president of the Supreme Court of Israel (2006-2012) An IMD survey published in 2012 ranked Israel in eleventh place out of 59 developed nations for participation of women in the workplace. In the same survey, Israel was ranked 24th for the proportion of women serving in executive positions. Israeli law prohibits discrimination based on gender in employment and wages and provides for class action suits; nonetheless, there are complaints of significant wage disparities between men and women. The OECD reported in 2016 that income disparity between men in women in Israel is particularly high compared with other countries in the OECD. On average, men in Israel make 22 percent more than women, which places Israel among the four OECD (behind Japan, Estonia, and South Korea) with the highest wage inequality between men and women. The OECD average stands at 15 percent.Israel's poverty rates highest among OECD nations, Ynetnews.com, 14 January 2016 The government enacted a number of programs to improve the status of women in the work place and society. The Authority for the Advancement of the Status of Women in the Prime Minister's Office grants scholarships for higher education for Druze, Bedouin, and Circassian female students in the country north. The authority holds professional training courses in Arab, Druze, and Circassian localities. In 2013, Malka Schaps became the first female Haredi dean at an Israeli university when she was appointed dean of Bar Ilan University's Faculty of Exact Sciences. Also in 2013, Israel‚Äôs Chief Rabbinate promised to remove the obstacles preventing women from working as supervisors in the state kosher certification system, and Emunah announced the first supervisor certification course for women in Israel. In 2016 it was announced that the High Court of Justice had given the Justice Ministry 30 days to formulate new regulations to allow women to compete equally with men for the position of director of rabbinical courts. Women's organizations Na'amat is the largest Israeli women's organization, founded in 1921. It has a membership of 800,000 women, (Jews, Arabs, Druze and Circassians) representing the entire spectrum of Israeli society. The organization has 100 branches in cities, towns and settlements all over the country. It also has sister organizations in other countries whose members are part of the World Labour Zionist Movement and the World Zionist Organization. The Association of Rape Crisis Centers in Israel is a leading organisation in fighting violence against women. Women's International Zionist Organization (WIZO), is a volunteer organization dedicated to social welfare in all sectors of Israeli society, the advancement of the status of women, and Jewish education in Israel and the Diaspora. WIZO was founded in England on 7 July 1920, and then opened branches throughout Europe and the Americas, and created well-baby clinics and clothing distribution centers in Mandatory Palestine, many still in operation today. WIZO opened the country's first day care center in Tel Aviv in 1926. After the creation of the State of Israel, the organization's headquarters moved from London to Israel. Emunah - Women's Religious-Nationalist Organization, founded in 1918, promotes religious Zionist-nationalistic education for girls and women, managing day-care centers, religious schools, family counseling centers and more, while promoting women's equality within the religious and social settings. In 2008, WIZO, Na'amat and Emunah received the Israel Prize for its lifetime achievements and special contribution to society and the State of Israel.Israel Women's Network (IWN) is a feminist non-partisan civil society organization working to advance the status of women in Israel by promoting equality through a range of projects and methods.  Feminist organizations  Feminist organizations in Israel include the Haifa Women's Coalition, which includes four Haifa-based women's organizations: Isha l'Isha ‚Äì Haifa Feminist Center, Kayan ‚Äì Feminist Organization, Haifa Rape Crisis Center and Aswat ‚Äì Palestinian Gay Women; Coalition of Women for Peace is an Israeli- Palestinian umbrella organization of women's groups that is \\"a feminist organization against the occupation of Palestine and for a just peace.\\" Women in Black is a nationwide anti-war movement; Ahoti ‚Äì for Women in Israel is a Mizrahi feminist organization based in Tel Aviv; New Profile is a movement dedicated to turning Israel into a \\"civilian\\" (as opposed to \\"militarized\\") society; the Jewish Women's Collaborative International Fund promotes women's rights and gender equality.  Political action organizations  Machsom Watch, or Checkpoint Watch is a group of Israeli women who monitor and document the conduct of soldiers and policemen at checkpoints in the West Bank. Women Lawyers for Social Justice promotes the rights of the women from socially and economically marginalized groups. Among its activities: Petition to the High Court for Inclusion of Haredi Women in the Agudat Israel Party, publication of a report on Domestic Violence Against Bedouin Arab Women, petition to repeal a law that negates welfare support in cases of car ownership and more.[http://www.itach.org.il/ We Power (◊¢◊û◊ï◊™◊™ ◊õ\\"◊ü - ◊õ◊ï◊ó ◊ú◊†◊©◊ô◊ù) is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting women to leadership and decision-making roles in Israel.  Religious organizations  Bat Kol is an organization for orthodox religious lesbians which seeks to educate and promote tolerance and acceptance within religious communities. Women of the Wall is a multi-denominational feminist organization whose goal is to secure the rights of women to pray at the Western Wall, also called the Kotel, in a fashion that includes singing, reading aloud from the Torah and wearing religious garments (tallit, tefillin and kippah).: \\"The Women of the Wall believed themselves to be liberal feminists.\\" Lo Nivcharot, Lo Bocharot is a Haredi feminist movement launched by Esty Shushan in October 2012,Nathan Jeffay, ‚ÄúIsraeli elections: Charedi women refuse to vote‚Äù, The Jewish Chronicle, 10 January 2013. to protest the exclusion of Haredi women from Haredi political parties and from the Haredi public sphere in general.Ben Lynfield, ‚ÄúIsrael elections: Women confront final taboo by calling for shake- up of male-dominated Knesset‚Äù, The Independent, 5 January 2015.

He purchased a guitar, and a Marshall half-stack and started practicing to teach himself guitar. Donnell came by Moe's apartment to listen to the songs he had written and said he needed more practice. After six months, Donnell returned to Moe's apartment and agreed to form a band with him. Moe placed an ad at Vintage Vinyl for a bass player and Shaughnessy Denney answered the ad a week later. The three practiced once, and decided to officially become a band on April 1, 2004. After being a band for two and a half years, Shaughnessy and Donnell wanted to add a lead guitarist to the band. Shawn Combs came to see Scene of Irony perform at The Pageant located in St. Louis, Missouri, and asked to join the band.

He is the Unit Chief within the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit in Quantico, Virginia, who works with a non-traditional team called Red Cells. He first appeared in the Criminal Minds episode The Fight in the fifth season. Background David Rossi from Criminal Minds says that he knew Cooper for twenty years. It is also quite clear that he and Aaron Hotchner, also from Criminal Minds, have a past as well, but the matter remains moot. Criminal Minds In the episode \\"The Fight\\", he calls Hotch to come to Washington, D.C. to discuss with him about a case that seems related to a disappearance of a father and a daughter, saying that he has a theory. When Hotch asks him why he is going by Strauss' orders not to work on the case with Hotch's team, Cooper says that they are missing and no one is looking for them. As Hotch's team worked with the SFPD, Cooper and his team worked in a warehouse, and sometimes Hotch's teammembers would pop in once in a while for more clues. He even goes with Hotch to interview the wife of the missing husband and his daughter. When Erin Strauss called Hotch about the status of the investigation, Cooper asked for the phone. Cooper then starts negotiating with her about staying in San Francisco and solving the case, at which she eventually tells him, \\"Tell Agent Hotchner that I will deal with the two of you when you get back.\\" With the help of Garcia, who also works with his team, they were able to identify the killer. When they get to the abandoned warehouse that the killer was in, the girl is gone and the father tells him that he took her and Cooper promises that he will find her and goes into a chopper and finds the killer and the daughter. When the killer was surrounded, he tells the pilot not to \\"blind his agents\\" as they are negotiating him to let the daughter go. When it appeared that the killer jumped off, Prentiss checks to see if he died. But the killer was still alive and was about to kill Prentiss, then shots came from Rawson, who is a sniper. Cooper then smiles, now that he knows that Prentiss is safe and that Rawson saved her life. When his team and Hotch's team were celebrating the closure of the case, Strauss calls him, telling him to get on the plane with Hotch and his team, saying that she has a pile of cases for him. Criminal Minds: Suspect Behavior In the show, Cooper appears to be a gifted profiler like Jason Gideon, as seen in \\"See No Evil\\". He also is shown to be more cautious and concerned for his team members, especially Mick Rawson and Gina LaSalle. In the episode \\"Death By a Thousand Cuts\\", Beth Griffith is kidnapped by the unsub and Cooper had to make a choice whether to sacrifice Beth or risk his career by killing the unsub's son. The episode ends with a cliffhanger and Beth's fate remains compromised.

This vessel should not be confused with other steam vessels named Chehalis.  Career Chehalis was built at Tumwater, Washington in 1867 by H.H. Hyde. The engines for Chehalis came from the Fraser River sternwheeler Henrietta, which had been built at Victoria in 1859. For nearly three years following construction, the owners of Chehalis tried to compete on Grays Harbor and the Chehalis River. This proved unsuccessful, and so the vessel was returned to Puget Sound where it proved more profitable. Chehalis was first put on the route between Snohomish, Port Gamble, and Port Ludlow. Chehalis was later sold to the Black Diamond Coal Mining Company of California, which was operating mines in the Black Diamond area south of Lake Washington. Under Captain Huffner and Capt. William Bailey (1822‚Äì1882), Chehalis was used to tow barges on the lake. (Captain Bailey was later killed in a dock accident at Yesler Wharf.) Capt J.C. Brittain and Capt. Thomas Brennan then bought Chehalis and ran the vessel on the Skagit River. Chehalis was the first vessel to go up the Skagit as far as Portage Rapids, and the first to ascend the Sauk River. The vessel was in charge of captains Daniel Benson, Curtis D. Brownfield, and Robert Bailey while on the Skagit River. Chehalis was also run on the Seattle-Olympia route under Capt.

Chehalis was a total loss, and her cargo was strewn along ten miles of the shore.

It is the thirteenth novel in the internationally popular Inspector Montalbano series. Summary After a disturbing dream, where his Chief Bonetti- Alderighi comes crying at Montalbano's door begging to be hidden and protected from the Mafia, which has taken political power and Mafioso Tot√≤ Riina has become Prime Minister,Clear allusion to recent Italian politics. Cf. Camilleri, op. cit., s.v. the Inspector is woken up by a window shutter banging against the wall and soon later by another banging, at the door, by Catarella who, as usual, announces the finding of a corpse. Under a steady downpour and between various expletives, the Inspector and his men, including a grumpy Mim√¨ Augello, Montalbano's deputy, succeed in retrieving the dead body, cut into pieces inside a bag and buried in a field of clay used by potters. Complicating the investigation is the strange behaviour of Augello, who has become morose and quarrelsome, thus making hell for everyone at the police station. Trying to understand what is happening to his deputy, Montalbano discovers that Mim√¨ is betraying his wife with another woman and telling lies about his being engaged in police activities that keep him busy all night. So the Inspector enlists the help of his Swedish friend Ingrid, whom he asks to tail Mim√¨ and find out what he's doing and who the other woman is. Meanwhile the investigation into the cut-up body, impossible to identify, becomes even more entangled due to a complaint by the beautiful South American Dolores whose husband, a ship officer, has disappeared. A not unimportant fact is that the officer was a distant relation of Mafia boss Balduccio Sinagra. What with the search for the missing husband, Augello's strange behaviour, and old mafiosi rituals which recall biblical passages (the Gospel's \\"the potter‚Äôs field, to bury strangers in\\", ), Montalbano's faith in his closest friends begins to falter.

He was born in Rogersville, Tennessee, but he moved with his family to Washington, Ohio when he was three years old. Before he got into boxing, Armstrong worked with racing horses in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He made his debut on September 19 in a six-rounder against Joe Choynski in Chicago, Illinois. He lost the decision on points. Choynski used him as a sparring partner, as did world heavyweight champion pretender Tom Sharkey and the true heavyweight champs Bob Fitzsimmons and Jim Jeffries. World Colored Heavyweight Champ On December 21, 1896, he won the World Colored Heavyweight Championship vacated by long-time colored champ Peter Jackson by knocking out Charley Strong in the 19th round in a fight held in New York City (although some sources claim the bout took place in Philadelphia on March 25, 1897). On New Year's Day 1897 he fought Joe Butler in Philadelphia and was knocked out in the second round. They met again on the sixth of March in a title bout, and Armstrong prevailed, winning by a technical knock-out in the 6th round. The following day, he fought Frank Childs and lost to him on points in a non-title bout. His next fight was a title bout with Sam Pruitt in San Francisco on April 23, 1897, which he won via a 1st round knock-out. His next official fights resulted in a loss on points to Joe Sheehy in a four-rounder in June and a win against Jack Douglass via a TKO in the 2nd round on September 13. Some sources also report that he beat Jack McCormick on September 25. In 1897, he also fought two exhibitions against Tom Sharkey in May and fought two exhibitions against two different opponents, Jimmy Barry and Childs, on May 29. He fought an exhibition against Joe Choynski in August and finished out the year with an exhibition against John Holtman in November. In the new year of 1898, Armstrong put his championship on the line in a rematch with Childs. On January 29, 1898, and Childs took the title by knocking Armstrong out in the second round. Post- Championship On August 5, 1898, Armstrong fought top white heavyweight contender James J. Jeffries, who was less than a year away from winning the world's heavyweight championship, in a 10-round bout at the Lenox Athletic Club in New York City. Armstrong lost on points. He fought colored heavyweight champ Denver Ed Martin for the colored heavyweight title in the Crystal Palace in London on July 25, 1902. According to the Associated Press coverage of the fight: > \\"Martin proved the cleverer and never gave his opponent a chance, being > declared an easy winner on points at the close of the fifteenth round; > Martin, it is announced, will challenge the winner of the Jeffries- > Fitzsimmons fight in San Francsico.\\" Martin was not given a title shot and met Armstrong for a rematch in Philadelphia on December 10 According to the Daily Gazette and Bulletin: > \\"The bout was fast from the start and both men narrowly escaped a knockout. > The bell saved Armstrong in the third and fifth and Martin was floored six > times in the fourth round.\\" The six-round bout ended in a no decision. In his next fight, Martin lost his title to Jack Johnson, who would one day break the color bar and become the first African American heavyweight champion of the world. Armstrong retired after being KO-ed by Walter Johnson in Haverhill, Massachusetts on December 26, 1904. He ended his career with an official record of 17 wins (with 15 KOs) against 11 losses (in which he was KO-ed six times) and five draws. He also had a newspaper decision record of one win and one draw. On January 29, 1932, he worked the corner for King Levinsky in his fight against Max Baer. He died on January 5, 1933 in Chicago, Illinois.

The fort lasted for nearly two hundred years with a rich legacy of history until it was finally demolished in 1897. It was located on the north side of Marlborough St., on the site of the current British Colonial Hilton Nassau. Remnants of the old walls can be seen on the hotel grounds. For many years it was the only fort in Nassau. Even though Columbus was the first to think of building forts first in his newfound islands in Bahamas to secure it for Spain, it was put into action only in 1687 by private people with intent on piracy oriented actions, with the tacit compliance of the then governors of the islands, in the Caribbean. The reason for establishing the fort at Bahamas was the sacking of the town and killing of the British Governor by the Spanish with support from French ships which had caused the islanders to flee. In order to prevent further such attacks, at the intervention of Charles II, in 1684 the town was resettled. In order to make the town more secure an Act was passed in 1695 not only for building of the town but also to build a defensive fort. This fort was built in 1697 and named as Nassau, after King William III (House of Orange-Nassau). It underwent several invasions, rebuilding and final dismantling in 1897. When built first in 1697 the fort was fortified with 22 cannons. In just about 3 years, part of the fort was damaged in an attack by the Spaniards in 1700, and two years later in 1702 Governor Elias Haskett was imprisoned in the fort. The allied forces of Spain and France attacked New Providence when the fort suffered severe damages with the guns getting immobilized and the inhabitants forced to leave the town. Soon pirates operating from the fort became a common event. However, on the urgings of the business community of London, George I sent forces, in 1718, to govern the island and to get rid of piratic operations. The governor set to action by restoring the island to normalcy when only one nine pounder cannon was found in the fort in total disrepair. It was only in 1741, a serious effort was made to get the fort restored under the guidance of an experienced engineer. The fort was renovated in 1744 with 54 cannon and 26 brass mortars. The process of neglect and frequent repairs followed and in 1776 the fort was attacked by the American Colonies who were fighting the British forces, to capture the ammunition stored here. The American naval Forces found only 100 guns since the ammunition had been stealthily moved to Boston before the attack. However, the Governor had been taken hostage in the bargain. The last act of attack on the fort was by the Spaniards in 1782, when they took control of the fort and held it till 1783 until the war with England ended in 1783. During this time, the valiant effort made by Colonel Deveaux to recapture the fort was fruitful, bringing an end to the saga of repeated attack and destruction of the fort. The fort was garrisoned in 1787 and a new fort (Fort Charlotte) was ordered to be built to defend the island. In the French revolution that followed, the old fort was allowed to remain in state of disrepair till it was decided to fully demolish it in 1897. It was at the ruins of this fort on its western wing that the British Colonial Hilton Hotel was decided to be built. Layout The fort had been built of stone in the shape of a 4-pointed star with its two high walled ends projecting northward into the harbor. The fort guarded the western end of the port. However, the reasons for the repeated damages suffered by the fort were attributed to its strategically poor location on a hill promontory which could be easily attacked from the higher hills to its south from where it was subjected to frequent and effective bombardments even with smaller sized guns.

RAF Bomber Command Thiele was posted to an operational training unit before being transferred to the Canadian No. 405 Squadron at RAF Pocklington a few miles east of York, equipped with Wellington IIs. Thiele's first mission was almost his last. Returning from Cherbourg in France in January 1942, Thiele got the green light to land, but as he touched down was confronted by another aircraft. The two planes collided engine to engine, ripping the wings off. The court of inquiry absolved him. On 30‚Äì31 May 1941, flying a Halifax, Thiele took part in the thousand-bomber raid on Cologne. By late October 1941, Thiele had completed 32 operations flying both Halifaxes and Wellingtons. There followed a number of missions over Essen amidst very heavy flak and German searchlight exposure. Thiele was promoted straight from pilot officer to flight lieutenant, skipping the intermediate rank of flying officer, and then to squadron leader in the space of a few months. Later, 22-year-old Thiele would revert to the rank of flight lieutenant in order to return immediately to operations rather than becoming a flight instructor. In August 1942, after completing a further 25 missions, Thiele would be awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC).

It was flying a Lancaster that Thiele completed 20 more missions and, in May 1943, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for displaying outstanding courage, keenness and determination during operations. On 12 May, Thiele was flying a Lancaster of No. 467 Squadron on a mission to Duisburg, an industrial city. He had nearly reached the target when his aircraft was hit by a flak underneath the fuselage, which severed the rear half of the starboard outer engine, punctured the starboard inner engine and blew out most of the perspex in the cockpit. Thiele, dazed by a blow from a shell splinter that had struck him on the side of the head, limped the aircraft back from Duisburg on two engines. Shortly after crossing the English coast he was unable to maintain height, but displaying superb airmanship he struggled on and succeeded in effecting a crashlanding at an airfield in Norfolk.

History Before the 20th century, there used to be three main Apinaj√© groups known as the R√µrkojoire, the Cocojoire, and the Krƒ©jobreire, each with their own land and political division, which totaled more than half of the current territory. Currently, the three distinct Apinaj√© groups have been living together, though S√£o Jos√© is controlled by the Krƒ©jobreire, and Mariazinha has Cocojoire leadership. During the first quarter of the nineteenth century the Apinaj√© had a successful economic growth fueled by extensive cattle farming and the extraction of baba√π palm oil which brought an increase in migration. In the late 20th century, immigrants encroached on Apinaj√© lands. Their lands divided when highways such as the Bel√©m-Brasilia Highway and the Trans-Amazonian Highway. Part of their lands separated by the Trans-Amazonian Highway was taken from them and the tribe is working to regain it. The land rights of the Apinaj√© have been recognized by the federal government of Brazil in the 1988 Constitution. Contact The Apinaj√© indigenous population has had contacts with the Jesuits, military bands and explorers, which is similar to the experiences of other indigenous groups. Between 1633 and 1658, the Jesuits journeyed up the Tocantins River in order to ‚Äú[persuade] the Indians to ‚Äòdescend‚Äô the river to the villages of Par√°‚Äù. This ushered in the potential of further encounters. On one of his expeditions, Captain-General D. Luiz Mascarenhas was confronted by ‚Äúwar-like‚Äù people, the Apinaj√©, in 1740. Another confrontation between the Portuguese settlers and the Apinaj√© occurred in 1774 when Ant√¥nio Luiz Tavares Lisboa and his band of explorers were traveling by way of the Tocantins River. These early contacts did not greatly disrupt the lifestyle of the Apinaj√© people. It was not until the 19th century that the indigenous group would suffer from colonization. This was due to the shrinking of their territory and population reduction in the face of settlement establishment by the Portuguese. Da Matta (1982) believes that the Apinaj√© were saved from extinction mainly due to the fact that the area they were situated in did not have true economic value. Conflict During the initial colonization period, the Apinaj√© had been recorded as being hostile to European expeditions. This prompted the construction of the military post of Alcoba√ßa in 1780. However, it was soon abandoned due to the successful raids of the Apinaj√©. This only prompted further fortifications. In 1791 ‚Äúanother military post was founded on the Arapary river‚Äù and the same occurred in 1797 with the construction of the post of S√£o Jo√£o das Duas Barras. Regardless of previous conflicts, the Apinaj√© participated in the War for Independence of 1823 after sending ‚Äú250 warriors to join the troops of Jos√© Dias de Mattos‚Äù. The most recent area of conflict was during the construction of the Trans-Amazon highway in 1985, which was supposed to be built over indigenous land. With the support of Krah√¥, Xerente, Xavante, and Kayap√≥ warriors, the Apinaj√© had their lands recognized by the Brazilian state and the route of the highway was altered to avoid passing through this indigenous territory. First Schools Schools existed in the area of the Apinaj√© as early as the early 19th century, however it is unclear if their purpose was for the indigenous group or the general settler population. The first instructional materials for the Apinaj√© language were organized by the missionaries of the Summer Institute for Linguistics, in this particular case, Missionary Patricia Ham. Governmental support for indigenous schools was established as part of the 1988 Constitution. The current school system of the Apinaj√© shows that children start to learn in their native language up to the 4th grade, when Portuguese is introduced. The schools are run by the Apinaj√© community, with some teaching staff that comprises non- indigenous instructors and assistants. These schools further support the hypothesis that transmission rates are high; children are monolingual until they reach an age when they can start learning another language, leading to the majority of the population as being bilingual. It seems like the Apinay√© language is still an important part of the culture of the group, and therefore has the ability to continue thriving. Economic development Apinaj√© woman farm subsistence gardens, while men fell trees and plant rice. Common crops include bananas, beans, broad beans, papayas, peanuts, pumpkins, sweet potatoes, watermelons, and yams. Apinaj√© families raise cattle, pigs, and chickens. Hunting and fishing supplement domestic foods. In the past, baba√ßu nuts were sold for cash.\\"Apinay√©: Productive Activities.\\" Povos Ind√≠genas no Brasil. (retrieved 25 April 2011) Language Family The J√™ family is the largest language family in the Macro-J√™ stock. It contains eight languages, some of which have many dialects within them. The languages of this family are concentrated mostly in ‚Äúthe savanna regions of Brazil from the southern parts of the states of Par√° and Maranh√£o south to Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul‚Äù. Unfortunately, many other languages in the Macro-J√™ stock have become extinct, because their East coast location meant for the first contact with Europeans, which, as written above, was violent and detrimental to many indigenous communities. Language Apinaj√© people speak the Apinay√© language, a Macro-J√™ language. It is spoken in thirteen villages by the majority of the tribe. Some Apinaj√© people also speak Portuguese.\\"Apinay√©.\\" Ethnologue. (retrieved 25 April 2011) Literature A descriptive grammar of this language exists, written by researcher Christiane Cunha de Oliveira in her dissertation ‚ÄúThe Language of the Apinaj√© People of Central Brazil‚Äù. Oliveira provides an extensive description and analysis of the phonology, morphology, and syntax of Apinay√©. Other linguists have also contributed to the descriptive grammar of the language, including Callow's 1962 paper discussing word order; Burgess and Ham's phonological analysis including topics like consonant to vowel ratio, tone, and inventories of the different sounds of the language; and Callow's 1962 analysis of nominal categories and Ham et al.‚Äôs 1979 analysis of verbal categories. Pedagogical grammars have been created for use in a bilingual classroom setting, with the intention of teaching both national culture and indigenous culture to young students. Sousa et al.‚Äôs ‚ÄúApinaj√© Intercultural Bilingual School: For an Education Beyond the Ethnic Frontier‚Äù discusses this process in depth, and examines the value of having an Apinaj√© pedagogical grammar in the classroom. There is an intrinsic link between language and culture, and learning the Apinay√© language helps children build a stronger connection with both their indigenous culture and the national culture of Brazil. It also is perhaps part of the reason that this language currently holds the status of ‚Äúdeveloping‚Äù on the EGID scale as mentioned above, as transmission of a language to children of the culture is vital to its survival. Documentation Projects In the Acknowledgements section of ‚ÄúThe Language of the Apinaj√© People of Central Brazil‚Äù, Oliveira thanks the Funda√ß√£o Nacional do √çndio (FUNAI) for assistance with the documentation needed for the research. Therefore, the Apinay√© language has been part of a small documentation project, to provide the research necessary for this dissertation and descriptive grammar. Otherwise, documentation projects for this language are unavailable. Ethnography The most recent ethnographic study done on the Apinaj√© people is from 2017, where the education system is analyzed (Sousa et al.). The most prominent ethnography of the Apinay√© language and people is Oliveira's thesis dissertation (2005). This was preceded by Da Matta's work (1982) which explores Apinaj√© customs and traditions. Curt Niumendaj√∫ was a German anthropologist and ethnologist who wrote The Apinay√© (1939). The book is based on the social structure of the indigenous group, though it also includes minimal information regarding the linguistic formation of the Apinay√© language.

Like the St. John's Library, the Cornish is one of two Carnegie libraries in the city. It is a Grade II listed building and a Winnipeg Landmark Heritage Structure. It was gazetted on January 15, 1993. It is named in honour of Winnipeg's first mayor, Francis Evans Cornish. History Designed by the architect S. Frank Peters, the plans had to be approved by Carnegie's personal secretary, James Bertram, to assure money was not wasted on exterior ornamentation at the expense of book shelves and furniture. The library is located at 20 West Gate in Cornish Park on a small piece of land at one of the entrances to Armstrong's Point, near the Maryland Bridge. It replaced the Winnipeg Waterworks building. It is situated on the eastern bank of the Assiniboine River with the library's west elevation facing the river. The Cornish Baths, Winnipeg's first indoor pool, were formerly located beside the Library. Construction by the National Construction Company of Winnipeg began in 1914. The library opened on June 15, 1915. The foundation was damaged by flooding in 1918 and it was repaired using a $7,000 Carnegie grant. The Library is undergoing an expansion in 2019-20 that will see that addition of an all-glass reading area and improved accessibility from the main entrance. It will re-open some time in late 2020. Architecture and fittings The library, in size, was built in keeping with Andrew Carnegie's specifications, being of a simple plan that was characterized by classical details, fenestration and modest interior appointments. Resting on a concrete foundation, it has nearly 4,000 cu. m. (141,074 cu. ft.) of interior space, 75 million bricks, 1,002 superficial sq. m. of plaster, and 229 cu. m. of concrete. The building cost approximately $30,000. Exterior The one- storey building is rectangular and has a raised concrete basement. An ornamental, smooth-cut belt encircles both levels. There are red brick walls and limestone details. Sills are made of stone. Windows are tall and rectangular. While the hip roof is low-pitched, a centred front portico and centred rear pavilion have a gabled roof. The main entrance has a pedimented double-door. This is framed by stone columns. An carved entablature includes the words: \\"PUBLIC LIBRARY\\", \\"CORNISH BRANCH\\", and \\"A.D. 1914\\". The pediment on top of the rear pavilion has an oculus with decorative brick and stone detailing. There are block modillions in the pediments and under the eaves. Other features include red brick chimneys with stone caps as well as a brick and stone porch with a gable roof. Interior The library has high ceilings and windows. The basement ceilings are , while the main floor ceilings are . The main floor has built-in perimeter bookshelves. Reading areas include partial wall and screened wall areas. The lower level is reached via stairs from the front vestibule. A central hallway in the basement separates lecture rooms. Interior doors are made of oak and glass. Other interior features include solid, wide, oak tables, wood panelling, and tiled fireplaces with oak mantels. The collections are situated on the main floor while the basement has a program room that seats 60 people. Nellie McClung Notable people The Canadian novelist, prohibitionist, and women's rights and reform movement activist Nellie McClung lectured at the Cornish Library.

Unlike traditional school approaches in which teachers attempt to tailor their material to a mythical \\"average\\" student, and move the class altogether using the material through one teaching and testing style, positive schooling teachers use techniques that focus on the well-being of individual students. Teachers use methods such as developing tailored goals for each student to engender learning and working with them to develop the plans and motivation to reach their goals. Rather than pushing students to achieve at a set grade level, seen through the emphasis of standardized testing, this approach attempts to customize learning goals to individual students' levels. Instead of setting students to compete against one another, learning is viewed as a cooperative process where teachers learn to respect their students and each student's input is valued.  Theoretical approaches  Several early psychologists and thinkers paved the way for the incorporation of positive psychology techniques, though they may not have yet been labeled as such, in the classroom. John Dewey was among the earliest advocates to impact the field of positive schooling. John Dewey recognized schools as primary institutions for the development of democracy. He opposed the repressive atmosphere of schools, especially elementary and secondary schools, and emphasized the importance of promoting learners' ability to absorb and recreate information in their minds. He put forth the idea of constructivism, which argues that individual learners should take information and creatively construct it according to their own personal capacities and views. This approach opposes the traditional view of education in which teachers pass down knowledge to the students through direct communication. In summary, Dewey's view of education, similar to progressive education implies that people learn best in environments that are applicable to the real world and that allow them to learn io890;op[ and practical problem solving. Maria Montessori, the originator of the Montessori system, put forth views relating to positive schooling as well. The Montessori system is largely based on the positive psychology principle of creativity. Creativity, known as one of the twenty-four character strengths, is offered with the freedom for children to choose how they learn, known as self-directed learning. Children are provided with hands-on materials, which not only inspires creativity, but also stimulates interest in learning, as children are able to express themselves through learning, rather than feeling forced to work in order to learn. Sophie Christophy coined the term Education Positivity (EdPositivity) in 2018, with the founding of self-directed, consent, and children‚Äôs rights based education setting The Cabin. Ed Positivity is an approach that transcends traditional subject silos and hierarchies, instead finding educational and learning validity in emergent and diverse interests, curiosities, and problem solving, pursued individually and/or in collaboration. Elizabeth Hurlock was one of the first psychologists to actually carry out experiments with positive psychology techniques to measure the effects of positive schooling in the field of education. Hurlock studied the effectiveness of praise and reproach in the classroom, arguing that praise was a more effective long-term incentive. Her studies found that praise was more effective for children regardless of age, ability and gender. Jeniffer Henderlong and Mark Lepper echo Hurlock's arguments that praise is beneficial to enhancing children's intrinsic motivation. Although some research doubts the effectiveness of praise, appropriate use of praise is proven to be positively correlated with confidence and better academic performance results. They support that praise increases the personal beliefs about one's ability to perform given tasks. Also, cognitive evaluation theory supports that praise enhances individuals' perception about performance outcomes and that positive moods induced by praise may contribute to effective outcomes. Arthur Chickering and Zelda Gamson focus on the pedagogy, the teacher's \\"how,\\" rather than content and subject matter being taught, which is partly due to the scarce empirical research that has been done on college curriculum. Chickering and Gamson give seven research-supported principles regarding education and learning in the undergraduate environment for teachers to follow: # Teachers are to encourage contact between students and faculty. Chickering and Gamson explain that student-faculty relationships give students motivation to keep working hard to strive for future goals and also provide support and resources. # To develop reciprocity and cooperation among students, promoting a collaborative learning environment, rather than a competitive one. This gives students opportunities to work together and learn from one another, which has been shown to strengthen understanding. # Teachers are to use active learning techniques, relating material to topics that students already have an interest in and getting students to ask, \\"What does this concept look like in my own life?\\" # Teachers are to give prompt feedback. Balancing assessment and feedback results in efficient learning, as students realize what they do and do not know and learn to assess themselves. # Emphasizing time on task, or sharing effective time management strategies to give students an understanding for their time expectations. # Communicating high expectations has shown to be very successful. Expectations that teachers implement give students a gage for how much potential they think that they have. # Respecting students' diverse talents and ways of learning accounts for all learning styles and allows students to figure out how they learn best. Eliot Aronson has pioneered the jigsaw classroom, a theoretical approach for 3rd-12th grade classes which emphasizes the individual academic strengths of children and seeks to make them peer-teachers in a cooperative learning setting. In this approach, students are divided into competency groups of four to six students; individual group members then break off and work with \\"experts\\" on their topic from the other groups, researching together that specific section of material. These students then return to their groups and present on their part of the material. This approach encourages group engagement, listening, and cooperation among peers, as well as incorporates an aspects of play into learning. It as shown positive effects on academic performance and liking for school and peers. This may be because increased liking leads to self-esteem, which if absent, can affect academic performance. It is also possible that jigsaw methods help to increase participation while reducing anxiety, lead to increases empathy, and result in changes in attributions of success and failures. The Jigsaw method has been proposed as a strategy to improve race relations since it meets the criteria posed by contact theory for reducing racial prejudice. Intergroup contact theory states that interracial contact will only improve race relations if ethnic groups are of equal status, pursue a common goal of mutual interest for groups, and are sanctioned by institutions. Another model that utilizes positive education in school is the response to intervention model. Response to intervention is a preventative model that works to provide tailored assistance to at-risk students who are exhibiting insufficient academic achievement, though its principles have been used to address behavioral issues as well. The central components of this model include a core curriculum based on scientific evidence, universal screening, progress monitoring, and decisions about acceptable progress in subsequent tiers. RTI utilizes a multi-tiered structure: at each tier, students are screened and then monitored. The model was originally created to help identify learning disabilities, so that the adoption of a core curriculum ensures that inadequate teaching is not the cause for poor performance. Those who struggle even when adhering to a research-supported curriculum are given more intense instruction at a higher tier. When behavior is being considered, school or local norms for behavior rates are used when screening. The Positive Behavior Support (PBS) model is structured similarly to RTI but addresses behavior problems. This model adopts a prevention and intervention approach, emphasizing the importance of building prosocial skills, in addition to reducing bad behavior while implementing a three-tiered \\"continuum of supports\\" from a universal to an individual level. The strategies at the universal level include defined expected behaviors, strategies to teach expected behavior, strategies to encourage and practice appropriate behavior, and consistency within and across school systems. The second level involves providing targeted support for individuals and groups that are at risk. The final level concerns individuals that persist in their bad behavior and involves functional behavior assessments, instruction-based plans, and collective comprehensive plans including families and community agencies. PBS can be implemented at a school-wide (SWPBIS), district-wide or even statewide level. Recently, local school systems and even state departments of education have been demonstrating a rising interest in PBS because the program requires little training time and limited money and staff. In 2002, the New Hampshire Department of Education organized a statewide initiative to introduce PBS into New Hampshire schools. PBS has also become popular in Maryland, as more than 33% of state's schools implemented the program in 2006.  Empirical findings  One major empirical finding in support for positive learning techniques has been the positive effect of praise-based discipline techniques in classrooms. Elizabeth Hurlock studied the day-to-day improvement of students who were praised, reproached, and ignored. Students were divided into these groups in addition to a control group after they had been administered an arithmetic test, and were subsequently tested each day over an additional period of four days. After the first testing session, the control group was tested in a separate room from the other groups. In the treatment room, the \\"praise\\" group of students were invited to the front of the room and praised for their work as well as encouraged to do better. The \\"reproach\\" group was called up and reproved for their poor performance, while the ignored group received no recognition. Some significant findings include the fact that the praised group experienced the most initial improvement, followed by the reproach group and then the ignored group, while no improvement was seen in the control group. The ignored and control group also showed a decrease in accuracy towards the end of the testing period. When children were grouped according to academic achievement into the categories \\"superior\\", \\"average\\" and \\"inferior\\" after the first test, praise was the most influential incentive for all students, though it was most effective for the \\"inferior\\" group. As a whole, the results suggested that praise was the most accurate incentive regardless of age, sex, initial ability, or accuracy. While empirical evidence supports the positive effects of praise, there exists a debate regarding whether the jigsaw classroom method is successful in various areas. Two studies by Christopher Bratt, who was interested in the jigsaw classroom's ability to improve prejudice based on ethnicity, examined the effects of the jigsaw classroom method on intergroup relations; yet, no positive effects were found. The first studied the method's effect on majority members' outgroup attitudes, attitudes towards school empathy, and intergroup friendships by examining two jigsaw classrooms and two regular classrooms of multi-ethnic 6th graders. The second measured common ingroup identity in the majority sample and outgroup attitudes in the minority sample in addition to the previous variables in a sample of 8th‚Äì10th graders in 46 multi-ethnic classrooms, utilizing a matched pair design between jigsaw and regular classrooms. No evidence of any significant effects of the jigsaw method was found in the second study, while outgroup attitudes improved in study 1. Yet, Bratt believed the findings from study 1 were spurious, arguing that the fact that one of the classrooms in study 1 was taught by two teachers while the others had one teacher may have influenced the results. A study by Walker & Crogan yielded evidence that supported the utility of the jigsaw classroom. The study investigated the relationship between teaching methods such as cooperative learning and the jigsaw classroom and outcomes in academic performance, self-esteem, attitude of school, attitude of peers, and racial prejudice. The study was designed to investigate solely the jigsaw classroom method, yet one of the teachers altered her mode of instruction due to the behavior of disruptive students so that it resembled cooperative learning. As a result, the experimenters modified their objectives, believing they could compare the effectiveness of cooperation, necessary in both methods, and task interdependence, characteristics only of the jigsaw classroom. They concluded that academic performance, liking of peers, and racial prejudice improved under the jigsaw classroom method while cooperative learning appeared to intensify intergroup tension, yet major methodological issues may cast doubt on the validity of these findings. Many of the classrooms did not adhere very strictly to proper plan for implementation of the jigsaw classroom and the researchers had to abandon their original design. Also, the fact that one of the teachers had to forgo the jigsaw classroom method due to student misbehavior is telling. Bratt argues that studies professing results that support improved intergroup relations are similarly flawed. The Circle of Courage curriculum is, yet, another practical attempt for implementing positive learning techniques. The Circle of Courage is an educational philosophy developed by Larry Brendtro, Martin Brokenleg, and Steve Van Bockern, that is based on Native American values and Western science. Belonging, mastery, independence, and generosity are four core values that are intended to integrate Western and indigenous cultures. Deborah Espiner and Diane Guild monitor the progress and success of Mt. Richmond Special School after implementing the Circle of Courage curriculum and Response Ability Pathways (RAP) program. The school managers established a positive learning environment based on these two programs, which were designed for dynamic interaction between teachers and students. Before launching the actual classroom environment, five months were taken to introduce new learning methods to school staff and students. In general, participants acknowledged that new modules brought positive impact in the school. One recognizable outcome was that RAP training facilitated the connection between teachers and challenging students. Additionally, new positive education methods also led teachers to discover the potentials of their pupils. When examining programs that attempt to help children overcome behavioral issues that prevent them from displaying their full potential, research has provided support for the efficacy of PBS. A study by Barrett and Lewis-Palmer investigated the statewide implementation of PBS in 467 schools. The results indicated that overall, the program had been successfully implemented and displayed high fidelity to the theoretical model. Elementary schools reported 43% less office discipline referrals (ODRs) per day, while middle schools reported 37% less ODRs per day and K-(8‚Äì12) schools reported 72% less ODRs per day when compared with the national averages. Schools also demonstrated significant reductions in suspension rates in as little as one year. Another study by Muscott and Mann examined the first cohort of 28 New Hampshire early childhood education programs and K-12 schools that had implemented PBS in accordance with the directive of the Department of Education. Within three months after the program was introduced, 54% of schools met the standards of successful PBS implementation and 88% of schools had done so two years after implementation. In terms of behavior issues, a school was considered successful if 80‚Äì90% of elementary students and 70‚Äì80 middle school students received less than 2 ODRs during a school year. After the first year, 70% of schools has achieved these results. Between the first and second years, the schools reduced ODRs by 28% collectively.  Controversies  Positive education is, by no means, uniformly agreed on as an effective teaching strategy. The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) was proposed in 2001 to improve the conditions of public schools in the United States. The act has imposed standardized testing on all schools that are government-run and receive government funding. Each school's test results are analyzed, and schools with continuously low test scores are obligated to develop an improvement plan.Dillon, E., & Rotherham, A. \\"States' Evidence: What It Means to Make 'Adequate Yearly Progress' Under NCLB\\" . Retrieved April 25, 2011. There is still much debate whether the act has a positive effect on America's education system, since it is based on performance-based education reform. Supporters of the act believe that setting measurable goals will improve individual educational success and that statewide tests will improve the situation of public schools. Major teacher's unions and other opponents, however, have doubts about the act's effectiveness, which may be due to the mixed results of NCLB, arguing over the ineffectiveness of standardized tests and higher standards for teacher qualification. Opponents also argue that standardized tests are exceedingly biased and that higher standards for teacher qualification simply contribute to teacher shortage.(nd) Similarly, the 2009 United States Department of Education program Race to the Top, designed to spur reform in K-12 Education, and awarding $4.35 billion in funds, has been controversial for its emphasis on testing to evaluate schools, an approach which contrasts positive schooling techniques, and data regarding its effectiveness has yet to be produced. Besides the emphasis on standardized testing to evaluate school performance, tracking has been a very controversial, yet widely implemented, approach to learning in America's public schools. Tracking is an approach which places children in classes according to expectation levels. Honors, college-preparation, Advanced Placement, and International Baccalaureate classes are examples of higher- level learning courses, while schools may simultaneously offer regular-level classes for other students. Research has shown a disparity in the enrollment of these classes based on race. Research also shows that while separation by tracking is beneficial for higher-level students, it produces no benefit for lower-level students, and is possibly even detrimental to their academic success. Many advocates for education reform discount tracking based on the argument that a rigorous, quality education should be provided universally through public schools.  Applications  Recently, a positive psychology plan was implemented in the U.S. military to address the high rates of post- traumatic stress disorder, depression, and other mental disorders among soldiers. The military asked psychologists to devise some sort of way not simply to treat the problem but to prevent future soldiers from becoming vulnerable to these mental disorders. Statistically, there is a normal distribution of reactions to combat in the military: the left side includes those who have trouble and end up suffering from a mental disorder, the middle, those who are resilient and return to normal functioning afterwards, and the right are those who bounce back to an even higher level of functioning and experience growth through adversity. The goal of the plan is to have a negatively skewed distribution that shifts most soldiers to the right side of this distribution. The model is designed to improve one's spiritual, emotional, social, and family fitness. If the plan is successful within the military, it could possibly revolutionize current U.S. civilian health care and be a new model for the education system. Within health care, it will emphasize prevention, rather than solely treatment; additionally, within schools, it will encourage psychological fitness similar to the plan used for the military. Moreover, \\"the emphasis on positive psychology interventions in education increases engagement, creates more curious students, and helps develop and overall love of learning (Fisher, 2015)\\". \\"Positive education benefits the teacher, too. It is easier to engage with students and persist in the work they need to do master their academic material (Fisher, 2015). It creates a school culture that is caring, trusting, and it prevents problem behavior. In relation to achievement goals, expectancy beliefs, and value it is found that task goals associated positively with optimism resulted in a highly motivated student (Fadlelmula, 2010). Research has shown that motivation may be consistent and long-term if it is always paired with positive psychology interventions.\\" Additionally, the effects of positive learning were examined in the context of medical school and first-year physicians. Often, medical students and young physicians get exhausted and burnt out from the stressful conditions they operate under. Medical students at Karolinska Institutet were evaluated in their final year of school and again in their first year as a physician. After controlling for baseline exhaustion, a positive learning climate in the clinic that the students were working in was found to have a negative correlation with exhaustion. In this case, positive learning was found to predict the exhaustion of students and new doctors. Although only a correlation, positive learning environments could benefit the well-being of people with various other careers and job conditions. Conclusion Positive education, the use of positive psychology in the realm of education, may have the potential to be a new model for successful education. The field of positive schooling, although still in the early stages of development, seems to have a promising future. Rather than the traditional concept of teachers simply communicating information to students, students in positive schooling learn through individual goals and by cooperating with other students to have an environment in which students can work towards the same goal together. Overall, the goal of positive schooling is to turn all students into teachers who will pass down their wisdom and knowledge to others and teachers who will continue the ways of positive education.

The origin of the community's name is uncertain. According to one story, while Anderson's station was being run by Bill Granger, a salesman asked for the name of the place to use on an invoice. Granger replied, \\"I'm alone,\\" meaning he could not ask what the name was, and the salesman wrote \\"Imalone\\" on the invoice. Another explanation states that Anderson named the community Imalone \\"because he was.\\" Imalone has frequently been noted on lists of unusual place names. The Imalone Bible Camp and Church, founded by Rev. Olaf Newhagen in 1940, was a major center of activity for many years, often attracting campers and counselors from Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota. Newhagen, a Norwegian immigrant, was a highly respected member of the community who farmed during the week and preached on Sundays. In 1967, five years after his death, the church split over the issue of baptism. The majority of the active members then formed the Grace Bible Church in Bruce. In the late 1970s there was another exodus when the majority of the active members left to form the Living Waters Church about a mile north on State Highway 40. Since 1980 there has been little to no activity on the premises and the buildings are in disrepair. As of 2007, the community consisted of a bar called the Wagon Wheel and some houses.

History Traditionally, Mysore has been home to industries such as weaving, sandalwood carving, bronzework, and the production of lime and salt. The planned industrial growth of the city and the state was first envisaged in the Mysore economic conference, held in 1911. This led to the establishment of industries such as the Mysore Sandalwood Oil Factory in 1917 and the Sri Krishnarajendra Mills in 1920.Hayavadana Rao (1929), p278Hayavadana Rao (1929), p270  Demographics  India census, Hebbalu had a population of 1471.

Mysore has emerged as the hub of the tourism industry in Karnataka, attracting about 2.5 million tourists in 2006. National Parks 40‚Äì60 miles to the south include Bandipur National Park and Mudumalai National Park sanctuary for gaur, chital, elephants as well as Bengal tigers, Indian leopards and other threatened species. For the industrial development of the city, the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board (KIADB) has established four industrial areas in and around Mysore and are located in Belagola, Belawadi, Hebbal (Electronic City) and Hootagalli areas. The major industries in Mysore include BEML, J. K. Tyres, Wipro, SPI, Falcon Tyres, L & T, Theorem India pvt Ltd and Infosys. Since 2003, information technology companies have been creating bases in Mysore, with the city contributing Rs. 1100 crores (US$220 million) to Karnataka's IT exports in the financial year 2007‚Äì2008. Infosys has established one of the largest technical training centres in the world and Wipro has established its Global Service Management Center (GSMC) at Mysore. Non-IT related services have been outsourced from other countries to companies in Mysore. Lulls in Development The industrial sector in the city experienced setbacks when the automobile manufacturer Ideal Jawa and the Sri Krishnarajendra Mills closed their operations. Revival efforts, such as the takeover of the Krishnarajendra Mills by the Atlantic Spinning and Weaving Mills Ltd. have been made, but these attempts have run into other problems. In 2011, Infosys built a fire station at Hebbal at a cost of 4.5 crore for the Karnataka Fire and Emergency Services department.

It was introduced by Leo Katz in 1953 and is used to measure the relative degree of influence of an actor (or node) within a social network. Unlike typical centrality measures which consider only the shortest path (the geodesic) between a pair of actors, Katz centrality measures influence by taking into account the total number of walks between a pair of actors. It is similar to Google's PageRank and to the eigenvector centrality. Measurement A simple social network: the nodes represent people or actors and the edges between nodes represent some relationship between actors Katz centrality computes the relative influence of a node within a network by measuring the number of the immediate neighbors (first degree nodes) and also all other nodes in the network that connect to the node under consideration through these immediate neighbors. Connections made with distant neighbors are, however, penalized by an attenuation factor \\\\alpha. Each path or connection between a pair of nodes is assigned a weight determined by \\\\alpha and the distance between nodes as \\\\alpha^d. For example, in the figure on the right, assume that John's centrality is being measured and that \\\\alpha = 0.5. The weight assigned to each link that connects John with his immediate neighbors Jane and Bob will be (0.5)^1 = 0.5. Since Jose connects to John indirectly through Bob, the weight assigned to this connection (composed of two links) will be (0.5)^2 = 0.25. Similarly, the weight assigned to the connection between Agneta and John through Aziz and Jane will be (0.5)^3 = 0.125 and the weight assigned to the connection between Agneta and John through Diego, Jose and Bob will be (0.5)^4 = 0.0625. Mathematical formulation Let A be the adjacency matrix of a network under consideration. Elements (a_{ij}) of A are variables that take a value 1 if a node i is connected to node j and 0 otherwise. The powers of A indicate the presence (or absence) of links between two nodes through intermediaries. For instance, in matrix A^3, if element (a_{2,12}) = 1, it indicates that node 2 and node 12 are connected through some walk of length 3. If C_{\\\\mathrm{Katz}}(i) denotes Katz centrality of a node i, then mathematically: :C_{\\\\mathrm{Katz}}(i) = \\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty \\\\sum_{j=1}^n \\\\alpha^k (A^k)_{ji} Note that the above definition uses the fact that the element at location (i,j) of A^k reflects the total number of k degree connections between nodes i and j. The value of the attenuation factor \\\\alpha has to be chosen such that it is smaller than the reciprocal of the absolute value of the largest eigenvalue of A. In this case the following expression can be used to calculate Katz centrality: : \\\\overrightarrow{C}_{\\\\mathrm{Katz}} = ((I - \\\\alpha A^T)^{-1}-I)\\\\overrightarrow{I} Here I is the identity matrix, \\\\overrightarrow{I} is a vector of size n (n is the number of nodes) consisting of ones. A^T denotes the transposed matrix of A and (I - \\\\alpha A^T)^{-1} denotes matrix inversion of the term (I - \\\\alpha A^T). An extension of this framework allows for the walks to be computed in a dynamical setting. By taking a time dependent series of network adjacency snapshots of the transient edges, the dependency for walks to contribute towards a cumulative effect is presented. The arrow of time is preserved so that the contribution of activity is asymmetric in the direction of information propagation. Network producing data of the form: :\\\\left {A^{[k]} \\\\in \\\\R^{N \\\\times N} \\\\right } \\\\qquad \\\\text{for} \\\\quad k=0,1,2,\\\\ldots,M, representing the adjacency matrix at each time t_k. Hence, :\\\\left( A^{[k]} \\\\right)_{ij} = \\\\begin{cases} 1 & \\\\text{there is an edge from node } i \\\\text{ to node } j \\\\text{ at time } t_k \\\\ 0 & \\\\text{otherwise} \\\\end{cases} The time points t_0 < t_1 < \\\\cdots < t_M are ordered but not necessarily equally spaced. Q \\\\in \\\\R^{N \\\\times N} for which (Q)_{ij} is a weighted count of the number of dynamic walks of length w from node i to node j. The form for the dynamic communicability between participating nodes is: :\\\\mathcal{Q} = \\\\left(I-\\\\alpha A^{[0]} \\\\right)^{-1} \\\\cdots \\\\left( I - \\\\alpha A^{[M]} \\\\right)^{-1}. This can be normalized via: :\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{Q}}^{[k]} = \\\\frac{\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{Q}}^{[k-1]} \\\\left(I-\\\\alpha A^{[k]} \\\\right)^{-1}}{\\\\left hat{\\\\mathcal{Q}}^{[k-1]} \\\\left( I - \\\\alpha A^{[k]} \\\\right)^{-1} \\\\right \\\\}. Therefore, centrality measures that quantify how effectively node n can 'broadcast' and 'receive' dynamic messages across the network, :C_n^{\\\\mathrm{broadcast}} := \\\\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\\\mathcal{Q}_{nk} \\\\quad \\\\mathrm{and} \\\\quad C_n^{\\\\mathrm{receive}} := \\\\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\\\mathcal{Q}_{kn}. Applications Katz centrality can be used to compute centrality in directed networks such as citation networks and the World Wide Web. Katz centrality is more suitable in the analysis of directed acyclic graphs where traditionally used measures like eigenvector centrality are rendered useless. Katz centrality can also be used in estimating the relative status or influence of actors in a social network. The work presented in shows the case study of applying a dynamic version of the Katz centrality to data from Twitter and focuses on particular brands which have stable discussion leaders. The application allows for a comparison of the methodology with that of human experts in the field and how the results are in agreement with a panel of social media experts. In neuroscience, it is found that Katz centrality correlates with the relative firing rate of neurons in a neural network. The temporal extension of the Katz centrality is applied to fMRI data obtained from a musical learning experiement in where data is collected from the subjects before and after the learning process. The results show that the changes to the network structure over the musical exposure created in each session a quantification of the cross communicability that produced clusters in line with the success of learning. A generalized form of Katz centrality can be used as an intuitive ranking system for sports teams, such as in college football.

Tulsa improved its record against Tulane to 7‚Äì1 overall, with the only loss occurring in 1968. Oklahoma State In week 3, Tulsa took on Oklahoma State in a home game that memorably lasted until 3:35 a.m. after inclement weather delayed the kickoff past midnight. The Golden Hurricane scored a field goal on their first drive to take an early lead, but were unable to contain the Cowboys' potent offense and quickly fell behind for good. The team was further hindered by the loss of G.J. Kinne near the end of the first quarter, forcing them to rely heavily on the run for the remainder of the game.

North TexasUAB October:October was a new month for Tulsa. TU began a winning streak which would extend through October to late in the season. TU began with North Texas on October 1, the final out-of- conference game of 2011. TU led 41‚Äì3 in the 3rd quarter before pulling the starters. Against Tulsa's, UNT scored 21 late points. On October 15, TU hosted UAB. TU's defense was shaky and allowed 20 first half points and led 24‚Äì20 at the half. TU pulled away, holding UAB scoreless in the second half and winning 37‚Äì20. Rice On October 22, TU traveled to Houston to play Rice. TU's offense got off to a quick start, scoring 17 1st quarter points due to 3 turnovers forced by Tulsa's opportunistic defense and winning 38‚Äì20. SMU On October 29, 2011, Tulsa's first year head coach Bill Blankenship faced the toughest C-USA opponent to date and the team picked to finish 3rd in C-USA West (behind Houston and Tulsa) in the pre-season media poll. However, SMU had exceeded preseason expectations at 5‚Äì2 after upsetting rival No. 19 TCU and falling only to Texas A&M; and Southern Miss (who was 6‚Äì1 at the time). Furthermore, Tulsa had struggled against SMU under previous head coach Todd Graham, losing 2 straight and barely winning by an average of 6 points against two 1‚Äì11 teams in 2007 and 2008. Nevertheless, Tulsa prevailed with a dominant performance. TU scored quickly and got out to a 24‚Äì0 lead at half time thanks to 3 interceptions by CB Milton Howell and two rushing touchdowns by short- yardage specialist HB Alex Singleton. TU won 38‚Äì7, allowing only 1 score to one of the top offenses in the country and scoring 38 points against one of the top defenses in the country. UCF In November Head Coach Bill Blankenship was entering his second toughest month of the year (after September) with a tough road game at Central Florida where Tulsa had struggled under previous head coach Todd Graham, losing two straight. As reported by tulsahurricane.com \\"UCF defense ranks in the top-six in the FBS for rushing, passing, passing efficiency, scoring and total defense\\".

Tulsa gained 251 yards rushing, more than UCF had allowed all season at home (4 games). TU's 24 points also exceeded the total points UCF allowed at home all season Marshall Tulsa headed home to host Marshall, one of the better teams in C-USA East division (eventually finished near top of East). Tulsa had struggled against Marshall under previous head coach Todd Graham, barely winning 38‚Äì31 against 3‚Äì9 UM in 2007 and 38‚Äì35 against 4‚Äì8 UM in 2008. This game had no such drama as Tulsa led 42‚Äì3 at the half and won its 11th straight C-USA game with a 59‚Äì17 win over Marshall. UTEP Next, the Tulsa Golden Hurricane traveled to El Paso to match up with the UTEP Miners in the Sun Bowl. Tulsa had struggled against UTEP under previous head coach Todd Graham, and had not won in El Paso since 2003. Under Graham, Tulsa had lost its previous two games in El Paso by 5 points total against two UTEP teams which finished 4‚Äì8. This time, there was no doubt after Tulsa led 50‚Äì15 in the 3rd quarter as TU won 57‚Äì28. TU's defense struggled early, giving up 15 points in the first half, but shut down UTEP for the pivotal 3rd quarter in which Tulsa seized control. Two scores by UTEP late in the 4th quarter allowed UTEP to be the first C-USA team to score more than 20 points against TU. Houston Finally, the University of Tulsa Golden Hurricane had an opportunity to accomplish one of the goals set long before the season started: Win the C-USA Western Division Title and play the C-USA Championship game.

The organization is engaged in building a new civil society in India through its grassroots to policy-level action in health, education and community development. They have been recognized by private and government bodies inside and outside of Karnataka. Their work in the field of AIDS prevention was recognized by the Indian government.HIV/ AIDS ‚Äì 2009 They received awards such as the 'National Youth Award' from the Indian government, and the Mahaveer Award for work in Community and Social Service from the Mahaveer Foundation. History In 1984 a group of young medical students led by Ramaswami Balasubramaniam at Mysore Medical College started the movement. Their initial intention was to provide rational, ethical and cost-effective medical care to the needy. They started by collecting (free) samples of medicines and distributing them to poor patients, organizing blood donation camps and weekly rural outreach clinics around Mysore. In 1987, they traveled to Heggadadevanakote Taluk, home of displaced and dispossessed forest-based tribes. These indigenous people, belonging to five clans ‚Äì Jenukuruba, Kadukuruba, Yerava, Paniya and Bunde Soliga ‚Äì had been displaced twice from their natural habitat by government development projects ‚ÄòProject Tiger‚Äô and ‚ÄòKabini Reservoir‚Äô, and were forced to live in penury on the fringes of the Bandipur National Park. The medicos set up a clinic at a village named Brahmagiri, about 80 km from Mysore city, with help from the Mysore District Administration. Realizing early that Medicare by itself is not enough and hoping that education would help the next generation, they opened an informal school in a cow-shed. Socioeconomic empowerment activities were added to health and education, and the rural poor were engaged as the organization moved from the role of a ‚Äòprovider‚Äô to a ‚Äòfacilitator‚Äô. A 10-bed hospital was started at Kenchanahalli, along with community-based programs in health and education. As the medicos returned after completing their post-training, the multi-specialty Vivekananda Memorial Hospital took shape at Saragur. The organization continued to grow and expand in the 1990s. Activities SVYM's principal area of operation is in Mysore. They operate various institution- and community-based health and education projects and undertake Community Development Initiatives, catering to a populace of about 400,000 including both tribal groups and the rural poor. SVYM has a training/resource center called Vivekananda Institute for Leadership Development at Mysore, which also serves as a base for urban-based interventions and also houses their registered office. They work in the most undeveloped regions of North Karnataka, particularly in Bijapur and Dharwad. In addition to direct intervention, they train and build capacities of like-minded NGOs. They have an education project running in Bangalore. Their Training, Research, Advocacy and Consultancy (TRAC) activities give them an India-wide presence. SVYM‚Äôs chapters in Hassan, Kodagu and Dakshina Kannada districts are run by members of SVYM. They carry out locally relevant projects. For the tribal people, they facilitate mobile education and medical services, namely Vidhyavahini and Sikshavahini.http://srkvijayam.com/2014/04/29/‡Æµ‡Æø‡Æµ‡Øá‡Æï‡Ææ‡Æ©‡Æ®‡Øç‡Æ§‡Æ∞‡Øà‡Æï‡Øç-‡Æï‡Æ±‡Øç‡Æ±-‡Æá‡Æ≥‡Øà‡Æû/ (In Tamil) Health care The institution-based services under health are provided through Vivekananda Memorial Hospitals (VMH) at Saragur and Kenchanahalli. VMH‚ÄìSaragur is a 90-bed facility offering multi-specialty secondary care at an affordable cost to the rural and tribal populace.

The park was named after Henry T. Hazard, the 20th mayor of Los Angeles. The park is abutted by County+USC Medical Center and the Francisco Bravo Medical Magnet High School. History Named after Henry T. Hazard A 2000-seat terraced grandstand opened in 1911 in the park, as did \\"the largest and best fitted playgrounds\\", divided into sections for boys and for girls. Beginning in 1962, a 1000-bed Veterans Administration (VA) hospital was planned to replace the park. The VA had proposed exchanging of park land for the at the VA property near Westwood. This proposal was met with opposition organized through the Save Hazard Park Association, which called the action \\"Robin Hoodism in reverse\\", since parkland in a poor Latino community would be exchanged for parkland in wealthier West Los Angeles. In 1966, the City Parks Commission voted in favor of the exchange, with general manager of the Recreation and Parks Department calling it a \\"good deal for the city\\". In the same year, Mayor Sam Yorty and the city council approved the exchange. The Association brought an injunction against the city, but it was denied in 1968. By 1969, Yorty ceded to the protest, asking the city council to repeal the plan. The Los Angeles Times said \\"the council and the mayor moved correctly, if belatedly\\", calling it a victory for the Association. In May 1970, a celebration occurred at the park to celebrate the dropping of the eminent domain suit. The celebration included local artist Leo Politi, who had painted murals at the park during the protests. In 2000, supporters lobbied for the inclusion of an adjacent section of wetlands to be included in the park. The efforts were led by the Save Hazard Park Association, which renamed to Friends of Hazard Park and Hazard Park Wetlands.

Economic Development The Economic Development program is very active in the commercial landscape of North Carolina‚Äôs clean technology sector. The program coordinates clean tech industrial recruitment support and advising by connecting out-of-state businesses with the resources that North Carolina has to help them get started. The Center works with 300 businesses on industry development projects annually. The Economic Development program also coordinates with the Renewable Energy program to provide solar and clean energy financial modeling for businesses looking for economic returns on renewable energy projects. The N.C. Solar Center‚Äôs dashboard allows customers to model inputs including ownership structures, tax incentives, grants, depreciation, electricity prices, and project costs. The N.C. Solar Center has had a large impact on North Carolina‚Äôs clean tech landscape. In 2012, the organization worked with the N.C. Department of Commerce to bring China‚Äôs Ming Yang Wind Power Group, a leading wind turbine manufacturer, to N.C. State University through a research and development center on Centennial Campus. Workforce Development The Workforce Development program area works to educate North Carolina‚Äôs work force on assessing and installing clean technologies. The Renewable Energy Technology Diploma series (RET) is a week- long certification course for non-degree professionals. In this series, participants get an in-depth understanding of a survey of renewable technologies as well as green building principles and strategies. The classes also offer hands-on training, current policy information, and a network of energy professionals. These courses offer continuing education credits for NC electrical contractors, registered architects, professional engineers, and LEED accredited professionals. The Workforce Development program also offers short course versions of these professional development workshops that last three days or less. The Workforce Development team also travels around the state to deliver these workshops. Since 2006, the team has traveled around North Carolina to deliver 5 day workshops, including Fayetteville for a photovoltaics course, Asheville for a solar and radiant heating course, Wilmingtonfor a green building course, and Manteo for a wind power course. In addition, the Workforce Development program offers the Certificate in Renewable Energy Management (CREM) course designed for business professionals and students studying to be in the clean technology sector. The course provides a sound foundation of how existing renewable technologies work but also dives into the infrastructure, finance, and policies surrounding the renewable energy industry. Energy Policy The N.C. Solar Center‚Äôs Energy Policy program conducts research and analysis to provide a better understanding of how renewables and energy efficiency are best promoted through public policy. In 1995, the N.C. Solar Center launched the Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency (DSIRE). The database is the most comprehensive source for energy efficiency and renewable energy financial incentives and policies in the country. The website features interactive maps and search features to allow visitors to pinpoint the exact local, state, or national policy information they want to know. The website experiences over 175,000 unique users/month. The DSIRE team also sends out monthly news blasts to keep policymakers and industry leaders up-to-date. The Energy Policy program also participates in the Sunshot Solar Outreach Partnership to remove solar market barriers and encourage the development of a sustainable solar infrastructure. The partners share best practices for increasing the use of solar energy in and by communities throughout the U.S. The N.C. Solar Center conducts outreach to local governments around the country to help them generate a master plan for solar energy deployment. Through encouraging local governments to develop regulations, incentives, and development agreements, the N.C. Solar Center and its partners are working to enable solar-generated power to account for 15-18% of America‚Äôs electricity generation by 2030. Education & Outreach The Education & Outreach program coordinates several clean technology activities for K-12 audiences in North Carolina. The purpose is to generate enthusiasm for STEM at a crucial stage in the educational development of students and to encourage students to consider technical careers at an early age. For high schoolers, the N.C. Solar Center runs the Students Making Advancements in Renewable Transportation Technologies (SMARTT) program that provides them a cooperative, hands-on learning experience building a street-legal electric vehicle.

Legend Some write that his name St. Germain was invented by him as a French version of the Latin Sanctus Germanus, meaning \\"Holy Brother\\".Schroeder, Werner Ascended Masters and Their Retreats Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 2004, pages 250 ‚Äì 255Luk, A.D.K..

Luk Publications 1989, pages 254 ‚Äì 267Booth, Annice The Masters and Their Retreats Summit Lighthouse Library June 2003, pages 312 ‚Äì 322 In the Ascended Master Teachings (but not in traditional Theosophy), the Master R, or the Master R√°k√≥czi, is a separate and distinct being from St. Germain. Literature about St. Germain=Biographies There are several \\"authoritative\\" biographers on St. Germain who usually do not agree with one another. Probably the two best-known biographies are Isabel Cooper-Oakley's The Count of St. Germain (1912), and Jean Overton-Fuller's The Comte de Saint-Germain: Last Scion of the House of Rakoczy (1988). The former is a compilation of letters, diaries, and private records written about the Count by members of the French aristocracy who knew him in the 18th century. Dr. Raymond Bernard's book The Great Secret ‚Äì St. Germain is biographical and covers many aspects of the Count's life, including his conflation with Sir Francis Bacon, and the author of the Shakespearean opus. Manly Palmer Hall, in his The Secret Teachings of All Ages, describes some of the same attributes as Dr. Bernard, including the attribution of the writings of Shakespeare to a great adept like Francis Bacon, who could be amalgamated with the Count of St. Germain. There have also been numerous French and German biographies, among them ' by Peter Krassa, Le Comte de Saint-Germain by Marie-Raymonde Delorme, and L'√©nigmatique Comte De Saint-Germain by Pierre Ceria and Fran√ßois Ethuin. Occult biography A book titled The Great Secret, Count St. Germain, by Dr. Raymond Bernard, purports that St. Germain was actually Francis Bacon by birth, and later authored the complete Plays attributed to Shakespeare. He also contends, as does the Saint Germain Foundation in Schaumburg, Illinois, that Francis Bacon was the child of Queen Elizabeth and Lord Dudley but that it was kept quiet. According to this theory, Francis was raised by the Bacon family, yet knew of his true birth, and left numerous hints throughout the Shakespearean canon of this, in the form of explicit clues in the text of the plays, in pictures, and in the alleged use of Bacon's cipher in the works. Books claimed by Guy Ballard to have been dictated to him by Saint Germain Saint Germain is the central figure in a series of books published by the Saint Germain Press (the publishing arm of the Saint Germain Foundation). The first two volumes, Unveiled Mysteries and The Magic Presence, written by Guy Ballard as \\"Godfr√© Ray King\\", describe Saint Germain as an Ascended Master, like Jesus, who is assisting humanity. In these first two books, Ballard discusses his personal experiences with Saint Germain and reveals many teachings that are in harmony with Theosophy. The third volume, The 'I AM' Discourses, contains material that is foundational to the sacred scriptures of the \\"I AM\\" Religious Activity, founded in 1930 ‚Äì the first of the Ascended Master Teachings religions. There are 20 Volumes in the Saint Germain Series of Books, which are also referred to as the \\"Green Books\\". Another significant work, the Comte de Gabalis, is said to be from the hand of Sir Francis Bacon before he Ascended and returned as Sanctus Germanus or Saint Germain. First printed in 1670, the book includes a picture of the Polish Rider, Rembrandt's famous painting at the Frick Collection in New York City, which is said to be of Sir Francis Bacon, AKA the Comte de Gabalis, or the Count of the Cabala. Lotus Ray King (Edna Ballard's pen name), wife of Guy Ballard, talked about this book having been authored by the Ascended Master Saint Germain in the Round Table Talks of the \\"I AM\\" Religious Activity. Claimed encounters with Saint Germain Several Theosophists and practitioners of alternate esoteric traditions have claimed to have met Saint Germain in the late 19th or early 20th centuries: * Annie Besant said that she met the Count in 1896. * C. W. Leadbeater claimed to have met him in Rome in 1926 and gave a physical description of him as having brown eyes, olive colored skin, and a pointed beard; according to Leadbeater, \\"the splendour of his Presence impels men to make obeisance\\".Leadbeater, C.W. The Masters and the Path. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1927 (Revised from 1925 edition) (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997) Page 32 Leadbeater said that Saint Germain showed him a robe that had been previously owned by a Roman Emperor and that Saint Germain told him that one of his residences was a castle in Transylvania. According to Leadbeater, when performing magical rituals in his castle in Transylvania, Saint Germain wears \\"a suit of golden chain-mail which once belonged to a Roman Emperor; over it is thrown a magnificent cloak of Tyrian purple, with on its clasp a seven-pointed star in diamond and amethyst, and sometimes he wears a glorious robe of violet.\\"Leadbeater, C.W.

Unveiled Mysteries. Chicago, Illinois: Saint Germain Press 1934 * Edgar Cayce, the \\"Sleeping Prophet\\", was asked while in trance if Saint Germain was present. Cayce's reply was: \\"When needed.\\" (From reading # 254‚Äì83 on 2/14/1935.) * Dorothy Leon, living author, has claimed to have had several encounters with Saint Germain and is an avowed disciple of his. * Miroslav Zimmer, living poet, claim to have met St Germain in the Mal√° Fatra mountains in Slovakia in 2011 in the company of a Sam Bennett. * David Narozny, living Czech music composer, claims to have met St Germain in Pruhonice on 23 May 2014. *Peter Mt. Shasta, living spiritual teacher, claims that in 1973, St. Germain materialized before him in Muir Woods, Marin County, California. He describes this meeting in Apprentice to the Masters: Adventures of a Western Mystic, Book II. He also claims to have had many other physical as well as etheric meetings with him as well as other Masters. *David Christopher Lewis, living spiritual teacher, claims that Saint Germain first came to him in person on 10 June 2004 in his home in Paradise Valley, Montana, and continued to come many times thereafter, dictating what is now in the book Saint Germain on Advanced Alchemy: HeartStreaming in the Aquarian Age.\\"SAINT GERMAIN ON ADVANCED ALCHEMY\\" (Meru Press, 2015) Esoteric activities Many groups honor Saint Germain as a supernatural being called a Master of the Ancient Wisdom or an Ascended master. In the Ascended Master Teachings he is referred to simply as Saint Germain, or as the Ascended Master Saint Germain. As an Ascended Master, Saint Germain is believed to have many magical powers such as the ability to teleport, levitate, walk through walls, and to inspire people by telepathy, among others. The Theosophical Society after Blavatsky's death considered him to be a Mahatma, Master of the Ancient Wisdom, or Adept. Helena Blavatsky said that he was one of her Masters of Wisdom and hinted that he had given her secret documents. Some esoteric groups credit him with inspiring the Founding Fathers to draft the United States Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, as well as providing the design of the Great Seal of the United States.Hall, Manly P.

According to The Theosophical Society, the Seven Rays are seven metaphysical principles that govern both individual souls and the unfolding of each 2,158-year-long Astrological Age. Since according to Theosophy, the next Astrological Age, the Age of Aquarius, will be governed by the Seventh (Violet) Ray (the Ray of Ceremonial Order), Saint Germain is sometimes called \\"The Hierarch of the Age of Aquarius\\". According to the Ascended Master Teachings, Saint Germain is \\"The God of Freedom for this system of worlds\\". According to the Ascended Master Teachings, the preliminary lead-up to the beginning of the Age of Aquarius began on 1 July 1956, when Ascended Master Saint Germain became the Hierarch of the Age of Aquarius, replacing the former Astrological Age Hierarch, the Ascended Master Jesus, who had been for almost 2,000 years the \\"Hierarch of the Age of Pisces\\". In the works authored by Alice A.

Alice A. Bailey's book The Externalisation of the Hierarchy (a compilation of earlier revelations published posthumously in 1957) gives the most information about his reputed role as a Spiritual Master. Saint Germain's spiritual title is said to be Lord of Civilization, and his task is the establishment of the new civilization of the Age of Aquarius.Bailey, Alice A.

They believe in the Gnostic Christology espoused by Cerinthus (fl. c. 100 AD), according to which \\"Christ\\" is a being who was incarnated in Jesus only during the three years of the ministry of Jesus.) According to certain Theosophists, \\"Christ\\" is identified as being a highly developed spiritual entity whose actual name is Maitreya. This Maitreya is the same being known in Buddhism as the Bodhisattva Maitreya, who is in training to become the next Buddha on Earth. According to Alice A. Bailey, the \\"executive council of the Christ\\" is a specific subgroup of the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom, charged with preparing the way for the Second Coming of Christ and the consequent inauguration of the Age of Aquarius. Previous incarnations According to The Theosophical Society (not to be confused with the United Lodge of Theosophists) and the Ascended Master Teachings, Saint Germain was incarnated as the following. (Note: Not all Theosophical and Ascended Master Teaching groups accept all of these incarnations as valid. St. Germain's incarnations as St. Alban, Proclus, Roger Bacon and Sir Francis Bacon are universally accepted.) * Ruler of a Golden Age civilization centered in a city called \\"The City of the Sun\\" 70,000 years ago located in the then- lush and verdant area that is now the Sahara Desert, originally a colony sent out from Atlantis. * High priest in the civilization of Atlantis 13,000 years ago, serving in the Order of Lord Zadkiel in the Temple of Purification, located in an Atlantean colony that had been sent out from the main island of Atlantis that had been established on the island now called Cuba. * Samuel, 11th-century BC religious leader in Israel who served as prophet, priest, and last of the Hebrew judges. * Hesiod, Greek poet whose writings serve as a major source of insight into Greek mythology and cosmology (c. 700 BC). * Plato, Philosopher who studied with students of Pythagoras and scholars in Egypt. He established his own school of philosophy at the Academy in Athens. (427‚Äì347 BC). * Saint Joseph, 1st century AD, Nazareth. Husband of Mary and guardian of Jesus. * Saint Alban, late 3rd or early 4th century, town of Verulamium, renamed St. Albans, Hertfordshire, England. First British martyr ‚Äì he had sheltered a fugitive priest, became a devout convert, and was put to death for disguising himself as the priest so that he could die in his place. * Proclus, c. 410 ‚Äì 485 AD. Athens. The last major Greek Neoplatonic philosopher. He headed the Platonic Academy and wrote extensively on philosophy, astronomy, mathematics, and grammar. * Merlin, c. 5th or 6th century, Britain. Magician and counselor at King Arthur's Camelot who inspired the establishment of the Order of the Knights of the Round Table. * Roger Bacon, c. 1220‚Äì1292 AD, England. Philosopher, educational reformer, and experimental scientist. Forerunner of modern science renowned for his exhaustive investigations into alchemy, optics, mathematics, and languages.Although C.W. Leadbeater claims that Roger Bacon was a past incarnation of Saint Germain and the Church Universal and Triumphant (the main Ascended Master Teachings religion) also accepts this, some sources and some Ascended Master Activities believe that Roger Bacon was a past incarnation of the Ascended Master El Morya * Organizer behind the scenes for the Secret Societies in Germany in the late 14th and early 15th centuries. The creation of a possibly fictional character named \\"Christian Rosenkreuz\\" was inspired by his efforts. * Christopher Columbus, 1451‚Äì1506 AD. Believed to have been born in Genoa, Italy and settled in Portugal. Landed in America in 1492 during the first of four voyages to the New World sponsored by King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain * Francis Bacon, 1561‚Äì1626, England. Philosopher, statesman, essayist and literary master, author of the Shakespearean plays (according to the Ascended Master Teachings), father of inductive science, and herald of the scientific revolution. Ascension into masterhood According to the Ascended Master Teachings, Francis Bacon made it appear that he died on Easter Sunday, 9 April 1626, and even attended his own \\"funeral\\" in disguise. It is believed by the adherents of the Ascended Master Teachings that he then traveled secretly to Transylvania (then part of Hungary, now part of Romania) to the Rakoczy Mansion of the noble family of Hungary. Finally on 1 May 1684 he is believed to have attained (by his knowledge of alchemy) his physical Ascension (attaining immortality and eternal youth ‚Äì the sixth level of Initiation), at which time Francis Bacon adopted the name \\"Saint Germain\\".\\"Saint Germain\\" (claimed by the Church Universal and Triumphant to have been dictated by Saint Germain to Mark Prophet) Studies in Alchemy Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA: 1974 Summit Lighthouse.

It is derived from the Wagon R. __TOC__  First generation (MA61S/MB61S, 1997)  The predecessor to the Solio, the Wagon R-Wide, was introduced in February 1997, as a slightly larger version of the Wagon R, exceeding the kei car specifications, with larger engines: 996cc (K10A, 48 kW/88Nm), 996cc Turbo (JDM, New Zealand and Australia only, K10A, 73 kW/118Nm) and 1.2-litre (K12A, 51 kW/93Nm) engine. The Wagon R-Wide was sold as the Wagon R+ in the European market (also introduced in the same year) with the atmospheric versions of the 1.0 K10A and the 1.2 K12A. The only other tall wagon style car sold in Europe around the time of its introduction was the Daihatsu Move. The car was made in Japan. It was not galvanised and it was prone to rust, especially in the sills, after years of use in Central and Northern Europe. The Wagon R-Wide was slightly facelifted in May 1998, and this updated Wagon R-Wide was also sold in Europe under Wagon R+. In Europe, the first generation was sold from 1997 until May 2000. Between 1999 and 2001, it was also built in Colombia by GM Colmotores, who sold it as the Chevrolet Wagon R+. This was equipped with the naturally aspirated K10A four-cylinder engine. In Indonesia, the facelifted first generation Japanese Wagon R-Wide is sold as the Suzuki Karimun and was produced locally from 1999 until 2006 and offered with a 1.0-liter petrol engine, whilst in China it forms the base for Changhe Beidouxing. The Big Dipper is available with an indigenously built 1.0-liter engine based on the old F10A, or with the more modern 1.4-liter K14B engine.

This updated version started sales in the European market in the summer of 2000. The main difference between the JDM Wagon R+ and the European Wagon R+ is the door handles, which on JDM models were body-colored while European models received black door handles. In December 2000, the Japanese-spec model was renamed Wagon R Solio, and this was available both in the bottom-of-the-line X trim level and in a more sports- oriented trim level known as the 1.3. In June 2002, the 1.0 E trim level was added to the Wagon R-Solio lineup. In August 2003, a mid-facelift Wagon R-Solio was released. In April 2004, the Wagon R-Solio was renamed Solio, losing the Wagon R moniker entirely. In August 2005, a facelifted Solio was launched. The Hungarian-built Wagon R+ is still being produced for the European market (in 2008, Wagon R-Solio and Solio are not sold), albeit with limited range and availability (it is no longer for sale in Ireland, for example). As of 2006 in the UK, only one model is available ‚Äì the GL, with a 1.3 litre (1298 cc) 16 valve 4-cylinder petrol engine delivering , ABS with EBD and air conditioning as options. The current model is x x (length x width x height), with a claimed of cargo space. It was too difficult for either the Wagon R-Solio or Solio to meet with Euro NCAP crash safety ratings. As a result, the Wagon R+ continued in Europe until late 2008, when replaced by the Splash. From 2000 until 2007, the Wagon R+ is rebadged as Opel/Vauxhall Agila. The Agila was built at an Opel factory in Gliwice, Poland and used Opel Engines and transmissions. The last Agila was a rebadged Splash. 2003 Suzuki Wagon R+ GL Automatic 1.2 Rear.jpg2003 Suzuki Wagon R+ GL 1.3 (pre-facelift, United Kingdom) Suzuki Wagon R+ DDiS.JPGSuzuki Wagon R+ DDiS 1.3 (facelift, Italy) MA34S Suzuki Wagon R Solio.jpg2002‚Äì2005 Suzuki Wagon R Solio (first facelift, Japan) MA34S Suzuki Solio.jpg2005‚Äì2010 Suzuki Solio (second facelift, Japan) MA34S Suzuki Solio Rear.jpg2005‚Äì2010 Suzuki Solio (second facelift, Japan) Chevrolet MW.jpgChevrolet MW (Japan)  Third generation (MA15S, 2010)  While the kei-version of the Wagon R went through third and fourth generations, the wider Solio remained in its second generation until undergoing a full model change in December 2010. The third generation Solio was released on 7 January 2011 and is based on the Palette instead of the Wagon R, although the Palette itself uses the Wagon R's platform. This generation of Solio (MA15) also provides the basis for an OEM deal with Mitsubishi Motors, rebadged as the Mitsubishi Delica D:2, which was released in March 2011. In Japan, it was sold at a specific retail chain called Car Plaza.

It is the only agency in the country which assigns short-term and long-term credit ratings to Ukrainian, CIS and Eastern-European importing companies in the course of their foreign economic activity and trade financing, in particular. History CredoLine was established with the support of foreign export credit agencies and Ukrainian partners in June 2008 with the view to achieving maximum transparency on the information market of CIS countries and qualitative improvement of rendered services. The described support is explained by the utmost necessity of establishment of an objective, independent and specialized rating agency, professionally able to credit assess risks of importing enterprises located in Ukraine, as well as throughout territory of the CIS region. Now and then it‚Äôs a privately owned company with 100% Ukrainian capital, run since the foundation date by the general Director Ms. Katerina Bogdanenko. The Agency‚Äôs Goal is to systematize and discipline the beneficial multilateral foreign economic relations between foreign partners and CIS partners on all of the cooperation stages. Different mentality, various approaches to business conduct, different legislative base, accounting standards should not be a barrier while any international transaction between mentioned parties, and with its services‚Äô complex CredoLine is putting every effort to facilitate such multicultural business collaboration. Services The main Agency activity line is credit rating assignment, which can be short- term or long-term, depending on the strategy and goals the rated Company/Group of Companies pursue/s. Creditworthiness investigations with subsequent credit opinion definition may be initiated by the rated company or by the interested counteragent (potential partner/existent business partner/financial institution which acts as a mediator between the rated company and other interested party etc.) So, CredoLine is elaborating different kinds of creditworthiness‚Äô investigations, such as: * Status Credit Rating Report * Status Credit Report * Status Credit Report of a Bank Apart from credit rating products, the agency is rendering its clients' different analytical products, always different by their nature and set goals. Basing on the client‚Äôs requirements, needs, deadlines etc. the agency prepares such reports: * Status country report * Status business trend report * Status monitoring report * Status market report * Others information-analytical reports Ratings and rating scale In the process of credit rating assignment, the agency uses its own complex methodology. Agency‚Äôs rating methodology is based on a special balanced system of indexes, which includes the influence of country risk and is recognized by leading export credit agencies and other financial institutions. The completeness of indexes list used in the process of evaluation of a company's financial position and performance (absolute indexes, financial stability ratios, solvency ratios, profitability ratios, efficiency ratios, insolvency ratios) and special procedure of reliability audit and correctness of forming basic data allow to evaluate financial position and performance of a rated company in the most objective way. Moreover, the given methodology is particularly adjustable within the trade financing processes and enables to accurately determine the maximum value of rating and maximum amount of credit limit. The scale of credit rating used by the Agency analysts was elaborated as well by the agency itself for the purpose of estimation of creditworthiness, the level of financial stability, aptitude towards country risk, as well as nonpayment risk of a rated company. Like others worldwide credit rating agencies (the so-called ‚ÄòBig three credit rating agencies‚Äô - Standard & Poor's, Moody's Investor Service and Fitch Ratings), CredoLine uses the same internationally recognized letter designations such as A, B, C and D. {border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" align=\\"center\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"background:#efefef;\\"  Rating ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"background:#efefef;\\"  Description - !style=\\"text-align:center\\" crAAA Excellent creditworthiness and financial stability.

An American privateer captured a British letter of marque at the Spanish port of La Guaira in Venezuela. Battle On 10 December while on a commerce raiding cruise, the American schooner , of 16 guns and 140 men under Captain Charles Whiting Wooster anchored off La Guaira. After Wooster arrived the American consul warned Wooster that if he remained in port, the Spanish garrison would sink his ship with their shore batteries. The Americans withdrew out of range but remained off the city. That same day Saratoga captured a British schooner and sent her as a prize back to the United States. On the following morning as a heavy fog cleared, the Americans spotted an incoming brig. After the engagement it turned out that she was the letter of marque , originally commanded by Captain N. Dalmahoy (or Dalmarhoy), of 237 tons burthen, mounting fourteen long 9-pounders with a crew of thirty-six men. She had been at sea for 57 days. Dalmahoy had died two weeks before the battle so her first mate, named Alexander, was captain. Immediately after spotting the British, Saratoga sailed to intercept but it took two hours for her to close to firing range. The Spanish colonists expected the arrival of Rachel and so hundreds of the colonists rushed to the beaches to observe the engagement. When the range closed the two vessels began tacking towards land, Saratoga opened fire while off the port, firing her starboard bow gun. The British answered with shots from their port quarter guns until both ships were side by side. For over half an hour the two vessels dueled but the fighting ended when Rachels fire weakened. After volleys of small arms fire had driven the British sailors below decks, the Americans closed in and boarded. The British had two men killed, including Alexander, and two men wounded, one of whom died shortly thereafter; only two men from Saratoga were wounded. The next day, being short of water, Wooster released twenty-seven of the prisoners and sent them into La Guaira in a longboat. He kept four of the prisoners on Rachel and two on Saratoga. Aftermath The next day , under the command of Captain Thomas Fellowes, encountered Rachel and captured her, together with the 12-man prize crew of Americans. The British took the Americans on board Fawn and put a six-man prize crew on board Rachel, which they sent her into Jamaica, where the Vice admiralty court condemned her as a prize. Fawn went into La Guaira and picked up Rachels crew, all of whom agreed to serve on Fawn, though some apparently deserted shortly thereafter.1812 Privateers - accessed 19 December 2013.

The band ended in 2012 after the re-activation of Martin's former group The Tea Party in 2011. Biography Following the disbanding of his group The Tea Party in 2005, Canadian singer-songwriter Jeff Martin lived for sometime in Ireland before settling in Perth. In 2008 he formed The Armada, releasing a self-titled album. After this, Martin toured as a duo with Jay Cortez, formerly of Perth bands End of Fashion and The Sleepy Jackson and in 2010 the pair formed a new band with Sleepy Jackson drummer Malcolm Clark. \\"Perth is where I met two of the finest musicians in the country\\" said Martin. This group was dubbed \\"Jeff Martin 777\\", a name Martin derived from his interest in the works of Aleister Crowley, in this case his 777 and Other Qabalistic Writings. Work commenced on an album at Clark's Perth studios. During the year, Martin toured as a duo with DIG drummer Terepai Richmond while the album was mastered. In January 2011, the album's title track was released on Martin's MySpace page. The Ground Cries Out was released in Canada on 1 March 2011 and the band undertook a short Canadian tour. The album peaked at No. 51 on the Canadian Albums Chart. It was subsequently released in Australia in April, followed by a tour in May 2011.

This is one of the most massive heaps of Kladno area, which, particularly when viewed from the northeast, forms by far visible and noticeable part of the landscape in shape of a mesa. The heap is situated less than NE from the centre of the Kladno on right slope of shallow valley of the D≈ôetovick√Ω potok stream, in a place where borders of the three municipalities meet. Most of the heap (NE and central part) is based on cadastre of Stehelƒçeves. Southern part of it is on territory of Bu≈°tƒõhrad town.

How the central route will look when completed The Kunming‚ÄìSingapore railway, increasingly called the Pan-Asia railway Network is a network of railways, being planned or under construction, that would connect China, Singapore and all the countries of mainland Southeast Asia. The concept originated with British and French imperialists, who sought to link the railways they had built in southwest China, Indochina and Malaya, but international conflicts in the 20th century kept regional railways fragmented. The idea was formally revived in October 2006 when 18 Asian and Eurasian countries signed the Trans- Asian railway Network Agreement, which designates the Kunming‚ÄìSingapore railway as one of several planned trans-Asian railways. The proposed network consists of three main routes from Kunming, China to Bangkok, Thailand: the Eastern route via Vietnam and Cambodia; the central route via Laos, and the western route via Myanmar. The southern half of the network from Bangkok to Singapore has long been operational, though a high-speed line has been proposed. As of January 2014, construction of sections connecting China with Vietnam, China with Myanmar and Laos with Vietnam are under way. Work on sections in Laos began in December 2017 and is expected to be completed in 2021 with Chinese assistance. The railway network is expected to increase regional economic integration and increase China's economic ties with Southeast Asia. A high-speed rail project in Vietnam with Japanese support was canceled in 2010 due to high cost. However, it will be re-considered during 2019 communist party session, as Vietnam's economy is growing at much faster pace than anticipated.  History =Colonial railways The British and French Empires first proposed building a railway from Kunming to Singapore in 1900 as Russia was completing the Trans-Siberian railway. From 1904 to 1910, the French built the Yunnan‚ÄìVietnam railway, to connect Kunming with Hanoi and Haiphong in French Tonkin, now northern Vietnam. In 1918, the southern line of the Thailand railway system was connected with British Malaya's west coast line, completing a metre gauge rail link from Bangkok to Singapore. In the late-1930s, the British began to build the Yunnan‚ÄìBurma railway but abandoned the effort in 1941 with the outbreak of World War II. In 1936, Vietnam's main railway, from Hanoi to Saigon was completed. This French-built system was (and still is) metre-gauge. In 1942, the railways of Thailand and Cambodia were connected linking Bangkok and Phnom Penh, but this trans-border connection has long since fallen into disuse. The Japanese Empire built the infamous Thailand‚ÄìBurma railway using prisoners of war to connect Bangkok and Yangon, but the entire line never entered commercial operation and is now partially submerged by the reservoir behind the Vajiralongkorn Dam. A continuous metre- gauge rail line from Kunming to Singapore via Hanoi, Saigon, Phnom Penh, Bangkok, and Kuala Lumpur was not realized as the French never built the \\"missing link\\" between Phnom Penh and Saigon, choosing to build a highway instead. 21st century revival In 2000, ASEAN proposed completing the Kunming to Singapore railway, via Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon), Phnom Penh, and Bangkok. This route is now known as the eastern route. In 2004, ASEAN and China proposed the shorter western route, which instead of running east through Vietnam and Cambodia, would go west from Kunming to Myanmar and then to Bangkok. In 2007 ASEAN and China proposed building three routes, the Eastern, Western and a central route via Laos.

This line was jointly planned by Vietnam and Japan using Shinkansen bullet train technology and financed in part by Japanese official development assistance. The project was scheduled to be built in stages from 2011 to 2020. In June 2010, Vietnam's National Assembly rejected the plan due to high construction cost, reportedly equal to about 50 percent of the country's GDP. However, the project will be re-considered during 2019 Vietnam's National Assembly Session as Vietnam's economy is growing much faster, thus significantly decreasing the project's cost / GDP ratio. *In Laos **Savannakhet‚ÄìLao Bao railway, a , electrified double track, high-speed railway from Savannakhet in Savannakhet Province, on the Thai border, to Lao B·∫£o in Vietnam's Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province. The project costs US$4 billion and is being built by the Giant Consolidated of Malaysia. A ground breaking ceremony was held in Ban Naxai on December 18, 2013. This line will also be extended to the port city of Danang in Vietnam, and give landlocked Laos an outlet to the South China Sea. *In Cambodia **The Phnom Penh to Poipet railway, next to Aranyaprathet on the Thai border, was rebuilt and reopened on July 5, 2018. The original railway was destroyed in 1973 during the Cambodian Civil War. **The disconnected rail link from Phnom Penh to Ho Chi Minh City is being reconsidered. The cost for construction is estimated around US$600 million and the Chinese government will fund most proportion of construction. The Cambodian government will deal with the relocation of people who will be affected by the proposed new railway construction. The section from Phnom Penh to the Thai border Central route The central route including the Bangkok to Singapore section will be in length. A trip from Kunming to Singapore will take 30 hours in 2022, and 18 hours when completed in 2040. (compared to 80 hours from Vientiane to Singapore in January 2019). The line will be used to transport both passengers and cargo. The central route consists of the following sections: =In China= *Kunming‚ÄìYuxi railway, from Kunming to Yuxi (completed in 1993, upgraded in 2016). *Yuxi‚ÄìMohan railway, 503 km standard gauge railway from Yuxi to Mohan at the border with Laos (under planning). This line was originally planned to begin construction by the end of 2010, but has been delayed. Construction of a railway logistics hub in Mohan began in early 2011. Construction began in 2016 and schedule for completion in 2022 from Yuxi-Jinhong-Mohan. =In Laos= Map of Laos *Boten-Vientiane railway, standard gauge line from Boten in Luang Namtha Province on the border with China, to Thanaleng, on the border with Thailand. This section is to be opened in late 2021. This line was originally planned as a high-speed rail joint-venture between the Laotian government and the China Railway Corporation, the Chinese state rail operator, and set to begin construction on 25 April 2011 but was delayed due to a corruption scandal that removed the Chinese railway minister, Liu Zhijun from office. The Laotian government then became the sole investor in the project, which is funded with a loan from the Export-Import Bank of China that would cover 70 percent of the project's cost of US$7 billion. The project was downgraded to a conventional speed railway with a maximum speed of 160 km/h instead of 200 km/h. As the terrain in Laos is mountainous, 76 bridges and 154 tunnels will need to be built. Unexploded bombs that have been dropped during the Vietnam War will have to be removed. The loan finance arrangement for this line was criticized by economists in the West as too expensive for Laos. There is also controversy over villagers whose houses will be moved to accommodate the new railway line. One village, Bopiat in northern Laos, has already been moved once to allow the construction of a casino. The National Assembly of Laos approved the project in October 2012, but the construction has not commenced because the Chinese state lender has been waiting since July 2013 for the Thai legislature to approve funding for the Thailand section of the railway line. On 22 July 2014, China's Exim Bank suspended loans to Laotian infrastructure projects, leaving the rail project in jeopardy.\\"China's EximBank Suspends Loans For Roads, Bridges in Laos\\" Radio Free Asia 2014-07-22 On 28 July 2014, at a meeting with Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping in Beijing, Lao People's Revolutionary Party general secretary Choummaly Sayasone asked the Chinese government to continue its assistance of rail development in Laos.\\"Xi Jinping Holds Talks with Choummaly Saygnasone, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party (LPRP) and President of Laos\\" PRC Foreign Ministry 2014-07-28 In October 2014, Radio Free Asia reported that China had made a new pledge to finance the project as talks between the two countries continued.\\"China Gives New Pledge on Lao Rail Project\\" RFA 2014-10-06 In January 2016, Singapore's Straits Times reported that ground was broken on the project in December 2015. =In Thailand Existing  * Northeastern Line (Thailand), a metre gauge railway connecting Bangkok with Nong Khai.

Planning for these lines began during the administration of Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva of the Democratic Party, which agreed to borrow US$400 million from China to purchase materials and expertise, and build one high speed line to Nong Khai Province to the north and another to the Padang Basar on the Malaysian border to the south. When Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra of the Puea Thai Party took office in August 2011, the Thai government initially scaled back those plans and proposed shorter lines that connected Thai cities but did not reach international frontiers. Supoj Sablorm, the secretary of the Thai Ministry of Transport, explained that Thailand was not in a rush to build a high-speed rail line to Laos because the Chinese-backed project in Laos had been delayed to beyond 2014. A year later in August 2012, the Thai government announced the plans to build four high-speed rail lines, including extensions to Nong Khai and Hat Yai by 2022. In October 2013, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, on a visit to Thailand, promoted Chinese high-speed rail technology and offered loan packages for high-speed rail construction that are partially repayable with rice and rubber. On 19 November 2013, the Thai Senate passed a bill that authorized the government to borrow US$69.5 billion to fund high-speed rail and other infrastructure projects in Thailand without going through the annual government budgeting process. The opposition Democratic Party challenged the spending bill in court and a judge expressed doubt about the necessity of high-speed rail for Thailand. The ensuing political protests in Bangkok, which began in December 2013 and continued through May 2014, has paralyzed the Thai government and prevented further decision-making of the rail project. On 30 July 2014, Thai army chief General Prayut Chan-o-cha, whose forces seized control of the government through a bloodless coup in May, announced plans to build two high-speed rail lines as part of a 741.4 billion baht transportation program.Amornrat Mahitthirook, \\"High-speed train gets go ahead ‚Äì Two routes okayed in B741bn scheme\\" Bangkok Post 2014-07-30 The Nong Khai to Map Ta Phut line, in length, would run from the Laotian border at Thanaleng to the Gulf of Thailand. The Chiang Khong to Ban Phachi line, in length, would run from Chiang Rai near the northern tip of Thailand to Ayutthaya just north of Bangkok. The two lines would allow trains to travel at a top speed of 160 km/h. Construction is scheduled to begin in 2015 and is to be completed in 2021. In November 2014, after a meeting between Li Keqiang and Prayut Chan-o- cha, China agreed to lend Thailand funds to build dual-track standard gauge mid-speed railways on the Bangkok-Nong Khai, Bangkok-Map Ta Phut, and Kaeng Khoi‚ÄìMap Ta Phut routes.\\"Dual-track trains to get China loan. Beijing to be repaid in Thai rice and rubber.\\" Bangkok Post 2014-11-02 The loans could be repaid with rice and rubber. On 4 December 2014, the Thai National Legislative Assembly voted 187‚Äì0 with seven abstensions to approve loans for the Nong Khai-Map Ta Phut and Kaeng Khoi-Bangkok lines.\\"NLA OKs Thai-China rail deal\\" Bangkok Post 2014-12-04 China would undertake construction and development of the lines but would not receive land use rights along the routes. On 19 December 2014, the two countries signed a memorandum to build the railways.Patsara Jikkham & Chatrudee Theparat, \\"Prayut, Li strike railway accord PM to visit China for inking of 4 more deals.\\" Bangkok Post 2014-12-20 As of December 2015, China and Thailand have agreed to build the 845 km double-track rail routes connecting Bangkok-Kaeng Khoi-Nakhon Ratchasima-Khon Kaen-Udon Thani-Nong Khai and a second section connecting Kaeng Khoi-Map Ta Phut. The two parties have not yet reached agreement on financing for the project. In March 2020, the Thai government committed to a US$21 billion railway expansion plan that will include a high speed rail from China to Singapore through Bangkok via the Laotian border near Vientiane. Western route The western route consists of the following railway sections: =In China= Double-track construction of the Kunming to Guangtong section of the Chengdu‚ÄìKunming railway at Anning in 2012. *Chengdu‚ÄìKunming railway, from Kunming to Guangtong (completed in 1971) *Guangtong‚ÄìDali railway, from Guangtong to Dali (completed in 1998), and *Dali‚ÄìRuili railway, from Dali to Ruili on the border with Myanmar (under construction since 2011). =In Myanmar= Map of Myanmar *Kunming‚ÄìYangon high-speed railway (Myanmar section), from Muse in the Shan State on the border with China to Yangon with maximum train speeds of 170‚Äì200 km/h. The Kunming‚ÄìYangon high-speed railway forms a portion of the high-speed railway from Kunming to Rakhine State on the Bay of Bengal. In the summer of 2018, it seems plans are again on to complete the China-Myanmar railway. https://www.mmtimes.com/news/china-myanmar-high- speed-railway-quietly-back-track.html In late November 2010, Chinese state media reported that the railway would begin construction in about two months. But in March 2011, the Chinese Commerce Minister Chen Deming stated that the project was delayed due to the first elections in Myanmar in 20 years and differences in the railway gauge of the two countries. He explained the Chinese rail developers were waiting for the new cabinet in Myanmar to form and expressed hope that work on the line would begin before the end of 2011. On 18 July 2014, the Myanmar government cancelled the project, citing opposition from civil rights groups, villagers and the general public.\\"Stalled $20bn Arno Maierbrugger, \\"Myanmar railway project a setback for Asia-Mideast trade\\" Gulf Times 2014-07-28 *Yangon‚ÄìMyitkyina railway, from Yangon to Myitkyina, near the border with China (existing railway).

The railway could be reopened, he said, with international assistance and promote development in the region and peace with ethnic Shan and Karen rebels in the border areas. Malaysia to Singapore section The existing route uses the KTM ETS tracks from Padang Besar to KL Sentral and onwards to Woodlands Train Checkpoint, Singapore. The line from Padang Besar to Gemas was electrified and double tracked in 2015, and upgrade works from Gemas to Johor Bahru is expected to be completed in 2021, bringing down journey times from Woodlands North in Singapore to KL Sentral to 4 hours, via Bukit Chagar.https://www.thesundaily.my/archive/gemas-jb-electric-double-tracking- project-can-increase-development-renggam-maszlee-IUARCH586958 In 2013, the governments of Malaysia and Singapore agreed to build a high-speed rail line from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore that was scheduled to open in 2026. But shortly after winning the May 2018 election, the incoming Malaysian prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad said he would reconsider the project.https://www.ft.com/content/c7975d7c-6243-11e8-90c2-9563a0613e56 Among revisions being explored to reduce costs, was to align the route to the existing meter gauge Keretapi Tanah Melayu (KTM) line and lay a standard gauge track in parallel, with a fork running to Jurong East so that bilateral agreement is not violated, to allow trains running at 200 km/h, cutting journey time between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore to 130 minutes. Stations were planned for Kuala Lumpur, Bangi-Putrajaya, Labu (Seremban), Muar, Batu Pahat, Iskandar Puteri and Jurong East. The line is now expected to be completed by 2031.

CAI reports that as of 2010, it has overseen the building over 171 schools in the two countries. These schools reportedly provide education to over 64,000 children, including 54,000 girls, where few education opportunities existed before in the remote regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan.\\"Mortenson Campaigned to Build Schools in Asia\\" , ABC News, March 8, 2006.Worldview: The lesson jihadis fear most ‚Äì In the remote reaches of Pakistan, former mountain climber Greg Mortenson is besting extremists by building schools\\" , Philadelphia Inquirer, January 13, 2008. Summary Stones into Schools picks up where Three Cups of Tea left off in late 2003. Tracing the efforts of CAI to work in the northeast corner of Afghanistan, the book describes how the book's author and Sarfraz Khan worked to establish the first schools in the area. Mortenson and Khan's efforts were thwarted for a time when a devastating earthquake hit the Azad Kashmir region of Pakistan. CAI assisted with relief efforts in the region by setting up temporary tent schools and later build several earthquake-proof schools. After CAI's relief efforts were completed, the non- profit charity organization then opens schools in areas controlled by the Taliban and Mortenson assists the US military to formulate strategic plans in the region. Advice solicited by US Military in Afghanistan Due to attention paid to Mortenson's books first by their wives, US military leaders in Afghanistan have sought Mortenson's advice on how to work with the elders of local Afghan communities since 2007. Seeking his knowledge on dealing with Afghan elders, the military has also included Mortenson as an active participant in meetings between the elders and US military commanders. He has not, however, accepted any payment for his services, nor does he have any contractual or other formal relationship with the US military.\\"Unlikely Tutor Giving Military Afghan Advice\\" Criticism=Allegations On the April 17, 2011 broadcast of CBS News' 60 Minutes, correspondent Steve Kroft alleged inaccuracies in Stones into Schools and its prequel, Three Cups of Tea. In particular, CBS News disputed Mortenson's claim that he got lost near K2 and ended up in Korphe; that he was captured by the Taliban in 1996; whether the number of schools built and supported by CAI is accurate; and the propriety in the use of CAI funds for Mortenson's book tours. 60 Minutes asked Mortenson for an interview prior to their broadcast, but Mortenson did not respond to their requests. Jon Krakauer, a former financial supporter of CAI, has also questioned Mortenson's accounts separately and was interviewed for the 60 Minutes segment. The day after the broadcast, Krakauer released his allegations in a lengthy online article, Three Cups of Deceit - How Greg Mortenson, Humanitarian Hero, Lost His Way.http://byliner.com/ Link to Krakauer's online article, \\"Three Cups of Deceit ...\\" Mansur Khan Mahsudhe, a tribesmen Greg Mortenson describes as a kidnapper in Stones into Schools, states he is \\"looking into how to sue\\" Greg Mortenson for what he claims are lies about him.Pakistani wants to sue Mortenson Response to allegations In response to the allegations made against him and his books, Mortenson wrote a statement that was published in the Bozeman Chronicle: \\"I stand by the information conveyed in my book, and by the value of CAI's work in empowering local communities to build and operate schools that have educated more than 60,000 students.\\" Mortenson further stated, \\"The time about our final days on K2 and ongoing journey to Korphe village and Skardu is a compressed version of events that took place in the fall of 1993...\\" Scott Darsney, a respected mountaineer and friend of Greg Mortenson, wrote an email subsequently turned into an exclusive article for Outside magazine's online version as a response to the allegations against Mortenson. Scott Darnsey Outside Magazine exclusive Darnsey questioned the accuracy and fairness of both the Krakauer piece and the 60 Minutes report. Darnsey had been interviewed by Krakauer, and maintained that Krakauer either misquoted or misunderstood what he said. As a response to Krakauer's allegations, CAI produced a comprehensive list of projects completed over a period of years and projects CAI is currently working on.

It was the world's largest intelligence headquarters from 1959 until 2019 when it was surpassed by Germany's BND headquarters. Name Before its current name, the CIA headquarters was formally unnamed. On April 26, 1999, the complex was officially named in the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 for George H. W.

History The Original Headquarters Building was designed by the New York firm Harrison & Abramovitz in the 1950s and contains of floor space. The ground was broken for construction on November 3, 1959, with President Dwight Eisenhower laying the cornerstone, and the building was completed in March 1961.

King Robert the Bruce gave the 'L-plan' castle to the Boyds of Kilmarnock for services rendered at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, as revealed in an undated charter in the Register of the Great Seal, stating that King Robert I granted the 'lands of Trebach' in Kyle-Regis to Robert Boyd.

The walls are 2.5m thick, with a height around 3.0m, constructed of massive rubble masonry, 9.0m long on the north- western section and 12.5m long on the south-western section. No window or door openings are visible. A broad natural ditch is visible on the western side and the shallow curvilinear ditch on the south side may have been part of the castle defences.RCAHMS Retrieved : 2011-04-26 Some finds were held by the proprietor of Trabboch Farm.

Sotelo began his musical studies as a self-taught player of the guitar, and later at the Real Conservatorio de M√∫sica de Madrid. In 1979 he moved to Vienna to study at the University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna. Four years later, after finishing his course with Dieter Kaufmann, among others, he was admitted in the Chair of Composition commanded by Francis Burt ‚Äì Sotelo dedicated to him the piece De Vinculis: Ge-Burt. A Francis Burt (2001) for violin ‚Äì and, decisively for him, in Roman Haubenstock-Ramati's seminars, to conclude this academic period in 1987, being awarded the Prize of Honour for graduate studies. During his time in Wien (1979‚Äì1992) Sotelo works, created (‚Ä¶et l'avare silence (1988), among others) and participates, together with Beat Furrer, in the creation of the Societ√© de l'Art acoustique, later known as Klangforum Wien. This group has to be considered a sort of \\"fetish\\" ensemble to Sotelo for two reasons: first, the personal relationship with Furrer and the musicians; second, the close and continuous work with them to create many pieces, from the Trio Basso ‚Äì a R.H.R. (1988‚Äì89) to Klangmuro... I (2009) for flute, double bass and ensemble. In Vienna he also studied electroacoustic music with Dieter Kaufmann and conducting with Karl √ñsterreicher. Also at this time, Sotelo came into contact with Luigi Nono, a composer who exercised a lively influence in his musical thought, today even stronger than in those years. He also met the poet Jos√© √Ångel Valente (Orense 1929 ‚Äì Geneva 2000) ‚Äì an unavoidable figure to comprehend Sotelo's catalogueMauricio Sotelo's works at www.mauriciosotelo.com.. Retrieved 11 September 2014 between 1994 and 2000‚Äîat the end of the eighties. Already in Spain, after the successful premi√®re of Tenebr√¶ Responsoria in the XXXII Semana de M√∫sica Religiosa de Cuenca (1993) with the cantaor Enrique Morente, Sotelo began an important teaching activity. As invited professor, he participated in the Aula de M√∫sica at the University of Alcal√° de Henares (1993‚Äì1995), in the composition seminar at Columbia University in New York (1996), in the Summer Courses of Composition at the International Festival √ìrgano de Le√≥n ‚Äì widely known as Cursos in Villafranca del Bierzo ‚Äì and, more recently, in the Seminar of Composition Casa da Musica in Oporto (2002), the Chair Manuel de Falla in C√°diz (2007) and the Course of Composition at the Conservatorio Superior de M√∫sica in C√≥rdoba (2009). From the turn to the 21st century, Sotelo consolidated his career in contemporary music, being institutionally recognized and finishing many main pieces like the cycle Wall of Light (2003‚Äì2007) ‚Äì devoted to the figure of Sean Scully ‚Äì Sonetos del amor oscuro. Cripta sonora para Luigi Nono (2003‚Äì2005) and Muerte sin fin (2010), among others. Mauricio Sotelo has been awarded numerous prizes including the Composition Prize by the Joven Orquesta Nacional de Espa√±a (1986), by the Sociedad General de Autores y Editores (1989) and by the WDR Forum Junger Komponisten (1992), the Ernst von Siemens Composer's Prize (1997), the Queen Sofia Prize of Composition (2000) and the Spanish National Music Prize (2001). He was composer in residence at the Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin (2011‚Äì2012) ‚Äì where he had met the composer Luigi Nono at the end of the eighties. He lives in Berlin and works today as a Professor of Composition at the Escola Superior de M√∫sica de Catalunya in Barcelona. Creation The leading influence on Sotelo's work is, with any doubt, the presence in his musical thought of the Venetian composer Luigi Nono. Sotelo devotes several pieces like Nel suono indicibile ‚Äì a Luigi Nono (1989‚Äì1990), Due voci‚Ä¶ come un soffio dall'estrema lontananza (1990‚Äì1991) where he uses texts from Massimo Cacciari ‚Äì a philosopher deeply close to Nono ‚Äì Frammenti de l'infinito. Lorca-Nono. Di√°logo del amargo (1998), where the poetic figure of Federico Garc√≠a Lorca appears ‚Äì also used by Nono in Epitaffi per Federico Garcia Lorca I‚ÄìIII (1951‚Äì1953) and the ballet Der rote Mantel (1955) ‚Äì or Cripta. M√∫sica para Luigi Nono (2009). This biographic and musical affinity with the Italian artist producest several branches in Sotelo's composition: architecture of memory, oral tradition, act of performing, sound, Andalousian cante jondo. The attraction and analysis of all these concepts led Sotelo to a deep connection with Flamenco in all its forms: cante, guitar, percussion and baile. Jos√© √Ångel Valente Also at the end of his years in Vienna, but materialized after his return to Spain in 1992, the composer came into contact with the poet Jos√© √Ångel Valente, another of the key figures in Sotelo's creation. Currently, as imbued by Valente's poetry, Sotelo writes pieces like Memoriae. Escritura interna sobre un espacio po√©tico de Jos√© √Ångel Valente (1994) ‚Äì a key work in his career ‚Äì Nadie (1995‚Äì97), Epitafio (1997), In pace (1997), Si despu√©s de morir... In memoriam Jos√© √Ångel Valente (2000), El rayo de tiniebla (2008), Arde el alba (2008‚Äì2009) and Muros de dolor ... V: Jos√© √Ångel Valente ‚Äì Memoria sonora (2009). Federico Garc√≠a Lorca The figure of Federico Garc√≠a Lorca also appears in Sotelo's music in 1998, for the first time, when he finishes the pieces Canta la luz herida por el hielo. Homenaje a Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, Frammenti de l'infinito. Lorca-Nono, Di√°logo del amargo and Interludien zu Lorcas 'Canciones Populares'. From that year, Lorca's lyrics arise in Sotelo's catalogue till today because of two reasons: on one side, a shared attraction for Flamenco ‚Äì also a very inspiring music for the poet ‚Äì and, on the other, the enchantment that Lorca's poems have caused in Luigi Nono's music already in the fifties. This seduction for the lorquian world is again reinforced in Sotelo's creative life since 2012, when he's invited to create a new opera: El p√∫blico ‚Äì commissioned by Gerard Mortier for the Teatro Real ‚Äì in a prologue and five scenes, with a libretto by Andr√©s Ib√°√±ez, after the text by Lorca published around 1930, performed for the first time in Puerto Rico in 1979 and seven years later in Spain. This opera was to have been premiered in the winter of 2015 at the Teatro Real in Madrid. Sean Scully As with Valente, the composer finds a closely similar thought in the abstract paintings by the Irish-born American painter Sean Scully (Dublin, 1945). Sotelo meets him in 1997 in Seville, in the II International Festival of Arts Sibila. Sotelo is largely interested in '... the process of its creation, It is certainly the clarity of the composition through which the light is liberated from material bonds and which can come to light as oscillations of air, and respectively ultimately as music' Mauricio Sotelo, Wall of light. Music for Sean Scully, Wien, Kairos, 2008, p. 23 As the composer thinks, one of the most interesting series made by the painter is the Wall of light cycle, officially launched in 1998, with Wall of light Pink, yet whose leading beginning can be located fourteen years earlier with Wall of light 4.84 (1984). The cycle runs until today so this is a main Project in Scully's career. Sotelo has created his own cycle of compositions devoted, at least in his conceptual aim, to Scully's work. Between 2003 and 2007, he wrote Chalan ‚Äì Wall of light earth (2003), Wall of light red ‚Äì f√ºr Beat Furrer (2003‚Äì2004), Sonetos del amor oscuro. Cripta Sonora para Luigi Nono (2005) ‚Äìwith Scully's paintings projected in the background as we shall see‚Äì, Wall of light sky (2005‚Äì2006), Wall of light black ‚Äì for Sean Scully (2005‚Äì2006) and Night (2007). What should be underlined is that we do not talk about a mere translation of art into music but a deep and complex contact between the artistic and musical disciplines. It's possible to check this from the own Sotelo's words: > ...two essential characteristics of the painting of Sean Scully, which (‚Ä¶) > are fully in accordance with my concept of sound: the formal aspect and the > oscillations of color (‚Ä¶). In Scully's pictures the many overlapping layers > of color create a deep vibrating space (‚Ä¶). In a certain sense, the flare of > color of the various strongly luminescent layers creates a kind of > 'dance'Sotelo, Wall of light..., op. cit., p. 22 All these poetic and artistic influences have to be understood as a√¶thetic keys to analyze the way in which Sotelo sees his own process of composition, but also as conceptual, textual and visual references to have in our minds when listening his music. They also take part of the score, even if they are not written in it. Sotelo and flamenco Since 1993, Mauricio Sotelo has written a great number of pieces in which the Flamenco gets a strong presence. But why? We shall propose two answers. The first has to do with the guitar itself. When he was a child, the composer chooses this instrument to begin his musical studies. As he will say many years later, the guitar is closely linked to Flamenco with all its symbolic and artistic imaginary. Since then, Sotelo shows a deep knowledge of it and devotes it a great attention but always looking for his own way to use it, maybe not too obvious at the beginning of his career ‚Äìas we see in pieces like Sole√° or Buler√≠a (1984)‚Äì but well defined most recently in Como llora el viento (2007), a work for guitar and orchestra. The second has to do with Flamenco as a way of thinking and creating music that embodies all Sotelo's compositional questions. The matter was, therefore, to go beyond the topic, to erase the boundaries and to hold a musical land where it could be possible to create a new kind of tradition, a new form of contemporary Flamenco. Sotelo quickly understood that the cante was the key to open a wide door in Flamenco music, not only because of its aesthetic and artistic qualities but also of its technical and strictly music attributes. And the composer found them in Enrique Morente's singing. As an experienced and wise cantaor, Morente came to Sotelo's life in 1993 to participate in the premiere of Tenebrae Responsoria. Two years later, both artists work together in the piece Expulsi√≥n de la bestia triunfante (1995), premiered in the International Festival of Arts Sibila in Seville (1996). After that, Sotelo has relied on the Flamenco singers Eva Dur√°n and Marina Heredia (to the opera De Amore. Una maschera di cenere, 1996‚Äì99), Carmen Linares (In pace, 1997), Esperanza Fern√°ndez (Nadie, 1995‚Äì1997), Miguel Poveda (Sonetos del amor oscuro, 2003‚Äì2005) and Francisco Jos√© Arc√°ngel Ramos 'Arc√°ngel'. With him, Sotelo has created the most of his recent pieces, from Si despu√©s de morir‚Ä¶, In memoriam Jos√© √Ångel Valente (2000) to Muerte sin fin‚Ä¶ comentario, a la memoria de Enrique Morente (2011), among others. From the turn to the 21st century, Sotelo is immersed in a deep research into de timbric qualities of the cante flamenco and, specifically, that of Enrique Morente's. Being helped by the composer Fernando Villanueva (Ciudad Real, 1976) and using programmes like AudioSculpt or Sonogram, the composer has managed to extract the cante's whole physical spectrum. From this huge source of material, Sotelo establish a sound palette to create every piece. This kind of creative method has led to Sotelo's music being dubbed 'spectral Flamenco', in a sort of adaptation of the French Spectral Music. Sotelo has recently begun to introduce a flamenco female dancer in his pieces. Maybe not the first in his catalogue but the most relevant pieces with bailaora are: Muerte sin fin (2010) with cantaor and ensemble, Muerte sin fin... comentario, a la memoria de Enrique Morente, with reciter, cantaor, ensemble and electronics (2011) and Luz sobre lienzo (2011) with violin, percussion and electronics. Here, Sotelo's efforts are directed to create not only a conversation or a dialogue, but a new idiom, a contemporary understanding of what flamenco has to be today. It's obvious that the baile has a strong presence. In this sense, Luz sobre lienzo has to be seen maybe a main example. Only four elements: violin (truth), bailaora (history), caj√≥n (time) and live electronics (light) ‚Äìaccording with the programmatic reference to Goya's painting of 1812‚Äì show a more minimal work, with an intense and vivid co-participation between the Moldavian violinist Patricia Kopatchinskaja and Fuenstana 'la Moneta', who premiered this piece in Madrid. Sotelo also calls for the 'comp√°s' through the use of a specific rhythm or tempo in the most of his pieces from the middles nineties, even if there's no other reference to any other form of flamenco ‚Äìtitle, instruments, performers or poetic allusion-. Here we find how the composer has absorbed the deep conscience of what this tradition has to mean to the musician: after the years of study and the hours spent in developing the technique, flamenco ‚Äìand also any kind of music or art‚Äì is a sort of inner language in which memory and experience are re-invented. The composer, in this case, is meant to make the occasion to happen, that is, to create, through the score and above all through a close work with the musicians, a new artistic milieu. Alterflamenco In Sotelo's hands, flamenco is no longer an exotic musical style linked to the conventional topics of the Spanish touristic image or a bourgeois approach of a strictly academic composer. Flamenco is today, with his work, an art that can be naturally integrated in the avant-garde expressions of contemporary art and music. Many other artists have felt the attractive power of flamenco sound or, by extension, of other music traditions rooted in the memory of a specific culture. From Manuel de Falla and B√©la Bart√≥k to Klaus Huber and Toshio Hosokawa, from the music Nationalism to the postmodernist artists, we could find many examples of stylized ways to insert oral traditional musics into academic catalogues. But, which of these composers would identify himself with a popular tradition with any nationalist aim? Sotelo asserts: \\"I am a composer, but above all, I am a Flamenco. Here we'll have a great sound architecture with its well sinked columns in the Flamenco roots\\". To arrive to this 'manifesto', Sotelo changed his own artistic identity. After the years in Wien and the academic studies, after the art and poetry influence and his recent spectrum researches, he acts, finally, like a 'cultural nomad', as Nicolas Bourriaud has defined the artist's role in the altermodernityNicolas Bourriaud, Altermodern, Tate Triennial, Londres, Tate Publishing, 2009, p. 13 of today. That's why we shall define Sotelo's music as a new form of tradition, a kind of 'alterflamenco', taking the prefix 'alter' as the sign of \\"an art-form exploring all dimensions of the present, tracing lines in all directions of time and space\\" ‚Äìin Bourriaud's words‚Äì.

It is the only Carnegie Library in northwestern California still functioning as a Public Library. Early history The first free reading room in Ferndale opened 3 February 1896 on the ground floor of the Gilt Edge Building with books from the old town library and the Chapin library. The Ferndale Enterprise newspaper reported the hours of operation and added that \\"Smoking, loud talking, spitting on the floor, etc. will be strictly prohibited by the management,\\" but by 12 February 1897 the reading room closed for lack of support. November 30, 1904 a free public library reading room was set up in the Paine building at the corner of Main and Washington streets. Two years later, on 18 April 1906, Ferndale was struck by the Great San Francisco earthquake. The Ferndale Enterprise reported that the Paine building was \\"twisted and the plate glass windows were demolished.\\" The Gilt Edge building where the old reading room had been was so completely ruined by the earthquake that it had to be demolished in 1908. The Carnegie Library The city council corresponded with James Bertram, an assistant of Andrew Carnegie in 1908 to obtain the Carnegie Foundation Grant for $8,000 which was equal to ten times the amount the town would contribute per year to support it. Architect Warren Skellings of Eureka, California, designed a one-story reinforced concrete building in Classical Revival style to fit on a 40 foot by 40 foot area, deeded to the town of Ferndale by Adam Putnam, and according to the deed of transfer \\"if not so used, then to revert to the grantor.\\" Construction was awarded to Ackerman and Ackerman of Eureka for $7,775.40 on April 12, 1909. Furnishings were extra so the city of Ferndale agreed to loan the extra money. The Paine building was leased by a showman for a movie theater, and in May 1909 the library temporarily moved into the Brelle Building, at Main and Shaw opposite the Knights of Pythias Castle, until the new library building was ready. On 29 October 1909, a 6.0 magnitude earthquake centered a few miles southeast of town broke the large glass panes in the front of the Brelle building. As new building neared completion, citizens questioned why the building bore the label \\"Ferndale Library\\" instead of \\"Carnegie Library\\". The Ferndale Enterprise of 5 November 1909 explained that it was \\"the express wish of Mr. Carnegie that his name should be omitted. Some of the first of the library buildings made possible by his generosity bore his name, but on later ones this has been left off by his desire,\\" and added that an \\"unostentatious\\" tablet would be placed inside the building with a hope \\"that gentleman will perhaps not object to our people commemorating his name.\\" Construction dragged on while a wood-burning furnace and electrical fittings were shipped and installed; the city council became concerned because they were also paying for the rental on the temporary facility at the Brelle Building, but on 15 March 1910 new the library building was accepted as ready for occupancy. The library formally opened 2 April 1910. By 1911 the Ferndale Village Club ladies had begun to plant the grounds and installed cement walkways, but a neighbor's cattle kept escaping onto the library grounds and eating the plantings. In 1912, cattle-proof concrete walls were built and library trustees were able to repay the town the $264.40 loaned during construction. In a sign of increasing regionalisation in Humboldt County, the Ferndale Library became a branch of the Humboldt County Library System in 1915. The building has been continually maintained. An updated furnace was added in 1926 and, in 1977, a rear addition enlarged the original building to include a children's room, a bathroom and storage, but the style and original furnishings were retained. The Eureka and Ferndale Public Libraries were the only two Carnegie Grant libraries in northwestern California, but only the Ferndale Library is still functioning as a public library with original bookcases and furniture.

Rugby career Bradshaw first played rugby at club level for his home town team of Cefn Cribwr RFC. He later played for Tondu before switching to first-class team Bridgend. Bradshaw was first selected to represent Wales in the opening encounter of the 1964 Five Nations Championship, played against England at Twickenham. Bradshaw was paired at centre with Llanelli's Ken Jones, in a game that ended in a 6-6 draw. Bradshaw retained his place for the rest of the 1964 tournament, and in his second game, a home fixture with Scotland, he scored his first international points for Wales with a try, a conversion and a penalty goal, in a convincing win. He was on the score sheet for the next match, when away against Ireland he successfully converted all three Welsh tries. Wales won 15-6. The last game of the 1964 Championship was a home match against France, but their form shown against the Home Nations left the team, and they struggled to keep up with a poor French team. At one point France were eight points in front, and only some fine place-kicking from Bradshaw (with a conversion and two penalties) allowed the team to snatch a draw.Griffiths (1987) p.4:35 In May 1964, Bradshaw was chosen as part of the Welsh squad to tour Africa, the first team from Wales to play outside Europe. Bradshaw was given kicking duties, scoring four conversions and a penalty against East Africa and then, in the only Test of the tour, he scored the only Welsh points, with a single penalty, in a humiliating 24-3 loss against South Africa. In the 1964/65 season Bradshaw was made captain of the senior Bridgend team.Jenkins (1991) p.26 Bradshaw failed to play for Wales in the 1965 Championship, but the next year he played in all four games of the 1966 tournament. Wales beat England and Scotland, Bradshaw scoring a conversion in the Scottish encounter. Despite scoring a penalty goal for Wales in the Ireland game, the Welsh team were beaten 6-9, leaving the team needing a win over France to secure the Championship title. The France encounter was an exciting contest filled with incident.Griffiths (1987) p.4:36 Bradshaw kicked two penalties to bring Wales back into the game after France built up an eight-point lead in the first 12 minutes; then Stuart Watkins intercepted a French pass in their own 25, completing a 70-yard run to score the winning try. Wales took the match and the Championship. This was Bradshaw's final international game. Personal history Bradshaw was born in Cefn Cribwr in 1939, and was educated at Ogmore Grammar School. He was employed as a draughtsman for the National Coal Board, before becoming a schoolmaster. His son, Chris, also played rugby, for Bridgend and Swansea and was named the 'Bill Everson Man of the Tournament' in the 1991 Snelling Sevens competition.

Much of his work was drawn, although he produced the occasional watercolour or oil painting. His drawings were used on a regular basis by engravers. A major work, the Views of the seats, Mansions, Castles, etc. of Noblemen and Gentlemen in England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland was published in 6 volumes between 1819-23.  Biography  Neale's earliest works were drawings of insects. While in search of specimens in Hornsey Wood in the spring of 1796, Neale met John Varley the water-colour painter. Together they projected a work to be entitled The Picturesque Cabinet of Nature, for which Varley was to make the landscape drawings, and Neale was to etch and colour the plates. No. 1 was published on 1 September 1796, but no more appeared. Neale was a clerk in the General Post Office, but eventually resigned his appointment to devote his time to art. Neale died at Tattingstone, near Ipswich, aged 67, on 14 November 1847.  Works  Neale's drawing of Ashburnham Place, Sussex (1828) Melford church interior In 1797 Neale exhibited at the Royal Academy two drawings of insects, and sent others in 1799, 1801, and 1803. In 1804 he sent to the Royal Academy a drawing of the Custom House, Dover, and continued to exhibit topographical drawings and landscapes until 1844. He contributed also to the exhibitions of the Society of Painters in Oil and Water Colours in 1817 and 1818, and from time to time to those of the British Institution and of the Society of British Artists. Some of his works were in oil-colours; but he is best known for his architectural drawings, which are executed in pen and tinted with water- colours. In 1816 he began the publication of the History and Antiquities of the Abbey Church of St Peter, Westminster which was completed in 1823, in two quarto volumes, with descriptive text by Edward Wedlake Brayley. He next began, in 1818, his Views of the Seats of Noblemen and Gentlemen in England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, of which the first series, in six volumes, was completed in 1824. The second series, in five volumes, was published between 1824 and 1829, and the entire work comprised 732 plates. He also in 1824‚Äì5 undertook, in collaboration with John Le Keux, the engraver, the publication of Views of the most interesting Collegiate and Parochial Churches in Great Britain, but the work was discontinued after the issue of the second volume. Besides these works he published Six Views of Blenheim, Oxfordshire, (1823); Graphical Illustrations of Fonthill Abbey, (1824); and An Account of the Deep- Dene in Surrey, the seat of Thomas Hope, Esq., (1826).

It was established in 1938 and provided volunteers with training in first aid and other skills which were seen as being relevant to Australia's war effort. Following the outbreak of the Pacific War members of the organisation were attached to the US military units in Australia as transport drivers and clerks. They also undertook mine watching and other tasks. The organisation ceased to exist in or about 1947. History The WNEL was formed in September 1938 at a meeting in Brisbane chaired by Helen Ryan, who continued as the organisation's leader during the war. At this meeting it was agreed that the WNEL would consist of a number of groups which would provide women with training in first aid, truck driving and other fields. The WNEL was not part of the Australian military, but cooperated with the Department of Defence. In January 1939 the Sydney Morning Herald reported that the WNEL accepted only women of British ancestry as members. At this time Dame Enid Lyons was the patron of the Legion and its advisory committee included the Premier of Queensland, Forgan Smith, and the Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Alfred James Jones. The WNEL was also affiliated with the National Council of Women. In March 1939 Ryan claimed that 1000 women were taking part in weekly training sessions run by the Legion. At this time the WNEL's first aid and home nursing unit had been divided into six sections and its transport unit was organised into several companies. The Legion adopted a system of military ranks under which new recruits were designated privates, members in charge of a training function were lieutenants and the woman in charge of a branch had the title of 'commandant'.Johansen (2002), pp. 91‚Äì92 From January 1939 the WNEL included an air wing which provided training in aircraft maintenance at Archerfield Aerodrome. This wing was led by Mary Bell, who was among Australia's first female pilots as well as the first Australian woman to qualify as a ground engineer. During July, Bell and the other members of the air wing left the Legion as they believed that the organisation would not help them to meet their objective to serve as aircraft maintainers during wartime; on the 17th of the month they formed the Women's Air Training Corps (WATC), and elected Bell its commander.Thomson (1991), pp. 27, 38‚Äì39 A member of the WNEL who was attached to the US Army as a driver during 1942 By April 1940 the WNEL had 51 branches in rural areas of Queensland as well as a large branch in Brisbane. As at May that year, the Legion was organised into a first aid and home nursing auxiliary, a transport division (which included horse and mechanised transport units) a land workers' section, a communication unit, despatch riders, a cooking unit and the air wing section. By July 1940 there were six different organisations training women for war work in the Brisbane region. Ryan and the members of the other organisations rejected a proposal made by The Courier-Mail that the six organisations be combined, however. At this time the WNEL had 4,000 members, of whom 1,600 were located in Brisbane, and included a transport section and an air unit. It also provided training in first aid, field cooking, physical fitness and radio communications. At about this time the WNEL also became affiliated with the British First Aid Nursing Yeomanry. The WNEL and other war-related women's organisations prominently participated in the 1941 Brisbane Exhibition. In late 1941 General Thomas Blamey, the commander of the Australian Imperial Force, stated that Australian women should prepare to work in the national economy rather than train to be dispatch riders or signalers. In response, Ryan argued that \\"The whole situation will be changed if the enemy attacks our shores. Then women would have to be utilised in many more ways than seems likely at present. So we'll go on training\\". Some members of the WNEL took a more active role in the war following the outbreak of the Pacific War. From March 1942 WNEL volunteers watched for naval mines in the Brisbane River under the command of the Royal Australian Navy. Members of the Legion also participated in the Volunteer Air Observers Corps. By 1943 the WNEL included a Motor Transport Corps and clerical staff assigned to help United States military units in Australia. Women who volunteered for these roles could choose to not be posted outside of their home area. At this time the WNEL's headquarters was located in Adelaide Street, Brisbane. Later in the war WNEL members also served as drivers for Dutch and British military personnel in Queensland. WNEL drivers were paid between ¬£5 and ¬£10 per week. In May 1946 Ryan told a Courier Mail journalist that the WNEL would continue to operate, though a decision had not been made on what its functions would be. The WNEL was active as late as October 1947. Ryan was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in June 1955 for founding and leading the WNEL during World War II.

Background/overview Mass interest in the issue of peer victimization arose during the 1990s due to media coverage of student suicides, peer beatings, and school shootings, notably the tragedy in Columbine, Colorado. Pdf. This led to an explosion of research attempting to assess bully-victim relationships and related players, what leads victims to experience negative outcomes and how widespread this problem was. Studies of peer victimization have also been conducted in the context of research investigating childhood relationships in general and how they are associated with school adjustment and achievement. Research has proven the problematic nature of peer victimization, identifying many negative outcomes such as low self-esteem, low school engagement, school avoidance, lower school achievement, learned helplessness, and depression. Peer victimization is especially prevalent and damaging in middle school, as during this time children are defining themselves by creating self-schemas and establishing self-esteem, both which will impact their future adult life; for this reason, most of the research on peer victimization focuses on this age group. They are also more vulnerable to peer rejection because needs for belonging and intimacy may be especially strong during early adolescence, when children are working to solidify their peer groups. Retrieved from www.csa.com. Much of victimization research adopts a social psychology perspective, investigating how different types of peer victimization affect the individual and the different negative outcomes that occur. Some experimenters are adopting the term social victimization in order to acknowledge that victimization can take both verbal and nonverbal forms or be direct or indirect. They mostly focus on the types of victimization that can occur from multiple sources in a particular environment. Personality psychologists look at individual differences and effects in victims. They may also study individuals in a social context, determining which are more likely to be victimized, such as those who are socially withdrawn. With the development of technology and the widespread access it gives to children and teenagers, peer victimization has become more prevalent through the Internet and cell phones than in years past. This form of victimization called cyberbullying has a potential for a much wider audience than traditional face-to-face victimization. It is also easier to hide from parents and teachers. Studies have found that because this form of victimization is done through the anonymity of the Internet or text messaging, bullies feel more comfortable being crueler to the victim. Without face-to-face communication, social standards become less important and behavior becomes less inhibited. Major theoretical approaches=Operational definitions Originally, researchers focused on overt forms of victimization, which were categorized as either physical or verbal. Later, researchers such as Nicki R. Crick argued for the existence of a more covert form of victimization which she observed primarily among females that she called relational victimization, during which a child's social relationships and social standing are attacked via methods such as peer exclusion. Lecture conducted from Vanderbilt University, Nashville. Today, victimization is largely operationally defined as either covert/relational victimization or overt/physical victimization, in which a child is threatened with or dealt corporeal damage. Research approaches and theories The study of peer victimization draws from two major strands of research as identified by Seely, Tombari, Bennett & Dunkle (2009) called the \\"bullying strand\\" and the \\"peer relationship strand.\\" The victimization aspect of the \\"bullying strand\\" focuses on what leads victims to disengage from school and suffer from damaging negative outcomes while others adjust. The peer relationship strand is more quantitatively oriented, studying fundamental factors related to peer victimization and the negative outcomes, paying special attention to what factors mediate the relationship between them. Interest in peer victimization in psychological research has been fairly recent, and therefore it appears that most researchers have drawn from other areas of study and contemporary applied theories to the context of peer victimization. The areas of the bullying strand that specifically pertain to peer victimization are studies of victimization prevalence, victims‚Äô home environment, and effects of victimization in schools . Researchers started by determining the prevalence of peer victimization believing this would allow for the comparison of the problem over time, populations and after interventions. Prevalence research has been conducted in many different countries, cultures and classroom contexts. Studies utilize a variety of different methods such as self-report questionnaires, peer nominations, and teacher nominations have been used. Unfortunately, results show that in many contexts, the percentage of children that are victimized have fallen in a range between 5-90% Bullying strand research also focuses on the type of families that those who are victimized come from and what types of parenting styles they experienced Finally, a limited number of studies today focus on impacts of being bullied in a school setting and how it relates to achievement, truancy, and drop-out. Studies examining peer victimization have also been conducted in the context of a body of research interested in peer relationships and how they affect educational performance and adjustment; this is identified as the \\"peer relationship strand.\\" In the 1970s and 1980s, Steven Asher identified one form of a relationship‚Äîpeer victimization‚Äîas a predictor of educational maladjustment. Later, a new perspective formed that considered peer victimization as a type of relationship existing on a continuum of relationship roles from healthy relations to detrimental ones instead of focusing on specific bully-victim relationships. Experimenters have also been interested in how early victimization effects individuals over time, focusing on school-related outcomes. Studies have largely worked to identify underlying factors that mediate negative outcomes. To account for difference in the severity of negative outcomes as a result of peer victimization, researchers have utilized theories of implicit peer relationships. In order to understand the social world, individuals create implicit theories about their social interactions Pdf. Pdf. A major determinant of how a person handles social evaluation is the degree to which they ascribe entity theories of personality, believing it their attributes are stable and unalterable or incremental theories of personality, viewing attributes as pliable able to be augmented Those who adopt entity theories of personality often pursue performance oriented goals, seeking to accrue positive and avoid negative evaluations of their competence. Since they view their attributes as constant, it is vital that they are desirable in order for them to maintain a positive self-image. People who hold incremental theories of personality endeavor towards mastery-oriented goals, focusing on learning and cultivating competence since as they believe their attributes are malleable. Accordingly, they should feel less threatened by others‚Äô evaluations of their competence. When thinking about self-evaluation, implicit theories should affect the degree to which children base their self appraisals on peer judgements, determining whether negative social interactions undermine their well-being. In regards to behavioral reactions to victimization, research has identified two categories of characteristic responses. One contains externalizing behaviors such as aggression, disruptive, antisocial, and acting out behaviors (Achenbach, 1966). Another constitutes internalizing behaviors like inhibited, anxious, or heightened withdrawal. Hawker and Boulton (2001) have used the rank theory of depression to explain the relationship between forms of victimization and types of maladjustment. According to the rank theory, internalizing problems such as depression are linked to a sense of powerlessness and of not belonging. Those who are physically victimized suffer from low resource-holding potential, which works in part to delineate social power in peer groups, while relational victimization directly affects children's sense of belonging instead. In addition, according to social rank theory, jeopardization of one's feeling of belonging stemming from relational victimization should play a greater part in perpetuating depression than that of resource-holding potential as in physical victimization. Therefore, depression should correlate more strongly with relational victimization as opposed to physical victimization. Currently, researchers have become interested in the direction of the relationship between peer victimization and psychosocial adjustment. Many believe that the relation acts in a single direction: either peer victimization leads to maladjustment, or the relationship is reversed Some argue that the relationship is bidirectional and causal relationship. As studies on the topic have generally utilized, cross-sectional research designs, a definitive answer has not been reached. Empirical findings A study by Cole, Maxwell, Dukewich & Yosick examined how physical and relational Targeted Peer Victimization (TPV) victimization were related and measured their effects on different types of positive and negative cognitions. It was hypothesized that the link between peer victimization and depression was mediated by the creation of negative self-schemas. The study found gender differences in victimization, as Relational TPV was more common for girls and physical TPV was more common for boys. Also, children who were severely victimized exhibited less positive self-cognitions and more negative self-cognitions as well as more depressive symptoms. Yet when they controlled for the effects of relational TPV, the effects of physical TPV disappeared; it appears that relational TPV is more strongly associated with these outcomes and an investigation of physical TPV alone would not yield the same associations. Positive and negative self-cognitions were found to mediate the effect of relational victimization to symptoms of depression. Another study by Sinclair (2011) examined the relationship between physical and relational peer victimization with negative and positive self-cognitions as well. It was found that both types of victimization led to increases in negative self-cognitions and decreases in positive self-cognitions, though the effects were more pronounced when a child experienced relational victimization. While girls were found experienced more relational victimization than boys did and boys experienced more physical victimization than girls did, the negative effects of victimization on self-cognitions was stronger in boys. This may be due to one of their findings that boys are less likely to seek adult social support than girls are. A study conducted by Schmidt and Bagwell used surveys to gauge the reactions of victimization and their self evaluated friendships. The study found that girls benefited significantly from having stronger, reliable peer friendships in coping with victimization, while boys did not. Pdf. A study by Snyder and colleagues studied 266 Kindergarten and first grade children in cases of observed victimization at school. The researchers hypothesized that children with higher recorded cases of victimization during recess would rank higher in antisocial and depressive behavior‚Äîaccording to parents and teachers‚Äîthan those who do not. Results showed that girls were not as affected by boys in terms of their change in teacher and parent rated behavior whereas boys were heavily influenced by the amount of peer victimization that day. Research seems to show that there is drastic difference in the way both genders (at least in children) respond to victimization from peers. Current studies on children indicate that regardless of observational method (researcher direct observation or survey results given to the children) there is a marked effect of victimization, especially from peers. The magnitude of the effect on their behavior and mental health is heavily correlated with the situation of the victimization and the child's social environment at the time. Schwartz et al. (1998) investigated the role of victimization in the development of children's behavior problems, focusing on both internalizing and externalizing problems. They hypothesized that higher levels of victimization would lead to increased level of behavioral problems. Child behavior was reported by teachers and parents, measured using the Child Behavior Checklist, and peer victimization was measured using peer nomination. Indeed, they found that peer victimization in middle childhood was associated with behavioral maladjustment on both a concurrent and prospective basis. Additionally, externalizing behaviors were more strongly associated with victimization than were internalizing behaviors. Seals & Young (2003) investigated relationships between bullying and victimization with gender, grade level, ethnicity, self-esteem, and depression. Results showed that victims reported lower levels of self-esteem than did bullies and nonbullies/nonvictims. Additionally, victims had the highest depression scores as compared to bullies and nonbullies/nonvictims. Research progress has also been made into recent mediums of victimization and bullying, notably online victimization. A study conducted by Mitchell et al. in 2007 collected data from over 2000 adolescents through telephone interviews. The most surprising finding was that those who reported being subject to online victimization in the past year are 96% likely to also report being subject to physical (offline) victimization. Pdf. Another study conducted with over 3000 youth in the 5th, 8th and 11th grades using surveys concluded that Internet victimization shares common causal pathways with physical and verbal victimization. Controversy An interest in aspects of bullying sprouted in the 1990s due to media coverage of student suicides, peer beatings, and school shootings. Yet such negative outcomes are rare. One of the most well-known cases concerning the effects of peer victimization is the Columbine High School massacre of 1999 in Columbine, Colorado, United States. The perpetrators of this incident, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, murdered 12 students and 1 teacher and also injured 21 other students before committing suicide. After the tragedy, details emerged showing that Harris and Klebold had been bullied for years by classmates, with little to no intervention by school officials. Though such events are not frequent, they do alarming damage. There has been a recent surge in the number of incidents regarding peer victimization and homosexuality. Specifically, the news has recently highlighted many cases of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) students who have committed suicide in response to peer victimization. One such incident is the case of 18-year-old Tyler Clementi, a Rutgers University student who was secretly videotaped by his roommate, Dharun Ravi, having sexual intercourse with another man. Ravi and another hallmate also streamed the video of the sexual encounter online. After finding out about this, Clementi jumped off of the George Washington Bridge to his death. Reports claim that Clementi had filed a complaint about his roommate having previously violating his privacy in the same manner, but no action had been taken to replace Clementi's roommate. Research demonstrates that lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) students are highly likely to be victimized. Over half of LGB participants were verbally abused when they were in high school, and 11% were physically assaulted in a study by D‚ÄôAugelli et al. (2002). Negative outcomes such as mental health problems and poor school performance have been associated with high incidences of victimization of LGB students. Recently research in this area seems to be progressing from the investigation of the extent and effects of LGB victimization to the specific factors associated with victimization and negative outcomes. A study by Goodenow et al. (2006) was one of the first to examine which school-related factors were associated with lower rates of victimization and suicidality in this population. School related factors included the presence of LGB support groups and staff support as well as other school characteristics like student-to-teacher ratio. It was found that LGB support groups were associated with both low victimization and suicidality among LGB students. Results indicated that the existence of LGB support groups may have led to a decrease in suicidality through decreasing incidence of peer victimization as the association between LGB support groups and suicidality disappeared when victimization was controlled for. Yet as this study examined correlations, causality cannot be assumed. Student courts were associated with less victimization, and antibullying policies were associated with less suicidality, even when the effects of victimization and perceived support were taken into account. Lower levels of victimization and suicidality of LGB students was also associated with large school size and urban locale. These school-related factors have traditionally been associated with a generally safer school environment, yet it seems that factors that increase safety for the general population may not increase safety for LGB students. A study by Kosciw et al. (2009) investigated how school related factors, community factors (such as adult education and income level), and locational factors (on a national level) were associated with victimization of LGB students. Results showed that community factors were the most significantly related to victimization and many regional-level as well as school-related factors were not found to be significant once these factors were taken into account. Increased reports of victimization due to gender expression were found in communities with higher poverty levels compared to affluent communities. Youth from communities with higher as opposed to lower proportions of adults with college degrees also reported less victimization. In accordance with the Goodenow study, It was also found that youth from urban communities were less likely to be victimized than those from rural communities. Applications The results of these studies show a strong need for intervention programs, specifically in-school programs. Though most schools punish bullying through disciplinary action, the frequency of bullying and victimization remains high. Thus, newer, more effective strategies must be implemented. Such programs should not only focus on punishing the bully, but should also focus on the victim. Victims should be taught to use healthier coping strategies instead of internalizing and externalizing their feelings. One intervention program focuses on bullying prevention in positive behavior support (BP-PBS). BP-PBS is designed to, in a series of steps, teach students how to treat each other respectfully, as well as teach ways to minimize social reinforcement of bullying behaviors in order to improve the school atmosphere. Ross and Horner (2009) investigated the effectiveness of this program across three elementary schools in Oregon by focusing on 6 students. Also see: handbook. They collected baseline data for the frequency of bullying as well as victim and bystander responses and then implemented the program across these school for approximately 8‚Äì12 weeks. Results showed that the frequency of bullying behaviors was significantly reduced among these students and that there was also a significant increase in more appropriate responses from victims and bystanders. Thus, interventions like BP-PBS may be effective in alleviating the problem of bullying and victimization in schools. To really test this, such programs should be put into effect nationally. Effective counseling are also a necessary component of dealing with peer victimization in schools. The most important step to successful counseling is identifying the children who are being victimized. While physical victimization can be easily noticed, for example by the presence of bruises and scratches, relational victimization is harder to detect. It is difficult to realize what children are being ostracized or ridiculed, especially if the student doesn't vocalize this treatment. Disciplining relational victimization is also a difficult task. Whereas physical victimization is usually punished with a school suspension, for example, it would seem ridiculous to respond to relational victimization with the same punishment. Because of such discrepancies, it is important to create and implement effective strategies for dealing with relational victimization. Trivia In a study evaluating the effectiveness of this program, Bauer, Lozano, & Rivara (2007) found that the Olweus program had \\"mixed positive effects\\"; specifically, there was a 28% decrease in relational victimization and a 37% decrease in physical victimization.

It is one of Indonesia's northernmost islands. Morotai is a rugged, forested island lying to the north of Halmahera. It has an area of some , stretching north-south and no more than wide. The island's largest town is Daruba, on the island's south coast. Leo Wattimena Airport is located on the island. Almost all of Morotai's numerous villages are coastal settlements; a paved road linking those on the east coast starts from Daruba and will eventually reach Berebere, the principal town on Morotai's east coast, from Daruba. Between Halmahera and the islets and reefs of the west coast of Morotai is the Morotai Strait, which is about wide. History Morotai was part of the Ternate Sultanate, which was a vassal of the Dutch East India Company by the end of the 17th century. Second World War The Empire of Japan invaded Morotai early in 1942 as part of its Dutch East Indies Campaign. US forces and their allies launched the Battle of Morotai in 1944; bombing the island in August and invading it in September. Imperial Japanese forces on Morotai held out until 1945 but failed to expel the Allied troops. In the latter part of 1944, 61,000 personnel landed on Morotai. Two thirds of them were engineers, who rapidly established facilities including harbors and two airstrips plus extensive fuel stores. The formal surrender of the Second Japanese Army took place at Morotai on 9 September 1945. The last Japanese holdout from the war, Private Teruo Nakamura (Amis: Attun Palalin), was discovered by the Indonesian Air Force on Morotai, and surrendered to a search patrol on December 18, 1974.. Permesta rebellion The Dutch Empire withdrew in the Indonesian National Revolution in the late 1940s, after which the new Indonesian Air Force (AURI) kept one of the Allied-built airstrips in use. During the Permesta rebellion in 1958, AURI North American B-25 Mitchell bomber aircraft used the airstrip in transit on their way to attack the rebel center at Manado in North Sulawesi. Permesta had its own \\"Revolutionary Air Force\\", AUREV, whose aircraft, munitions and pilots were supplied by the CIA. AUREV aircraft attacked Morotai on April 21 and again early on April 26. The second air raid was immediately followed by an amphibious Permesta landing force that quickly captured the island. Within hours, a Douglas C-47 Skytrain transport aircraft landed on the now captured airstrip, carrying senior Permesta representative and two Americans. One was a USAF officer who inspected the runway and pronounced that Boeing B-29 Superfortress heavy bomber aircraft could use it. In May 1958 Indonesian National Armed Forces started to gather amphibious forces to retake both Morotai and the rebel-held town of Jailolo on the neighboring island of Halmahera. By May 16 the assault fleet started to gather in Ambon harbour and on May 20 its troops landed on Morotai while √©lite Pasukan Gerak Tjepat (PGT or \\"Quick Reaction Force\\") troops parachuted onto the island. The Permesta force's surrender was as quick as its capture of the island less than a month before. It alarmed the Permesta rebels who had captured Jailolo, many of whom promptly fled back to North Sulawesi. Thereafter the rebellion was largely confined to the Minahassa Peninsula of Sulawesi, where Permesta remnants waged a guerilla campaign until the last unit surrendered in January 1962. =Spaceport plan= After assessing three potential spaceport sites in 2012, the national space agency LAPAN announced Morotai Island as a future spaceport site. Planning started in December 2012. The launch site's completion is expected in 2025. In 2013, LAPAN planned to launch an RX-550 experimental satellite launcher from a location in Morotai to be decided. This island was selected according to the following criteria: * Morotai Island's location near the equator, which makes the launch more economical. * The island has seven runways, one of them 2,400 meters, easily extended to 3,000 meters. * The ease of building on Morotai, which is not densely populated, and little potential for social conflict with native inhabitants. * Morotai Island's east side faces the Pacific Ocean directly, reducing downrange risks to other island populations.

Preparation  The preparation of potassium methoxide can be achieved on the laboratory scale by the (strongly exothermic) reaction of metallic potassium and methanol upon the release of equimolar amounts of hydrogen. Kaliummethanolat aus Kalium und Methanol The reaction of metal hydrides (potassium hydride) with methanol forming potassium methoxide is also possible but less important. Kaliummethanolat aus Kaliumhydrid und Methanol The exothermic reaction of potassium hydroxide with methanol leads in an equilibrium reaction to potassium methanolate and water (avoiding formation of highly inflammable hydrogen gas). In a continuous process the formed water must be removed permanently.Chimtek Engineering: Potassium Methylate Production Technology, abgerufen am 12. August 2015. Kaliummethanolat aus Kaliumhydroxid und Methanol The complete removal of the water is critical for the reaction conversion, due to the pronounced hygroscopy of potassium hydroxide, which contains about 10% of water. The significantly higher dissolution rate of potassium hydroxide in methanol compared to sodium hydroxide is advantageous. On a large scale, potassium methoxide is produced by decomposing potassium amalgam with methanol, which is produced by the chloralkali-electrolysis of potassium chloride by the amalgam process. Impurities of the resulting potassium methoxide in methanol with metallic mercury can be eliminated by ultrafiltration. Solid potassium methoxide is obtained by distilling off the methanol. Because of their simpler production and better handling for chemical purposes solutions of potassium methanolate ( 25 to 32% by weight) are preferably used, which were continuously withdrawn from the amalgam process. The displacement of the amalgam process by the ecologically and economically superior membrane process for the preparation of the mass chemicals sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide will make this standard production process for the production of alkali metal alkoxides in future useless.ICF International: Study on EU Implementation of the Minamata Convention on Mercury, abgerufen am 12. August 2015.  Properties  Potassium methoxide is a white to yellowish, hygroscopic, odorless crystalline powder which reacts violently with water forming potassium hydroxide and methanol. The aqueous solutions obtained are highly basic and have a corrosive effect. The substance is classified as an inflammable solid with a spontaneous ignition temperature of 70 ¬∞C.Evonik Industries, GPS Safety Summary, Potassium Methylate, abgerufen am 12. August 2015. The human toxicity and ecotoxicity evaluation of potassium methoxide is based on the properties of the decomposition products potassium hydroxide and methanol during hydrolysis in the aqueous medium.  Use  The carbonylation of methanol with carbon monoxide to methyl formate (methyl methanoate) is catalyzed by strong bases, such as potassium methoxide. The main application of potassium methoxide is use as basic transesterification catalyst in biodiesel synthesis (as a 25-32% methanolic solution). Triglycerides of vegetable and animal origin are reacted with methanol in the presence of alkali metal methanolates to form the corresponding fatty methyl esters. Potassium methoxide allows a facilitated formation of fatty soaps in comparison to the (lower-priced) sodium methoxide (here potassium salts of the fatty acids from the triglycerides) and higher yields are obtained with potassium methoxide. The optimum conditions for biodiesel production from canola oil are reported as being 1.59% by weight of potassium methoxide, a reaction temperature of 50 ¬∞C and a methanol/oil ratio of 4.5: 1. The biodiesel yield is 95.8% with a fatty acid content of 0.75% by weight.

Joseph Philippe Gentil (9 February 1928), is a Mauritian composer best known for composing The Motherland, the National Anthem of Mauritius. Joseph Philippe Gentil was born in the island of Mauritius, Indian Ocean of Irene Annibal and Eugene Gentil son of photographer, musician and conductor, Gabriel Gentil. He worked for over 30 years in the Mauritius Police Force, more precisely with the Mauritius Police Band as a musician and composer. He was known in his younger days for his comedies performed live in open air such as at the Jardin De La Compagnie, Port Louis. He later became well known on MBC TV for his comedy gigs. He has introduced various European and American musical talents to the Mauritian community by covering their songs, such as Fernandel, Bourvil, Glenn Miller Band, Louis Armstrong, and Henri Salvador. He has composed various marches performed by the Mauritius Police Band; unfortunately, many of his compositions were destroyed when the band's room in Vacoas burned down. However one of his compositions remains as the National Anthem of Mauritius, the Motherland which he won as a competition when Mauritius became independent from the British Empire in 1968. The lyrics were written by Mauritian poet Jean-Georges Prosper. On the day of Independence, 12 March 1968 a national newspaper mistakenly published the name and photograph of Philippe Oh San who was the Mauritius Police Band's maestro as the National Anthem's composer. The remaining newspapers were returned to be reprinted with the correction.http://www.nationalanthems.info/mu.htm As a result, it has left the name of Mr. Oh San in the mind of many Mauritians as being the anthem's composer. However it was Mr. Oh San who after hearing Mr. Gentil's anthem being performed by the band musicians, encouraged for the work to be entered into the contest for a new National Anthem and after receiving Mr. Jean Georges Prosper's lyric as proposal for the anthem found that the lyric perfectly matched the melody composed by Philippe Gentil, the two being created separately. Following the release of the Motherland as the National Anthem, Gentil was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire M.B.E. from Queen Elizabeth II of England and in 2008 and 2010 obtained other titles of the Officer of the Order of the Star and Key of the Indian Ocean O.S.K. and Commander of the Order of the Star and Key of the Indian Ocean C.S.K. from the Mauritian government for his musical service to the Mauritian nation. Philippe Gentil has been the tutor and mentor for many musicians and professional performers for the largest part of his life. From the time of his retirement in 1988, he formed and directed a new band for the Police officers of the Beau-Bassin Prison for about 20 years which he has now left in the hand of others. He still lives in Mauritius with his spouse Claudette Ivy Diane Gentil, born Castel (1940) with whom he had a late daughter named Marie- Danielle Gentil (b 1960) and a son Jacques Philippe Mario Gentil (b 1961).

Garalov is a member of the ruling New Azerbaijan Party and has held his present office for 11 years. He formerly served as the chief prosecutor in Ganja. He is related to influential party official and longtime MP Zahid Garalov. Prosecutor General of Azerbaijan In 2005, Garalov raised eyebrows when he accused the parliamentary opposition of collusion with Armenia and warned that Armenian- backed government opponents were plotting a revolution against President Ilham Aliyev's government. In his capacity as prosecutor general, Garalov defended the arrest of journalist Eynulla Fatullayev in 2007, alleging that his website threatened state-sponsored terrorism by Iran against Azerbaijani government buildings. He claimed that Fatullayev's detention and imprisonment should not be taken as signs that Azerbaijan does not uphold freedom of the press. Garalov benefited under a 2009 law that lifted restrictions on how many terms a prosecutor general could serve, as he was reappointed and confirmed to his current position in 2010, less than a year later. In 2011, Garalov said that his office would take action against government officials suspected of corruption and bribery. \\"In order to require the same attitudes from others and have the moral rights for investigation [of] corrupt officials' activity, we must start fighting against corruption from ourselves,\\" he added, criticizing the \\"luxurious lifestyle\\" of some Azerbaijanis as evidence of corruption. After the outbreak of the 2011 protests against the Azerbaijani government, Garalov vowed to \\"suppress\\" the demonstrations and said that the experience of \\"other countries\\", presumably a reference to Egypt, Libya, and Tunisia, would not be repeated in Azerbaijan. Ahead of a planned protest in mid-April, Garalov accused opposition leaders Ali Karimli and Isa Gambar with acting on orders from foreign governments and summoned both leaders for interrogation, after which they were released. On 1 May 2020 Garalov was succeeded by Kamran Aliyev as the Prosecutor General. The decision was approved at the plenary meeting of the National Assembly upon President Ilham Aliyev's proposal.

He won the Scottish Cup with East Fife in 1938, and was manager of both Bury and Tranmere Rovers for eight years. Playing career Russell played for his hometown club Dundee before joining East Fife. Winning the Scottish Cup in 1938, Russell played 92 games for The Fifers before joining Sheffield Wednesday for the next season, where he was an ever-present as the club finished third in Division Two. As it did with so many players, World War II hampered Russell's career. Management career After a stint in the Royal Air Force, Russell became a coach for the Danish Football Association before returning to England in 1950 to take up a coaching role at Bury. In 1953, Russell became the manager and led the Shakers for eight years. The club played 379 games under him between 1953 and 1961, winning 154, losing 139 and drawing 86 match. However, whilst at Bury, finances were a severe problem for Russell, and in 1957 they suffered relegation from Division Two for the first time in 63 years. Fortunes soon turned around though for the Scotsman, and he guided Bury back to Division Two in the 1960‚Äì61 season. He then took over as manager of Tranmere Rovers, at the time two divisions lower than Bury, replacing Walter Galbraith who had been in charge for less than a year. After near misses and disappointments along the way, he finally steered Rovers back to the Third Division at the conclusion of 1966‚Äì67 season. In 1969, Russell became the club's general manager to allow his long-time coach, Jackie Wright, to take over the managerial reins, having guided the team to 167 wins and 130 defeats over a 379-game and eight-year stint as manager. In 1978 Russell left the club for the final time. Since then, one of the hospitality suites at Tranmere's ground Prenton Park has been named after Russell.

He was well known for his breakthrough hit \\"Questo vecchio pazzo mondo\\" (\\"This old crazy world\\"), a cover of P.F. Sloan's \\"Eve of Destruction,\\" and for the song \\"Such a Cold Night Tonight\\" that he sang in the movie Yuppi Du. Life=Early life Santercole was born in Milan, Italy, on 21 November 1940. His family is originally from the south eastern region of Apulia. Santercole's mother, Rosa, was the sister of the singer, comedian, and movie director Adriano Celentano. Santercole lost his father as a child. He spent some years in college, and was then forced to go to work by himself. He was fond of rock'n'roll, and in his free time he learned to play the guitar. Celentano recruited Santercole for his group, the Rock Boys, when his second guitarist, Ico Cerutti, left the group. Santercole became a Rock Boy just in time to participate in the First Italian Festival of Rock and Roll, held on 18 May 1957 at the Via Piranesi Ice Palace in Milan. Record producer Walter Guertler was in the festival audience, and signed the Rock Boys to a recording contract right after the show. The Rebels and the solo debut The Rock Boys evolved into the Rebels, who backed up Celentano and other singers such as Ricky Clem Sacco and Gianco. Celentano began a solo career and soon Santercole became the group's lead guitarist. Santercole began singing as well; the first song he sang on was \\"Sono un fallito\\" (\\"I am a Failure\\"), a cover of Ray Charles's \\"Busted.\\" That was followed by his own solo single, 'Silver Star', in December 1964, which got good airplay and chart success in early 1965. In 1965 he released a solo EP, credited to Santercole with Celentano and Don Backy. Then in 1966 Santercole sang on and released the single \\"Questo vecchio pazzo mondo\\" (\\"This old crazy world\\"). The song is a cover of the folk-rock/protest song written by P.F. Sloan, 'Eve of Destruction' which became a hit when covered by Barry McGuire in 1966. Santercole performs the song in Cantagiro in 1967. Celentano used the same music tracks and lyrics in 1984 on his album I miei americani (My American), a collection of U.S. hits translated into Italian, and again in the first episode of his 1999 television show, Francamente me ne infischio (Frankly I don't care) in 1999. In 1966, Santercole participated in Festival di Sanremo with his uncle, Ico Cerutti and Pilade, performing \\"Il ragazzo della via Gluck\\" (\\"The Kid from Gluck Street\\") under the name Trio of Clan; however, they are eliminated in the early evening. Meanwhile, the kinship with Celentano is strengthened. Celentano separated from his Milena Cant√π and married actress and singer Claudia Mori, while Santercole fell in love with and married Mori's sister, Anna Moroni (becoming the brother-in-law of his uncle). Anna Santercole will bear him two sons. Composer and actor Santercole has written many famous and significant songs of Italian music, including some of great success. His first success was \\"A Caress into a Fist\\" (\\"Una carezza in un pugno\\"), initially recorded by Celantano as a B-side in 1968. The song has become an evergreen of Italian pop music is, having been used several times by Celentano in his television programs. In 1992 the singer and Fiorello imitator included a new cover of \\"A Caress into a Fist\\" on his album Again fake. \\"A Caress into a Fist\\" was the first song Santercole wrote. He had never tried to write a song, because he did not believe he could. One day, though, when learning a new song ‚Äì Bert Kaempfert's \\"Strangers in the Night\\"‚Äîon guitar, he found himself varying notes and finally playing a completely different song, the one that became \\"A Caress into a Fist\\".\\"Gino Santercole, una vita tra musica e cinema,\\" VignaClaraBlog.it, Web, May 15, 2011. Other hits followed: \\"Svalutation\\", a rock song with electric guitar, on his 1976 album (which also contained his songs \\"The Boat\\" and \\"Room 21\\"), \\"A boy on the Lion\\", and \\"Remarkably\\" (written initially for Mina, with lyrics by Luciano Beretta). Santercole also composed music for movies. He is credited with the soundtracks of Segni Particolari: Bellisimo (Distinguishing Features: Beautiful) (1983) and Joan Lui ‚Äì Ma Un Giorno Nel Paese Arrivo 10 Di Lunedi (1985). In addition he did numerous work on the music of Celentano's films; a highlight being his hit \\"Such a Cold Night Tonight\\" (which Santercole sang in English), from the movie Yuppi du. In 1969, Santercole also began an acting career. While he had previously played cameos and parts, his first substantial role came in the 1969 film Serafino (Seraphim). One day he visited Celentano, who had landed a role in the movie, on set; the director, Paolo Germi, saw him, thought he had a good face, and cast him as the Sergeant. As an actor, Santercole has worked with directors like Pietro Germi, Dino Risi, Giuliano Montaldo, Luigi Comencini, Luciano Salce, and Mario Monicelli. He has cast credits in four movies: Mani Di Velluto (1979), Yuppi du (1975), Il Commisario Pepe (1969), and Serafino (1969). Return to television and reconciliation with Celentano In 1999 Santercole collaborated on the new album by Pio Trebbi, lead singer of the Clan Celentano, who was experiencing economic difficulties: the two wrote the song \\"The Last of the Clan'. To help, Santercole contacted Celentano, who decided to join the two in an episode of his television program Francamente me ne infischio. The symbol of peace between the two after that in the past there had been some disagreements. On 22 January 2007 Santercole agreed to participate with Varese at a celebration of the 50th anniversary of rock 'n' roll in Italy, along with Pennant, the Rebels, Rosie, Ghigo Agosti, and others. In September 2008 Santercole was a guest at the Festival in Venice with Adriano Celentano for the new release of Yuppi Du. 2009 in June he hosted the programme of Rai Two Stracult Show of Marco Giusti German in a sketch comedian with Stefano Sarcinelli and Nicola Vicidomini.

The community is found mainly in Panangattiri village of Kollengode sub district, of Palakkad district and spread across Vallanghy, Nemmara, Alathur, Vadavannur and Vithanaserry. Other names used to refer this community are PathuMadom and Dashagotram. Etymology The name is derived from two Tamil/Malayalam words, ‚ÄòPathu‚Äô and ‚ÄòKudi‚Äô, which mean ten families, ten households, ten clans, ten classes, ten Gotras or ten mutts. The other names of this community are DashaGotram and PathuMadom, which also imply the same meaning. Origin: history and legend=Poompuhar Parvam (Poompuhar Canto) The community is originated from a group of Shaivite Brahmins who were specialized in the field of gem business in Poompuhar, Tamil Nadu. They were considered as elite class in Poompuhar society and had a dignified life as equal to Chola emperor. The community has its origin from the direct disciples of JnanaSambandhan (a Brahmin child saint who revived Hinduism in Tamil land-7th century CE). The people of the community were expertise in both classical Tamil and Sanskrit languages. Though they were followers of Shaivite sect of Hinduism, they were also worshippers of Vishnu, Indra and Iravan. They were vegetarians and scholars of Vedic sciences and philosophies apart from their business profession. Though this community had business profession and had later adopted ‚ÄòShreshthi‚Äô (Chetti) title, they did not mix with other Vaishya communities and have lived according to Brahmin tradition. These merchant Brahmin lords had maintained a separate army and land in Chola Empire and were authorized to collect taxes in their region. Palayana Parvam (Exodus Canto) Legend says that, centuries ago when a king of Chola Empire wished to marry a girl from this community. The community did not like that idea as alliances with other communities were prohibited. Though the community did not accept it, the king did not change his mind set. So the community, which comprises Ten Gotras, escaped from Chola kingdom at a midnight. Knowing this the king had sent his army men in search of them. As the community has understood imminent danger nearing them they scattered gems and other precious stones on their path to divert the attention of the soldiers. The soldiers spent much of the time to search these valuables in the sandy road. Though they escaped from soldiers but they could not find a solution when the nature came as an obstacle. It was a rainy season in Poompuhar. The Cauvery River was overflowing and they found it difficult to cross the river. They prayed at lord Ganesh temple nearby the river to save them if their deed was right. Their prayer got answered. The river got turned into two branches to enable them to cross the river without any difficulty. It is said that another Vaishya group who accompanied with them have taken a different route from there when they reached Avinashipattanam. By the advice of their Kula Guru they met Kollengode king. But Kollengode king asked them to contact Zamorin king of Kozhikode. RakshaPurusha Parvam (The Protector Canto) The Kula Guru of the community with his influence on Zamorin has made appointment for the community. They met Zamorin and had spent seven days in his palace. King Zamorin was highly impressed by the community leaders‚Äô in depth knowledge of Vedic science, Puranas and on other various subjects. He had honored them by asking them to sit on silk-bed. While their stay at Kozhikkode, Chola emperor had sent his ambassadors to request the Zamorin to send them back to Poompuhar. But Zamorin had refused to do so and informed that the community is the distinguished guests of his kingdom. The community leaders then discarded their sacred thread after accepting the titles like Vadhyar, Panicker, Chettiyar (this title is a continuation from Poompuhar), Moothotty and Mannadiar from Zamorin. The king allowed the ten Mutts to be settled at his autonomous area in Palakkad called Panangattiry (which was also a land in dispute between kings of Palakkad and Zamorin). He asked both his counterparts of Kollengode and Palakkad to permit the community to lead an independent life as their own which should not be challenged by anyone of them at any cost. Palaka Parvam (The Kingship Canto) The people of Panangattiry (ThenPanassai) has welcomed this community to their land and called them as ‚ÄòPathukudi‚Äô as they represent ten different Gotras. Later Pathukudi community was collectively known as ‚ÄòPathukudi Panickers‚Äô irrespective of their titles. They built a Nagaram (town) under the footage of Thenmala hills and became the Deshavazhis (rulers) of the land with the consent of king Zamorin. They chose central area of the land to protect them from any outside invasion and for the effective administration of the land. The adjoining areas were given to Tamil Brahmins, Gounders, and Kulalas etc. They built temples for Bhagavathy (Goddess), lord Siva, and lord Ganesh and for their tutelary deity lord Iravan. (Lord Iravan temple is only one temple for Iravan at Kerala state) The chief of the community became ‚ÄòPalakan‚Äô (ruler or chieftain) of the land and has used title as Rajah in front of the name. Their mutts became known as ‚ÄòTharavads‚Äô as in local name and Rajah‚Äôs one was known as ‚ÄòKovilakom‚Äô. He used the lion depicted flag. Some families migrated to different parts of Palakkad afterwards. Uchitajnata Parvam (Propriety Canto) Pathukudi community‚Äôs prominence in the social set up came down after few centuries probably after decline of Zamorin dynasty. They led the rest of life as just petty landlords and agriculturalists. Their growth became stagnant at one stage due to rigid customs and disunity between different Tharavads. Later some Tharavads got ruined and after that some of the members became administrators in aristocratic Nair Tharavads. The community found a short fall in their count later because they were minority section in population in Kollengode. It is due to the same Gotra marriage is not permitted according to the customs and also alliances with other caste/-allied communities were strictly prohibited. So they solved the problem by splitting some ‚ÄòTharavads‚Äô into two numbers. But this was not a permanent solution. Then some ‚ÄòTharavads‚Äô, which migrated to Kollengode, made alliance with Tharakan community (an Arya Vaishya community originated from Poompuhar) and a new community has originated in that region called ‚ÄòPathukudi-Tharakan‚Äô community. Some tharavads of Pathukudi community got revived later on with new names in Pananagattiri land. Religion, temples and tutelary deity The community generally follows Shaivite sect of Hinduism. As they are rooted from the disciples of JnanaSambandhan who revived Hinduism, they followed religious tolerance with other sects. So they gave importance to Vaishnavite gods. The ancestors of this community has preached that both Siva and Vishnu are the same and has lived according to that principle. The following are the temples built by Pathukudi community at Panangattiry: *Sri Iravan *Sri Viswanathaswamy *Sri MahaGanapathy *Sri KurumbaBhagavathy *Sri Mariamman Lord Iravan is the tutelary deity of Pathukudi community. He is the son of legendary warrior Arjuna and the Naga princess Ulupi. He is also called as Koothandavar or Koothanda colloquially. Iravan is worshipped in Tamil Nadu as ‚ÄòAravan ‚Äò as a village deity. (In Tamil ‚ÄòAravan‚Äô effigy a cobrahood shelters His head which shows his Naga affiliation.) The idol placed in the sanctum sanctorum is a younger form of Iravan who is holding bow and arrow. Lord Krishna‚Äòs idol is also installed in the same Garbha Griha. They also built temples for Siva, Serpent gods, Bhagavathy and Mariamman in Panangattiri. Among various lamp poles dedicated to Sri Pudussery temple at Palakkad by various communities, Pathukudi community‚Äôs one is the largest one, which is also considered as main and sacred nature. Customs and traditions In their earlier life of Pananagttiri, they followed same Brahmin traditions. Their Mangalya Sutra and marriages were same as that of Tamil Brahmins and was changed subsequently. The Mangalya thread must be a yellow thread (not chain) during marriage ceremony as it is considered sacred and auspicious which is applicable for both rich and poor. The community follows patriarchal system. They wore tuft in front of their head as like Nairs and Namboothiris. Being a Trivarnika community, the after death pollution (pula) is only for ten days. The unique Chitragupta festival /Indrotsavam is celebrating by the community as a part of continuation of their Poompuhar life. They observe Pillayar Noimbu for lord Ganesh like Tamil Brahmins and all Vaishya communities.

The filmmakers have clarified that the story is not officially or literally based on Smitha alone, but on many of her southern contemporaries such as Disco Shanti. It also resembles the personal lives of other women in popular culture, including Hollywood actress and sex symbol Marilyn Monroe. The film was directed by Milan Luthria and co-produced by Shobha Kapoor and Ekta Kapoor, after Ekta came up with the idea and asked screenwriter Rajat Aroraa to pen a story based on it. Produced on a budget of , The Dirty Picture was released worldwide on 2 December 2011 (the anniversary of Smitha's birth), in Hindi, Telugu and Tamil versions. Vidya Balan, Emraan Hashmi, Naseeruddin Shah and Tusshar Kapoor played lead roles. Upon release it was a critical and commercial success, with Balan receiving the highest accolades for her performance; she was called \\"the hero of the film\\". In addition, the film has received widespread praise for portraying women as powerful, contributing something unique to a typically male-dominated society. The music was composed by Vishal Shekhar with lyrics written by Rajat Aroraa. The Dirty Picture grossed worldwide and received several awards, most of which were won by Balan for her portrayal of Silk. It won three National Film Awards including Best Actress, three Filmfare Awards and six Screen Awards including Best Picture and Best Director. Box Office India declared the film Super Hit after its fourth week.  Plot  A day before her marriage, Reshma (Vidya Balan) runs away from her rural village, hoping to become a star in Chennai. She fails to impress a casting director, and he insults her for being unattractive and unable to act. Determined to secure a role, she spontaneously auditions for the position of a background dancer. However, she dances in a sultry manner, using erotic movements which annoys the film's director, Abraham (Emraan Hashmi). He edits out Reshma's entire dance sequence. The film fails at the box office, much to the dismay of the producer Selva Ganesh (Rajesh Sharma), who later recalls Reshma's performance and offers her a role in a song in his upcoming film. Selva also suggests that she now be referred to as \\"Silk\\", which is more exotic and captivating. At the first shoot, Silk dances with veteran actor Suryakanth (Naseeruddin Shah), her childhood idol. Enamoured with him, Silk gains his affection and attention by offering a long-term sexual relationship. Meanwhile, Abraham proposes a new film to Selva Ganesh and is keen to cast Suryakanth. However, Suryakanth's suggestion of adding sex and eroticism, to make the film more commercially viable, angers Abraham. Silk slowly builds a name for herself in the industry and goes on to do many more sexually charged films with Suryakanth, which catapults her into stardom. She gains many male fans and, in a short time, becomes immensely rich and popular as a Southern sex symbol. Suryakanth's younger brother Ramakanth (Tusshar Kapoor) is an admirer of Silk and starts to befriend her. Silk develops a liking for him, after she realizes that he is the first man who loves her for more than just her body and sex appeal. At an awards ceremony Silk is praised for her performance but is insulted by Suryakanth who tells her that she is nothing more than everyone's \\"dirty secret\\". Hurt by his remarks, Silk announces that she will continue to make her \\"dirty pictures\\" and that she has no qualms in doing so. She begins to spend more time with Ramakanth and becomes the focus of tabloid gossip after noted journalist Naila (Anju Mahendru) criticises Silk for having a romantic relationship with both brothers. To avoid scandal, and also to get revenge, Suryakanth drops Silk from his forthcoming films, forcing her to work with smaller, unknown filmmakers. She loses interest in her work and begins to feel threatened by a younger aspiring actress, Shakeela. During a dance challenge she intentionally trips Shakeela, much to the embarrassment of Ramakanth who then decides to end their relationship. To ease her heartbreak and the rejection from her family, Silk turns to alcohol and chain smoking. She gains weight, causing her to lose her status as a sex symbol. Silk approaches Silva Ganesh with an offer to produce a film together. Ultimately, the audience and industry has lost interest in her, and the film fails. On the other hand, Abraham directs a film which turns out to be a huge hit, and he feels that he has finally proven to Silk (and himself) that his films do not need any sexualisation to be successful. Having lost her fame and fortune, Silk has accumulated so much debt that she approaches a small-time filmmaker, willing to take on any role. She is shocked to find that he wants her to do a pornographic film, and she refuses. He intoxicates her with alcohol and starts filming, without her permission. The place is raided by the police but Silk manages to escape. Abraham finds himself falling in love with Silk, even though he denies it first, as he struggles with this moral dilemma. During a phone conversation with Silk, Abraham becomes alarmed when she asks him to bid farewell to everyone for her. He rushes to her house, and finds her lying in bed dead from a sleeping pill overdose, along with a suicide note written by her. The film ends with Abraham's narration, examining the life that Silk has led, and he questions whether it was her or her life that was right or wrong.  Cast  * Vidya Balan as Reshma/Silk, a rebellious and independent woman. She runs away from her rural home at a young age to nurture her dream of becoming an actress. She is uninhibited in expressing her sexuality. * Emraan Hashmi as Abraham (loosely based on Balu Mahendra), a director and the narrator of the film. He dreams of making critically acclaimed films. He initially hates Silk and her over-sexualisation of the film industry. * Naseeruddin Shah as Suryakanth, an aging South Indian superstar. He is involved in extramarital relationships and has a secret affair with the much younger Silk. * Tusshar Kapoor as Ramakanth, Suryakant's brother and a writer for one of his forthcoming films. He is attracted to Silk but, unlike his brother, is empathetic towards her. * Anju Mahendru as Naila, a journalist who writes sensationalist articles about Silk but secretively admires her courage. * Rajesh Sharma as Selva Ganesh/Keedadas, the producer of most of Silk's films * Imran Hasnee as film director Vijayan * Mangal Kenkre as Ratnamma, a confidante of Silk. * Arya Banerjee as Shakeela, an up-and-coming young actress who compares herself to Silk * Vikas Shrivastav as Sudhir, casting director * Mohit Sinha as Manorma * Shivani Tanksale as Raadhika * Lavin Gothi as a fan of Silk * Neha Bam as Silk Samitha's Mother / Biological Mother of Silk  Production = Development  Ekta Kapoor launched the film with director Milan Luthria soon after their collaboration Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai became a hit. She said that The Dirty Picture would be India's answer to the Academy Award-nominated film Boogie Nights. Later in a press conference, Kapoor clarified that neither of Balaji's forthcoming films, Ragini MMS nor The Dirty Picture, were \\"porn films\\" as they had been made out to be. Kapoor has gone on record to add, \\"I would be surprised if I don't get unbelievable critical acclaim for The Dirty Picture and a national award for my actress, Vidya Balan. The film has one of the most well-written scripts I have come across and a lot of youngsters in my office have looked at it with great admiration.\\" She pointed out that the purpose of the film was neither to justify nor criticise Smitha's life but for the audience to live her life. Additionally, all actors, including Balan and Shah attended workshops for almost two months before filming began, to familiarise themselves with the body language of their characters. When screenwriter Rajat Aroraa initially started working, taking cues from producer Kapoor, the scope of the film was much smaller, primarily looking back to the soft-pornography scene of the 1980s. As work progressed, the scope gradually widened to include the controversial romances of Smitha through a fictionalised biopic. While researching for the film, director Luthria and screenwriter Aroraa found little material in magazines of that period, as \\"women like Silk Smitha were often ignored by film magazines, except for gossip column mentions\\". Thus they derived many of the details of her life from anecdotes and party gossips, and then fictionalised them. Apart from depicting the pomp of the Telugu/Tamil film industry, the screenplay takes up issues such as money management by actors, \\"their string of broken relationships\\", and the way they \\"led lonely lives and met with tragic ends\\". For inspiration, instead of looking at South Indian films of the period, the team turned to the work of mainstream Bollywood directors like Manmohan Desai, Vijay Anand, Raj Kapoor, Feroz Khan and G.P. Sippy. To put the global soft-porn industry in context, the team looked into Boogie Nights (1997) and The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996). The final script became a \\"fictionalised, women-oriented, generalised perspective on the 1980s film industry\\".  Casting  After initial talks with actresses Kangana Ranaut and Bipasha Basu fell through, Vidya Balan was offered the lead role. When Balan was narrated the script and shown sketches of what she needed to wear for the portrayal, she felt uncomfortable. Luthria added, \\"We couldn't have found anyone better than Vidya for this role. It's a casting that very few would think is viable because it is going to be nothing like Vidya has done before. But I am confident she will push the envelope as far as she can\\". Regarding the criticism that Balan's character might evoke, Luthria clarified, \\"I wanted Vidya to know that what she's doing is not crass or crude but can be shown aesthetically in a sensual manner with a touch of class. What her character does, is not cheap.\\" As a reference point, he also asked Balan to study 'similar themed' films such as Burlesque and Chicago. Balan also underwent salsa training to fine-tune herself with Smitha's languid body language. Next, Naseeruddin Shah was cast as an ageing South Indian superstar with \\"hideous wigs, dark glasses and painted-on mustaches\\". He performed a \\"fast dance number\\" in the film, a full 22 years after he last did it in the song \\"Tirchi Topiwale\\" from Tridev (1989). Regarding his character, Ekta Kapoor stated, \\"This role requires him to play to the gallery, provoke claps, laughs, and whistles and I know he can pull it off because Naseer is the Shah of all actors.\\" Luthria added, \\"Expect a man who unabashedly enjoys the flesh of women\\". Tusshar Kapoor and Emraan Hashmi were next cast in lead roles. While it was known that Tusshar Kapoor would play the role of a script- writer and Smitha's love interest, the nature of Hashmi's role was unknown for a while. The casting received praise from trade pundits, with Taran Adarsh commenting, \\"Known for engaging in interesting and unconventional casting in all its previous releases, Balaji has again tackled the unheard of, by casting Emraan Hashmi and Vidya Balan ‚Äì two of the most successful stars of today ‚Äì opposite each other in The Dirty Picture. The perfect combination of mass and class promises to make this controversial film yet another winner from the Balaji stable.\\"  Filming  Filming was to begin on 21 May 2011: a week after the release of Kapoor's Ragini MMS. But due to production delays, it began a week later. Balan, a religious person, organised a puja on the sets before principal photography began. The first leg of filming took place at Mumbai's Film City where an elaborate set re-creating Chennai (then Madras) of the 80s was set up. The second schedule was shot in Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad. The song \\"Ishq Sufiyana\\" was shot at Bidar fort in Bidar, Karnataka. Filming was completed in September, before venturing into post- production, ahead of the December release. Director Luthria wanted to depict a sense of discomfort between the two lead characters, Balan and Hashmi, a \\"meeting of two completely different worlds\\". So he didn't allow them to interact and get comfortable with each other during film workshops ahead of the shoot. Since he considered them \\"the unlikeliest pair to come together\\", he brought them together right into the shoot filming an important scene, where they had to insult each other. Though he was initially anxious, it all turned out well and he was surprised by the resulting chemistry.  Marketing  Vidya promoting The Dirty Picture in Kolkata. The first look of The Dirty Picture and a short teaser were launched online on 26 August 2011. The enthusiastic response even prompted its producers to consider a sequel. The film's trailer on YouTube got over 500,000 hits in one day and one million hits in two days. Meanwhile, the theatrical trailer was launched on 30 August at a single screen cinema in Bandra. The space was especially decorated to recreate the retro era. Since the film is set in the 1980s, a time when multiplexes did not exist, the producers thought it would be fitting to show the premi√®re on a single screen. The lead stars created publicity by organising a promotional campaign in the festival of Mithibai College on 30 November. As a part of the film promotion, actors Vidya Balan, Tusshar Kapoor and Emraan Hashmi made appearances on the popular TV show Bigg Boss aired on Colors on 26 November 2011.

The first of the four tracks, \\"Ooh La La,\\" sung by Shreya Ghoshal and Bappi Lahiri was released on the internet on 19 October 2011. \\"Ooh La La\\" was featured in Fox American sitcom television series New Girl episode \\"Big Mama P\\". and was used in some regional films, including Race Gurram in party scene in Lucky's house. Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama gave the music an overall rating of 4 out of five saying, \\"Music of The Dirty Picture takes the expected route and delivers what it promised\\" and chose Ooh La La and Ishq Sufiyana as picks from the album.

Highly recommended!\\" Raja Sen from Rediff.com gave 3.5 out of 5 stars and said \\"The Dirty Picture forsakes much potential nuance in its urge to please crowds but is still far more engaging than most Bollywood produce.\\" Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com gave 3 out of 5 stars, highlighting that \\"In terms of creativity, it's a middling effort. But where bravado is concerned, The Dirty Picture kicks ass by virtue of three very strong reasons: Vidya Balan. Vidya Balan. Vidya Balan.\\" Kunal Guha of Yahoo! India gave the movie 3 stars out of 5, and said, \\"Clearly, Rajat Aroraa's winning dialogues will make you sit up and say, \\"She [Balan] didn't just say that?!\\" Sudhish Kamath of The Hindu praised Balan's performance saying \\"This is the single-most boldest performance by a woman in the history of Indian cinema...Vidya apparently put on 12 kilos for this film and they all show. It needs some amount of guts and sass to pull it off and she sizzles in this role tailor-made to show off her acting chops.\\" Box office The Dirty Picture opened strong, with 60‚Äì65% collections on average at multiplexes and had the 5th biggest opening of 2011.

Television broadcast The Indian television premiere of The Dirty Picture was set to be telecast on Sony Entertainment Television on 22 April 2012 at 12 noon and 8 pm IST.

It had to go through these cuts as the telecast of an adult-rated film during prime time in India is a violation of the Cable TV Network Rules, 1994 and the Cable TV Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995. Following this process, Sony Entertainment Television promoted the scheduled telecast. However, on the scheduled day, the film was not telecast, with the channel putting up a message stating, \\"For unavoidable reasons we regret to inform that The Dirty Picture will not be telecast today.

The sheriff had judicial, electoral, ceremonial and administrative functions and executed High Court Writs. In 1908, an Order in Council made the Lord-Lieutenant the Sovereign's prime representative in a county and reduced the High Sheriff's precedence. However the sheriff retained his responsibilities for the preservation of law and order in the county. The usual procedure for appointing the sheriff from 1660 onwards was that three persons were nominated at the beginning of each year from the county and the Lord Lieutenant then appointed his choice as High Sheriff for the remainder of the year. Often the other nominees were appointed as under-sheriffs. Sometimes a sheriff did not fulfil his entire term through death or other event and another sheriff was then appointed for the remainder of the year. The dates given hereunder are the dates of appointment. All addresses are in County Kilkenny unless stated otherwise.

Eug√©nie is a play in five acts by Pierre Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais. It was first performed at the Com√©die- Fran√ßaise on January 29, 1767. The premier of Eug√©nie was delayed for some time by the illness of one of its stars, Pr√©ville, who was to play the role of The Baron. There was much buzz about the play before the opening, and its premier was well-attended; but the audience's reception was lukewarm, evidently due to the play's long running-time. Beaumarchais and the cast spent the next two days revising the script, and the result was a greater success. Until the premiere of The Barber of Seville several years later, Eug√©nie was Beaumarchais's most famous play. It was adapted in English by Elizabeth Griffith as The School for Rakes in 1769‚Äîa direct translation was difficult to make as Beaumarchais, despite setting the story in England, demonstrated a poor understanding of British culture and law.  Plot  The plot was inspired by an actual incident which befell Beaumarchais's sister.http://www.enotes.com/literary-criticism/beaumarchais-pierre-augustin- caron-de  Act One.  Eug√©nie and her aunt, Madame Murer, have come to London from their native Wales. They are accompanied by Eug√©nie's father Baron Hartley, who believes they're in town on business. In fact, Eug√©nie has secretly married The Earl of Clarendon and has come to visit him; they are staying in the Earl's petite maison, near his palace. Eug√©nie is dismayed that the Earl has gone out of town despite knowing about their plans to visit. Madame Murer‚Äîwho is the only member of Eug√©nie's family that knows about the wedding‚Äîtries to reassure Eug√©nie that noblemen like the Earl simply have busy schedules. (It's of note that the script frequently indicates that Eug√©nie's father, the Baron, is not a nobleman.) Eug√©nie is even more concerned because she is already pregnant, and still hasn't told her father about her marriage, due to the insistence of Madame Murer and the Earl that it should be kept a secret. The Baron has even started to prepare an arranged marriage for her to someone else‚Äîan old military man by the name of Cowerly. Eventually the Earl arrives to visit Eug√©nie. His valet, Drink, prepares to announce him, but chides his master: Drink knows that the Earl's marriage to Eug√©nie was not valid and in fact was completely staged. Furthermore, the Earl is preparing to marry someone else very soon. The Earl complains that another of his servants, his Steward who had pretended to be the minister at his fraudulent wedding, is also feeling regrets and will probably attempt to write to Madame Murer with the truth. He tells Drink to make sure to check any mail that's received at the house and withhold anything that looks like it might be from the Steward. Drink finally leaves to announce the Earl, during which time the Earl admits in monologue that he does truly love Eug√©nie but has been pressured by his uncle to marry someone else; he is so terrified of his uncle and so ashamed of his own behavior that he can't bring himself to confess what he's done. When Eug√©nie and Madame Murer finally greet the Earl, Eug√©nie inquires as to why he has been so distant; the Earl responds with various lies which appease Eug√©nie. The Baron comes in and after meeting the Earl, congratulates him about his upcoming wedding to Lady Winchester, daughter of the Duke of Winchester. Eug√©nie and Madame Murer are horrified at this news, and the flustered Earl quickly lies and assures everyone that the stories of him getting married are just a rumor that's going around. The ladies retire and the two men exit together.  Act Two.  Later, the Earl sneaks back into the house alone in order to talk with Drink: he instructs Drink to make sure that nobody comes to visit Eug√©nie or her family until after his wedding is concluded, and he specifically warns about the Baron's friend Captain Cowerly (the brother of Eug√©nie's fianc√© Cowerly.) Meanwhile, Drink has intercepted the letter from the Steward and hidden it. Once the ladies are alone, Drink gives them the remainder of the mail, which includes the news that Eug√©nie's brother Sir Charles, an officer in the army, has been in a duel with his Colonel; the Colonel lost after being disarmed, but is now trying to have Charles assassinated. Eug√©nie worries over her brother and gives the news to her father. Soon afterward Captain Cowerly comes into the house, complaining that the servants were insisting that nobody was home and that he had to barge his way in. After being greeted, Cowerly inquires as to where Sir Charles is at. The Baron and Madame Murer are amazed that he already knows about Sir Charles's troubles, and Cowerly explains that not only has he already spoken with Charles in London, but in fact had assumed that the reason for the family's visit was because Charles was there. Gradually the conversation turns to Earl Clarendon, and Cowerly reveals the family is staying in the Earl's petite maison (a house where parties and sexual trysts are had) and confirms that the Earl is about to marry someone else. Eug√©nie becomes physically unwell at the news and is taken away by her aunt.  Act Three.  Later, the Baron goes to comfort Eug√©nie. Eug√©nie decides she should not conceal the truth from her father anymore and admits to him that she has secretly married the Earl. The Baron is outraged by this news; just when he's beginning to calm down, Madame Murer enters and scolds him for his behavior and argues for the merits of the Earl. The Baron, meanwhile, argues that the Earl is a heartless womanizer. When Eug√©nie finally reveals she is already pregnant, the Baron is forced to give his blessing to the marriage; but both he and Eug√©nie remain confused as to why everyone seems to think the Earl is going to marry someone else if he is already married to Eug√©nie. They decide to ask Drink about what's going on. When Drink is called in, the Baron grabs him by the throat and demands answers; Drink is so frightened and confused that he mistakenly thinks they've learned that the marriage between the Earl and Eug√©nie was fraudulent, and winds up delivering to them the letter from the Steward since he believes they already know the contents. Eug√©nie and Madame Murer are horrified when they learn the truth, and the Baron is beside himself with outrage; he claims he will disown Eug√©nie, and storms off. Eug√©nie tearfully asks her aunt that they depart from London, but Madame Murer insists she should meet the Earl one more time‚Äîher plan is to call out a minister and to arm the servants, and have essentially a shotgun wedding for Eug√©nie and the Earl.  Act Four.  When the Earl arrives at Madame Murer's request, he brings along a companion he had rescued from an attack in the street‚Äîthis man, it turns out, is Eug√©nie's brother Sir Charles. When Madame Murer and the servants try to ambush the Earl, Sir Charles -- feeling indebted for the Earl's help to him -- comes to his defense and allows the Earl to escape; however, Sir Charles indicates that he expects to duel with the Earl later on to settle the matter of Eug√©nie's marriage honorably. Eug√©nie is rendered catatonic by the whole incident and is finally taken away to bed, while Sir Charles swears he will avenge her.  Act Five.  The final act occurs very early in the morning; the family has been up all night fretting over Eug√©nie's condition, and they even seem to fear that she may die from grief. She is able to emerge from her room, in a weakened state, to try to convince Sir Charles not to fight the Earl‚Äîshe insists that she'd rather be known as a \\"foresworn wretch\\" than to see the Earl harmed. Charles does not listen to her and leaves to fight the Earl: he returns almost immediately, lamenting that when he tried to fight the Earl, his sword shattered and the Earl escaped. Everyone assumes the Earl ran off to go through with this wedding to Lady Winchester. Later, to their surprise, the Earl forces his way into the house and throws himself at Eug√©nie's feet: he declares that he loves her and has done everything in his power to set things right, including admitting to his uncle all that he's done, and calling off the other wedding. Initially Eug√©nie seems to be so near death that she hasn't even heard him, but at last she gathers \\"what bits of energy remain\\" to reply with a rejection of his offer for marriage: she has been too badly mistreated to ever forgive him. The Earl pleads, and tries to get the Baron or Madame Murer to back him up, but they side with Eug√©nie. At last the Earl delivers a rousing speech in which he argues that, if Eug√©nie won't marry him for her own sake, then at least she should wed him for the sake of their child. This argument moves the Baron and he agrees to grant Eug√©nie to the Earl; at which news Eug√©nie's attitude (and health) do a complete turnaround, and she gladly accepts the Earl's hand.

Its finer structure can be described in the language of quasi categories as an A‚àû-category. They are named after Kenji Fukaya who introduced the A_\\\\infty language first in the context of Morse homology Kenji Fukaya, Morse homotopy, A_\\\\infty category and Floer homologies, MSRI preprint No. 020-94 (1993), and exist in a number of variants. As Fukaya categories are A‚àû-categories, they have associated derived categories, which are the subject of the celebrated homological mirror symmetry conjecture of Maxim KontsevichKontsevich, Maxim, Homological algebra of mirror symmetry, Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians, Vol. 1, 2 (Z√ºrich, 1994), 120‚Äì139, Birkh√§user, Basel, 1995.. This conjecture has been computationally verified for a number of comparatively simple examples. Formal Definition Let (X, \\\\omega) be a symplectic manifold. For each pair of Lagrangian submanifolds L_0, L_1 \\\\subset X , suppose they intersect transversely, then define the Floer cochain complex CF^*(L_0, L_1) which is a module generated by intersection points L_0 \\\\cap L_1 . The Floer cochain complex is viewed as the set of morphisms from L_0 to L_1 . The Fukaya category is an A_\\\\infty category, meaning that besides ordinary compositions, there are higher composition maps : \\\\mu_d: CF^* (L_{d-1}, L_d) \\\\otimes CF^* (L_{d-2}, L_{d-1})\\\\otimes \\\\cdots \\\\otimes CF^*( L_1, L_2) \\\\otimes CF^* (L_0, L_1) \\\\to CF^* ( L_0, L_d). It is defined as follows. Choose a compatible almost complex structure J on the symplectic manifold (X, \\\\omega) . For generators p_{d-1 d}, \\\\ldots, p_{0 1} of the cochain complexes on the left, and any generator q_{0 d} of the cochain complex on the right, the moduli space of J -holomorphic polygons with d+ 1 faces with each face mapped into L_0, L_1, \\\\ldots, L_d has a count : n(p_{d-1 d}, \\\\ldots, p_{0 1}; q_{0 d}) in the coefficient ring. Then define : \\\\mu_d ( p_{d-1 d}, \\\\ldots, p_{0 1} ) = \\\\sum_{q_{0 d} \\\\in L_0 \\\\cap L_d} n(p_{d-1 d}, \\\\ldots, p_{0 1}) \\\\cdot q_{0 d} \\\\in CF^*(L_0, L_d) and extend \\\\mu_d in a multilinear way. The sequence of higher compositions \\\\mu_1, \\\\mu_2, \\\\ldots, satisfy the A_\\\\infty relation because the boundaries of various moduli spaces of holomorphic polygons correspond to configurations of degenerate polygons.

Mullins (born Michael John Mullins on 9 November 1953) is an English lead vocalist, backing singer, and songwriter, best known as the lead singer of Salsa band Modern Romance (1982‚Äì85). Modern Romance achieved eight Top 40 singles and two hit albums. After the band called it quits in 1985, Mullins continued working within the music industry, most notably as a backing singer for Cliff Richard: he can be seen singing with Cliff Richard live on Top of the Pops, on the Christmas number one single, \\"Mistletoe and Wine\\" (1988).Lee-Williams, Matt: Modern Romance, Biography, Internet Movie Database [accessed] 27 April 2011. Mullins has since performed with Alan Parsons as part of The Alan Parsons Project.Bluebear's Music Vault: World Liberty Concert: Alan Parsons and Friends, Sat 3 January 2009 [accessed 14 April 2012] Early music (1981‚Äì82) Mullins began his music career as a backing vocalist and musician for Modern Romance. He is thanked for providing the vocals and guitar of their debut album, Adventures in Clubland (1981). During this time he also appeared with the band on episodes of Top of the Pops, and provided further vocals on their single, \\"By the Way (I'm Still in Love with You)\\" (1982). The lead singer for Modern Romance was, at the time, Geoff Deane, who had formed the band with David Jaymes, two remnants of punk rock band The Leighton Buzzards. Modern Romance had reached No. 1 in Venezuela with Adventures in Clubland ‚Äì which also earned them a Gold Disc there ‚Äì and had scored four UK hits, Mullins often lending his vocals and talents as a musician to their live TV appearances and studio work. However, in 1982, Deane would leave the band to pursue a solo career. Modern Romance (1982‚Äì85) Following the departure of Geoff Deane in late 1982, the Jaymes/Deane era came to an end, and Mullins took over as Lead vocalist for Modern Romance. Their first single ‚Äì in what would become known as the Jaymes/Mullins era ‚Äì climbed the UK charts, reaching the top-five. \\"Best Years of our Life\\" ‚Äì which peaked at No. 4 in the UK ‚Äì would be the band's highest charting single. They quickly followed with the similar sounding single, \\"High Life\\", which climbed to the No. 8 position. Modern Romance were holding their own with bands such as Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet, and a myriad TV and magazine appearances followed. They were regulars on Top of the Pops and made an appearance at the Royal Variety Performance. Modern Romance subsequently released their second studio album titled Trick of the Light (1983). The album was a success, reaching No. 53 on the UK Album Chart, and one significant change was the re-recording of the single \\"Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White\\" [New Version] (the new recording of this version was included on both Trick of the Light and Party Tonight) with Mullins lending the song his softer vocals. The album itself has since made it into the Taschen book, 1000 Record Covers, that showcases the most interesting and original vinyl cover art from the 1960s ‚Äì 1990s (Mullins and David Jaymes grace the front cover of the album).Ochs, Michael, 1000 Record Covers, Taschen, 25th Edition, 2005, pp.700.

Despite Modern Romance being an established name in pop music, it seemed that David Jaymes and Mullins would remain generally at the forefront, their faces appearing on the majority of the record and magazine covers. Vinyl Picture discs of the singles \\"High Life\\" (1983) and \\"Don't Stop That Crazy Rhythm\\" (1983) indeed featured the faces and signatures of both Jaymes and Mullins (one on each side), as did the posters included with these singles. The pair also appeared in an article for the Tucker's Luck TV annual titled Best 1980s Artifact; Mullins (and Jaymes) appeared alongside Nick Heyward of Haircut One Hundred, Boy George of Culture Club, Simon Le Bon of Duran Duran, and Steve Norman of Spandau Ballet.Lee-Williams, Matt: Jaymes, David, Biography, Internet Movie Database [accessed] 27 April 2011.Tucker's Luck Annual, IPC Publishing, 1983, Tucker's Luck: The Books [accessed] 27 April, 20.11. By now, Mullins was prominent enough in the industry to make personal appearances on show like Mike Read's Pop Quiz, whilst the band as a whole enjoyed live performances on TV shows hosted by Kenny Everett, Russell Harty, and The Krankies. By Christmas 1983 they were ready to release the album, Party Tonight, a compilation containing all the band's hits from both the Jaymes/Deane era and the Jaymes/Mullins era, as well as a handful of cover versions and B-sidess. Party Tonight (1983) ‚Äì produced by Tony Visconti and released in the UK on the Ronco label ‚Äì made a significant dent on the UK Albums Chart, cracking the Top-50 at No. 45. Mullins' vocals could also be heard ‚Äì along with the rest of the band ‚Äì across the radio waves, as jingles for the Radio 1 evening show were adapted from various Modern Romance hits. The single, \\"Good Friday\\" / \\"Good Feelings\\" [re-mix] was released simultaneously and reached the UK No. 96 position. Both Party Tonight and Good Friday shared the same cover art, a photo still captured from the band's 1983 ITV advert for Party Tonight. It was around this time that band member John Du Prez went his own way and, taking stock of the poor success of the single Good Friday, Modern Romance decided it was time for a change in both image and music style. The mid-1980s, however, were not as kind to the band. Modern Romance began with a new look, Mullins and the band now sporting long hair and leather jackets.Just My Imagination, Single Cover Photo, 1984.Burn It!, Album Cover Photo, 1984. The first single released alongside the band's new image was a cover version of the song \\"Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)\\" (1984): the single failed to chart, as did their third studio album, Burn It! (1984), and its subsequent singles: \\"Burn It!\\" (1984), \\"That's What Friends Are For\\" (1984) and \\"Move On\\" (1984). The album was produced by Tony Visconti and featured additional percussion by Luis Jardim. They released a cover version of \\"Tarzan Boy\\" and finally the anthology single, \\"Best Mix of Our Lives\\" (1985), which contained the hit singles \\"Everybody Salsa\\", \\"Ay Ay Ay Ay Moosey\\", \\"High Life\\", \\"Don't Stop That Crazy Rhythm\\", and \\"Best Years of Our Lives\\". \\"Best Mix of Our Lives\\" reached No. 81 on the UK chart. It was reported in a 1985 edition of The Sun that Mullins was to quit Modern Romance.The Sun, 1985, Newspaper, Bizarre Page [issue unknown].

Biography Fonrouge was born in Lomas de Zamora, a suburb south of Buenos Aires, to Dolores Segu√≠ and Alberto Marcelo Fonrouge; the latter served as Mayor of Lomas de Zamora, and died in 1929. Fonrouge earned a Law Degree at the University of Buenos Aires. He specialized in commercial and criminal law, and became an active civic booster for Lomas de Zamora and its surroundings, opening the first clinic in Villa Centenario (one of the district's more disadvantaged areas) in 1940 and later establishing the local chapters of the Breadmakers' and Taxi Drivers' Unions. He inaugurated his first law office in 1948 in Lomas de Zamora, and later opened offices in downtown Buenos Aires, Ca√±uelas, and La Plata. He married Ang√©lica Aranda, and they had five children. Fonrouge acted as defense attorney to numerous Peronists and others persecuted in the aftermath of the 1955 overthrow of the populist President Juan Per√≥n. Following a schism in the Conservative Party convention in 1957, Fonrouge and his law partner, Vicente Solano Lima, co- founded the Popular Conservative Party. Their party platform differed from their Conservative Party colleagues in that they supported most of Per√≥n's social reforms, as well as the lifting of the ban order on Peronism itself. They were consequently banned from fielding candidates in the 1958 and 1963 general elections, and instead endorsed the UCRI and MID via an alliance with two leading developmentalist figures, Santa Fe Province Governor Carlos Sylvestre Begnis and President Arturo Frondizi. He was a frequent guest commentator on Channel 13, and in 1966 was named Man of the Year by Gente magazine. As one of the leading non-Peronist advocates for both the lifting of the ban on Peronism as well as for allowing Per√≥n himself to return from exile, Fonrouge participated in many of the negotiations held between the Argentine Government and Per√≥n at the latter's Puerta de Hierro (Madrid) residence. His efforts led to his appointment as Secretary General and chief counsel for the FREJULI alliance, formed by Per√≥n's Justicialist Party and its alles (including Fonrouge's Popular Conservatives) ahead of the March 1973 general elections. The FREJULI alliance won in a landslide, and Fonrouge was elected to the Argentine Senate for the Province of Buenos Aires, the nation's largest; he was sworn in on May 3, 1973.Senado de la Naci√≥n (search for Fonrouge, Alberto Mar√≠a) Remaining active in his community, among Fonrouge's accomplishments as Senator was the establishment of the University of Lomas de Zamora in 1974. He also maintained a good working relationship with Ricardo Balb√≠n, the longtime head of the Peronists' chief congressional opposition, the centrist UCR. He and Balb√≠n were specifically recommended by the dying Per√≥n (now in his last term in office as president) to his wife and successor, Isabel, as reliable sources of advice once she took office; he died in July 1974. Mrs. Per√≥n, however, relied primarily on her fascist astrologer, Jos√© L√≥pez Rega, instead, and amid mounting chaos a March 1976 coup ended both her presidency and the tenures of all elected officials at the time; Fonrouge was reportedly the only Senator who was allowed to retrieve his belongings from his Senate offices undisturbed by military guards. Fonrouge, as he had after the 1955 coup, became one of the most prominent defense attorneys to jailed Peronists during the Dirty War, and in 1982 was named chief counsel for the Buenos Aires Province Justicialist Party; among his more notable clients in prison at the time was the deposed Governor of Chaco Province, Deolindo Bittel. Bittel was later nominated for the Vice Presidency, albeit unsuccessfully, when elections were ultimately called in 1983. Fonrouge later taught at the Universities of Buenos Aires, del Salvador, and John F. Kennedy. He was offered a post as a Supreme Court Justice in 1990 by President Carlos Menem, but declined the nomination. He continued to teach constitutional law until age 88, and served as a member in the Carlos Pellegrini Commission (a historical society devoted to the former president from 1890 to 1892). Fonrouge relocated to scenic La Falda, C√≥rdoba upon his retirement, and died in 2012 at age 99.

The film was directed by Ye≈üim Ustaoƒülu. It is based on a novel by Georgios Andreadis titled Tamama. The film was produced by Setarh Farsi, Helge Albers and Behrooz Hashemian. The film was nominated in Montr√©al World Film Festival 2004. Plot The neighbor¬¥s son Mehmet is worried about the elderly woman Ayshe, and he likes hearing her stories. When Ayshe¬¥s older sister dies she refuses to be with the other villager and starts searching for her younger brother in Greece. Waiting for the Clouds takes place in 1975 and Mehmet¬¥s experience is based on the directors memory from the 70s. And the character Ayshe would not have had to keep her ethnic identity a secret for 50 years if she had lived in a tolerant environment. Hiding ethnic identity The character of Ayshe was born Eleni, daughter of indigenous Greeks in the eastern Black Sea region of Northern Turkey, what was once the ancient country of Pontus. She was adopted by a Turkish Muslim family in the World War I. Fear is the reason that Ayshe never spoke of her ethnic past again. In the 70s Turkey the government did put a lot of pressure on the ordinary lives. If there had been tolerance, Ayshe would not have had to keep her ethnic identity a secret for 50 years. But in 1970s Turkey, paranoia and a fear of ‚Äúothers‚Äù was on the rise while tolerance toward minority ethnic groups diminished. Boundaries and Ties The movie has many commonalities with a series of movies by the renowned film maker Theodoros Angelopoulos: the borders and their impact on the lives of human beings ‚Äì as in The Suspended Step of the Stork; a tedious Odyssean search for a family member ‚Äì as in Landscape in the Mist; the long-lost identity and the fusion of different cultures ‚Äì as in Ulysses' Gaze and The Suspended Step of the Stork. The similarities are not limited to the content and themes; they also include the form and style of the movie: carefully composed scenes and an enormous number of extended long shots.http://press.princeton.edu/titles/6074.html. But there are telling differences as well. In Waiting for the Clouds, Ustaoglu tends to emphasize on the idea of distance, whereas Angelopolous emphasizes on the journey. We barely see Ayshe on the journey; rather, we see her at two different destinations. She belongs to a generation which has gone through the ordeal of Population exchange between Greece and Turkey, and has never managed to fully recover from that emotional wound. When she finally decides to overcome her fears and inhibitions and go to find her lost brother, she trespasses a number of boundaries. We don‚Äôt see her cross the physical boundary, the border, ‚Äì unlike Angelopolous ‚Äì but her crossing the imagined boundaries that she had created for herself is manifest. ‚ÄúThe objective properties of the community are less important than the imagined ones.‚ÄùDragonas, Thalia G. and Bar-On, Dan. (2000). \\"National Identity among a Neighboring Quartet: The Case of Greeks, Turks, Israelis, and Palestinians.\\" page 336. Deep in her subconscious, she imagines herself belonging to another nation, another community, and another language. But when she ventures outside her little home in the small village, she gets to see that what she had imagined to be her true community, is as strange to her as it gets. She goes back to Turkey, but she is not the same person anymore. She seems like she has put a huge burden off her shoulder. She begins to smile.

Before the era of mobile phones, these used to refer to the tapping of phone lines via a method called wiretapping. Wiretapping has now been replaced by software that monitors the cell phones of users. While mobile phone surveillance has been carried out by large organizations for a long time, especially for clues of illegal activities, more and more such surveillance is now carried out by individuals for personal reasons. For example, a parent may become a \\"text spy\\" in order to monitor a child's texting activity. This brings in the moral, ethical and legal question of who owns people's privacy.  Prevalence  According to a 2007 American Management Association report, computer monitoring takes form ranges from keyboard(45%), files(43%), blogosphere(12%) to social networking sites(10%). No newer data is available on the number of phone surveillance carried out currently.  Phone surveillance software  Phone surveillance in now more commonly carried out on cell phones.

The story goes that as Shivaji was passing that way some of his foragers had been killed by the garrison, prompting him to occupy Bellary; but he restored it again to the Hande Nayakas at once on condition that tribute should be paid to him. * 1685 AD :Bellary fell to the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb's campaign in the Deccan ). * 1724 AD :Asif Jah I, who was the Subedar of Gujarat and Malwa, defeated and killed the Delhi sponsored Mobariz Khan, the Subedar of the Deccan, at the battle fought at Shakar Kheda in the district of Berar. :Soon after, Asif Jah I assumed independence from Mughal control to establish Hyderabad as a separate state, beginning the Asaf Jahi dynasty. Asif Jah I assumed the title Nizam-ul-mulk, and Bellary was included in the Nizam's Dominion. * 1761 AD :Bellary became tributary to Basalat Jang, the brother of the then Nizam Salabat Jang and the Subedar of Aadavaani (Adoni) and Raichur. * 1769 AD :The Hande Nayaka of Bellary refused to pay tribute to Basalat Jang, which prompted him to occupy Bellary. The Nayaka then pleaded for Hyder Ali of Mysuru (Mysore) to rescue Bellary. Hyder Ali forcefully expelled the occupiers, after which the Hande Nayakas were tributary to him. * 1792 AD :At the partition of Tipu Sultan's territory by the British after the Third Anglo-Mysore War, the district was given to the then Nizam Asif Jah II. * 1800 AD :After the defeat and death of Tipu Sultan in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War at Srirangapattanam (Seringapatam), the Mysore territories were further divided up between the Wodeyars, Asif Jah II and the British. :In 1796 AD, Asaf Jah II, harassed by the Marathas and Tipu Sultan, had opted to get British military protection under Lord Wellesley's doctrine of Subsidiary Alliance. As part of this agreement, Asif Jah II ceded a large portion of the acquired territory including Bellary, to the British, with the consent of the Hande Nayakas to be added to the Madras Presidency as 'Bellary District'. This area was also known as the Ceded Districts, a term still used for the areas, and was considerably larger than the present district, including the present districts of Kadapa (Cuddapah), Anantapuram and much of Karnoolu (Kurnool). * 1800‚Äì1807 AD :All through these political changes since Vijayanagar times, the Hande Nayakas were the de facto rulers of Bellary ‚Äì while their masters constantly changed, locally their powers were absolute. All this changed with the arrival of Major Thomas Munro, the first collector of the Ceded Districts (1800‚Äì1807), who disposed of the eighty palayagars (Polygars) of the districts either with pensions or assimilation of their estates and established the Ryotwari system ‚Äì land revenue collected directly from the tiller of the soil. *1808 AD :The ceded districts area was split into two districts, Bellary and Kadapa. The Bellary area was still larger than Kadapa and the second largest district in Madras Presidency, measuring 13000 square miles (nearly twice the size of Wales), and a population of 1,250,000 (one and half times that of Wales). *1840 AD :Bellary became the headquarters of the district. The Collector until this year lived in Anantapuram. * 1867 AD :The Bellary Municipal Council was created, along with the Adoni Municipal Council. These were the only two municipal townships in the whole of Bellary district for a long time. * 1882 AD :Seven of the southern talukas were was carved out to form Anantapuram district, further reducing the size of Bellary District. :The Maratha princely state of Sandur was surrounded by Bellary district. * 1894 AD :A steam cotton-spinning mill was established. * 1901 AD :Bellary was the seventh largest town in Madras Presidency, and was one of the chief military stations in Southern India, garrisoned by British and native Indian troops under the British Indian Government. A company of the Southern Mahratta Railway Volunteer Rifles was also stationed in the town. :The town included a civil railway station to the east of the Bellary Fort, the cantonment and its railway station on the west, the Cowl Bazar and the suburbs of 'Bruce-pettah' (currently spelt Brucepet) and 'Mellor-pettah', named after two British officers once stationed in the town. : The town was also headquarters for the Roman Catholic Mission and the London Mission. : The industries in the town included a small distillery and two steam cotton- presses. The steam cotton-spinning mill established in 1894 had 17,800 spindles, and employed 520 hands. * 1 October 1953 ADA 1951 map showing Bellary district in Madras State :Bellary district of Madras State was divided on linguistic basis. :Areas with significant Kannada speaking populations (Harapanahalli, Hadagali, Kudligi, Hosapete, Sanduru and Siruguppa) were transferred to Mysore state, which would later become Karnataka state. :Areas of the district with significant Telugu speaking populations (Yemmiganuru, Aadavaani, Aaluru, Raayadurgam, D.Hirehaalu, Kanekallu, Bommanahaalu, Gummagatta) were merged into Anantapuram and Karnulu districts in what would later become Andhra Pradesh state. :Bellary city was the one and only city with both Kannada and Telugu speaking population in large numbers, was included into Mysore state after a protracted debate and controversy. * 1997 AD :With the re-organisation of the districts in Karnataka, Harapanahalli taluk was transferred to Davanagere district, reducing the number of talukas in the district to seven. * 2004 AD : Bellary City Municipal Council was upgraded to a City Corporation. * 2018 AD Harapanahalli taluk was again transferred back to Bellary District References=MapsGeneral=External links * Official Website of Bellary City Corporation Category:Bellary Category:History of Karnataka Category:Histories of cities in India ","title":"History of Bellary"},{"id":"31598986","text":"Eli Krog (n√©e Meyer) (1891-1970) was a Norwegian publicist, translator and author.

It is located east of the River Elbe on the upper edge of the valley between Schmilka and Bad Schandau in the Schrammsteinen. The Teufelsturm is also referred to as the \\"Symbol of Saxon Climbing\\".Richter, 1993, p. 96, 98  Origin of the name  The oldest name for the peak is probably Butterweck (\\"Bread and butter\\") or Butterweckfels, because the summit bears a certain resemblance to a bread roll when seen from a distance, such as from the other bank of the Elbe. The name Teufelsturm was already being used by Wilhelm Leberecht G√∂tzinger in his descriptions of Saxon Switzerland, where he mentioned it as a sundial by the farmers on the plateaux around Sch√∂na and Reinhardtsdorf. The shadow thrown by the Teufelsturm on the rock face behind it - when seen from the direction of Reinhardtsdorf-Sch√∂na - disappears around midday exactly behind the rock tower, which is therefore also called the Mittagstein or Mittagfels (i.e. \\"Midday Rock\\"). Another name is Campanile, probably derived from similarly named summits in the Dolomites and the Brenta, so-named because of their smooth rock faces and generally rectangular structure of the tower. The name most used today, Teufelsturm (\\"Devil's Tower\\") probably arose due to the difficulty of climbing the rock tower.Heinicke, S. 176  Rock climbing  At the beginning of the 20th century, the Teufelsturm was one of the most difficult climbing rocks in Saxon Switzerland. On 9 September 1906, Oliver Perry-Smith made the first successful ascent on the Alter Weg, today classified as climbing grade VIIb or, without support, VIIc (Saxon scale). This achievement was the high point of the first development period for the Saxon Switzerland Climbing RegionRichter, 1962, p. 75 and was then described as \\"the most difficult climbing in Saxon Switzerland\\".Fehrmann, p. 221 In the 1930s, the valley side (Talseite) of the Teufelsturm was seen as one of the last, great, sport climbing challenges in Saxon Switzerland, after initial attempts, including one by Emanuel Strubich, had come to naught in the 1920s. In 1936, Rudolf Stolle finally climbed it for the first time. Today it is graded as a VIIIb climb.Heinicke, p. 179 Its ascent remains disputed, because the first climber, both in the lower section as well as at the key point, used a safety ring and thus supported himself over the key point (he used a human climbing tree (Steigbaum). An important first climb was the ascent in 1965 of the Ostwand (\\"East Face\\", grade VIIIc) by Kurt Richter. In the 1970s and 1980s, Bernd Arnold climbed the Sonnenuhr (1977, IXa) and the Teufelei (1984, Xa) routes, whose difficulties made them among the top achievements of their day. The most important route has to be the Pferdefu√ü. First conquered in 1984 by Werner Sch√∂nlebe, it runs along a prominent edge and is climbed in red point style and is classified as grade Xc. In 2007, Heinz Zak first used a Highline from the Teufelsturm to the neighbouring massif,http://news.climbing.de/highline-auf-den-teufelsturm/ which led to discussions about the sense and purpose of trendy types of sport in Saxon Switzerland.

Life and career Bonelli was born George Richard Bunn to Martin and Ida Bunn of Port Byron, New York. His family later moved to Syracuse and soon George preferred to be called Richard. Prior to deciding on a career in music, Bonelli was a friend of race car driver and later mayor of Salt Lake City, Ab Jenkins. Bonelli studied at Syracuse University and his voice teachers included Arthur Alexander in Los Angeles, Jean de Reszke and William Valonat in Paris. Bonelli with his wife 1920‚Äì1925 Bonelli's operatic debut came on April 21, 1915 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music as Valentin in Gounod's Faust. He toured with the San Carlo Opera Company between 1922 and 1924. In 1923 he made his European debut as Dardano in Catalani's Dejanice during the Carnevale season in Modena, Italy. He returned to Europe in 1924 to sing at the Monte Carlo Opera and was eventually engaged by the Th√©√¢tre de la Ga√Æt√© in Paris. Between 1925 and 1931 Bonelli performed with the Chicago Opera Company and between 1926 and 1942 frequently performed at the San Francisco Opera. His Chicago debut in 1925 was in the role of Germont in Verdi's La traviata with Claudia Muzio (Violetta) and Antonio Cortis (Alfredo). His debut role in San Francisco was Figaro in Rossini's Il barbiere di Siviglia, after appearing in Flotow's Martha at the Los Angeles Grand Opera earlier in September 1926. Seizing the opportunity of a one-year collapse of Chicago Civic Opera, the Met impresario Giulio Gatti- Casazza quickly engaged Bonelli for leading baritone roles in New York. His first performance with the Metropolitan Opera was on 29 November 1932, again as Rossini's Figaro, at the company's tour to Philadelphia. (It was also the role for his last Met stage performance on 14 March 1945.) The cast included Lily Pons (Rosina), Tito Schipa (Count Almaviva), and Ezio Pinza (Don Basilio). Bonelli's New York Metropolitan Opera debut came on December 1, 1932 as Giorgio Germont in Verdi's La traviata opposite Rosa Ponselle as Violetta and Tito Schipa as Alfredo. He remained on the Met's active roster until 1945, making his final performance as Rossini's Figaro on March 14 that year. He was the Tonio in the first ever live telecast of opera, from the Met on March 10, 1940 alongside Hilda Burke and Armand Tokatyan. He returned to the Met in 1966 as an honored guest at the 'Gala Farewell' marking the last performance by the Metropolitan Opera in the old opera house at Broadway and 39th Street, before moving to the Lincoln Center. Of his many roles, Bonelli was known best for his Verdi repertory as Giorgio Germont, Di Luna, Renato, Rigoletto and Amonasro, and also for his portrayals of Valentin in Gounod's Faust, Wolfram in Wanger's Tannh√§user, Tonio in Leoncavallo's Pagliacci, Rossini's Figaro, Enrico Ashton in Donizetti's Lucia and Sharpless in Puccini's Madama Butterfly. In Italy, he performed under the name Riccardo Bonelli. He also appeared in two movies; a supporting role in 1935's Enter Madame and a cameo appearance in 1941's The Hard-Boiled Canary. After retiring from singing, Bonelli became a successful voice teacher at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara, and in New York. Among his students were Frank Guarrera, Enrico Di Giuseppe, Lucine Amara, and Norman Mittelmann. In 1949 when Edward Johnson retired from his position of general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, Bonelli was a contender for the job though it ultimately went to Rudolf Bing. Bonelli's favorite baritone was Titta Ruffo. American baritone Robert Merrill had stated that Bonelli was his inspiration to study singing, after hearing him perform the Count di Luna at the Met alongside Giovanni Martinelli and Elisabeth Rethberg in 1936. Even after retiring from teaching, he periodically performed on stage into his 80s. His later appearances were more on the West Coast of the United States. He was actor Robert Stack's uncle. Bonelli died in Los Angeles on June 7, 1980 at the age of 91. References * Richard Bonelli (Baritone) ‚Äì Short Biography ‚Äì biography on Bonelli (retrieved April 26, 2011) * Charles A.

His father was a noted plant enthusiast and owned an extensive garden, so that Eduard was encouraged to choose the same career and accordingly began as apprentice at the market garden of Herr B√∂ckmann in Hamburg on 1 May 1844. Here he served out 3 years of apprenticeship until December 1847. To round off his education he visited the renowned nurseries of Berlin, Potsdam, Magdeburg, Leipzig, Dresden, Erfurt and Hanover, and on 1 March 1848 started as assistant at Andrew Henderson & Co., Pineapple Place Nursery in London. Chatsworth House In May 1849 he joined the staff at Chatsworth House, country seat of the Duke of Devonshire, boasting a famous garden of great splendour, with elaborate water works, a giant fountain, an enormous conservatory and an important collection of orchids and other botanical treasures. William Cavendish, the incumbent Duke, was a passionate gardener and collector who had inherited the title in 1811. The designer of the sumptuous grounds and residence was gardener and architect Joseph Paxton, who entrusted young Eduard with the care of Victoria regia which in 1849 existed in England only as a few seedlings raised by the Royal Botanic Garden at Kew. Three of the seedlings were donated to Chatsworth, Syon House and Regent's Park, and competition was intense for the honour of coaxing from this waterlily the first blossom in Europe. On the evening of 8 November 1849, Ortgies could report to the Duke that the first bud was about to open. The news was wired to Queen Victoria and to the botanists Hooker, John Lindley, George Bentham who were invited to Chatsworth. This illustrious gathering attended the opening of the second bud. left Louis van Houtte, the Ghent horticulturist who established a garden that soon became world famous and who founded the illustrated gardening journal Flore des Serres et des Jardins de l'Europe, was wildly enthusiastic about being the first on the Continent to cultivate Victoria regia. The head of his cultivation section, Benedikt Roezl, later famous as an orchid hunter, had met Ortgies in 1848 in London. Van Houtte urged Roezl to write to Ortgies and beg a seedling of Victoria and, if Paxton would agree, to employ Ortgies as head of the culture of aquatics and orchids. At that time Paxton was inundated with requests, but immediately agreed to the proposal, feeling that Ortgies, as keeper of the Victoria, should be first in line for the new seedlings. On 1 April 1850 Ortgies reported for duty at van Houtte's garden and a conservatory to his design was constructed for the Victoria. On 5 September the first flower opened, amidst a host of Nymphaea species in full bloom. Ortgies crossed Nymphaea dentata with N. rubra to produce the first Nymphaea hybrid ever, illustrated in Flore des serres 8 t. 775, 776 under the name Nymphaea ortgiesiano-rubra. Later he managed to coax the Australian Nymphaea gigantea into flowering and setting seed. In the spring of 1851 Ortgies was transferred to the office and placed in charge of German and English correspondence, and the compiling of catalogues, while carrying on with supervising the aquatic and orchid cultures. During this period Ortgies made business trips to England, Germany, Denmark and other European countries, creating a large circle of acquaintances and friends. In the summer of 1855 he agreed to become Head Gardener of what is now the Old Botanical Garden, Z√ºrich, though he found it very difficult to take his leave of the van Houtte family to whom he had grown close. Nymphaea hybrid ortgiesiano-rubra Flore des Serres et des Jardins de l'Europe His predecessor in Zurich had been the energetic Eduard August von Regel, who took up the respected position of director of the Imperial Botanic Garden in St. Petersburg. The Zurich Botanical Garden was poorly subsidised, necessitating the sale of plants and seed in order to cover its running costs. Ortgies was able to raise more than enough money for this purpose, so that the Garden was able to carry out urgently needed renovation of the old conservatories, start the building of new conservatories, improve the water supply, and create an Alpine rock garden. As reward for his efforts, Ortgies received the title of Inspector and a considerable increase in his salary. Ortgies was interested in acquiring new or rare plants, and for this his contacts abroad were ideal. This project caused seemingly endless problems for Ortgies, though it brought financial security to the Garden, an enormous diversity of plants, especially orchids, and a greatly enhanced reputation in and outside Switzerland. Arranged through Ortgies, collections by Roezl streamed onto the Zurich plant market. Roezl managed a huge import nursery, holding auctions in London with business contacts in most European gardens. That Roezl had become affluent was in no small part due to his friend Ortgies. His part in Roezl's success led to his being approached by the collector Gustav Wallis whose contracts with Jean Linden and Veitch Nurseries had been terminated. Ortgies acted as his agent for a few years, but Wallis fell ill and went into a gradual decline up to his 1878 death at the hospital of Guayaquil. Wallis was followed by Lehmann in Colombia and Ricardo Pfau in Costa Rica - both shipped their most interesting plants to the Zurich Botanical Garden. There was also Fuchs in Guatemala, Garnier in Cuba, Gaibrois and Bruchm√ºller in Colombia, and Besserer in Mexico. After 38 years with the Botanical Garden, Ortgies retired to Kilchberg to be with his family. http://www.victoria- adventure.org/water_gardening/biographies/ortgies_gartenflora_1894_english.html References Category:1829 births Category:1916 deaths Category:German gardeners Category:Botanists with author abbreviations ","title":"Eduard Ortgies"},{"id":"31599044","text":"Plan of the sites of the Federal Garden Show Park at Ehrenbreitstein Electoral Palace Blumenhof at Deutsches Eck Koblenz Cable Car Aerial view of core area Ehrenbreitstein The Federal Horticultural Show 2011 () was held from 15 April to 16 October 2011 in Koblenz, Germany. It was the first Federal Horticultural Show in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. Venues had been the plateau in front of the Ehrenbreitstein Fortress, the square in front of the Electoral Palace and flower beds in the area around the Deutsches Eck. One of its attractions was the cable car over the Rhine, which was established as an ecologically sound transport connection. It connects the Rhine shores near the Basilica of St. Kastor with the plateau in front of the fortress. Unlike previous garden shows, the staging area in Koblenz was mainly in the centre of the city and directly affected the local population. In addition to the prestige of hosting a Federal Horticultural Show, Koblenz benefited to a much greater extent from the associated urban development. Planning and funding In 2001/2002, Koblenz applied to be a venue for a Federal Horticultural Show in 2013 or 2015. Duisburg had been awarded the show for 2011, but it withdrew from its commitment. In January 2004, the National Gardening Association (Zentralverband Gartenbau, ZVG) awarded the 2011 event to Koblenz. After discussions with the state of Rhineland-Palatinate on the financing of the project, the City Council made a final commitment on 27 January 2005 to host the Federal Garden Show in 2011. The total budget had been expected to amount to ‚Ç¨ 102 million, of which ‚Ç¨ 49 million had been provided by the state and ‚Ç¨ 28 million by the city of Koblenz. The rest of the funds were to be raised from sponsorship and from the entry fees of the expected attendance of at least two million visitors. By the summer of 2007, ideas had been sought and a preliminary plan had been completed. The ground breaking ceremony was celebrated in the city at the Electoral Palace on 20 July 2008, 999 days before the start of the National Garden Festival. Logo and slogan  The Logo of the Federal Horticultural Show 2011 presents a colourful kaleidoscope in the form of a twist, which is intended to represent intense viewing. It is meant to symbolise the city‚Äôs energy in its preparations for the Federal Horticultural Show, as well as referring to the playful elements of a happy and colourful festival. The garden show‚Äôs slogan is \\"Koblenz transformed\\". Core areas  There were three core areas for the Federal Horticultural Show 2011: In the inner city there was the area around the Electoral Palace, there had been flower beds at the Deutsches Eck, and on the right (eastern) bank there was the area located on the plateau of Ehrenbreitstein. These core areas had been fenced and were only accessible with a ticket. The largest area of 27 hectares was located on the plateau in front of Ehrenbreitstein fortress. This was a large landscape garden and formed the entrance to the fortress. Historically this forecourt allowed a \\"free field of fire\\", which was needed to defend the fortress at that time. The main axis runs from the top station of the cable car to the entrance of Ehrenbreitstein fortress as a diagonal through the garden on the plateau. In this field, there was a forest of orchids, abandoned vineyards, an arid biotope, old orchards and gardens, rare species of bats and habitats for endangered species at the edges of the slope. The grounds around the Electoral Palace has an area of 8.6 hectares. It is the largest palace complex in the Middle Rhine area and its garden is integrated into the city. There is a restaurant in the castle. The garden behind the palace was restored to the historical Lenn√© scheme. The entire complex had been made up of diverse species of plants, water features, fountains, radial steps and walls for sitting on. It reflects the glory of the rulers who once resided here. The flower beds on the Deutsches Eck had been the smallest area with 2.2 hectares. They had been located behind the Deutsches Eck between Deutschherrenhaus and St. Kastor‚Äôs church. It was intended as a peaceful area for the enjoyment of secular and religious art. Art exhibitions and cultural events with sculptures and flower beds dominated this area, which was divided into three approximately equal-sized fields. In 2008, preparation of this site found the first archaeological evidence for a Roman settlement at Koblenz, following 150 years of fruitless searches.

It is said to inflict minor damage in the initial stage and might be mistaken for executable files of governmental organizations. This is the second attack claimed by Iran after the Stuxnet computer worm discovered in July 2010, which targeted industrial software and equipment. Researchers came to believe that the Stars virus found by Iranian computer specialists was the Duqu virus. The Duqu virus keylogger was embedded in a JPEG file.

He played an active role in the 1595 Union of Brest of which he was a firm supporter. He was also a writer, polemist and theologian. Early life Adam Tyczkowicz was born on 12 April 1541 from a noble family. His father, Lev Tyczkowicz, was scribe of the Queen of Poland (Anna Jagiellon). His mother, Anna ≈Åosa, after the death of her husband, on about 1550, married the governor of areas of Smolensk. Prince Mikolaj \\"the Black\\" Radziwill took care of his education and sent him to a Calvinist school and later in the Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w. In 1572 Adam was secretary of king Sigismund II Augustus and in 1580 he was judge in Brest. In 1588 he was Castellan of Brest and a senator of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. In his youth, under the influence of Prince Radziwill, Adam converted to Calvinism, but about 1574, scared about the extremes of that denomination he returned to the Orthodox Church. In the same year he married Anna, of the dukes of Ho≈Çowni√≥w-Ostro≈ºeckich, with whom he had six children. Bishop After the death of his wife in 1592, he chose to become a monk, taking the religious name of Ipati (Hypatius). Thanks to the support of Prince Konstanty Wasyl Ostrogski, a close friend of his, he was appointed in 1593 as a bishop of the eparchy of Volodymyr-Brest and he was consecrated bishop on 6 June 1593on 27 May 1593 according to the Julian calendar by the hands of Mykhajlo Rohoza. Hypatius played a crucial role in the establishing of the Union of Brest by which the Ruthenian Church moved from the jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Constantinople to the jurisdiction of the Pope, thus forming the Ruthenian Uniate Church. He actually traveled to Rome, along with the Bishop of Lutzk Cyril Terlecki, to carry to Pope Clement VII the petition undersigned by the bishops in Brest on 12 June 1595 asking for the union: they arrived in Rome on 25 November 1595, obtained the approval of the Pope on the conditions that Byzantine rite, liturgical practices and the not-use of the filioque would be preserved and were back in Lutzk in March 1596. Metropolitan Hypatius Pociej was appointed new Metropolitan of Kiev in August 1599 by the will of king Sigismund III Vasa and he was confirmed by Pope Clement VIII on 15 November 1600. In 1601 he founded a seminary and on 3 March 1605 he was formally recognized as the only Byzantine Rite Metropolitan in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. On 11 July 1609 some Orthodox, who opposed the Union of Brest, attempted to his life, but without success. In 1611 he succeeded to appoint also a bishop favorable to the Union of Brest in the Eparchy of Przemy≈õl. He also worked on the restructuring of the Order of Saint Basil the Great. Potii died on 8 July 1613 in Volodymyr-Volynskyi and was buried in the cathedral of that town. Works Hypatius Pociej was also a writer, polemist and theologian. Among his works we have: \\"The Union, or an Exposition of the Articles\\" (1595), \\"Antirysis\\" (Anti-Discourse, 1599), \\"A Defense of the Council of Florence\\" (1603), and \\"Harmony, or the Agreement of Faiths\\" (1608).

PRDM9 is responsible for positioning recombination hotspots during meiosis by binding a DNA sequence motif encoded in its zinc finger domain. PRDM9 is the only speciation gene found so far in mammals, and is one of the fastest evolving genes in the genome. Domain Architecture Schematic of the PRDM9 Domain Architecture in mice PRDM9 has multiple domains including KRAB domain, SSXRD, PR/SET domain (H3K4 & H3K36 trimethyltransferase), and an array of C2H2 Zinc Finger domains (DNA binding).  History  In 1974 Jiri Forejt and P. Ivanyi identified a locus which they named Hst1 which controlled hybrid sterility. In 1982 a haplotype was identified controlling recombination rate wm7, which would later be identified as PRDM9. In 1991 a protein binding to the minisatelite consensus sequence 5‚Ä≤-CCACCTGCCCACCTCT-3‚Ä≤ was detected and partially purified (named Msbp3 - minisatelite binding protein 3). This would later turn out to be the same PRDM9 protein independently identified later. In 2005 a gene was identified (named Meisetz) that is required for progression through meiotic prophase and has H3K4 methyltransferase activity. In 2009 Jiri Forejt and colleagues identified Hst1 as Meisetz/PRDM9 - the first and so far only speciation gene in mammals. Later in 2009 PRDM9 was identified as one of the fastest evolving genes in the genome. In 2010 three groups independently identified PRDM9 as controlling the positioning of recombination hotspots in humans and mice. in 2012 it was shown that almost all hotspots are positioned by PRDM9 and that in its absence hotspots form near promoters. In 2014 it was reported that the PRDM9 SET domain could also trimethylate H3K36 in vitro, which was confirmed in vivo in 2016. In 2016 it was shown that the hybrid sterility caused by PRDM9 can be reversed and that the sterility is caused by asymmetric double strand breaks. Function in Recombination PRDM9 mediates the process of meiosis by directing the sites of homologous recombination. In humans and mice, recombination does not occur evenly throughout the genome but at particular sites along the chromosomes called recombination hotspots. Hotspots are regions of DNA about 1-2kb in length. There are approximately 30,000 to 50,000 hotspots within the human genome corresponding to one for every 50-100kb DNA on average. In humans, the average number of crossover recombination events per hotspot is one per 1,300 meioses, and the most extreme hotspot has a crossover frequency of one per 110 meioses. These hotspots are binding sites for the PRDM9 Zinc Finger array. Upon binding to DNA, PRDM9 catalyzes trimethylation of Histone 3 at lysine 4 and lysine 36. As a result, local nucleosomes are reorganized and through an unknown mechanism the recombination machinery is recruited to form double strand breaks.

In January 2017, the company was acquired by United Luck Consortium and then sold to Zhejiang Jinke for over USD 1 billion. History= Founding and early years  Outfit7 was founded by Samo and Iza Login, who had studied computer science in college and wanted to get into the mobile app business following the debut of the Apple App Store. In 2004, they invested $250,000 (‚Ç¨180,000) with six friends and set up on office in Ljubljana, Slovenia, where they developed some apps. Their first few attempts ‚Äî a soccer app, a travel guide to Iceland and a \\"wealth affirmation app\\" were unsuccessful. After six months of attempts, they developed a children's app called Talking Tom Cat, in which an animated cat named Tom would repeat in a \\"high-pitched helium squeak whatever is spoken into an iPhone's microphone\\" along with other reactions to feeding and petting.  Talking Tom and Friends  The Talking Tom and Friends franchise was created with the launch of the Talking Tom Cat app. It focused on anthropomorphic cats and dogs repeating things said to it by the user, before shifting focus to other apps such as endless-runner games, virtual pet games and the like. The franchise reached 300 million downloads 19 months after its launch. The app franchise then went on to hit one billion downloads in June 2013.

On 20 January 2017 it was announced in a press release that Outfit7 was sold to United Luck Holdings Consortium, a China-based group for US$1 billion. However, four days later, another press release indicated that United Luck would sell Outfit7 to a Chinese chemical company, Zhejiang Jinke Peroxide Company, which was renamed to Zhejiang Jinke Entertainment Culture Co.

In response to the alleged arson attacks on the American commercial agent in Lautoka, Viti Levu, the navy sent a warship to demand compensation for the attack from Seru Epenisa Cakobau, the Vunivalu of Bau and self-proclaimed Tui Viti (King of Fiji). Expedition The first incident that led to the American expedition was in 1849 when the house owned by agent John Brown Williams was hit by cannon fire and burned. The Fijians were allegedly celebrating Independence Day when cannonballs fell on the building. The second incident happened the same year as the expedition when, again, fire was to interrupt John Williams's duties. After another accidental fire on Nukulau destroyed his store and some Fijians looted it. , under Commander Edward B. Boutwell, was sent to monitor the unrest in October and her crew were landed on more than one occasion to protect American interests. When Commander Boutwell heard of the incidents involving William's house and store, he demanded US$5,000 in compensation from King Cakobau. This initial claim was supplemented by further claims totalling $45,000. The natives received a deadline saying if they failed to pay, a landing party of marines and sailors would be sent ashore to capture the king in the island's village. Fijian warriors put up some resistance and one American service man was killed and two were wounded. Ultimately the men of John Adams were successful in routing a contingent of natives from Lautoka but Cakobau and the survivors escaped capture. Cakobau's claim to be King of Fiji was by no means universally recognised by his fellow-chiefs, who jealously guarded the independence of their fiefdoms. His dilemma was that if he acknowledged the debt, he did not have sufficient funds to pay it, but that if he disclaimed it by saying that it fell under the jurisdiction of another chief, he would jeopardize his claim to the kingship, which he wanted foreign powers to recognize. He decided to bide his time, hoping that the Americans were only bluffing. A second Fiji expedition in 1858, involving the crew of , achieved clearer results, but in the end Cakobau never paid the debt.

Finding his wealth growing, Trimble paid less attention to his dry goods store, opening a warehouse and becoming involved in selling grain in the nearby village of Edison; as time passed, he also formed a bank. Possessed of a large lot along Iberia Street in Mount Gilead, Trimble chose to build his house on the property in 1853. Constructed of brick, and designed by the architectural firm of Miller and Smith, it is the largest and most elaborate house in the village, due largely to its unusually high degree of preservation. Few ornate Italianate houses built before the Civil War remain in the area, and the large lot makes the house even more prominent in Mount Gilead, one of Ohio's smallest county seats. Trimble lived in the house for twenty-five years; in April 1878, his investments in other businesses proved ruinous when those businesses failed, and he was forced to sell the house in his bankruptcy. For many years after this event, it was the home of Perry Cook and his family; they sold it to another family in the 1940s, and it was purchased from that family by the local Presbyterian church in 1982.

The Station Emmerich station is the German railway station closest to the Dutch border on the Arnhem-Oberhausen railway. It is served by CityNightLine/EuroNight, RE and RB services operated by DB. The station is largely used by freight and features both the Dutch and German voltages on most tracks. In the past all trains had to change from a Dutch to a German locomotive and vice versa at Emmerich, but now there are more Dual Voltage locomotives that can operate in many countries, so through running often happens now without stopping. The ICE from Amsterdam to Cologne, Frankfurt/Main and Basel all pass through the station without stopping. However the CityNightLine services stop here, even though not all of them have to change locomotives. With the introduction of ICE 3 trains in 2000 the service between the Netherlands and Emmerich stopped, as the CNL services can only be used by passengers boarding the train at Emmerich at night or leaving the train in the morning. From December 2005 Dutch train operator Syntus started a service at weekends 4x per day between Arnhem and Emmerich. The service was unsuccessful and ceased after just 6 months. In early 2014 platforms 1 and 2 were modernised, including new paving and a shelter to wait in.

She studied under Suv√©e, David and learned to paint miniatures from Jean-Baptiste Jacques Augustin Biography C√©sarine Henriette Flore Davin-Mirvault was born in Paris and while her family was not part of the aristocracy it was well connected due to the fact that her godfather was a count and her godmother a marquise. She was the daughter of a geographer-engineer. She studied under Suv√©e, David, and Augustin. She learned to paint miniatures from Augustin, although she was more focused on learning to teach painting. Davin-Mirvault was married to an ‚Äúinspecteur √• Parme‚Äù and had two daughters, however, her husband died in 1824, two years after her last exhibition. Career Davin- Mirvault‚Äôs career was typical of David‚Äôs female students because she was not celebrated during her lifetime, however, she was also not ignored by critics. Her main focus was portraiture, but she also painted miniatures and genre paintings. Her most renowned work is her Portrait of Antonio Bruni, which is on view at the Frick Collection in New York. Davin-Mirvault exhibited frequently between 1798 and 1822 as recorded in Salon catalogues. She received a medal de deuxi√©me classe in 1804 for a full length self-portrait. She also received a medal de premiere classe in 1814 for an entry. Around the same time as her husband‚Äôs death, Davin-Mirvault established a school of drawing and painting for women. Despite the school being well-attended, she died poor in 1844 while living in her oldest daughter‚Äôs house. Works Most of Davin- Mirvault‚Äôs portraits were small-scale as she was accustomed to painting miniatures. Some of the subjects whom she painted in miniature include: ‚ÄúCitoyenne‚Äù Sallatin (wife of a musician for the Th√©atre Feydeau), Suv√©e (Davin-Mirvault‚Äôs teacher), Joachim Murat (Napoleon‚Äôs brother-in-law), and Caroline Bonaparte (Napoleon‚Äôs wife). Along with miniature portraits, she also painted miniature landscapes, genre scenes, and history scenes. These works include a scene of Hercules titled A Child Preferring Arms to All Other Articles of His Education. A critic praised this work in La Mercure de France, however, he mistakenly thought the artist was a man. A Young Girl Grieved by the End of ‚ÄúClarissa‚Äù When She Reads the Will is an example of one of Davin- Mirvault‚Äôs genre miniatures and was exhibited in the Salon of 1801. She began referring to herself as a student of David after 1804 when her Portrait of Bruni had been exhibited. At this time, Davin-Mirvault stopped exhibiting miniatures most likely as a result of her studies with David giving her a newfound confidence. She then only exhibited portraits, genre paintings, and one history painting. Portrait of Bruni is not signed or dated and is painted using muted, dark tones. Great attention is given to the textures of objects within the painting. Bruni is pictured wearing a deep blue coat and tuning a viola. He sits in a dark chair in front of a grey background. His face, neckcloth, and the upholstery tacks provide bright accents to the darkly painted picture. Bruni‚Äôs hair is dusted with powder, which can also be seen on the collar and shoulders of his coat. This is an example of Davin-Mirvault‚Äôs ‚Äúliteral-minded all-inclusiveness‚Äù that causes issues in some of her other works. The portrait was kept in the collection of Bruni‚Äôs descendants until 1952, however, they believed it had been painted by David. In 1952 the portrait was bought by Knoedler and Co. and sold again to the Frick Collection still as a painting by David. The Frick Collection issued a press release on October 7, 1952 stating that the portrait was painted by David basing this attribution on stylistic qualities and the friendship between David and Bruni. However, the portrait was finally correctly attributed to Davin-Mirvault a decade later by Georges Wildenstein who had always suspected it was in fact painted by one of David‚Äôs pupils. Wildenstein proved this through the discovery of a listing for the portrait in the Salon Catalogue of 1804. The portrait does look heavily influenced by David due to Da¬¨vin-Mirvault‚Äôs skill at emulating her teacher‚Äôs style, especially his precision. Although she did not win an award for the Portrait of Bruni, it was highly praised in her time. Portrait of Francois-Joseph Lefebvre, Duc de Danzig, Mar√©chal was commissioned in 1804 by Napoleon for the Salles de Mar√©chaux Tuileries Palace. Davin- Mirvault most likely received this commission because she was supposedly related to Lefebvre. However, the portrait was never exhibited in the Salon. The handling of this portrait seems more primitive when compared to her Portrait of Bruni. In addition, the details seem to overpower the subject. However, the portrait has the same precision, impasto highlights and thinly brushed background as the Portrait of Bruni. Portrait of Asker-Khan, Ambassador from Persia in 1808 was exhibited in the Salon of 1810, and her second portrait of the ambassador was exhibited in the Salon of 1814. Louise- Phillipe bought the portrait in 1836 for the Mus√©e de Versailles, where it still remains. The background of the portrait is more architectural than her previous works with a curtain, a column, and a distant landscape. The subject is shown kneeling in prayer on a Persian rug, however, the details are overpowering just as they are in Lefebvre. Both the Portrait of Asker-Khan and Lefebvre demonstrate how Davin-Mirvault was accustomed to painting miniatures and was not always as successful at a large scale. Portrait of Mrs. Pinckney- Horry is painted in an oval shape and looks like an enlarged version of Davin- Mirvault‚Äôs miniatures. This portrait is executed differently from her others due to its delicate handling and contours. Portrait of a Seated Lady demonstrates Davin-Mirvault‚Äôs skill at portraying details in a way that is not as overpowering as in some of her other portraits previously discussed. Rather, the intricate decorations of the subject‚Äôs clothing compliment her as she sits confidently. The Beautiful Kitchen Maid was purchased by a prominent collector, Lucien Bonaparte. This work was originally exhibited in the Salon of 1806 with the title The Kitchen Maid and was described as, ‚Äúone of the best works by a female student of M. David.‚Äù The Death of Malek-Adhel was exhibited in the Salon of 1814 and is the only history painting that Davin-Mirvault exhibited. The painting features a dying Hindu nobleman as his lover and father mourn over him. A reviewer for the Salon of 1814 praised Davin-Mirvault for receiving ‚Äúexcellent lessons‚Äù from David.

CHICAGO! Go! Yeah!\\" on the vinyl edition) is a track from Sufjan Stevens 2005 concept album Illinois, released on Asthmatic Kitty. The song tells the semi-autobiographical story of a young man on a road trip, and his youthful idealism. The track is one of Stevens' most popular songs, and he usually ends his live shows with a version of this song. The song has been recorded in five different versions by Stevens himself, the versions not on Illinois being included on the collection The Avalanche, and one demo released digitally on Stevens' website, later released as a 12\\" single bundled with the \\"Illinois: Special 10th Anniversary Blue Marvel Edition\\". The track has also been sampled by Chiddy Bang on their single \\"All Things Go\\".  Production  In the process of making the second album in his ambitious Fifty States Project, which involved recording an album for each of the states of America, Stevens had committed a large amount of time to researching the people and history of Illinois. However this track is one of the most autobiographical on the album. Sufjan Stevens states in interviews around the release, that, \\"I've had quite a few exceptional and traumatic experiences in Illinois, a few times when visiting Chicago at a particularly difficult time in my life or driving cross country and being pulled over by the cops just outside Peoria,\\" and that he saw his first rock show there. However, he self-deprecatingly qualifies the story of the song as only being partly true, stating, \\"The writer is the inventor, the designer, the creative force behind a body of work. The author is the actual man or woman, in reality, in society, in person. I like Woody Allen the director/writer, circa 1975, but I doubt I would like Woody Allen the person, circa 1975.\\" Stevens also cited the poem \\"Chicago\\" by Carl Sandburg as an influence on the track, and had intended to include a track about Saul Bellow on Illinois, but could not find a way to adequately cover the writer.  Alternate versions  The year after the track was released on Illinois, three further versions were included on the outtakes album, The Avalanche: Outtakes and Extras from the Illinois Album, these being an acoustic version, the \\"Adult Contemporary Easy Listening Version\\", which is a baroque pop version of the original track, and a \\"Multiple Personality Disorder Version\\", of which Stevens stated, \\"James, my drummer was in town, and we decided it would be kind of fun to deconstruct the song\\". One further \\"(Demo)\\" version was recorded during the album recording sessions in 2004 and released digitally on Stevens' homepage on February 25, 2016. It was released as a 12\\" bundled with the \\"Illinois: Special 10th Anniversary Blue Marvel Edition\\" on April 1, 2016.  Reception  The track was well received as the centerpiece of the acclaimed album Illinois. Allmusic described the track as having \\"An expansiveness that radiates with the ballast of history and the promise of new beginnings.\\", and the track was included as one of the Pitchfork 500 most important tracks since punk broke.

Tugboat Annie race  In 1932, Alice was featured along with a number of other Puget Sound tugboats in the feature film Tugboat Annie. The film, which was based on a fictionalized version of the life of Thea Foss, starred the then very popular comedic actress Marie Dressler (1865‚Äì1934) in the title role. The film required a staged tugboat \\"race\\", which was won by the Peter Foss, under the command of Capt. Arthur Hopstead, to whom Marie Dressler personally presented the Tugboat Annie Trophy.

They have been mentioned in inscriptions from the 9th century CE.A History of India, by Burton Stein and David Arnold, p.120 Aihole was formerly a major city of the Chalukyas of Badami and a place with many temples and brahmans, some of whom seem to have become involved in the trading activities of the Five Hundred. But most of the Ayyavolu Lords were merchants, especially those engaged in long-distance trade. Their inscriptions between the 9th and 14th centuries record their endowments made to temples and throw light on their trading activities or commodities. The Five Hundred guild, known as Ayyavole in Kannada, Ayyavolu in Telugu, Aryarupa in Sanskrit, and Ainuruvar in Tamil, operated in Southern India and Southeast Asia. They became more powerful under the Cholas.Nagapattinam to Suvarnadwipa: reflections on Chola naval expeditions to Southeast Asia by Hermann Kulke, K. Kesavapany and Vijay Sakhuja, p.xviii and p.181 They were protectors of the Veera-Banaju- Dharma, that is, law of the heroic or noble merchants. The Bull was their symbol which they displayed on their flag; and they had a reputation for being daring and enterprising.Peranakan Indians of Singapore and Melaka: Indian Babas and Nonyas--Chitty Melaka, by Samuel Dhoraisingam, p.3 Description The following passage on the guild of Ayyavolu merchants is taken from an inscription dated 1055 CE and summarises their activities and commodities:A History of India, by Burton Stein and David Arnold, p.121 Famed throughout the world, adorned with many good qualities, truth, purity, good conduct, policy, condescension, and prudence; protectors of the vira-Bananju-dharma [law of the heroic traders], having 32 veloma, 18 cities, 64 yoga-pithas, and asramas at the four points of the compass; born to be wanderers over many countries, the earth as their sack,....the serpent race as the cords, the betel pouch as a secret pocket,... by land routes and water routes penetrating into the regions of the six continents, with superior elephants, well-bred horses, large sapphires, moonstones, pearls, rubies, diamonds,...cardamoms, cloves, sandal, camphor, musk, saffron and other perfumes and drugs, by selling which wholesale or hawking about on their shoulders, preventing the loss by customs duties, they fill up the emperor's treasury of gold, his treasury of jewels, and his armoury of weapons; and from the rest they daily bestow gifts on pundits and munis; white umbrellas as their canopy, the mighty ocean as their moat, Indra as the hand-guard of their swords, Varuna as the standard bearer, Kubera as the treasurer,... Origin and activities The Five Hundred were an itinerant group that became a community because of their operations.A History of India, by Burton Stein, p. 126 In comparison to other guilds, they were considered the most flamboyant. Together with another guild of merchants called Manigramam, the guild of Five Hundred were found in ports and commercial centres. They endowed temples, fed Brahmans, and contributed to the maintenance of irrigation works. Their inscriptions dot the entire southern peninsula, tracing an inter-regional and international network of merchants. Some of these merchants were called \\"nanadesi\\" (or \\"of many countries), while some were called \\"swadesi\\" (or \\"of own country\\"). These traders were one of the conduits for transporting Indian culture to Southeast Asia.A History of India, by Burton Stein and David Arnold, p.121 Evidences show that the erection of temples and mathas depended upon royal patronage and mercantile guilds like Ayyavolu, Nakaramu and Komatis who supported temple building activity. Similarly temple building activity also depended upon guilds of architects or the Acharyas of the Vishwakarma-Kula who also seem to have organised themselves into guilds based on geographical divisions.Art of South India, Andhra Pradesh, by B. Rajendra Prasad, p.85 Veera-Balanjas The lords of Ayyavolu were called Vira-Balanjas. The term Vira-Balanja in Kannada and Vira-Valanjiyar in Tamil, Vira-Balija/ Balija Chetty/ setty in Telugu all, of them mean \\"valiant merchants\\".Encyclopaedia Indica: India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Volume 100, by SS Shashi, p.86 These merchants styled themselves as protectors of Vira Balanja Dharma (Vira Balanja Dharma Pratipalanulu) and often figured in the inscriptions of medieval Andhra.Studies in economic and social conditions of medieval Andhra, by K.Sundaram, p.69-76 There are several epigraphs available on the Veera-Balanjas. One example is an epigraph of 1531 CE from the Anilama village of Cuddapah, which refers to the grant of certain toll-income (Magama) on articles of trade, such as cotton, yarn, cloth, etc., made by the Veera-Balanja merchant guild of Ayyavolu, for the lamp-offerings of God Sangamesvara of that village.Hindu and Muslim religious institutions, Andhra Desa, 1300-1600, by Ravula Soma Reddy, p.110 Copper-plate inscriptions of Nellore mention that the organisation of Ayyavola, or Ayyavola-enumbaru- swamigalu were the protectors of the Vira-Balanja dharma (aka Vira-Bananja dharma) and followed the Vira-Banaja-Samaya.The quarterly journal of the Mythic society (Bangalore), Volume 82, p.88-91 According to an inscription dated 1240 CE found at Chintapalli in Guntur district, the Vira-Balanja Samaya (a trade corporation) consisted of Ubhayananadesis, the Gavaras, and the Mumuridandas; and they were the recipients of five hundred hero edicts.A study of the history and culture of the Andhras, Volume 2, by Kambhampati Satyanarayana, p.52 Of these, the Ubhayananadesis were a unit of merchants derived from all quarters and countries, consisting of Desis, Paradesis and Nanadesis, while the Gavares derived their name as a body of merchants worshipping God Gavaresvara. Some trade guilds were based on religious identities, such as the Nakaras (a guild) which was a body of Nagara Komati devotees of Nakaresvara and the Gavare Balijas which was a body of Balija devotees of Gavaresvara (Sri Gavaresvara divya deva sripada padmaradhakulu).Cultural heritage of the Kakatiyas: a medieval kingdom of south India, by S.Nagabhushan Rao, p.59 The Mummuridandas were warriors first and merchants next. An inscription of 1177 AD from Kurugodu, Bellary explicitly states that the Mummuridandas were an offshoot of the 'Five Hundred' who were eminent in Aryapura, that is, Aihole or Ayyavole (srimad aryya nama pura mukhyabhutar enip ainurvarind adavid anvay ayatar).Brahma sri: Researches in archaeology, history, and culture in the new millennium : Dr. P.V.

Kesavapany and Vijay Sakhuja, p.163 The Ayyavole-500 were simply called Ainuruvar in Tamil. In Visakhapatnam, three inscriptions were found, two in Telugu and one in Tamil. They were on the Ainuttava-perumballi (500 perumballi) in Visakhapatnam and dated to 1090 CE under the reign of the Ganga king Anantavarmadeva.Nagapattinam to Suvarnadwipa: reflections on Chola naval expeditions to Southeast Asia by Hermann Kulke, K. Kesavapany and Vijay Sakhuja, p.164 Another Telugu inscription records a similar grant to the same Ainuttava-Perumballi by the Chief Mahamandaleshvara Kulotungga Prithvisvara. The inscriptions suggest that the Anjuvannam people were patronized by the Ayyavole-500 guild and even treated as members of that guild.Nagapattinam to Suvarnadwipa: reflections on Chola naval expeditions to Southeast Asia by Hermann Kulke, K. Kesavapany and Vijay Sakhuja, p.165 It would seem that when the Ayyavole-500 guild became a big overreaching guild of Southern India, most of the existing indigenous and local trade guilds became associated with it. The Manigramam and nanadesi guilds joined the Ayyavole-500. Due to the various Chola naval expeditions to Southeast Asia and the support provided by the Cholas to the Ayyavole guild, the Ayyavole guild emerged as a maritime power and continued to flourish in the kingdom of Srivijaya (a dominant thalassocratic city-state based on the island of Sumatra, Indonesia). This is well documented in an inscription of the Ayyavole guild of the year 1088 AD found in Barus of West Sumatra, Indonesia. South Indian merchants were also active in Burma and the Thai peninsula.Nagapattinam to Suvarnadwipa: reflections on Chola naval expeditions to Southeast Asia by Hermann Kulke, K.

He majored in Chemistry, Zoology and Botany from BJB College in Bhubaneswar, Orissa, India (B.Sc., 1975) and studied Zoology (Endocrinology) at Utkal University, Orissa, (M.Sc., 1978). Following four years of lectureship at various colleges in Utkal University (1978‚Äì82), in 1982 Jena received a teaching and research fellowship from Iowa State University, to pursue studies leading to a doctorate degree. In December 1988, he received his Ph.D. degree in Zoology (Molecular Endocrinology), Following postdoctoral studies at Iowa State and Yale Universities (1988‚Äì1994), Jena joined Yale University as an Assistant Professor, and in 2000, joined as Professor in the Department of Physiology, at Wayne State University School of Medicine.[6].Biography:http://www.med.wayne.edu/physiology/facultyprofile/jena/pdf%20files/Jena%20Biography.pdf Scientific Discoveries Using Atomic force microscope on live cells, Jena was the first to report the discovery of a new cellular structure the Porosome in the mid 1990s. The Porosome are permanent supramolecular structures at the cell Plasma membrane, where secretory Vesicle (biology and chemistry) dock and fuse to release intravesicular contents to the outside of the cell. This discovery was a major breakthrough in our understanding of cell secretion. The Porosome, has been determined as the universal secretory machinery in cells, from exocrine cells of the pancreas, to neuroendocrine cells, and neurons. Jena and his research team has determined the structure and dynamics of the Porosome in live cells, at nm resolution and in real time. The structure of the Porosome was further confirmed by electron microscopy in whole cells, and in isolated Porosome preparations. The isolated Porosome has been both structurally and functionally reconstituted in lipid membrane and live cells, and its composition determined. The discovery of the Porosome, and an understanding of its structure, function, composition, and reconstitution, has opened a new field in cell biology; nano cell biology[3].

He attended the Berberian College from 1898, but he was expelled because of a relationship with another future writer, Mannig Berberian, daughter of Reteos Berberian, founder and owner of the college, and for asking her to marry him. In 1902 he went to London to complete high school, and was hosted \\"by an ancient family of the English aristocracy.\\" In the same year he completed the first draft of his collection Crucified Dreams. In 1905 he matriculated at the Sorbonne in Paris and joined the Armenian liberation movement. In 1907 he went back to the Ottoman Empire because of his father's illness, to take over the management of the family business, established in the production of carpets and lace, which gave work to about two thousand workers, located in the districts of √úsk√ºdar, Kumkapƒ±, Kadƒ±k√∂y. This commitment continued along with his involvement in journalism and literary writing. Political and literary activity in the Ottoman Empire In 1908 he published the newspaper Surhantag (The Messenger) with Dikran Zaven, and in 1909 he founded the political and literary weekly Nor Hosank (New Wave), in collaboration with Karekin Gozikyan, called Yessalem,Karekin Kozikian, writing under the name Yessalem, was born in Kharput in the Ottoman Empire in 1878 and had emigrated to the Caucasus during the Armenian massacres of 1894-95. Kozikian was a twenty year old worker who had been politicized when very young and had already been a member of the Revolutionary Hunchak Party, International Communist Current Workers of the world, unite! who was the founder of the first workers' union of the Armenian press in the Ottoman Empire (Matbaa ƒ∞≈ü√ßileri Meslek Birliƒüi). He also works with fiction writer Rupen Zartarian and playwright Levon Shant in the magazine of art and controversy Baguine(Temple). Also Atom Yarjanian (Siamanto), an important Armenian journalist, wrote in this magazine. In 1910 tries to establish with Gostan Zarian and Kegham Parseghian a circle of innovative art around Les volont√©s folles. In the same field comes out in Constantinople, accompanied by illustrations of cartoonists Enrico Sacchetti, and Yambo, the important essay on F.T. Marinetti and futurism (FT Marinetti and apagajapa≈°toitiine). In the same year he publishes a series of poetry books that stand out as the leading exponent of so-called symbol poetry in Armenian. From 1911 is in correspondence with Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Gian Pietro Lucini, Libero Altomare and engages on essays and translations in Armenian language, to make known their poetry together with that of Corrado Govoni and Enrico Cardile as part of a larger work of renovation in literature in the Armenian language in the light of the important Italian and French literature and historical events. In the same year Yenovk Armen published an essay titled Hrand Nazariantz and His Crucified Dreams. In the same line is to be included in the volume Le Tasse et ses traducteurs arm√©niens. the test was preceded by a letter of recommendation from a famous linguist, philologist and translator of Dante's era father Arsen Ghazikian of Mechitar Congregation of Venice. This work, having as its topic translations into Armenian of Torquato Tasso's opera, released in French for the publishing house Arzouman types of Constantinople in 1912. Also in 1912, the re-release of The Crucified Dreams requires the attention of the public and critics. From 1913 appear the original versions of the texts Aurora, soul of beauty, Gloria Victis, The Crown of Thorns, The great hymn of cosmic tragedy and an essay on Hranush Arshagyan. Engaged in recent years to obtain the support of European intellectuals to the Armenian cause, finds in Italy other supporters. Among these are undoubtedly highlighting Giovanni Verga, Luigi Pirandello and later Umberto Zanotti Bianco, and many other well-known Italian and European intellectuals associated with the Masonic and Rosicrucian fraternities.

There are, however, reports of cohabitation with Lena De Cosmis, the daughter of Leonardo De Cosmis, starting from 1911 through the header of a letter. The poet Gian Pietro Lucini, a friend of Nazariantz, two years before marriage, in fact, addressed his letters to the \\"family De Cosmis-Nazariantz\\" at \\"the Italian Post Office at Galata suburb of Constantinople\\". Arriving in Italy, he intensified the relations with members of the Armenian diaspora and with the protagonists of the Italian culture, French and English, going abroad for study. At the same time he was hired as a professor of French and English at the Technical, Marine, and Professional Institute in Bari.  Literary activity in Italy  In 1915 collaborates with Il Ritmo and he prints for Laterza editors in Bari the first volume of the collection ideal of knowledge Armenia directed by him, his essay on the Armenian poet Bedros Tourian, and presentation of Enrico Cardile, which will also translate, for editions of the magazine Humanitas of Bari, I sogni Crocifissi (1916), Lo Specchio (1920) and Vahakn (1920). Next year is the beginning of collaboration The Hardening by Renato Fondi, with which will establish a regular and lasting relationship. Following Nazariantz comes into contact with avant-garde Sicilian magazines hosting his contributions: The climb(1917), The Literary Kindler (1917) and La spirale where in 1919 has published an extract from the poem Lo Specchio. In Bari became a friend of Franco Casavola and is committed to promoting music production. The two work together to organize, with the help of Giuseppe Laterza, Giacomo Favia, Tina Suglia, and others, the Futurist evening at Teatro Piccinni of Bari, September 26, 1922. A few months later, on January 2, 1923, the evening's program at the futuristic Teatro Margherita Bari includes \\"the mimic action-drama\\" entitled \\"Lo specchio\\", with music by Franco Casavola Nazariantz inspired by the poem. In 1924 the Alpes publishing house by Milan publishes the collection Tre poemi, including \\"Heaven of Shadows\\", \\"Aurora anima di bellezza \\", \\"Saadi Nazyade flower,\\" translated by Cesare Giardini. In the same year his commitment to supporting the Armenian cause is also responsible for the foundation of Nor Arax, a village for Armenian exiles in the countryside of Bari, whose population helped nourish the production of carpets and lace. Today, what is left of Nor Arax is a few of the original houses as well as the columns at the entrance of the village on which the words \\"Nor Arax\\" (in both English and Armenian) are engraved. Nor Arax is located at the address Via Giovanni Amendola, 154 70126 Bari, Italy. After 1943 he worked in Radio Bari for which he wrote and read various conferences of literary topic. In the same year he founded the magazines for inspiration symbolic-Masonic \\"Holy Grail\\" (1946) and \\"Graalismo\\" (1958) directed with his friend the poet and writer Potito Giorgio. On both serials writings appeared, among others, Giuseppe Ungaretti, Ada Negri, Liliana Scalero, Elpidio Jenco, Giuseppe Villaroel, Lionello Fiumi, Charles Plisnier and other photographs of well-known and lesser-known painters, among them to remember Fryda Laureti Ciletti. The Italian translation of \\"Il Grande Canto della Cosmica tragedia\\" was published in 1946. Nazariantz published the \\"Manifesto Graalico\\" in 1951. In it, considered ending the Italian avant-garde, and the other signatories Nazariantz entrusted the resolution of intellectual-society relationship to the absolute primacy of art. In 1952 was published in the latest anthology entitled \\"Il ritorno dei poeti.\\" In 1953 a number of Italian and foreign intellectuals proposed his candidacy for the Nobel Prize of Literature, which was finally awarded to Winston Churchill. At the requests of the documents found in the name of Nazariantz highlight a lack of effectiveness on the part of applicants and it includes well as non-acceptance.  The last few years and death  The last years of Nazariantz's life were characterized by heightened economic hardships that had plagued him throughout his life as a stateless person. At the end of the fifties he was admitted to a hospital in Conversano, where he was surrounded by affection and esteem of some young friends Conversano, not that they wanted to rediscover the enormous human and intellectual value. In recent years, verified the nullity of his first marriage, also died Vittoria Strazzaboschi his faithful companion for many years, wed with Maria Lucarelli. In 1960 he moved from Conversano, a town he so loved, to Casamassima, also in the province of Bari, where he lived in conditions of almost complete destitution with his second wife Maria Lucarelli. He died two years later in 1962. Throughout his life, maintained a great admiration for the fairer sex, which had a glimpse of the symbolism of Miriam, due, perhaps, the mystical and esoteric teachings of Giuliano Kremmerz. Nazariantz is buried in the Cimitero Monumentale cemetery of Bari (entrance to the cemetery is located at the intersection of Via Nazariantz Hrand and Via Francesco Crispi), in an almost anonymous tomb that only bears his name, dates of birth and death, and the label of \\"POETA\\" (poet). The address of the tomb within the cemetery is campo 34, number 206. The tomb is owned by the family of Diran Timurian, an entrepreneur in the import-export of oriental carpets, one of many Armenians whose family had arrived in Bari thanks to Nazariantz's humanitarian work.  Quotes  245px The Sicilian poet Enrico Cardile, wrote of him: \\"Nazariantz is a man of inexhaustible energy, a consistently exceptional, with a prodigious enthusiasm, fascinating in its resolute modesty. His enthusiasm can community, his passion becomes epidemic, if you know you will love it, if you love him you feel ready to share its risks and dedicate to his cause (Ed namely Armenia free)\\" Daniel Varujan, known Armenian poet, wrote: \\"Nazariantz has written poems that can match those in their splendor deep St√©phane Mallarm√©, French poet. His soul has in fact an exceptional affinity with the soul of the prince of poets. Soul always be striving intoxication unknown and indefinite that one can hardly perceive through the human aspiration. His images are evocative of a depth.

Opened in 1976 and closed since December 31, 2019, it was the first modern and major shopping mall located in the area. The shopping mall building is now planned for demolition to give way for a redevelopment of the site into residential building complex with a shopping center by SM Prime Holdings. History=First opening SM Department Store in Harrison Plaza The property was built in a former cemetery, which was destroyed during World War II, and cleared of graves afterwards. Before the development, the area used to be known as Fort San Antonio Abad in Malate, Manila, Harrison Park, and Ermita Cemetery, respectively.https://filipiknow.net/manila-history-and-trivia/ Harrison Plaza opened in 1976 and was the first modern shopping mall in the Philippines after the opening of Ali Mall. The Martel family leased the lot on the place where the mall is standing under the contract with the city government of Manila. Despite being built on the site of a former cemetery, very few urban legends involved the place. The retail center was the first air-conditioned shopping mall in the Philippines. Fire, two-year closure, second opening After the mall was razed by a fire the shopping mall was shuttered for renovations which was done from 1982 and 1984. When it was reopened to the public in 1984, the mall featured a cinema, amusement rides, Jai alai fronton site (until it was converted to SM Hypermarket in 2010), a fountain, a Roman Catholic chapel and a hotel in the 1990s. It was anchored by the country's major Department Store chains like SM Department Store and Rustan's. Fall of Harrison Plaza With the rise of new malls built by SM, Ayala, Robinsons, and Megaworld as well as a makeover of Ali Mall, the Harrison Plaza suddenly became a decaying, squalor and disorderly mall and had lost its glory days due to the mismanagement or bad maintenance from the Martel family. This led the Martels to consider selling the property. In June 2016, it was reported that SM Prime Holdings is planning to invest to redevelop the mall and planned to put up business process outsourcing offices and residential towers in the Harrison Plaza complex. The firm is partnering with the city government of Manila which has economic interest from the redevelopment project. In April 2018, SM Prime Holdings was finalizing a deal to buy out the Martel family from its contract with the City of Manila to redevelop and manage Harrison Plaza. Since the shopping center was in need of redevelopment and lagged behind nearby malls including Ali Mall, SM Prime Holdings plans to build a new shopping center with a residential condominium above it. The Martel family's contract of the mall would expire by 2020 or 2022. Closure and sale to SM The Harrison Plaza on January 1, 2020. It was announced on the memo given by the Martels to the mall's tenants that the mall will cease its operations on December 31, 2019 with the family giving them time to clear out the area until January 31, 2020. After the deadline, the property will be demolished to give way for a \\"massive project\\" of SM Prime Holdings, reportedly a condominium building complex with a shopping center or mall similar to The Podium. Tenants Harrison Plaza in 2015 At its peak, the Harrison Plaza housed 180 stores, eateries, and service outlets. It also had four movie houses and a supermarket. It also had a jai alai fronton prior to the sports' ban by the national government. The sports venue was replaced by an outlet of SM Hypermarket.

Background  The celebrated 1500 letter of Mestre Jo√£o Faras was discovered in the Portuguese royal archives by the historian Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen, and published for the first time in 1843.Revista do Instituto Hist√≥rico e Geogr√°fico Brasileiro, Rio de Janeiro, 1843, tomo V n¬∫ 19. online Despite much search, the figure of Mestre Jo√£o Faras remains elusive.Sousa Viterbo (1897), Valentim (2007) In his 1500 letter, Mestre Jo√£o identifies himself simply as a bacherel of arts and medicine ('bachelor' was a general term for someone with formal learning) and a personal physician and surgeon of the King Manuel I of Portugal. Besides the 1500 letter, the only other concrete clue we have of Mestre Jo√£o's existence is an (unpublished) manuscript translation of Pomponius Mela's De Situ Orbis from Latin into imperfect Castilian.Found in the Portuguese national archives by Sousa Viterbo in 1898. The frontispiece (reproduced p.673-74) is signed Maestre Joan Faras, bachiler em artes e mede√ßina, fisico sororgiano dell muy alto Rey de Purtugall Dom Manuell. Its margins are littered with notes by the hand of Duarte Pacheco Pereira. See Valentim (2007) He may also have gone by the name 'Johannes Emeneslau'.This has been conjectured on the basis of a document found in royal archives in which the name \\"Johannes Emeneslau' was erased and replaced by 'Johannes bachelor of arts and medicine', the same way Mestre Jo√£o signed his letter. On account of his poor command of Portuguese and penchant for Spanish (Castilian), Mestre Jo√£o Faras is generally believed to have been originally of the existing nationalities in what would be Spain later (whether Castilian, Galician or Aragonese has been alternatively proposed). He was almost certainly a Sephardi Jew. He probably fled Spain for Portugal after the 1492 Alhambra decrees, but ended up converting after 1496, to enter the service of King Manuel I of Portugal. Recent researches have traced at least two original Spanish Jews who plausibly fit his profile: one, a certain Juan Faraz, a native of Seville,This is proposed by Juan Gil (2003); See also Valentim, 2007: p.22 another, a \\"Mestre Joam\\" (original surname and town not given), who settled in northern Portugal and took up the name Jo√£o da Paz.This is the interpretation preferred by Valentim, 2007: p.26  Voyage and mission  Mestre Jo√£o Faras joined the 2nd Portuguese India Armada of thirteen ships, commanded by Pedro √Ålvares Cabral, which left Lisbon in March 1500, destined for Calicut, India. It is unknown on which ship he sailed, although it has been conjectured (on account of his complaint about it being \\"small\\" with insufficient space) to be either the Anunciada commanded by Nuno Leit√£o da Cunha or the S√£o Pedro commanded by P√™ro de Ata√≠de.Pereira, 1979; Valentim, 2007: 29 The purpose of his joining the expedition seems to have been purely scientific, to assist the future development of navigational science. His predecessor Mestre Jos√© Vizinho was sent to Guinea back in 1485 to test measurements of solar altitudes.Pereira, p.38-39 Mestre Jo√£o Faras was probably sent by the king in a similar spirit, to test out new astronomical instruments and tables. It is known that Mestre Jo√£o Faras brought along a new nautical astrolabe and what he characterized as some new-fangled Arab astronomical nautical staves (cross-staff?) for experimentation. He was almost certainly furnished with Abraham Zacuto's new tables as well. Mestre Jo√£o Faras was probably specifically charged to find a way of determining the position of the ship by the stars in the Southern Hemisphere, a difficulty which had not yet been overcome. Since the time of Prince Henry the Navigator, \\"compass error\\" (the exact deviation of the magnetic north from the true north) could be corrected in the northern hemisphere by recourse to the position of northern Pole Star (observed on board via the quadrant), thus allowing navigators to determine the correct position of the ship. But the Pole Star disappeared beyond the horizon as the equator was crossed, rendering this method useless in the southern hemisphere. It was hoped that an equivalent South Pole Star might be found. An alternative method was to take recourse to the position of the sun at noon. This had been suggested since at least the 1470s, but was really only opened up with the publication of the Almanach perpetuum of Abraham Zacuto in 1496, with its tables of solar declination. As the sun could not be observed directly by the quadrant, Portuguese navigators brought on board ship the old land-based astrolabe (which allows measuring the sun's height without looking directly at it). Unfortunately, astrolabe readings required stability which is not possible at sea, so new small hand-held nautical astrolabes were being experimentally introduced at this time.Barros, Dec., Lib. 2, p.280 This was still not perfected. In 1497, Vasco da Gama took Zacuto's tables and the astrolabe with him on the maiden trip to India, but was dissatisfied with results. Upon arrival at the Bay of St. Helena in November 1497, Gama disembarked to take readings on land because he did not trust the readings of the new nautical astrolabe at sea.Jo√£o de Barros (1552) Decadas de Asia Dec. 1.2,p.280-81) Master Jo√£o Faras makes much the same complaint about his on-board readings in his letter - claiming the rocking of the ship put his readings off by a whole four or five degrees. (In his letter, Mestre Jo√£o hints the pilots on board had engaged him in a friendly charting competition - the pilots betting they could find the Cape of Good Hope more accurately by compass and chart alone than Mestre Jo√£o could with his astrolabe.)  In Brazil  On 22 April 1500, Cabral's armada sighted the land coast of Brazil, and anchored a couple of days later at Cabr√°lia Bay (just north of Porto Seguro, Bahia), where they were met by local Tupiniquim Indians. Sketch of the southern celestial sky by Mestre Jo√£o Faras, from his letter of May 1, 1500. Master Jo√£o Faras left the ships on April 27, and with the assistance of the pilots Afonso Lopes and Pedro Escobar, set up a large wooden astrolabe on the beach (more reliable than the tin ones used aboard ship) with the objective of taking the altitude of the sun at mid-day and determine their position. The latitude measure calculated by Faras on April 27, 1500 was 17¬∞ S (Cabralia Bay is actually at 16¬∞ 21' S, thus his error was less than 40').Couto, 1999:p.51-52 Mestre Jo√£o Faras assumed they had landed on an island (more precisely, four islands, in his estimation, on account of being told 'via gestures' by their Tupiniquim hosts that hostile Indians often arrived by canoe from elsewhere). Indeed, he believed these islands were already discovered and depicted on earlier maps, but not known to be inhabited. In a curious passage of his letter (that has since produced much speculation), Mestre Jo√£o advised the king to consult an old mapa mundi then in the possession of the Portuguese navigator P√™ro Vaz da Cunha (nicknamed Bisagudo) in Lisbon, which depicted these very islands (modern historians speculate this might be a copy of the 1448 map of Andrea Bianco). Mestre Jo√£o Faras's conclusion that they were on an island was probably shared by Pedro √Ålvares Cabral and certainly by the secretary P√™ro Vaz de Caminha, who wrote up the official report. (But the account of an anonymous Portuguese pilot, the only other eyewitness of this journey, was less sure, reporting it was unclear whether they were on an island or on \\"firm land\\").The anonymous pilot's accounts was first published in an Italian collection in 1507 (1550 version online). See also Pereira, 1979: p.57; Couto, 1999:p.52 On May 1, 1500, both P√™ro Vaz de Caminha and Mestre Jo√£o Faras wrote up their separate letters to King Manuel I of Portugal, signed from the location of Vera Cruz (the name Cabral bestowed on the 'island').Chronicler Gaspar Correia Lendas da India (p.152) claims the name was on account of the Feast of the Cross, which landed on May 3 in the liturgical calendar. Nonetheless, both letters are dated May 1. Both letters were given to the captain of a ship to be sent back to Lisbon (either under Gaspar de Lemos or Andr√© Gon√ßalves, the sources conflict).Barros (p.390) reports Lemos; Correia (p.152) reports Gon√ßalves The armada left Brazil in the direction of the Cape of Good Hope on May 3, 1500. Tentative identification of the stars depicted by Mestre Jo√£o Faras in his letter of May 1, 1500. In his letter to the king, Mestre Jo√£o Faras provided a rudimentary sketch of the stars of the southern hemisphere sky, in an attempt to identify the Southern Pole Star, although he apologized to the king for not having taken their precise height measurements (he blamed it on his bad leg). He identified the five-star constellation now known as the Southern Cross, but he then called \\"las Guardas\\", as they were always bright and visible above the horizon. But he recognized they were not the elusive pole star of the south. Instead, he tentatively pointed out two lower stars (small and bright, possibly Chi Octantis and Mu HydriAlbuquerque, 1970: p.237-38 as possible candidates for the southern pole star (\\"el polo antartyco\\"). He rounded off his letter in a pessimistic note, suggesting that it was probably better for ships to continue trying to navigate by the altitude of the sun (via the astrolabe), rather than hoping to find the Southern Pole Star with a quadrant. Although historians generally credit Mestre Jo√£o Faras as the \\"discoverer\\" of the Southern Cross constellation, some point out that he might have been preceded by the Venetian navigator Alvise Cadamosto, who, sailing at the mouth of the Gambia River in 1455, drew a similar constellation which he called the carro dell'ostro (the \\"southern chariot\\"). However, Cadamosto's constellation has too many stars and is positioned incorrectly. Nothing more is heard from or about Mestre Jo√£o Faras after this letter. According to one author, 'Jo√£o da Paz' (one of the possible identities of Jo√£o Faras) settled in Porto, Portugal.Valentim, 2007 A search in the 1518 household roster of King Manuel I shows nobody by that name, suggesting he was probably already dead by that time.Valentim, 2007: p.16-17  See also  * :pt:Carta do Mestre Jo√£o * Carta de P√™ro Vaz de Caminha * 2nd Portuguese India Armada (Cabral, 1500)  References  Sources  * [Mestre Jo√£o Faras] \\"Carta do Mestre Jo√£o, Physico d'El Rei, para o mesmo Senhor, de Vera Cruz, ao 1¬∫ de Maio de 1500\\", Revista do Instituto Hist√≥rico e Geogr√°fico Brasileiro, Rio de Janeiro, 1843, tomo V n¬∫ 19, p. 342-44. online * Albuquerque, Lu√≠s de (1970) \\"A navega√ß√£o astron√≥mica\\" in A.

He currently occupies the position of Senior Scientist and group leader of the DSB Repair Metabolism Laboratory at the Francis Crick Institute, London. He is also an honorary Professor at University College London. Early life and education Boulton studied Molecular Biology at the University of Edinburgh, then studied for a Ph.D. at the University of Cambridge under Professor Steve Jackson of the Gurdon Institute from 1994 to 1998. It was at Cambridge that Boulton began researching mechanisms of DNA. He has described his first exposure to the research environment at Cambridge as \\"extremely influential.\\" Research The website of Cancer Research UK explains Boulton's work in this way: human DNA \\"is constantly under assault from chemical reactions taking place in our bodies and from things we're exposed to in our everyday lives....Most of the time, DNA damage is repaired successfully by the cell. But if the cell continues to grow whilst its DNA is already damaged, it can lead to cancer.\\" Boulton is learning about DNA damage repair \\"by first studying it inside a microscopic worm called C. elegans and then extending these findings to human cells,\\" an approach that has revealed \\"remarkable similarities between the genes and proteins used to repair DNA damage in the worm and in humans....By studying this fundamental process of DNA damage repair, the researchers have contributed to our understanding of how faults in the system can lead to cancer.\\" Boulton himself has explained his work at the DNA Damage Response Laboratory as follows: \\"DNA is a highly reactive molecule that is susceptible to damage. Fortunately, cells have evolved specialised repair processes that are remarkably efficient in correcting specific types of DNA damage. Failure to correctly repair DNA damage will lead to mutagenic change, which can contribute to ageing and cancer. Indeed, defects in genes that repair DNA damage are the underlying cause of a number of hereditary ageing/cancer predisposition syndromes such as Fanconi anemia and Blooms. The focus of my lab is to identify new DNA repair genes, understand how they work in DNA repair in mitotic and meiotic cells and determine how defects in these processes contribute to human disease such as cancer. We hope that our work will provide an improved understanding of how DNA repair works and how, when DNA repair is compromised, it contributes to cancer/ageing and or infertility disorders in humans.\\" Boulton's research has resulted in several major breakthroughs in understanding that are viewed as highly promising with regard to the potential development of new cancer treatments. DNA Damage Response Laboratory DNA damage, due to environmental factors and normal metabolic processes inside the cell. A special enzyme, DNA ligase (shown here in color), encircles the double helix to repair a broken strand of DNA. DNA ligase is responsible for repairing the millions of DNA breaks generated during the normal course of a cell's life. Without molecules that can mend such breaks, cells can malfunction, die, or become cancerous. DNA is highly reactive and susceptible to damage from things we are exposed to in everyday life. Fortunately, DNA has evolved processes in which it has the ability to repair itself. If the damages are not repaired and it continues to grow, mutagenic changes occur causing ageing and cancer. Boulton is responsible for identifying these new DNA repair genes, understanding how these genes work in DNA, and determining how the defects in these processes contribute to human diseases. To fulfil these tasks, Boulton studies the DNA damage repair inside a specific worm called C. elegans, then extends these findings to human cells. Through this process, he has found \\"remarkable similarities between the genes and proteins used to repair DNA damage in the worm and in humans....By studying this fundamental process of DNA damage repair, the researchers have contributed to our understanding of how faults in the system can lead to cancer.\\" Boulton's research has resulted in several major breakthroughs that are viewed as highly promising with regard to the potential development of new cancer treatments. Boulton's papers about his work have appeared in a number of major scientific journals, such as Nature, Science, Cell, and Molecular Cell. Career After receiving his Ph.D. from Cambridge, Boulton completed postdoctoral fellowships funded by the European Molecular Biology Organization and the Human Frontier Science Program at Harvard Medical School. He first worked under Professor Nicholas Dyson of the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, then under Professor Marc Vidal of the Dana Faber Cancer Institute at Harvard Medical School. In 2002, Boulton joined Cancer Research UK, working at its London Research Institute, Clare Hall Laboratories, in South Mimms, and in Hertfordshire. He established his own research group there, and was eventually promoted to Senior Scientist in 2007. He is a member of the Editorial Board for Genes & Development.http://genesdev.cshlp.org/site/misc/edboard.xhtml Boulton‚Äôs PhD supervisor, Stephen P. Jackson, has said that it is Boulton's distinctive combination of approaches that has allowed Boulton to make seminal contributions to DNA repair, genome instability, and cancer. Among Boulton's achievements is the discovery that the gene RTEL1 serves as an anti- recombinase that affects genome stability and cancer and counteracts toxic recombination. In addition, he and his team discovered the PBZ motif and determined that ALC1 (Amplified in Liver Cancer 1) is a poly(ADP- ribose)-activated chromatin-remodelling enzyme required for DNA repair, and that poly (ADP-ribosyl)ation (PAR) is a post-translational modification of proteins that play an important role in mediating protein interactions and the recruitment of specific protein targets. Also, he has discovered that the Fanconi Anemia proteins FANCM and FAAP24 are required for checkpoint-kinase signalling (ATR) in response to DNA damage and established that DNA repair defects of Fanconi Anemia cells can be suppressed by blocking non-homologous end joining. He has also demonstrated that a newly identified helicase, RTEL1, plays a crucial role in repairing double-stranded DNA breaks by means of homologous recombination (HR) ‚Äì a discovery that has great therapeutic significance and that has already led to the development of treatments, with a drug currently undergoing clinical tests. The discoveries made in Boulton's laboratory have led to new therapeutic approaches. The findings about ALC1 may prove to have significant implications for the treatment of liver cancer. The discoveries about Fanconi Anemia proteins, moreover, suggest that NHEJ inhibitors might help suppress Fanconi Anemia patients' predisposition to cancer. Honours and awards Boulton won the Colworth Medal from the Biochemical Society in 2006, and was selected to give the EACR Young Cancer Researcher of the Year award lecture in 2008. He was presented with the Eppendorf/Nature Young Investigator Award in 2008 for his research into DNA damage, specifically his work with RTEL1. He became a member of the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) in 2009, and was awarded a Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award in 2010. He won the EMBO Gold Medal in 2011 for his research on DNA repair mechanisms. The election committee said that it was \\"particularly impressed by his pioneering role in establishing the nematode worm, C. elegans, as a model system to study genome instability.\\" In 2011, Boulton was chosen to give the Royal Society Francis Crick Prize Lecture, an honour awarded annually by the Royal Society. He was selected for this honour in recognition of his achievements in the field of DNA repair. Boulton was elected as a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences in 2012. In 2013, Boulton was the recipient of the Paul Marks Prize for Cancer Research, which recognises a new generation of leaders in cancer research who are making significant contributions to the understanding of cancer.

Its two claws are very different in size, are elongated, and bear many long teeth on the inner surface. Description Dinochelus ausubeli has a carapace length of around , and is in life mostly translucent white, with reddish pink colouring near the middle of the carapace, on the tail fan, on the antennae, and on the first pereiopods (including the claws). Its two claws are very different in size. Distribution and discovery D. ausubeli is only known from its type locality, , off the coast of Luzon in the Philippines. It was found by trawling at a depth of around in 2007, as part of the Census of Marine Life, a major effort to document marine life in the first decade of the 21st century. It was described in 2010 by an international team of scientists. Taxonomy The new species was placed in a separate genus, Dinochelus, whose name derives from the Greek roots (dinos), meaning \\"terrible\\" or \\"fearful\\", and (chela), meaning \\"claw\\". The specific epithet \\"ausubeli\\" honours Jesse H. Ausubel, the sponsor of the Census of Marine Life, \\"in recognition of his vision and support for marine biodiversity exploration\\". Dinochelus belongs to a group of lobsters previously recognised as the separate family, Thaumastochelidae, which also includes the genera Thaumastocheles and Thaumastochelopsis. These genera all show very long, toothed claws with a bulbous base, with one claw much longer than the other. Dinochelus has features in common with each of those genera; on the basis of DNA sequencing using cytochrome oxidase I, Dinochelus is thought to be the sister taxon to Thaumostocheles + Thaumastochelopsis.

It is an active practice for developing self-knowledge. It is a search for meaning out of which may arise greater social understanding‚Äîdeeper, genuine interest in one's fellow man. Biography work is founded upon the vast work of Rudolf Steiner, collectively called spiritual science or anthroposophy--\\"wisdom or knowledge of the human being.\\" Anthroposophy is often described as a path from the spiritual in the human being to the spiritual in the world or cosmos. A profound relationship exists between the cosmos or macrocosm and the human being as microcosm. Indeed, anthroposophy suggests the human being is a microcosm of the macrocosm. Yet, biography work works directly with physical existence, life on earth, which itself speaks volumes, if we will but \\"learn to read the text\\" of the individual experience, as well as that of the archetype. The human being is a bridge then: on the one hand, embedded in the earth, directed by the rhythms of nature, the seasons, night and day, etc.; and, on the other hand, belonging to the spiritual world. \\"The only real hope of people today is probably a renewal of certainty that we are rooted in the earth, and at the same time in the cosmos,\\" as so beautifully described by Vaclav Havel (The Measure of Man).  Individuality and Connection to Others  The human life, one's biography, is shaped by the inherently creative and uniquely individual power of the \\"I\\" or Higher Ego or Higher Self. It is an exploration of the role of the \\"I\\" in unfolding a life full of gifts, opportunities, illnesses, accidents, struggles, tasks, responsibilities, and perhaps above all questions. Biography work invites new self-understanding and, in turn, awakens interest in the experiences of others. In an evermore virtual world, biography work fosters real meetings and genuine appreciation for the diversity of human endeavor and creativity.  History  Biography Work was first developed in the 1970s, arising out of a picture of human development given by Rudolf Steiner early in the twentieth century. Steiner described physical, soul, and spiritual development from birth to death in great detail, and included, as a significant aspect of the whole human being, the soul‚Äôs further spiritual growth after death and through successive lifetimes, i.e. reincarnation. Steiner knew that in our time there would be tremendous need for increased social understanding, and that study of human development would be an essential foundation of such understanding. One of the earliest descriptions of biography work given by Rudolf Steiner appears in the lecture titled \\"How Can the Destitution of Soul in Modern Times Be Overcome?\\" and is as follows: \\"As many descriptions as possible of how human beings really develop‚Äîwhat I would call the positive natural history of individual human development‚Äîmust be disseminated in an understanding way. Wherever we can we should describe how this or that person developed‚Äîwe should be able to give a loving account of human development, as we have observed it. The study of life is needed, the will to the understanding of life.\\" Drawing on the many references found in multiple lectures given by Rudolf Steiner, students of his work and leaders in the anthroposophical community began to create practices that are today collectively referred to as \\"biography work\\" (or sometimes \\"social art\\"). Two of those leaders, Bernard Lievegoed, a Dutch physician, and Gudrun Burkhard, a physician who still lives and practices in Brazil, both teachers and authors as well, led a pioneering initiative and introduced this new way of life- consultation, first in their respective regions and soon to the world. In the United States, the efforts of George and Gisela O'Neil culminated in the publication (by Florin Lowndes, after the O'Neils' deaths) of The Human Life, a rich depiction of human development, birth to death, a thorough exploration of their original work in developing the life-chart, and a comprehensive collection of references made by Dr. Steiner regarding human biography.  Method or Ways of Working  Biography work is about listening. At the heart of biography work is the understanding that each life story is a unique revelation of intention and deep wisdom. For the biography practitioner, each ‚Äújourney‚Äù is sacred, and there is an understanding that the ‚Äútraveler‚Äù is continually informed by both individual and universal truths. Biography practitioners bring a broad perspective, artistic exercises, and true listening to life explorations. Biography work is phenomenological; its methods based in phenomenology, particularly as developed by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Biography practitioners (also called biography workers, social artists) work via the following: workshops, adult education courses, one-on- one or small group conversation, counseling, consultation and continuing education for professionals.  Workshops and Courses  These are offered on a variety of themes and the learning process is typically infused with social art. Sessions might include short talks, biography exercises, work with storytelling, nature observation, artwork, meditation or inner practice, and conversation. One of the gifts of working in groups is a heightened appreciation for each unique life as it resonates within the context of universal patterns.  Conversation  Being one of the most human of activities, conversation is central to biography work.  Counseling  Some certified biography practitioners are also licensed in counseling, psychotherapy, social work and the like. They typically work in a formal or clinical setting and are able to address crises, life-changing events, inner difficulties, and illness.  Consultation and Continuing Education  Biography practitioners can bring new perspectives to existing professions such as art therapy, medicine, care for the elderly, hospice, work with the homeless, and more.

Biography Born in Paris to Turkish-Jewish immigrants, Misrahi studied at the University of Paris (Sorbonne), where he became a protege of Jean-Paul Sartre. He is currently the emeritus professor of ethical philosophy at the Universit√© de Paris I (Sorbonne), he has published a number of works on Spinoza and published the essentials of his work on the question of happiness. He has published a number of works in publications including Les Temps modernes, Encyclop√¶dia Universalis, Le Dictionnaire des philosophies \\"PUF\\", but also Lib√©ration and le Nouvel Observateur. In 1974 he was the doctoral advisor of future UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, S√©rgio Vieira de Mello. In November 2002, he published a polemic in the columns of Charlie Hebdo, regarding a book by controversial Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci, la Rage et l'Orgueil. During his studies at the Sorbonne, Misrahi also became involved with the militant Zionist group Lehi, which was then conducting an insurgency in Palestine against the British. Misrahi was recruited to carry out an attack on British soil. During a March 1947 visit to London, Misrahi placed a bomb in the Colonial Club, a recreational facility for students and soldiers from British colonies in Africa and the West Indies. The bomb, which detonated on March 7, 1947 blew out the facility's doors and windows and seriously injured several soldiers.Cesarani, David: Major Farrans Hat: The Untold Story of the Struggle to Establish the Jewish State, p. 117-118Eliav, Yaakov: Wanted  Works  * La condition r√©flexive de l'homme juif, Julliard, 1963 * Spinoza, Choix de textes et Introduction, Seghers, 1964 * Martin Buber, philosophe de la relation, Seghers, 1968 * Lumi√®re, commencement et libert√©, Plon, 1969 ; Seuil, 1996 * Le D√©sir et la r√©flexion dans la philosophie de Spinoza, Gordon and Breach, 1972 * Marx et la question juive, Gallimard, 1972 * La philosophie politique et l'Etat d'Israel, Mouton, 1975 * Trait√© du bonheur : 1, construction d'un Ch√¢teau, Seuil, 1981, 1995 ; Celtic knot, 2006 * Trait√© du bonheur : 2, √©thique, politique et bonheur, Seuil, 1984 * Trait√© du bonheur : 3, les actes de la joie, PUF, 1987, 1997 (R√©√©died Encre marine, 2010) * Ethique, de Spinoza, Traduction, Introduction, Commentaires et Index de Robert Misrahi, PUF, 1990, 1993 ; editions de l'Eclat, 2005 * Le Corps et l'esprit dans la philosophie de Spinoza, synth√©labo, les Emp√™cheurs de penser en rond, 1992 * Spinoza, Grancher, 1992 * Le bonheur, Essai sur la joie, Hatier, 1994 * La probl√©matique du sujet aujourd'hui, encre marine, 1994 * La signification de l'√©thique, Synth√©labo - les Emp√™cheurs de penser en rond, 1995 * Existence et D√©mocratie, PUF, 1995 * La jouissance d'√™tre : Le sujet et son d√©sir, essai d'anthropologie philosophique, encre marine, 1996, 2009 * Les figures du moi et la question du sujet depuis la Renaissance, Armand Colin, 1996 * L'√™tre et la joie, Perspectives synth√©tiques sur le spinozisme, encre marine, 1997 * Qu'est-ce que l'√©thique ?, Armand Colin, 1997 * Spinoza, Armand Colin, 1998 * Qu'est-ce que la libert√© ?, Armand Colin, 1998 * Qui est l'autre ?, Armand Colin, 1999 * D√©sir et besoin, Ellipses, 2001 * 100 mots pour construire son bonheur, Le Seuil - les Emp√™cheurs de penser en rond, 2004 * 100 mots sur l'Ethique de Spinoza, Le Seuil - les Emp√™cheurs de penser en rond, 2005 * Spinoza, M√©dicis-Entrelacs, 2005 * Le philosophe, le patient et le soignant, Les Emp√™cheurs de penser en rond, 2006 * Le Travail de la libert√©, Le bord de l'eau, 2008 * Savoir vivre.

Life Bentham was a son of the Rev. Samuel Bentham (c.1681‚Äì1733), registrar of Ely Cathedral and vicar of Witchford near Ely, and his wife, Philippa Willen (c.1681‚Äì1747). The Benthams were a clerical family, and James was the sixth priest in a continuous descent from Thomas Bentham (1513/14‚Äì1579), Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield. His elder brother, Edward (1707‚Äì1776) became a distinguished theologian and natural philosopher, and Regius Professor of Divinity at Oxford. The family were distant cousins of the philosopher and reformer Jeremy Bentham (1748‚Äì1832).For a family tree, see From Ely Grammar School, James was admitted 26 March 1727 to Trinity College, Cambridge, from which he graduated B.A. in 1730, and M.A. in 1738. In 1733 he was presented to the vicarage of Stapleford in Cambridgeshire, which he resigned in 1737, when he was made a minor canon of Ely. In 1767 Bentham was presented by Bishop Matthias Mawson to the vicarage of Wymondham in Norfolk, and upon his resignation of that living in the following year to the rectory of Feltwell St Nicholas in the same county. This preferment he held till 1774, when Bishop Edmund Keene presented him to the rectory of Northwold, which, after five years' tenure, he gave up for a prebendal stall in Ely Cathedral. To this was added in 1783, on the presentation of the Rev. Edward Guellaume, the rectory of Bowbrick Hill, Buckinghamshire. Bentham died at his prebendal house, Ely, on 17 November 1794, at the age of 86. Works In 1757, Bentham published proposals for making turnpike roads under the title of Queries Offered to the Consideration of the Principal Inhabitants of the City of Ely and Towns adjacent. His plan, after encountering ridicule, was carried into effect under powers obtained by an act of parliament passed in 1763, and by the aid of subscriptions and loans of money. A road was made between Ely and Cambridge, and the system was extended to other parts of the Isle of Ely. Some twenty years later Bentham published Considerations and Reflections upon the Present State of the Fens, with a view to encouraging their improvement by draining and enclosing Grunty Fen, a large tract of common near Ely of 1,300 acres. His major work, The History and Antiquities of the Conventual and Cathedral Church of Ely, was begun in 1756, when he circulated printed lists of the abbots, bishops, priors, and deans of Ely among his friends, for the purpose of obtaining materials. The work was sent to the press in 1764, and published in 1771. It was a quarto volume, printed at Cambridge by his brother Joseph (a Cambridge alderman, and printer to the university). William Cole's notes on Bentham's work are in William Davis's An Olio of Bibliographical and Literary Anecdotes and Memoranda, Original and Selected. During the later period of his life Bentham collected materials for illustrating the \\"Ancient Architecture of this Kingdom\\", a work he was unable to complete. Family Bentham married twice. His second wife, Mary Dickens of Ely, bore him a son, also named James, and a daughter. The younger James became vicar of West Bradenham in Norfolk. In 1812‚Äì17 he published, in two volumes at Norwich, a second edition of his father's History of Ely Cathedral, prefaced by a memoir of his father. Supplements were published by William Stevenson, also at Norwich, in 1817. References *Dictionary of National Biography, Bentham, James (1708‚Äì1794), historian of Ely, by Robert Harrison.

Born in Madrid on April 7, 1969, he illustrates children's literature and young adult fiction, school books, comic books, advertising material and press.  Biography  Alberto de Hoyos started as an amateur comic artist in the mid- eighties, and published his work in independent and alternative Spanish comic magazines in the nineties. After majoring in Fine Arts at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid, he began his career as a professional illustrator and designer. His versatile style enables him to work for all ages and in a variety of fields, such as press, advertising, children's and teenager's literature, and also school textbooks. He develops his most interesting work in digital painting, children's literature and young adult fiction, where, from a mixed technique, combining through computer software, pencil, painting, engraving, watercolor and collage, it has evolved to a totally digital technique in which it discards the imitation of traditional tools and reduces expressive resources to more artificial digital effects and textures. He illustrates and designs book, cover art and collections for various publishing companies: Pearson International, Bayard, Oxford University Press, Editorial San Pablo (Spain), Edelvives (Spain). As for press, he collaborates as illustrator and cover page artist for Spanish newspapers and magazines: ABC, Blanco y Negro, Nuevo Trabajo, Gu√≠a de Madrid... As a school textbook illustrator he has worked for many publishers, both Spanish (Edelvives, Santillana, Anaya, Bru√±o, ESC, Almadraba, Richmond...) and international (Macmillan, Oxford University Press, Pearson Education, Kumon, Disney...).

The company was founded in 1889 by Thea Foss (1857‚Äì1927) and her husband Andrew Foss. The company is now the largest tug and towing concern on the west coast of the United States. July 2, 2013, Foss Marine Holdings announced that (effective at that date) it merges all of its operations and resources under a single name: 'Foss Maritime Company'. Founding and early years The Foss concern began in 1889 with a single rowboat which Thea Foss rented by the day in Tacoma while her husband Andrew, a builder, was working on a construction project. At the end of the building, the Fosses realized that Thea's boat had made them more money than Andrew's carpentry. They acquired more boats, and soon began operating larger vessels, branching out into sailboats, naptha launches, gasoline-engined vessels, and scows and barges. By 1916 Foss Launch and Tug Company bought Captain O.G. Olson's Tacoma towing business, including the steam tugs Echo, Elf, and Olympian. When Thea Foss died in 1927, the company owned 27 gasoline, diesel, and steam powered vessels, and numerous unpowered barges. Arthur Foss; built 1889, retired 1968, now owned by Northwest Seaport Later years Foss tug dieselised their fleet c.1930. In this way, they were in a better position to weather the Depression. Their small competition either went under or were bought out. During the Second World War, Foss tugs were seconded to the US Navy to fight in the Pacific. Tugs were needed to help the Navy in the South Pacific; in the North Pacific with the Aleutian Campaign; in Alaska with the Alaska Highway. More tugs were built in the emergency program and these became available after the war. Foss tug would buy and sell used tugboats and name them with a member of the family. Many famous tugs from the Seattle area have been renamed for a Foss. The condition of the vessel and the number of work contracts at the time dictated ownership. Foss owned several Miki-class tugs. In the post war years, large pulp mills were built around Puget Sound, as were large bridges. These provided work for the tugs. Cement, chemicals, pulp, aircraft, fish, and the Cold War, with the DEW line in Alaska, provided work . The North Slope oil boom continued the work for tugs after 1968. By this time Foss had expanded to deep sea work and had become harbor tugs in San Francisco and Los Angeles. Foss Maritime has 90 tugs and an equal number of barges. Early vessels Foss Maritime started out only with rowboats with their signature white and green trim paint. Sooner than later Foss started expanding their venue of work. They saw what the people of Washington wanted, so they expanded to developing towing tugs. Some of their first powered vessels were built by the hands of the Foss family itself. Her first power vessel was the St. Patrick, a steamer that operated in the Commencement Bay. The steamer ran aground, and was fully rebuilt by Thea's carpenter husband. The boat was then sold for another steamer. Their second powered vessel was Lizzie A. This was one of the worst boats the Foss family ever owned and quickly sold the unreliable vessel for $500. One of the most important ships this is still seen today in the Puget Sound area is the vessel called Hope. This was a naphtha-fueled vessel that solely operated rafting giant Douglas Fir logs in the sound area. Bay Area On September 1, 1993, Foss Maritime expanded into the San Francisco Bay Area, maintaining a pool of vessels and barges for Tug/Barge escort, docking, and other services in conjunction with SeaRiver maritime. Today Foss provides three large conventional SeaRiver tugs and one Foss cycloidal tractor tug. The Foss SeaRiver Tug office is located at 150A West Industrial Way, Benicia, CA . Current officers *John Parrott, President and CEO Hybrid Technology In recent times, Foss Maritime has been working on lowering their NOx and carbon dioxide emissions. Foss constructed a hybrid tug, Caroline Dorothy, to reduce atmospheric pollution. Their hybrid craft cuts down as much as 44% of harmful emissions dispersed into the atmosphere. The boat idles only 7% of the time. The hybrid tugboat uses diesel power when under sail, and recharges the hybrid batteries when anchored, reducing fuel consumption. During other times, the hybrid tug is battery-powered. The boat has both hybrid and diesel power working on the same drive shaft. This hybrid craft operates on two different fuel systems. When the tug needs power, it switches to diesel. While it is using diesel, the power generated by the propeller charges the craft's hybrid system. In July 2013, Foss announced to retrofit a third tug. Other new developments Foss Maritime developed and built an ASD Z-Drive and Voith Schneider Propulsion cycloidal tractor tugs capable of working with the largest vessels in its operating area. Awards In 2008, the United States Coast Guard awarded Foss Maritime its most prestigious environmental honor for developing the low-emission, hybrid tugboat Green Dolphin. The award was the William M. Benkert 'gold' award for their impact on the environment. Earlier, in June 2008, Foss won the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Air Excellence Award, also for their green tug. Foss also received a Commendation- Environmental Award from BP Shipping and an honorable mention for the 2008 Port of Seattle Environmental Business of the Year award. Foss has maintained their green technology. Recently, the company has been working on bringing a sister ship hybrid tug into the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.

She was recruited as an MI5 infiltration agent by Maxwell Knight of B5(b) Section in 1931.Christopher Andrew, The Defence of the Realm: The Authorized History of Mi5 (London, 2009), p. 179. Under the instructions of Knight, Gray moved to London and became a member of the Friends of the Soviet Union in 1932.The National Archives, file no. KV2/1022. Knight's reasoning behind Gray becoming a member of a pro-Soviet organisation but not actually offering to spy on Britain for the Soviet Union, was that the most successful counterespionage agents were those who were approached by the enemy organisation. This plan met with success in 1934. Then, after a period of working for the Anti-War Movement, she was approached by Harry Pollitt and asked to undertake a 'special mission', on behalf of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB). Having accepted the request, Gray was sent to Paris on June 6, 1934; she was to rendezvous with Percy Glading, an officer of League Against Anti-Imperialism and a founding member of the CPGB. Following the meeting, Gray was instructed by Glading to go to India to deliver money and messages to insurgent elements. However, the cover story provided to Gray by the CPGB was so flimsy for a woman travelling alone during the monsoon season to India that she would easily rouse the suspicion of the authorities. Knight's B5(b) section, therefore, stepped in to concoct a plausible cover story to enable her to continue to gain evidence of CPGB espionage.Andrew, The Defence of the Realm, p. 180. On her return from India, Gray worked as Pollitt's personal secretary until she dropped all work with the communists in 1935 because of the strain of maintaining a double life. Glading case On Knight's instructions, Gray had maintained social contact with both Pollitt and Glading. Glading asked Gray to engage in suspicious activity once more at lunch with her on February 17, 1937. Glading required Gray to rent a flat in London, that the CPGB would subsidise and make available for his use. Gray then rented an apartment at 82 Holland Road, Kensington. Glading then visited the flat on April 21, 1937, with a man whom he referred to as 'Mr. Peters'. 'Peters' was really Theodore Maly, a Soviet spy and a principal agent in Britain. A few months later, Glading visited the flat with a foreign couple, 'Mr and Mrs Stevens' (their real names were William and Mary Brandes), agents of the NKVD who had just escaped from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police having obtained fraudulent Canadian passports.Curtis B. Robinson, Caught Red Starred: The Woolwich Spy-Ring and Stalin's Naval Rearmament on the Eve of War (Bloomington IN, 2011), p. 66. The Brandes then proceeded to bring stolen secret documents, largely from the Woolwich Arsenal, and maps to the apartment to be photographed and developed. They did not return to London after November 1937, and Glading took over the photography of documents. On January 21 Gray rang the authorities to report that Glading was to meet a man at Charing Cross station at 8.15pm to receive still more classified documents.Andrew, The Defence of the Realm, p. 181. The information provided by Gray, who testified under the code name \\"Miss X,\\" led to the apprehension of Glading, Albert Williams, a hitherto-unidentified spy in the Woolwich Arsenal, and two other contacts within the arsenal: George Whomack and Charles Munday.Andrew, The Defence of the Realm, pp. 181-182.  Later life After the successful trial of Glading, Williams, Whomack and Munday, which resulted in six years of penal servitude for Glading, Gray left the Security Service for a new life in Canada.Andrew, The Defence of the Realm, p. 182. Gray was last heard of living outside Toronto in the mid-1980s. She felt aggrieved at being 'dumped' by the service, with only a severance lump sum payment of ¬£500.http://www.grahamstevenson.me.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=230:percy- glading-&catid;=7:g&Itemid;=108  References See also * Harry Pollitt * Maxwell Knight * Mi5 * Theodore Maly Category:1906 births Category:Year of death missing Category:British anti-communists Category:MI5 personnel ","title":"Olga Gray"},{"id":"31599992","text":"Ayigya is a town in Ghana.

In the 1970s the firm merged with Mainprize & Rignall, and in the 1980s acquired Neville Hobson & Co. It was at this point, that the traditional mode of partnership management which involved all Partners in every decision was abandoned in favour of a ‚Äúmore modern‚Äù management committee.

The opening concert was held on May 4, 2011. The building features a distinctive colored glass facade inspired by the basalt landscape of Iceland.  History  Harpa was designed by the Danish firm Henning Larsen Architects in co- operation with Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson. The structure consists of a steel framework clad with geometric shaped glass panels of different colours. The building was originally part of a redevelopment of the Austurh√∂fn area dubbed World Trade Center Reykjav√≠k, which was partially abandoned when the 2008 Icelandic financial crisis took hold. The development was intended to include a 400-room hotel, luxury apartments, retail units, restaurants, a car park and the new headquarters of Icelandic bank Landsbanki. As of 2015, apart from Harpa, only the hotel looked likely actually to be built.'Opna l√∫xush√≥tel vi√∞ H√∂rpu 2018', Vi√∞skiptabla√∞i√∞ (14 April 2015). Construction started in 2007 but was halted with the start of the financial crisis. The completion of the structure was uncertain until the government decided in 2008 to fully fund the rest of the construction costs for the half-built concert hall. For several years it was the only construction project in existence in Iceland. The building was given its name on the Day of Icelandic Music on 11 December 2009, prior to which it was called The Reykjav√≠k Concert Hall and Conference Centre (). The building is the first purpose-built concert hall in Reykjav√≠k and it was developed in consultation with artistic advisor Vladimir Ashkenazy and international consultant Jasper Parrott of HarrisonParrott.http://art4logic.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/harpa-conference- center-opera-in.html It houses the Iceland Symphony Orchestra and the offices of The Icelandic Opera. In the opening concert on 4 May 2011, Iceland Symphony Orchestra performed under the baton of Vladimir Ashkenazy with the Icelandic pianist V√≠kingur √ìlafsson as soloist. The concert was broadcast live on R√öV, the Icelandic National Broadcasting Service. The Icelandic Opera performs at the concert hall even though the venue is primarily designed for concerts, lacking a curtain, proscenium, and any of the traditional stage machinery. Harpa is operated by Portus, a company owned by the Icelandic government and the City of Reykjav√≠k. In 2013, the building won the European Union's Mies van der Rohe award for contemporary architecture. The current director of Harpa is Halld√≥r Gu√∞mundsson.

The specimens are fragmentary, consisting of leafless stems (axes) which branched dichotomously and bore kidney-shaped spore-forming organs or sporangia, apparently at their tips. The internal structure of the stems is unknown. Description Fossils of Hollandophyton colliculum were found near Ludlow, Shropshire, England, in siltstones of upper Silurian age (, around ). They were described as \\"mesofossils\\", i.e. relatively small fragments, the longest of which was only 1.25 mm long, making it difficult to obtain a full understanding of the growth habit of the plant. H. colliculum consisted of leafless stems (axes) which branched dichotomously; those found were all less than 0.7 mm wide. In the fossils, stems appear to have spiralled in a clockwise direction from the bottom to the top, although this effect may have been increased by drying prior to preservation. Sporangia were found attached to short lengths of stem. Rogerson et al. consider that these were the tips of stems, but say that they may have been stalks attached to the sides of stems. Hence it is unclear whether sporangia were borne terminally or laterally. The sporangia were kidney-shaped (reniform), 1.0 to 1.6 mm wide and 0.5 to 0.8 mm high. The stem or stalk widened somewhat where it joined the sporangium. The sporangium wall contained swollen cells and had a 'bumpy' appearance. Spores appear to have been released through the appearance of an opening in a depression around the top of the sporangium, not sufficiently wide to result in its disintegration into two valves. Rogerson et al. say that this is the earliest evidence for \\"predetermined\\" dehiscence (opening to release spores). Triradiate spores with fine surface markings were found. They were all of one size, up to 30 ¬µm in diameter. In one specimen, two stomata were found immediately below the attachment of a sporangium to the stem. The best preserved is circular, around 35 ¬µm in diameter, with two guard cells. Hollandophyton was (at least in 2002) the oldest fossil on which both stomata and sporangia have been found. Taxonomy The genus Hollandophyton was published in 2002 by Rogerson et al., the name being in honour of the contribution to Silurian geology by C.H. Holland. The specific epithet colliculum, from the Latin collicula, a little hill, refers to the \\"hillocky\\" appearance of the sporangia. Phylogeny The relationships of Hollandophyton are uncertain. The internal anatomy of the stem is unknown. The overall organization of the plant ‚Äì branching stems with terminal sporangia ‚Äì resembles that of the genus Cooksonia, including the species now called Aberlemnia caledonica (formerly Cooksonia caledonica). The twisted stems resemble Tortilicaulis. Although the general shape of the sporangia resembles that of zosterophylls, Hollandophyton sporangia lack the thickened edges of the sporangial 'valves' which are characteristic of species assigned to this group, such as Zosterophyllum llanoveranum or Ventarura lyonii. Rogerson et al. conclude that Hollandophyton's \\"phylogenetic significance remains obscure.\\" References Category:Silurian life Category:Prehistoric plant genera ","title":"Hollandophyton"},{"id":"31600291","text":"Katrina Bayonas is an actors' agent, film producer and casting director who is best known for discovering Pen√©lope Cruz and managing her career.

The main Christian festivals are Christmas and Easter. The way in which these holidays are celebrated often incorporates traditions from earlier religions. Christmas is held on 25 December each year to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ. It is a public holiday in Nigeria. In Igboland, in addition to a church service and distribution of gifts the festivities may include Mmo (masquerade) dancing, where men in their twenties or thirties dress in colorful costumes and wear masks. These masquerades, which pre-date the introduction of Christianity, honor the ancestral spirits. In some areas, palm branches are hung inside and outside the houses, signs of peace and symbols of Christmas. Easter is held to commemorate the crucification of Jesus Christ on Good Friday and to celebrate his resurrection three days later on Easter Sunday. It is a public holiday in Nigeria. Easter usually occurs in April. Easter Sunday is a joyful occasion, celebrated with feasting, dancing, drumming, and sometimes with public masquerades and dancers. Christmas and Easter may be times of heightened tension between Christians and Muslims in some areas. On Christmas Eve in 2010 at least 38 people were killed, including shoppers and church attendees. Members of the extreme Islamist sect Boko Haram were blamed for several incidents. Some reports placed the death toll as high as 80. In 2011, Easter occurred just after elections in which Goodluck Jonathan, a southerner and Christian, had been elected President. Churches were burned in some parts of northern Nigeria, and some Christians were killed in post-election violence. Muslim festivals About half of the population of Nigeria adhere to the Muslim religion, with Muslims living throughout the country but particularly in the north. 50% are Muslims 40% are Christians and 10% percent are other practiced religions There are two main Muslim festivals, Eid Al Fitri and Eid Al Kabir, all national public holidays. The different ethnic groups in different locations have the same way for celebrating these festivals. The three-day festival of Eid Al Fitri celebrates the end of the holy month of Ramadan, a period of fasting from dawn to dusk each day. The festival is a time to give charity to the poor, and to celebrate the completion of Ramadan with family and friends. Bida Emirate durbar festival, 2001 Eid al Kabir (known as Eid al-Adha elsewhere), or \\"Festival of Sacrifice\\", is an important religious holiday celebrated by Muslims worldwide to commemorate the willingness of Abraham ( æIbrƒÅhƒ´m) to sacrifice his son Ishmael (IsmƒÅ'ƒ´l) as an act of obedience to God, before God intervened to provide him with a ram to sacrifice instead. A ram, goat, sheep, cow or camel is sacrificed, with the family eating part of the animal and donating the rest to the poor. The festival is celebrated on the tenth day of Dhu al-Hijjah, the last month in the Islamic calendar. Durbar festivals are celebrated at the culmination of Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. Durbars have been held for hundreds of years in the northern states, notably the Daura Emirate, and gave an opportunity for conscripts to the army to display their skills as horsemen. In modern times, durbars are held in honor of visiting heads of state. They include a parade, shows and competitions. The horsemen are dressed in vividly colored costumes, with period weapons, and are accompanied by a drum corps and musicians. Modern Durbar festivals include prayers at the start of the day, followed by parades in town squares or in front of the local emir's palace. Horsemanship is still the main focus. Each group must gallop at full tilt past the Emir, then halt and salute him with raised swords. Durbar festivals are being developed as important tourist attractions. Other Important festivals=Afan National Festival Sights of the Afan National Festival, 2020 edition: Afizere (Jarawa) dancers from Toro LGA, Bauchi State. The Afan National Festival is annually held in the town of Kagoro in the southern part of Kaduna State, Nigeria on the 1st of January at the Chief of Kagoro's palace field with many cultural displays by troops from within the township, its vicinity and across the Middle Belt of the country. It is said to have been active for over 400 years. Argungu Fishing Festival The Argungu Fishing Festival is an annual four-day festival in the town of Argungu in the north-western Nigerian state of Kebbi. It began in the year 1934, as a mark of the end of the centuries-old hostility between the Sokoto Caliphate and the Kebbi Kingdom. The festival is held on the Sokoto river in February or March. Thousand of fishermen equipped only with nets compete to catch the largest fish. Other attractions include dance and music, sporting competitions and exhibits of arts and crafts. People from various parts of the world come to see or look at this festival. Ikeji Arondizuogu Ikeji cultural festival of Arondizuogu in Imo State is a popular festival that brings the Igbo speaking community around the world together. Its origin dates back to over five centuries and it is acclaimed as the biggest pan-Igbo cultural community festival with strong heritage, international recognition and is witnessed by thousands of people on a yearly basis. It is arguably the biggest cultural festival in Igboland. In contemporary times, each passing year has witnessed an increase in grandeur, display, dance, sophistication and an all-inclusive participation of all Arondizuogu people and friends. The festival is marked with colourful display of different masquerades such as Ogionu, Mgbadike, Nwaaburuja and Ozoebune; prestigiously parading across the market square to the admiration of the public. The essence of the festival, which ranks among the best surviving traditional ceremonies of the Arondizuogu people, is to celebrate the harvest of the first yams. It serves to unify and foster ties among Aro people who are spread across the entire Igbo speaking states and part of Cross River state. It appeals to the entire Igbo speaking peoples both at home and in the Diaspora. Ikeji is a four-day festival of propitiation, thanksgiving and feasting which is held annually in March or April. Reckoned with the Igbo calendar, these four days correspond to one Igbo week of four market days (Eke, Oye/Orie, Afo and Nkwo). Each of these days has a special significance and represents one of the several dimensions of Ikeji ‚Äì a festival renowned for sumptuous feasting, fascinating masquerades, pulsating rhythms, and colourful performances. Traditional musical instruments used to accompany the masquerades are ekwe (wooden slit drum) of various sizes, ogene (metal gong), bells, maracas and oja (wooden flutes). The flutist is a very important element in the ikeji festival. He deftly communicates with the masquerades - weaving soulful melodies and blending esoteric messages into the intoxicating rhythm of the drums. Another interesting aspect of ikeji is the raconteur known as ima mbem - an imaginative tale delivered with a musical cadence that only the initiated can sometimes understand or comprehend. The importance of the flutist during Ikeji festival is very vital, for he communicates things hidden from the ordinary eyes to the masquerades, combined with soulful melodies, steps and gestures, ‚Äúblending esoteric messages into the intoxicating rhythm of the drums‚Äù to the admiration of the crowd. During Ikeji festival, on the last day, a ram is usually tied to a pole at a popular market square with a single thread. Somebody with the strongest protection from any juju of whatever type is expected to leisurely walk to the ram amids heavy attempt with juju from other people to knock him down, maim him or kill him. Only the brave can participate in, while the not so brave will either abstain from or remain with the crowd as spectators. Only the brave can stand forward from the crowd, one after another and approach the tree with a view to untying the ram. However, each contender will be attacked by forces which are beyond the scope of this article to explain, with a view to stopping him reaching the ram. If overwhelmed, he will beat a retreat back to his starting point. Until eventually, the bravest among the masquerades participating in the competition for that year's festival, after overcoming all odds, will reach the ram and untie it and take it, to a thunderous applause by the spectators. This will be followed by visits to his house by fellow kinsmen with food and wine for elevating the status of his village. Each year this is used to commemorate the person in Arondizuogu and neighbouring towns with the strongest juju or voodoo power. Calabar Carnival The Calabar Carnival has been held in Calabar since 2006, including band competitions, a parade, food and dancing. It has been called Nigeria's biggest street party. The carnival may have as many as 50,000 costumed participants and 2 million spectators, and is broadcast on television across the country. It is the culmination of the month-long Calabar festival. The Calabar Carnival holds at the end of the year in Nigeria, and in keeping with tradition, carnival teams march across the streets where they engage in colorful displays and competitions from which winners are selected and awarded. Participating teams usually rehearse for months in advance before the carnival date itself. Carniriv Young Stunna performing at Carniriv Opening Ceremony. The Carniriv () is an annual festival, held in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. The Carnival starts few weeks before Christmas, and lasts for seven days. During this time several ceremonial events are held, most of which hold some cultural and or sacred significance. The Port Harcourt Carnival bears a certain uniqueness as it combines two carnivals - a purely cultural carnival and a contemporary Caribbean style carnival- in one. This gives it an edge over all other regional and continental carnivals, and presents with the principal advantage which must be consummately exploited. The Government of Rivers State recognizes Carniriv as its biggest tourism export. With economic interests increasingly identifying tourism as a viable alternative to the fossil fuel economy‚Äìespecially in these parts‚Äìthe state government has exhibited its commitment to developing this carnival into a regionally unrivalled and globally reckoned tourist attraction. Thus, it has always made available the necessary monetary backing needed for the event to hold every year, and has also worked hard through the Ministry of Culture and Tourism to see that it is held. Eyo festival An Eyo Iga Olowe Salaye masquerade jumping The Eyo Festival is held in Lagos, Nigeria. It is usually performed in Lagos Island.

Harvey T. \\"Pop\\" Hollinger (October 13, 1886 ‚Äì March 6, 1977) was one of the first comic book collectors. He set up his retail and mail order shop for new and used comics in Concordia, Kansas, in the late 1930s.  Biography =Early life Hollinger was born in rural Chapman, Kansas, and lived there through his high school years. After high school, he purchased a Harley- Davidson motorcycle and camera, then proceeded to travel the Midwest earning money for gas and food by selling photos he took along the way. In 1905, Hollinger married and in the same year enrolled at McPherson College in McPherson, Kansas. He played football and baseball for the McPherson Bulldogs until he graduated in 1912 with a liberal arts degree. In 1914, Hollinger and his family moved to Concordia, Kansas, to accept the position of teacher of applied sciences at Concordia Junior-Senior High School where he created the Industrial Arts program. In 1933 he retired from his teaching job to become self-employed running a service station and operated a secondhand store as a sideline in the basement of a local grocer. In 1939, Pop transitioned to selling mainly periodicals and comic books. Pop Hollinger ran his used comic book store from 1939 until 1971. Pop bought and sold old comic books throughout the Golden Age and Silver Age. During World War II, Pop was asked to return to high school teaching as many of the instructors had joined the fight. Comic books Hollinger entered into the comics trade through his retail store and expanded into mail order. Originally a side business, he became so successful that he began working on ways to trade comics and began experimenting with restorative methods. His restoring attempts included using tape and staples and were primarily done to enhance the longevity of the reading experience rather than to boost the collector value. Hollinger referred to this process as 'rebuilding' and to the comic books as 'rebuilt comics'. Inventions Hollinger held several patents, including a Tray Dispenser (patent 4323168), a method and apparatus for dispensing flexible trays.

During his career, he guided Theodore Roosevelt, Baron Rothschild, and Ernest Hemingway on African hunts. Hemingway modelled the fictional hunter Robert Wilson in his story \\"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber\\" after Percival. Percival also worked with well-known white hunters like Bror von Blixen-Finecke and mentored Sydney Downey and Harry Selby, and was known in African hunting circles as the \\"Dean of Hunters\\". Early life Percival was born in Newcastle upon Tyne in Northern England, at the tail end of the 19th century. When Philip was still quite young, his older brother Blaney (born 1875) went off to East Africa, and proceeded to send Philip several exciting accounts of his life as a game warden there. When Philip turned 21 he inherited a small sum of money and struck out to join his brother in Africa, sailing to Mombasa. Percival settled in Limuru, where he grew coffee and wheat and bred ostriches, cattle and horses. Hunting life Upon reaching Africa, Percival was quick to pick up hunting with his brother, and Harold and Clifford Hill, who were also ostrich farmers. The ostriches they raised were used as bait to lure lion and other big game. At first, Percival mainly hunted lion with the Hills, but in time he started to lead hunting trips of his own. Initially he charged clients a fee of ten pounds per week and an additional twenty-five pounds per lion and in those days guides like Percival only provided the wagon, pack animals and a couple of assistants, leaving the clients to provide their own food, drink, tents and bedding. Theodore Roosevelt safari In 1909, Philip's brother Blaney had been instrumental in bringing then Colonel Theodore Roosevelt to East Africa for a safari and Philip was given the opportunity to work as an assistant hunter on the trip. Roosevelt remembered Percival well, writing about him: :\\"At Bondoni was Percival, a tall, sinewy man, a fine rider and shot‚Äîlike so many other men whom I met, he wore merely a helmet, a flannel shirt, short breeches or trunks, and puttees and boots. I shall not forget seeing him one day as he walked beside his twelve-ox team, cracking his long whip, while in the big wagon sat pretty Mrs. Percival with a puppy, and little cheetah cub, which we had found and presented to her and which she was taming.\\" After the Roosevelt safari, Percival decided to become a full-time white hunter and one of his first solo clients was Baron Rothschild, but he also conducted safaris for other royals like the Duke and Duchess of Connaught. Company man As he became more ingrained into the hunting life, Percival joined the safari company Newland and Tarlton, along with other hunters like Alan Black. When Newland and Tarlton dissolved in 1919, and Safariland was created out of its ashes, he stayed on with that outfit as well. During this time, he mentored a new generation of hunters like Sydney Downey and Harry Selby. Percival also went on to become the first president of the East African Professional Hunter's Association, a position he served in for 15 years. In 1930, before his tenure as EAPHA president, Percival left Safariland to team up with Bror von Blixen-Finecke in the joint venture Tanganyika Guides Ltd., of which he was the Kenya director, with Bror heading up the Tanganyika operation. Ernest Hemingway During his partnership with von Blixen, Percival guided Ernest Hemingway on both of Hemingway's African safaris, the first coming in 1934. Hemingway struck up a friendship with Percival, affectionately calling him \\"Pop\\", a name they used for each other, and also one of the monikers Hemingway gave to Jackson Philips in The Green Hills of Africa, a character modelled on Percival. Hemingway also considered Percival a great teacher, and most notably molded the Percival he knew into the character of Robert Wilson, in \\"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber\\". Yet Percival was not the only model for Wilson, and indeed critics have identified Bror von Blixen as another influence, especially in terms of Wilson's \\"cynicism and womanizing\\". Legacy The legacy of Philip Percival, the \\"Dean of Hunters\\", runs deeper than his influence on Hemingway. Percival also mentored a new generation of African hunters, including Sydney Downey, who called him \\"the greatest white hunter of all time\\", and Harry Selby, who himself went on to captivate a new generation of foreigners through the travel writings of Robert Ruark.

Main characters = Shuichi Shindo  Voiced by: Tomokazu Seki (Japanese); Rich McNanna (English)Both English and Japanese Voice Actors are from \\"Gravitation-Complete Collection (2010)\\" is the primary protagonist of the series. Shuichi's ambition at the start of the series was to follow in the footsteps of his idol, Ryuichi Sakuma, the lead singer of the band Nittle Grasper, by creating his own successful music band named Bad Luck. He has pink hair. One day when, as he is walking through a park reading his lyrics of the song \\"Glaring Dream\\", a sudden breeze blows them away, where they are picked up by a mysterious man who dismisses them as \\"elementary-level\\", saying that Shuichi has zero talent and should just give up. Stung by the man's criticism, Shuichi becomes determined to make him apologize. Shortly after his friend Hiroshi Nakano helps him realize that he is attracted to the man in the park, Shuichi sees an interview on television that shows that the person in the park is in fact, the famous romance novelist Eiri Yuki. Initially, Yuki treats Shuichi coldly, but Shuichi perseveres through Yuki's icy demeanor and eventually the two begin a relationship. Shuichi's band also begins to rise in fame, and a major portion of the series focuses on his attempts to balance the demands of his job with his pursuit of Yuki's affections.  Eiri Yuki  Voiced by: Kazuhiko Inoue (Japanese); Jim J. Ward (English, as Rome Elliot) is a popular romance novelist who met Shuichi Shindo in the park and mercilessly dismissed his song lyrics. Through coincidence, they kept bumping into each other, and eventually came together romantically. In the series (manga and anime), Eiri and Shuichi struggle with their celebrity status and their mercurial relationship. Eiri's father is a monk, who runs a temple in Kyoto. He has one younger brother, Tatsuha Uesugi, who is a monk-in-training. He also has one elder sister, Mika Uesugi, who is married to Tohma Seguchi. At the beginning of the series, Eiri is engaged to Ayaka Usami. In the Gravitation EX first book, Eiri is temporarily, according to himself, blinded. It is unknown whether or not his eyes will heal. He did it to save Riku Kitazawa (his deceased past mentor Yuki Kitazawa's orphaned child) from being run over by a semi-truck, which is unlike his original character. Later, Eiri and Shuichi find that Yoshiki Kitazawa (Yuki Kitazawa's trans sister) had dumped Riku off on them to parent, possibly just until she returns. It turns out in track 76 that Eiri was faking his blindness, though the reason is unknown.  Tohma Seguchi  Voiced by: Ai Orikasa (Japanese); Bill Rogers (English) is the keyboard player in Nittle Grasper and Mika Seguchi's husband. He is the head of N-G recording company and demands the best from all his contractual bands. Tohma is very protective of Eiri Yuki, and blames himself for the trauma Eiri suffered as a teenager, seeing that he was the one who hired Yuki Kitazawa in the first place. He has declared Eiri as his dearest. He is unfailingly polite to the point where he will refer to anybody (including his wife) as -san, and appears to be a friendly and even-tempered person (if also a ruthless businessman). As the series goes on, it becomes evident that much of this is a carefully constructed mask: when Eiri is involved, Tohma has been known to be far from rational and soft-spoken. Tohma is an anime-adaptation of Daisuke Asakura, who wrote most of the music for the series  Supporting characters = Hiroshi Nakano  Voiced by: Yasunori Matsumoto (Japanese); Daniel Kevin Harrison (English) is like a big brother to Shuichi. He is Shuichi's best friend and the other original member of Bad Luck. Quiet and far more wise than the impetuous Shuichi, Hiroshi tries to serve as the voice of reason for Shuichi as he falls head over heels for Eiri Yuki. Hiroshi himself is not immune to love. He eventually finds himself smitten with Eiri‚Äôs supposed fiance√© from Kyoto. At first, it doesn't seem as though it will go far because Ayaka still seems to have feelings for Yuki. However, over time she gets over Yuki and agrees to go steady with Hiro. Ayaka made a bet with Hiro (same with Yuki to Shuichi) that if they sold 1,000,000 copies of one CD they debuted they would go on a date. Hiroshi also has an older brother, Yuuji. The two of them were disowned by their parents for their chosen career choices: Hiroshi, the guitarist in a band, and Yuuji, an actor. Yuuji never ends up getting roles for his acting, but he keeps trying. Hiro also warned Yuki that he had better not make Shuichi cry over anything but Shuichi's own stupidity, anything else Hiro warns that he would teach Yuki a lesson on hurting a brother-like friend that means a lot like Shuichi. Shuichi always told everyone that Bad Luck isn't Bad Luck without Hiro.  Suguru Fujisaki  Voiced by: Fujiko Takimoto (Japanese); Luke Novak (English) is hired as Bad Luck's keyboard player. Though he usually fakes being polite to others, young Suguru is quite similar to his cousin, Tohma Seguchi, despite his unfortunate proclivity for being controlled by others. While only sixteen years old, he has incredible talent‚Äîand knows it. Suguru knows Eiri Yuki's past as well, but it seems that Yuki also knows a bit about Suguru himself: he has commented before about Suguru \\"hiding his real identity\\". He is quite short for his age, something K and Tatsuha constantly tease him about. In the manga, he is also known to make sexual advances towards Hiroshi.  Ryuichi Sakuma  Voiced by: Kappei Yamaguchi (Japanese); Kenneth Miller (English, as Kenneth Robert Marlo) is the lead singer of the popular band Nittle Grasper along with Tohma Seguchi and Noriko Ukai, and friend of Shuichi. He left the band three years ago to pursue a solo career in America, but returned to Japan to reform Nittle Grasper. Shuichi is excited at the news of Nittle Grasper's reunion, but that now makes Ryuichi his rival. Ryuichi is kind and sometimes seems to have the mind of a five-year-old until he starts singing; then he becomes a really cool, mature, vocal god. Other characters have noticed that Ryuichi and Shuichi are quite similar in their childlike manner. His best friend is a pink bunny named Kumagoro (Mr. Bear in the English version), which is from K-san, his old manager. It contains a tracking device and is from the K brand stuffed animal line.  Noriko Ukai  Voiced by: Yuri Amano (Japanese, TV series), Haruna Ikezawa (Japanese, OVA); Megan Hollingshead (English, TV series), Jessica Calvello (English, OVA; as Zoe Fries) used to be the keyboard player for Nittle Grasper, but joins Bad Luck for a bit on Tohma's request. Once Nittle Grapser gets back together though, she leaves for good. Noriko is rude, loud, and talented. She won't take junk from any of her band members, and demands the best out of them. Often she acts like an older sister to Ryuichi.  Claude \\"K\\" Winchester  Voiced by: Ryotaru Okiayu (Japanese); Brian Maillard (English) Claude K. Winchester, known simply as \\"K\\", is Ryuichi's former manager and now the manager for Bad Luck, K is aggressive in promoting the band. His concern is first and foremost Bad Luck, but in his shaping of the band's career, he ends up involving himself in Eiri and Shuichi's relationship. He is American, and in the original Japanese version, they played on the stereotype that Americans always have guns and will pull them out any time, any place. K often speaks English mixed in with his Japanese. Also in the manga it is shown that K has a family; he has a wife named Judy, and a son named Michael.  Mr. Sakano  Voiced by: Takehito Koyasu (Japanese); Bill Timoney (English, as Billy Regan) A very stressed worker, (first name unknown) worships Tohma and tries to be the perfect business man for him no matter what. Sakano takes every opportunity, though he's not as conniving as K. Sakano has a tendency of panicking that often makes him seem like nothing but an overly nervous salaryman. Nevertheless, he takes Bad Luck seriously, and has even gone against Tohma in order to secure their success.  Mika Seguchi  Voiced by: Hiromi Tsuru (Japanese); Debora Rabbai (English, as Angora Deb) is Eiri's older sister and Tohma's wife. She's beautiful, yet cold. She looks quite a bit like Eiri except with longer hair and makeup. In book one, she wanted to make Eiri see his dying father, bribing Shuichi with her own husband (Tohma). Later in the manga series we find out she and Tohma are going to have a child.  Tatsuha Uesugi  Voiced by: Hideo Ishikawa (Japanese); Jason Griffith (English); Hannes Maurer (German) is Eiri's brother, who has the same voice and characteristics as his older brother, but with black hair and eyes. Tatsuha is obsessed with Ry≈´ichi and watches his Nittle Grasper video repetitively. He's quite the perverted and obsessive fan, not to mention a 16-year-old monk.  Ayaka Usami  Voiced by: Rie Tanaka (Japanese); Rachel Lillis (English) is betrothed to Eiri and likes him very much, but wants what's best for him, so she lets Shuichi stay with Eiri and tries to give up on him. Hiro has a crush on her and later they go on a date together.  Reiji  Voiced by: Miki Nagasawa Reiji originally works for the American record company XMR of which her father is the president. She tries to get Shuichi to sign with XMR when he leaves Japan after Eiri breaks up with him. Further continuing the Americans-with-guns stereotype, Reiji is often seen with some sort of projectile weapon, which is more often than not a bazooka. Reiji's ultimate weapon however is her giant Panda mecha, in reference to the fact that she wears glasses, a common insult to meganekko. During his stay in New York, Reiji falls in love with Shuichi, but does not quite understands these feelings at first. She accepts that it can only be a one-sided affection, though that does not stop her from following him back to Japan and becomes Bad Luck's temporary manager while K is suspended. She continues to hang around after his return until Ryuichi decides he wants to return to the U.S. and be an actor; Reiji returns with him to be his new manager. Reiji only appears in the manga and the drama CD.

He was elected to the House of Councillors in the 2019 Japanese House of Councillors election, becoming the first openly-gay man to be elected to either chamber of the National Diet. Previously, he became one of the first two openly gay male politicians to win an election in Japanese history when he was elected in April 2011 to a seat in the Tokyo's Toshima ward assembly. Wataru Ishizaka, also openly gay, was elected in the same election to the Nakano ward council in Tokyo. Before he was elected to the city council, he was Mizuho Fukushima's chief of staff. Personal life and activism A graduate of the Meiji Gakuin University School of Law and a native of Sugamo, he previously served as a secretary to SDP chair Mizuho Fukushima, and founded the gay male support organization Peer Friends in 2004. He came out in 2002 at the age of 28 through a memoir, Where is My Boyfriend? (Boku no kareshi wa doko ni iru?). He has since been active in the Japanese LGBT rights movement and has appeared in various series, including NHK's Heart-to-Heart, and has participated in Tokyo Pride Parade. Political career In October 2013, he ran for Social Democratic Party party chairmanship but lost to National Diet Councilor Tadatomo Yoshida. The first openly gay candidate for leadership of a sitting parliamentary party in Japanese history, Ishikawa was recognized after the election by an editorial in The Japan Times as one who could both \\"be a valuable asset for the SDP\\" and \\"help channel the voices of marginalized people, including irregularly employed workers and members of the gay community, to ensure that they are reflected in local and national politics\\". Ishikawa left the SDP in 2018 and received the nomination of the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan in November for the 2019 House of Councillors election. Political positions=Same-sex matrimonial rights He helped to successfully lobby the Japanese government to amend the certificate allowing Japanese citizens to marry foreign nationals of the same sex in countries where same-sex marriage is legal. He is campaigning for the creation of a municipal domestic partnership registry for Toshima which would grant ward-managed housing and hospital visitation rights. Words and actions In the middle of the night on March 20, 2020 at Shinjuku Ni-ch≈çme, the biggest gay village in Tokyo, Japan, Ishikawa suddenly filmed a police car on patrol. A police officer noticed him and questioned what he was doing, but he ignored the officer and continued to film the video. When the officer asked him to stop filming, he screamed loudly, \\"It's my hobby to film the cops who walk pompously around Shinjuku Ni- ch≈çme,\\" \\"The police have no right of publicity,\\" \\"Tell me your name and let me film your police notebook,\\" etc. When other officers arrived after his own report to the police, he said, \\"I'm a member of the National Diet, you must have been scared.\\" The trouble lasted for about an hour, and he was eventually calmed down by the officers and left the scene. In response to an interview by Asagei Biz about this trouble, he replied in writing that he was \\"not aware of any trouble\\" with the officers and that there was \\"nothing in particular\\" that he did not agree with the officers' behavior. Regarding this trouble, a Japanese comedian criticized him should be resigned a legislator on Twitter. To his lastest tweet before the trouble, more than 1,000 voters replied him to explain. However, he, who should have been elected as a member of the House of Councillors with the confidence of the voters, shut down all inquiries and made no defense to the voters. Later, on April 27, he tweeted as \\"(Ishikawa's staff)\\" and the following day, on April 28, he himself tweeted, but both of the tweets were completely unrelated to the trouble. He also did not respond to questions from an online newspaper about the trouble, after all. Shortly before Shinzo Abe announced his resignation from the position of Prime Minister of Japan on August 28, 2020, citing worsening ulcerative colitis, Ishikawa posted a tweet calling for accountability, saying that Abe would not be allowed to hide behind the clouds. However, despite his stance on holding Abe's accountable, he never fulfilled the accountability demanded by voters for his own problems.

The full title of the painting is The Alchymist, in Search of the Philosopher's Stone, Discovers Phosphorus, and prays for the successful Conclusion of his operation, as was the custom of the Ancient Chymical Astrologers. It has been suggested that The Alchymist refers to the discovery of phosphorus by the Hamburg alchemist Hennig Brand in 1669. This story was often printed in popular chemical books in Wright's lifetime, and was widely known. Description The picture shows the alchemist trying to produce the elusive Philosopher's stone, which could turn ordinary metal into gold, but instead, to his amazement, he discovers phosphorus. However, Wright does not picture the alchemist in a 17th-century background but he romanticises the room by imagining medieval gothic arches and high, pointed windows as if he is in a church. He also gave a very favourable impression of the actual process which involves the reduction by boiling of urine. A 1730 description of the manufacture of phosphorus described the need for 50 or 60 pails of urine that was both putrid and \\"bred worms\\". The Alchemist by Thomas Wijck Wright also gives religious connotations to the painting. The alchemist kneels in front of a shining vessel, stretching out his hands in a similar gesture to that used by El Greco when painting St Francis receiving the Stigmata or St Jerome in Prayer. Benedict Nicolson compares his posture to that of one of Christ's disciples receiving communion. He believes that the layout of the painting may have been taken from Thomas Wijck's painting (left) of an alchemist which also contains similar vaulting, a confusion of objects and a similar assistant who is singled out by the light. This painting from the previous century was on display in London during Wright's lifetime. However it is clear from a sketch by Wright's companion, Peter Perez Burdett, that he had a strong influence on the design. His sketch of 4 February 1771 shows the vaulting and the layout of the painting with the glass container as its focus. It is Burdett who says where to place the figure in the painting and Burdett had already referred Wright to Matthew Turner so that Wright might fully understand the underlying science in the painting. History Since its exhibition in 1771, the picture has provoked many contradictory interpretations. Its mystery obviously disturbed 18th-century viewers, and although Wright was an internationally recognised artist, the painting was not sold when he first exhibited it. The picture travelled with Wright to Italy in 1773‚Äì1775, came back to England, was reworked in 1795, but was only sold four years after his death, when his possessions were auctioned at Christie's.

Henry II gave Horncastle to Gerbald Skalls, Scrivelsby to Robert Marmion and Kirkstead Abbey the Hermitage of Wildmore. Skalls and Marmion gave the monks of Kirkstead right of common pasture in Wildmore. By 1222 the Abbot of Kirkstead, styled Lord of Wildmore, possessed the whole of Wildmore with the exception of Moorhouses which belonged to Revesby Abbey. Wildmore Fen was not drained until 1802, being part of the drainage plans of the East, West, and Wildmore Fens. Wildmore was formed as a parish in 1880 from the fen allotments of West Ashby, Horncastle, Mareham on the Hill, Moorby, Roughton, Thimbleby, High Toynton, Low Toynton, and Wood Enderby; and detached parts of Bolingbroke, Coningsby, Haltham, Tattershall, Tattershall Thorpe, Thornton le Fen, Toynton All Saints, and Wilksby. Church St Peter's church, Wildmore In 1816 the church, known as Frog Hall, was built of red brick, sandstone and limestone. It was dedicated to Saint Peter and is a Grade II listed building. Today Saint Peters Church is one of the Brothertoft Group in the Diocese of Lincoln, also known as \\"Five in the Fen\\", which also includes St Gilbert of Sempringham (Brothertoft), All Saints (Holland Fen), Christ Church (Kirton Holme) and St Margaret of Scotland (Langrick).

The song tells the story of a mother who leaves her child in the care of a friend or neighbor while she goes out to work hard in the fields for no pay. It is sung by this lady to the little black child who has been left in her care. This lady tells the child to fall asleep, because his mother is working in the fields. The lady promises that the child's mother will bring him treats, such as quails and pork, if he falls asleep. The mother is a slave, as she works without pay. The caregiver tells the boy, if he doesn't fall asleep, the white devil, meaning the slave driver, will come to eat his little feet.

It carries federal highway B 49 over the Rhine, and connects central Koblenz with the suburbs of Pfaffendorf and Ehrenbreitstein. The first bridge was completed in 1864. It was destroyed in the Second World War and the current bridge was opened in 1953. First bridge across the Rhine  Pfaffendorf Bridge in 1900 Bridge memorial A column on the Rhine shores (opposite the Weindorf Koblenz restaurant) commemorates the original construction of the Pfaffendorf Bridge between 1862 and 1864. According to the inscription on the front of the column, the foundation stone was laid in the reign of King William I on 11 November 1862 and inaugurated on 9 May 1864. It was initially just a railway bridge, over which the trains of the Rhenish Railway Company ran to Oberlahnstein, connecting the left and right bank lines. It had three spans constructed of wrought iron, each 97 m long. The height of the arch was 3.14 m. There were two 10 metre-high towers at each end of the bridge, which had iron bars that could be used to seal off the bridge in the event of war. In addition, the right bank was protected by the Horchheim Gate Fortress (Horchheimer Torbefestigung) built between 1864 and 1867. The bridge was built as the result of negotiations between Prussia and the Duchy of Nassau. Prussia wanted a line from the existing left bank line to connect with the eastern hinterland of the Rhine that would not be quickly interrupted by enemy advances in case of a war with France. Nassau, however, advocated a line along the right bank of the Rhine. At the same time, Nassau was looking for an opportunity to link the left bank railway line to its own rail network. Under an agreement signed in 1857, on the one hand Nassau granted a concession for the building of the Lahn Valley Railway through its territory, via the Prussian cities of Gie√üen and Wetzlar, to Koblenz, and on the other hand, the construction of the Pfaffendorf Bridge was given the go- ahead. Originally the Pfaffendorf bridge could not be used for road or pedestrian traffic, but as early as 1865, the southern side could be used for general traffic at times when no trains were running. With the construction of the Horchheim Railway Bridge in 1879, the south side of the bridge became permanently available for road traffic. In 1899, the Coblenzer Stra√üenbahn- Gesellschaft (Koblenz Tramway Company) was permitted to build a tram line over the bridge in order to expand its network on the eastern bank. The last trains crossed the Pfaffendorf Bridge at the beginning of the First World War in August 1914. Conversion to a road bridge  In 1932, the City of Koblenz owned the Pfaffendorf Bridge and decided to reconstruct it. In fact, it was almost totally rebuilt. With four road lanes and two pedestrian walkways, it had a total width of 16 m. The bridge towers were demolished by the council and a new connection was provided to the Ehrenbreitstein‚ÄìLahnstein bypass (now federal highway B 42) on the east bank, across the railway line. War damage and reconstruction  View from Glockenberg tunnel Like all bridges in Koblenz, the Pfaffendorf Bridge was dynamited on 7 March 1945 by German troops. Early in 1946, construction of a temporary bridge began. Approval was given in 1950 for the rebuilding of a new fixed bridge over the Rhine and a steel girder design was chosen. The construction of the new bridge would allow the pontoon bridge to be removed. The new Pfaffendorf Bridge had a four-lane roadway, 1.6 m wide bike paths on both sides, and 2.6 m wide footpaths. On 18 July 1953, the bridge was opened to traffic, and the temporary bridge was then removed. A new grade-separated connection from the Pfaffendorf Bridge to the B 42, the 294-metre-long Glockenberg Tunnel, was opened on 27 June 2003, after 12 years of construction.

He was educated at Bonn, became chaplain at Crefeld in 1850, then founded in 1852 the first large exhibition of ancient masterpieces of Christian art, and established a manufactory of silks after the models of the middle ages, for use in churches, and model schools for instruction in the manufacture of church vessels. Volume XXII (2003) Columns 128-135 \\"Franz Johann Joseph Bock\\"  Early life  Bock was born in the town of Burtscheid on March 5, 1823.Francis Bock - Curator of the Diocesan Museum He was the son of Franz Joseph Bock Burtscheider (baptized February 22, 1796), who was a lifeguard. His mother, Agnes Dotru, died when Bock was a young child. He was the only child of this marriage and was raised at first by his grandmother and later by his father. His father had a simple education and didn't earn much, however still was able to send him to the seminary of Kaiser-Karls-Gymnasium and later to study theology at the University of Bonn (1846‚Äì49). In 1850 he became a chaplain at the Krefeld parish church of St. Dionysius and was there until April 1853.  Career  Cloth of Saint Gereon fragment Bock founded in 1852 the first large exhibition of ancient masterpieces of Christian art. In that year he curated a national exhibition on 100 medieval vestments and precious gold items from the Rhenish church treasures when they were first presented to the public. He established a factory of silk production with special designs based on models from Middle Ages patterns. These silks then were used in church items and church related vestments. Bock took a two-year art history tour study period between 1855 and 1857 to collect from different countries throughout Europe ideas and materials. Much of this information eventually ended up in his two volume writing Geschichte der liturgischen Gew√§nder des Mittelalters. He published many other works relative to Christian art and antiquities. In 1872 he published an important work on the church treasures in Maastricht, the Netherlands, along with Micha√´l Willemsen, guardian of the Treasury of the Basilica of Saint Servatius. Bock spent a further eight years in preparing his principal work Die Kleinodien des heiligen R√∂mischen Reichs deutscher Nation nebst den Kroninsignien B√∂hmens, Ungarns und der Lombardei.Franz Bock bio Bock was one of the founders of the archdiocesan art museum Kolumba (a.k.a. \\"Di√∂zesanmuseum\\") at Cologne. In 1853 he made many art and textile purchases for the museum when he traveled around France. He became the founder of a new branch of classical studies when he introduced his work The History of the liturgical vestments of the Middle Ages (1859‚Äì71), which was the first scientific study of the origin and development of ecclesiastical robes with regard to fabric, color, design, editing and ritual significance. When Bock had the opportunity to sell textile fragments to various interested parties (i.e. museums) he would just cut it off from some precious medieval textile he found. His radical treatment of original medieval material earned him the nickname \\"Scissor Bock.\\" For example, when Bock found the Cloth of St Gereon at the old Saint Gereon church he just cut it into four fragments and sold them to museums in Berlin, Lyon and London around 1863 to 1875. These cloth fragments are considered to be of the oldest Western tapestry still in existence.Anzovin, p. 175 The first European tapestry still extant is the Cloth of St. Gereon, originally created for the Church of St. Gereon in Cologne, Germany. It is a seven-color wool tapestry depicting medallions with fighting bulls and gryphons. Most scholars date the work to circa 1000, based on its decorative ornaments, which resemble those in illuminated books of the time.Stanford, volume 7 \\"Tapestry\\" The oldest of these mural tapestries in existence are fragments from the Church of Saint Gereon in Cologne.Beach, The oldest existing mural tapestries are no doubt the fragments from the Church of Saint Gereon in Cologne, which were woven in Europe.Thurstan, p. 11 What is known as the \\"St. Gereon\\" tapestry is the oldest surviving piece of Western European tapestry.The History of Tapestry Bock was a pastor at Cologne from about 1857. From 1854-1875 he was an Executive Board Member of Arts Christian Society for the Archdiocese of Cologne. He was also appointed honorary canon of Aachen Cathedral in 1862. Bock maintained close relationships with like-minded connoisseurs and patrons such as the Cologne Archbishop Johannes von Geissel, the Bishop of Munster Johann Georg M√ºller, Prince Karl Anton of Hohenzollern and to families of the Rhenish and Westphalian nobility and local artisans such as the sculptor Friedrich Wilhelm Mengelberg.  Death  Bock died in Aachen April 30, 1899. The city of Aachen made Bock an honorary grave in the Campo Santo Teutonico in Rome, where a bronze plaque commemorates him.

History Designed in the Commercial or Chicago School style of architecture with Classical Revival touches, it features the three tiers typical of the Commercial style: an ornate main floor exterior, plain middle story exteriors and a not quite as plain top floor crowned with a cornice. When the building opened on February 22, 1926, the bank occupied the ground floor and the upper floors were occupied by about 90 commercial tenants. By 1929, however, there were only 20 tenants left. The bank failed in 1933 and the ground floor became retail space and gradually the upper floors were reoccupied by doctors, dentists, lawyers and accountants and other professionals. Sharp's Drug Store was a longtime occupant of the ground floor. It was the tallest commercial building in Manatee County from completion until 1986 when the 12-story Bradenton Financial Center surpassed it. Today the building is owned by the law firm which occupies most of its space. The ground floor exterior has been restored to its original appearance.

It is located in Tobolsk, Tyumen Oblast, Russia.  History  Aerial view of the Tobolsk Kremlin, taken by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. Tobolsk was founded in 1587. Moscow encouraged the construction of stone buildings there. In 1683-1686, masons sent from Moscow and Veliky Ustyug built the stone St. Sophia-Assumption Cathedral. Around the beginning of the 18th century the stone walls and the towers of the Kremlin were built, as well as a number of buildings that have not survived to our days, standing on a westward line from St. Sophia-Assumption Cathedral: the Holy Trinity Cathedral, the Bishop's House, the Holy Gate with the Church of St. Sergius of Radonezh and the bell tower. The Siberian Metropolitan Paul (who, before the appointment to Tobolsk, was the Archimandrite of the Chudov Monastery in the Moscow Kremlin) supervised the construction. The cathedrals built under his supervision were cross-domed structures topped by five domes. St. Sophia-Assumption Cathedral At the end of the 17th century construction work in the Kremlin was continued by Semyon Remezov, a cartographer who was also the first historian of Siberia. He had the Departmental Palace (1699‚Äì1704) built above the southern cliff of the hill and the Trading Arcades (1702‚Äì1706) in the northwestern corner of the Kremlin. Gostiny Dvor Knyaz M. Gagarin, appointed in 1708 first governor of the Siberian province, planned to create in the Kremlin impressive buildings for military administrative and commercial use, which should have constituted, together with the Sofia court a monumental center. In construction works were employed Swedish prisoners of war who were in exile in Tobolsk. To prevent the erosion of the mountain, the Tobol River was moved to the south for two versts. In 1712, by the project of Remezov was built the stone tower Demetrius gate and next to it, on the edge of the mountain, the Ascension church (destroyed in 1717). Despite the 1714 ban of stone construction, work continued until 1718. After the execution of governor Gagarin, the Demetrius gate remained unfinished. In 1743-1746 was built the Church of the Intercession, accessory building of St Sophia-Assumption Cathedral. Walls and towers were gradually destroyed. In 1799 were built the stone retaining walls of St. Sophia gully and a new multi-tier bell tower - the tallest building of the city.  Protection and reconstruction  In 1939 the Tobolsk Kremlin has been recognized architectural historical monument, subject to state protection. In 1952, a progressive deterioration of masonry was revealed and thus a plan for restoration work was drafted. In 1961, the Tobolsk museum received the status of Historical and Architectural Museum-Reserve. In early 1970s the restoration works began. The walls and the towers were reconstructed. The photograph taken 2009 by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev was auctioned for charity at the St Petersburg Christmas yarmarka (fair) in 2010 for the equivalent of U$1.75 million, earning it a place on the list of most expensive photographs.

The title is a play on the nursery rhyme \\"Little Bo Peep.\\" Plot The cartoon starts with baby Wile E. Coyote being told by his father Cage E. Coyote (voiced by Stan Freberg) that he is not allowed to talk until he catches the Road Runner. Wile E. then sees baby Road Runner; as the Road Runner is running, it freezes and words pop up saying: ROAD RUNNER (Morselus babyfatus tastius), and the camera moves back left to Wile E. with more words saying: COYOTE (Poor schnookius). The bird then speeds off, causing the Coyote's jaw to drop, and his eyes to fall out of his sockets. A light bulb appears over his head, signaling a new idea. PLAN 1: Wile E. uses some keys to open a door to a room that has dangerous explosive items and ends up getting blown up. PLAN 2: Wile E. uses a badger trap to catch the Road Runner, but he catches a badger instead. PLAN 3: Wile E. gets a package from the mail‚Äîa Stretch Hamstrong‚Äîto stop the Road Runner, but ends up getting crushed by two cacti. PLAN 4: Wile E. uses his jack in the box to punch the Road Runner, but he gets punched instead. He does get the Road Runner, but he then escapes from him. PLAN 5: Wile E. uses toy rockets full of water on a big trike, but gets punched which sends him flying in the badger trap and gets beaten up by the badger he caught earlier.

Every year several tourists visit the church and the little village of less than a hundred inhabitants in one of the side valleys of River Zala.  History  The territory of Kall√≥sd used to be a royal estate belonging to Zalav√°r. The king offered it to the sons of Orosz from Kom√°r only after 1203. His grandson, Mikl√≥s, son of Karacs built the parish church around 1260. From the 14th century it belonged to the Abbey of Kapornak. The inhabitants of the village were forced to leave the church by reason of the Turkish expansion in the 17th century. The population returned in 1711. They started to clean the thicket around the church and renovated the building in 1740. Because of the growing number of inhabitants they had to build a hallway to the church in the 19th century which was demolished during the renovation between 1989 and 1993 in order to preserve the round church in its original shape.  The building  The Romanesque church has brick walls on its stone base and a conical roof structure. An apse is set into the east end of the building. There are semicircular windows on the sides of the entrance on the south-western side. The ancient round base, the entablature, the apse and the cupola all refer to Romanesque architecture in the middle of the 13th century.  The role of the round church today  In the 1990s a new church has been raised on the side of the bell tower in the middle of the village. Nowadays regular church services take place there. The nearly 800-year-old church in the cemetery hosts the summer concerts in July and August. The symbol of Kall√≥sd also appears on the blazon of the village.

Background Dr. Carlat received his undergraduate education at University of California, Berkeley and his medical degree at University of California, San Francisco. He completed his residency in psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, from 1992-1994 and was chief resident of the MGH inpatient psychiatry unit in 1995. Currently he is an associate professor at Tufts Medical School and edits a monthly newsletter called the Carlat Psychiatry Report, which he founded. Carlat wrote a 2007 New York Times Magazine article about how he was paid to push the anti-depressant Effexor, to his colleagues. He indicated that he received cash compensation and stayed in luxurious hotels in exchange for persuading doctors to prescribe Effexor to their patients, using phrases like \\"drug whore\\" and \\"hired gun\\" to self describe his actions. He estimated he earned roughly $30,000 for his endorsements of the drug. Carlat has argued that psychiatry has been inconclusive about how and why it works: \\"We don't have any direct evidence that depression or anxiety or any psychiatric disorder is due to a deficiency in serotonin because it's very hard to actually measure serotonin from a living brain. Any efforts that have been made to measure serotonin indirectly ‚Äî such as measuring it in the spinal fluid or doing post-mortem studies ‚Äî have been inconclusive. They have not shown conclusively that there is either too little or too much serotonin in the fluids. So that's where we are with psychiatry. ... In cardiology, we have a good understanding of how the heart pumps, what electrical signals generate electricity in the heart. And due to that understanding, we can then target specific cardiac medications to treat problems like heart failure or heart attacks.... not perfect, but pretty well worked out.\\" Carlat was recruited by the pharmaceutical company Wyeth to promote the antidepressant Effexor as being more effective than other antidepressants on the market. According to Carlat, he started to question the research about the efficacy of Effexor and other antidepressants, and was soon dropped from the company's hired speakers. He wrote about this experience in an article entitled 'Dr. Drug Rep' for the New York Times magazine. This article went on to be selected for Harper Perennial's Best Science Writing 2008 anthology and became the basis of his book Unhinged.

It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance. The castle is notable for its role in Swiss historiography as the first fortress destroyed in the Burgenbruch at the beginning of the Swiss Confederacy. The slighting of Zwing Uri (Twing √úren) is mentioned in the White Book of Sarnen, a Swiss chronicle of 1470. The event is placed in the year 1307 by the Chronicon Helveticum (1570). The site had been occupied since the Bronze Age. By 1150, there had been a farmstead with three buildings. By the early 13th century, the dwelling was replaced by a defensive tower. During the period of 1310 to 1320, the tower was still standing, and there are traces of a planned expansion into a full castle with a ring wall and a moat. This expansion was interrupted at about six weeks into the construction work, and the castle was abandoned in ca. 1320, i.e. 13 years after the traditional date of the Burgenbruch. The site remained unoccupied until 1868, when a restaurant was built, using stones from the ruin. The remains were secured in 1928, when the ruin was acquired by the Schweizerischer Burgenverein. Archaeological excavations of the ruin were performed in 1978.W.

Nottingham Moderns RFC was formed. The early matches were played on rented pitches around the city. With the help of old school masters and the youth service, steady progress was made. However, financing the new club was a problem. On most occasions the players would make their way to away matches by public transport, resulting in all day adventures to various parts of the East Midlands. A good relationship was formed with the local colleges and sports teachers, and with the Welsh Exiles. This led to a period of rapid growth that resulted in sustained fixtures with more established local sides and also games against the 2nd XV teams from the Midlands senior teams.http://www.nottinghammodernsrfc.org/About/Club-History  Settling down: The 1970s  The year 1975 was momentous in the history of the club. The club finally secured a home at Wilford where they remain today. In the same year they became the first club from Nottinghamshire to win the Three Counties Cup (Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire & Lincolnshire). The 1st XV also reached the semi-final of the Midlands Clubs Championship. The most successful season in the club's history was probably 1974‚Äì75, with the 1st XV, 2nd XV, and 3rd XV losing just three games each all season. The 1st XV and 2nd XV also won the respective County Cup competitions. All of this was accomplished as a nomadic club, with no fixed home, playing on rented parks pitches, and drinking in numerous local public houses to entertain their opposition. In 1979 the clubhouse was built (extended in 1981), due in no small way to Arthur Luff, then Club President, and a former international referee. During this successful period, the club produced a number of players who went on to represent many senior rugby clubs and representative sides. Brian Hall captained Leicester http://www.leicestertigers.com/news/12653.php as well as representing the Barbarians and The Midlands. However, the greatest individual achievement from one of the Moderns' players of the time, did not come on the rugby pitch. In 1975, Doug Scott, a founder member of the club, stood alongside Dougal Haston on the summit of Mount Everest - the first Briton to reach the top of the world via the south-west face  The 1980s  Further County Cup triumphs followed in the 1980s. The hard work of the players was also rewarded with the inaugural Notts., Lincs., and Derbys. Divisional League Title, together with three Nottinghamshire Shield victories, and success in the final County Cup Final.  The 1990s  Even more success came in 1991. The 1st XV lifted the first Three Counties Cup, playing every round away from home and only conceding one try in the process. Not to be outdone, the 2nd XV went the whole season undefeated. At the same time, the club's under-14 side won the Three Counties Cup without conceding a try - a feat they repeated two years later as under-16s while winning the Rugby World Team of the Month award. Hard work and determination from many members, most particularly David Hargreaves, resulted in increased sponsorship and finance. In 1996 the ground at Wilford was improved and the clubhouse extended. The opening ceremony was hosted by Dean Richards, the former Leicester Tigers Captain, who also brought a team of 'Old Tigers' (The Droglites) to play their first game outside of Leicestershire. In 1996, the 1st XV won the League and Cup (The Stag & Swan Cup) double, the 2nd XV won the County Shield and the Veterans won the Skegness Trophy and Casuals Trophy. In 1997, the 1st XV won the Cup (The Stag & Swan Cup) and reached the Three Counties Cup Final, the 2nd Xv retained the County Shield and the Veterans retained the Skegness Trophy.  The 2000s  The 2007 season was the most successful recent event with the 1st XV winning both the County Cup and the Three Counties Shield. In the 2010‚Äì11 season, the club continued to improve its position within Midlands 2 East (North), ending the season above its nearest rivals West Bridgford RFC for the third successive season. The 2011‚Äì12 season saw the 1st XV struggle on the pitch leading to them finishing 12th in Midlands 2 East (North) and seeing them relegated to Midlands 3 East (North) for the 2012‚Äì13 season.http://clubs.rfu.com/Fixtures/MatchByDivision.aspx?DivID=126926916 The 2nd XV achieved a 2nd-place finish in their league which led to a promotion to the NLD Pennant 1 league. The 2012‚Äì13 season saw the 1st XV compete well in the league achieving a mid-table position after a strong finish to the season. The 2nd XV competed well in the NLD Pennant league 1 but ultimately took the decision to drop back down to NLD Pennant league 2 for the following season. The 2013‚Äì14 season saw a change in coach to Andrew Highton. The season was certainly a season of two halves as the 1st team struggled in the first part of the season but finished strongly to the season to achieve a mid-table finish again. The 2014‚Äì15 season saw another new coach in Robert Fowkes take the helm. Yet again for the 1st XV it was a two part season as they struggled in the first part of the season but improved as the season went on to finish just above the relegation zone. The 2nd XV had a very successful season completing the league and cup double and only losing one competitive game all season. The 2015‚Äì16 season saw the 1st XV struggle on the pitch due to the loss of some key figures from the previous season. This ultimately led to relegation finishing 11th in the league. There was some positive news on the pitch as all three senior teams reached their respective Notts RFU Cup finals. Victory was achieved by the 2nd XV retaining the cup from the previous season whilst the 1st XV & 3rd XV battled hard during their defeats. Teams at the club As of the 2016‚Äì17 Season, Nottingham Moderns regularly field four senior teams: * The 1st XV plays in the RFU league structure, currently in Midlands 3 East (North) following their promotion from Midlands 4 East (North) at the end of the 2016‚Äì17 season. This is the eighth tier of English rugby. * The 2nd XV plays in the NLD Security Plus Pennant Leagues, which is mainly a league for 2nd, 3rd and 4th XVs of clubs within Nottinghamshire, Lincolnshire and Derbyshire. In the 2018‚Äì19 season they will compete in Pennant League 2. * The 3rd XV (The Mighty) is the club's social side, who also compete in the lower echelons of the NLD Security Plus Pennant League. * The Veterans' XV comprises players aged 35 and over, and plays friendlies through the season. The club has also been developing a Junior Rugby section and currently fields teams from under 7 to under 18 level, with the aim to eventually develop a full Junior/Mini rugby section which will feed into the senior teams. A number of players have come through the ranks to feature in the senior sides during the 2015‚Äì16 season for the first time. Club organisation The club elects a committee of its members each year. For the 2019‚Äì20 season, the club's officers are:http://www.nottinghammodernsrfc.org/About/Committees * Club President: Dave Hassall * Club Chairman: Jeff Mapp * Club Secretary: Ed Lisley * Club Treasurer: Nick Halstead * Junior Chairman: Stuart Grantham Playing offices: * Head Coach: Steve Mason * Assistant Coach: Ian Melrose * 1st XV Captain: Richard Pascoe * 2nd XV Captain: James Feasey * 3rd XV Captain: Phil Moss Links with local universities In the mid-2000s (decade) the club recognised that there was a need to re-establish former links with the local universities, the closest of which was Nottingham Trent University. The club lies midway between the University's City and Clifton campuses and will be a stop for the proposed Nottingham City Transport Tramline Extensionhttp://www.nottinghamcity.gov.uk/netphase2/index.aspx?articleid=10436 which will link to two university campuses. The club set out a marketing strategy and embarked on a two-year plan which would hopefully benefit both the club and university. This last season has seen Nottingham Trent University and the University of Nottingham provide the club with a talented pool of players, with the club in return allowing use of its facilities and providing access to some expert coaching to the universities.  RFU recognition  In 2011, the club submitted for and won a prestigious RFU Presidents' XV award in the 'Student Rugby-Play On' category. The club's blueprint for forming links with students will be used as a case study by the RFU in a report it will send out to every registered rugby club in the country. The club was again recognised by the RFU in the 2012‚Äì13 season, this time in the Community Engagement category.

Divided into its Principal Parishes. Emanuel Bowen, 1752. A New & Accurate Map of Mexico or New Spain together with California, New Mexico &c.; Bowen, 1752 Emanuel Bowen (1694 - 8 May 1767) was a Welsh map engraver, who achieved the unique distinction of becoming Royal Mapmaker to both to King George II of England and Louis XV of France. Bowen was highly regarded by his contemporaries for producing some of the largest, most detailed and most accurate maps of his era. He is known to have worked with most British cartographic figures of the period including John Owen and Herman Moll. Background Bowen was born at Tal-y-Llychau, Carmarthen, Wales, to Owen Bowen, a distinguished but not noble gentlemen, and was apprenticed to Merchant Taylors' Charles Price from 1709, and admitted to the Merchant Taylors Livery Company on 3 October 1716 but he was already active in London from 1714. Career One of his earliest engraved works, Britannia Depicta, published in 1720, contained over two hundred road maps together with a miniature county map of each of the counties of England and Wales. It followed on John Ogilby's earlier work with updated style of historical and heraldic detail. It was an unusual feature of the atlas that the maps were engraved on both sides of each page, resulting in a handier- sized book. By 1726 he was noted as one of the leading London engravers. Among his multiple apprentices, the most notable were Thomas Kitchin, Thomas Jeffreys, and John Lodge. Another apprentice, John Oakman who had an affair with and eventually married, Bowen's daughter. Other Bowen apprentices include Thomas Buss, John Pryer, Samuel Lyne, William Fowler and his own son Thomas Bowen. He published \\"A Complete System of Geography, 1744‚Äì7; an 'English Atlas, with a new set of maps,' 1745(?); a 'Complete Atlas ... in sixty-eight Maps,' 1752; 'Atlas Minimus; or a new set of Pocket Maps,' 1758; and a series of separate maps of the English counties, of Germany, Asia Minor, and Persia, between 1736 and 1776. A recurring feature of Bowen's work, evident even on the early road maps, was his habit of filling every corner and space of the map with jottings and footnotes, both historical and topographical. Death In spite of his royal patronage and renown, Bowen like many cartographers of his day, would die in poverty. His son, Thomas Bowen (1733 - 1790) would carry on the business, but would ultimately suffer a similar fate, dying in a Clerkenwell workhouse in 1790.  Complete map of the Southern Continent  Captain Cook had mapped its east coast. A New & Accurate Map of Persia drawn by Emanuel Bowen in 1747 Bowen's map, A Complete Map of the Southern Continent survey'd by Capt. Abel Tasman & depicted by order of the East India Company in Holland in the Stadt House at Amsterdam, was essentially a copy of the map Melchis√©dech Th√©venot had published in Relations de divers Voyages curieux (Paris, 1663, v.1). Although Th√©venot said that he had taken his chart from the one inlaid into the floor of the Amsterdam Town Hall, it appears to be an almost exact copy of that of Joan Blaeu in his Archipelagus Orientalis sive Asiaticus published in 1659 in the Kurf√ºrsten Atlas (Atlas of the Great Elector).National Library of Australia, Maura O'Connor, Terry Birtles, Martin Woods and John Clark, Australia in Maps: Great Maps in Australia's History from the National Library's Collection, Canberra, National Library of Australia, 2007, p.32; this map is reproduced in Gunter Schilder, Australia Unveiled, Amsterdam, Theatrum Orbis Terrarum, 1976, p.402; and in William Eisler and Bernard Smith, Terra Australis: The Furthest Shore, Sydney, International Cultural Corporation of Australis, 1988, pp.67‚Äì84, p.81. The map of the world set into the floor of the great hall of the Amsterdam Town Hall was drawn from Blaeu's world map of 1648. Once Blaeu's map of the world appeared other mapmakers, such as Th√©venot, copied his depiction of New Holland. Hollandia Nova in the Kurf√ºrsten Atlas is shown as it appears in Blaeu's world map of 1648.Kees Zandvliet, \\"Golden Opportunities in Geopolitics: Cartography and the Dutch East India Company during the Lifetime of Abel Tasman\\", in William Eisler and Bernard Smith, Terra Australis: The Furthest Shore, Sydney, International Cultural Corporation of Australis, 1988, pp.67‚Äì84, p.80. It appears to have been Th√©venot who introduced a differentiation between Hollandia Nova to the west and Terre Australe to the east of the meridian corresponding to 135¬∞ East of Greenwich, emphasised by the latitude staff running down that meridian, as there is no such division on Blaeu's map.Damian Cole, \\"No longer incognita\\" and Martin Woods, \\"'Terre Australe, east coast of New Holland'\\", National Library of Australia, Mapping our World: Terra Incognita to Australia, Canberra, National Library of Australia, 2013, pp.182, 143. A legend on Bowen's map emphasised the separation between Hollandia Nova and Terra Australis that had been introduced either inadvertently or intentionally by Th√©venot when he placed the two names on either side of the latitude staff running down the 135¬∞ East of Greenwich meridian. Bowen's map legend identified Terra Australis as the land described by Quir√≥s by saying: > It is also requisite to observe that the Country discovered by Ferdinand de > Quiros lies according to his description on the East Side of this Continent > directly opposite to Carpentaria which if Attentively considered will add no > small weight to the Credit of what he has written about that Country and > which has been very rashly as well as very unjustly treated by some Critical > Writers as a Fiction; Whereas it Appears from this Map of Actual > Discoveries, that there is a Country where Ferdinand de Quiros says he found > one: And if so why may not that Country be such a one as he describes? Another legend added by Bowen to the map called for discovery and settlement of Terra Australis: > It is impossible to conceive a Country that promises fairer from its > Situation than this of TERRA AUSTRALIS, no longer incognita, as this Map > demonstrates, but the Southern Continent Discovered. It lies precisely in > the richest climates of the World....and therefore whoever perfectly > discovers and settles it will become infalliably possessed of Territories as > Rich, as fruitful, and as capable of Improvement, as any that have hitherto > been found out, either in the East Indies or the West.

In October 2010 Enigma's producer Michael Cretu invited the fans to record themselves and vote for a vocalist to create the song via internet. Latvian Fox Lima's (Alise Ketnere) \\"Fei Mea\\" was the most voted and became the lead vocal for the chorus of the social song. The 3 runners up, J.Spring (Jerome Pringault) from Spain, Mark Josher from Brazil and Rasa Serra (Rasa Veretenƒçevienƒó) from Lithuania provided other important parts of the vocals like the backings, bridge and verse of the final version of the single. All 4 vocalists are fully credited for the lyrics and music. Fans were also involved in the production of the song choosing a solo instrument, its final style and mood as well as its cover art created by Lars Doerwald. Finally Ar√≠stides Moreno (Steadycamline) was voted by the fans to direct the official video which was released on YouTube, Enigma's official website and Facebook on March 17, 2011. Ar√≠stides Moreno (Steadycamline) also directed and edited a making-of video of the event. \\"MMX\\" is the first track Michael recorded on his own in his mobile producing studio called Merlin,http://www.enigmasocialsong.com and it is also the first song ever created and produced via the internet exclusively for and by fans. Background At the end of September 2010 Enigma's producer Michael Cretu officially announced a special event for the 20th anniversary of the project called \\"Enigma's Social Song\\" involving the fans all over the world. The project was set up as an event \\"to commemorate Enigma's 20th anniversary involving fans actively in the process of creating a song together with Michael Cretu. For the first time ever he will allow people to look behind the scenes writing and producing along the preferences of the public. They will be engaged in original vocal submissions, series of votings and active participation. That's why we call it a \\"Social Song\\".\\" Enigma's Social Song official website was also created. The following 3 weeks hundreds of fans submitted and voted for their favorite vocals via YouTube. For the first two weeks of voting J. Spring's \\"Time Machine\\" was the fans favorite but Fox Lima's \\"Fei Mea\\" was eventually the most popular, and became the lead vocalist, closely followed by Mark Josher's \\"Set U Free\\", J. Spring's \\"Time Machine\\" and Rasa Serra's \\"Oi Giria Giria\\". Following the release of the song, Fox Lima revealed that her lyrics for \\"Fei Mea\\" did not have a language but were, in fact, words and sounds that came to her while recording. Recording After officially announcing the winner, Cretu formally invited and asked the 3 runners up: Mark Josher, J. Spring and Rasa Serra to record supporting/backing vocals for the song. It was confirmed on Enigma's official Twitter that \\"Michael had received all the vocals from all the winning vocalists, that he was very pleased with their high quality and would use all of them in the final mix making it the first real and global social song\\". Michael decided to use Fox Lima's lead vocals for the chorus recurrent in the final version. J. Spring is the second vocalist to appear on the track with some hypnotic/tribal chanting and singing the word \\"to love\\" in French \\"aimer\\". He appears again later on in the song together with the solo instrument. Rasa Serra comes in after the second and third chorus singing a traditional Lithuanian folklore song. She also closes the track. Mark Josher provided the verse which is the only part of the single sung in English. How Michael implemented each vocalist in the song was only revealed on the day of the official release of the single. Another contest was set up on the official website for the fans to choose the style and overall mood of the song as well as a solo lead instrument. During the whole process of the production Michael kept posting short videos explaining the various phases of the track. Art cover contest & Final mix release To add to the global spirit of the project Michael Cretu and the Enigma's team decided to involve fans further more and participate in another contest for the cover art of the single. Michael named the 20th anniversary single \\"MMX - The Social Song\\" (MMX meaning \\"2010\\" in Roman numerals) referring to MCMXC a.D. (1990 in Roman numerals) to commemorate the initial success of the project. \\"Everything started with the first Enigma album, MCMXC a.D., in 1990. 20 years later I am proud that this musical journey turned out so great. The \\"Social Song\\" is something special‚Ä¶ a sort of experiment that is a remembering of the past and an outlook of the future. I wanted both aspects being reflected in the name of the final song.\\" Michael Cretu explains. After more than 460 submissions, Lars Doerwald's creation for the cover art was the most voted.\\"The cover fits perfectly to Enigma. It‚Äôs weird and modern at the same time.\\" Michael says. \\"Even though we had so many good creations, I am very happy with the result.\\" The final mix of the single was finally released on December 15, 2010 along with its front cover and a digital booklet. Official Video On January 24, 2011 an ultimate event for the single was announced on the official website and a video contest was set up. As for the other stages fans were asked to submit a video for the single and vote for their favorite. \\"On December 15, 2010 we launched our final \\"MMX (The Social Song)\\" as a result of an amazing interactive fan event. We have so much enjoyed the last 3 months of collaboration and we got such a positive feedback that we decided to continue our journey. People have shown their talent in singing, designing covers, and creating a song together, but one thing is missing, though ‚Äì the music video.\\" After a month of submissions and votes, Ar√≠stides Moreno (Steadycamline) was finally announced as the winner of the video contest and became its official director. The edited and final version of the official \\"MMX\\" video was released on March 17, 2011 on YouTube and Enigma's various official websites. Ar√≠stides Moreno (Steadycamline) also directed and edited a 30 minutes Making- of video of the event released on May 30, 2011.

The Village caused much controversy at the time, though it was highly praised by Maxim Gorky (who from then on regarded the author as the major figure in Russian literature), among others, and is now generally regarded as Bunin's first masterpiece.The Works by I.A.Bunin. Vol.III. Novelets and Stories, 1907‚Äì1911. Khudozhestvennaya Literatura Publishers. Moscow, 1965. Commentaries, p.468. Composed of brief episodes set in its author's birthplace at the time of the 1905 Revolution, it tells the story of two peasant brothers, one a brute drunk, the other a gentler, more sympathetic character. Bunin's realistic portrayal of the country life jarred with the idealized picture of \\"unspoiled\\" peasants which was common for the mainstream Russian literature, and featured the characters deemed 'offensive' by many, which were \\"so far below the average in terms of intelligence as to be scarcely human.\\" History Ivan Bunin completed the first part of The Village in September 1909, in Moscow, working, as his wife Vera Muromtseva attested, with extraordinary intensity.Muromtseva-Bunina, V.N. Conversing with Memories. Novy Journal, Vol.65, New York, 1961. p.236 In a letter to Gorky the writer himself spoke of \\"sleepless nights\\" and \\"hands shaking\\" from nervous exhaustion.Gorkovskye Chtenya // Gorky Readings. Moscow, 1961. p.44 The first part of the novel, \\"The Morning\\" (–£—Ç—Ä–æ), was premiered as a recital before a Moscow literary circle audience, then appeared in Utro Rossii newspaper (1909, No.34, November 15). On February 10, 1910, Bunin sent the first part to Saint- Petersburg's Sovremenny Mir for it to be published in March, promising the remaining parts for the April issue. But in April he unexpectedly left for North Africa and stayed at Capri, so the publication was postponed. \\"What I am now engaged with is the completion of –î–µ—Ä–µ–≤–Ω—è novelet. Two days will be spent in Moscow, then I'll depart for Orlovskaya gubernia to put all my energy into the work,\\" Bunin told Odessky Novosty correspondent on May 16.The Works by I.A.Bunin. Vol.III. Novelets and Stories, 1907‚Äì1911. Khudozhestvennaya Literatura Publishers. Moscow, 1965. Commentaries, p.469. These plans were disrupted by the writer's mother's illness and death. It was only after the burial that he returned to the unfinished book. On August 20, 1910 Bunin informed Gorky in a letter: On September 2, 1910, the manuscript was sent to Sovremenny Mir and was published in Nos.10 and 11. This second part was tried out at a public recital event at the Moscow Sreda (Wednesday) literary circle on September 19, where, according to Nash Zhurnal magazine, \\"the audience was deeply impressed.\\"  Concept  The novel's title had to do with an idea formulated by one of its characters, a local self-styled eccentric named Balashkin. According to the latter, Russia as a whole amounts to one huge Village and \\"the fate of its wild and poor peasantry is the fate of the country as such.\\" \\"My novel depicts the life of rural Russia; along with one particular village it is concerned with life of Russia as a whole\\", Bunin told Odessky Listok newspaper in 1910.Tvardovsky, p.21  Critical reception  In October, 1909, Birzhevye Vedomosty newspaper's literary critic predicted that \\"This new thing, ideologically very explicit, will cause controversy and stir up both the left and the right.\\"Birzhevye Vedomosty. Saint Petersburg, No.11348, October 6, 1909, evening issue. Indeed, The Village came as a surprise for many, especially for Marxist critics. \\"Who could have thought that this refined poet... [singer] of all things exotic and 'otherworldly'... would create such an ultra-real, Earth-smelling piece of truly rough literature\\", Vatslav Vorovsky wrote.Aleksandr Tvardovsky. Preface to The Works by I.A.Bunin, Vol.I, 1965. P.19. Literary critics from both the left and the right were unanimous in one verdict: \\"peasantry in Bunin's novel was painted by one brush: black.\\"Tvardovsky, p.72‚Äì73. \\"Poignant hopelessness is what this gloomy tapestry emanates; pessimism and even negativity is what is felt in every stroke of the painter's brush\\", wrote an Odessky Novosty critic (signed N.G.) on October 13. \\"Each and every page of it cries out something about how vile and ugly the Russian muzhik is, to what extent the Russian peasantry is degraded,\\" agreed L. Voitolovsky of Kiyevskaya Mysl, arguing that not a trace of light could be found there, that could be seen as present in Russian rural life-related works of Anton Chekhov, Ivan Turgenev, Gleb Uspensky and Fyodor Reshetnikov.Kiyevskaya Mysl, 1910, No. 328, November 27. \\"Bunin's pattern is monochromatic and monotonous, always slightly tendentious,\\" wrote Yelena Koltonovskaya in 1912.Koltonovskaya, Yelena. Critical studies. Saint Petersburg, 1912, p.279. By all this Bunin wasn't impressed. \\"Read some of what's been written. Both praises and put-downs are so utterly banal and flat,\\" he wrote Gorky.The Works by I.A.Bunin. Vol.III. Novelets and Stories, 1907‚Äì1911. Khudozhestvennaya Literatura Publishers. Moscow, 1965. Commentaries, —Ä. 474. The latter replied: \\"I know for sure that when this astonishment is over [‚Ä¶] serious people will rightly say: –î–µ—Ä–µ–≤–Ω—è, besides having all these artistic merits, became this first impulse that made our broken Russian society to think seriously ‚Äì not of muzhik or of common people, but of Russia as a whole; it poised the question: is Russia to be or not to be?\\"Gorky Readings, p.55 Contemporary critics picked at the novel's density which was unusual for Ivan Bunin's prose which up until then was placid and classicist in tone and form. According to Gorky, \\"if one single weakness should be pointed out, it might be summed up by one word: \\"density\\". Too much material. Each page resembles a museum.\\"Gorky Readings, p.50 Preparing the first edition of Complete Bunin publication, the author edited the original text heavily in order to make it more 'spacious'. He went on doing this over the years. Boris Zaitsev remembered that even after having been given the Nobel Prize, Bunin continued to re-write parts of –î–µ—Ä–µ–≤–Ω—è, expressing dissatisfaction with his own work in rather strong terms. \\"What he did before [The Village] was tell of things that happened yesterday, things that warranted some kind of retrospect assessment ‚Äì and all those things bore a kind of elegiac shade of reminiscence that was so dear to his heart\\", Soviet poet and critic Alexander Tvardovsky wrote. This new work was totally different. According to Tvardovsky, Bunin shared his character Balashkins's views on rural Russia's degradation as fatal in terms of the country's future history. \\"The utter gloominess of this short novel in retrospect could be seen as a kind of mental preparation towards breaking up with his Motherland that followed years later,\\" the critic argued.

The FPLN, made up mostly of Nigerien Tuareg fighters and based in Libya, carried out an armed assault on an armory in the northern town of Tchintabaradene in March 1985, but was repulsed by government forces. Following the attack, Abdoulaye's father was re-imprisoned to be released only upon the death of Niger's military leader in 1987. Following the death of Seyni Kountche, Abdoulaye returned from Libya, joining his father and their former political rival Sawaba leader Djibo Bakary in meeting with new President Ali Saibou, announcing an amnesty and a series of reforms.James Brooke, \\"Niamey Journal; Wary Niger Wonders: Why Is Qaddafi Smiling?\\", The New York Times, 15 March 1988. Political leader Abdoulaye returned to politics when military rule finally ended in 1991 as Niamey chapter leader of his father's former party, the PPN-RDA. He quickly rose to Party Vice President, and succeeded Professor Dan Dicko Koulodo as elected president of the PPN-RDA following the former's death. Under his leadership, the PPN-RDA remained a marginal party, working in coalitions with larger groupings. In 1995 Abdoulaye was elected to the National Assembly of Niger, working in coalition with then Prime Minister of Niger Mahamadou Issoufou. Diori was chosen as Vice President of the Assembly at that time. In 2004 he returned as minister to the National Assembly, and was elected President of the Defense Commission of the National Assembly for the 2004-2008 session.Pr√©sentation du drapeau au contingent 2008 du Groupement d'instruction de Tondibiah : pr√®s d'un millier d'√©l√©ments form√©s et jug√©s aptes √† servir la patrie .

It is one of the dirtiest in the EU in terms of CO2 emissions, as oil-based fuels account for about 80% of domestic production. However, renewables have grown to over 13% of production whereas they were less than 1% in 2000. As such Estonia is one of the countries to have reached its EU renewable target for 2020 already.  Consumption  According to IEA the electricity use (gross production + imports ‚Äì exports ‚Äì transmission/distribution losses) in 2008 in Estonia was 8.5 TWh and population 1.34 million people. Own energy production was 78% of primary energy in 2008. In 2008 electricity use per person in Estonia was 105% compared to the one in the United Kingdom. IEA Key stats 2010 pages 50  Production = Fossil fuels  Oil-based fuels, including oil shale and fuel oils, accounted for about 80% of domestic production in 2016. There is also some natural gas capacity, but no coal generation. The largest power complex in the country, Narva Power Plants, consists of the world's two largest oil shale-fired thermal power plants. The complex generated about 95% of total power production in Estonia in 2007.  Wind power  Total installed wind power was 149 MW at end of 2010 and grew to 303 MW in 2014.

In statistics, he wrote pioneering papers about the optimal design of experiments. He made other notable contributions to the mathematical sciences and to Finnish universities. Early life Erik Gustav Elfving was son of Fredrik Elfving (1854‚Äì1942), a professor of botany at the University of Helsinki, and Thyra Elfving (n√©e Ingman). He was the youngest of four children. Gustav Elfving earned excellent grades at the Svenska normallyceum, a Helsinki gymnasium for Swedish-speaking boys, from which he graduated in 1926. In the same year he enrolled at the University of Helsinki, planning to major in astronomy. He switched to mathematics, graduating in 1930 in mathematics, with astronomy and physics as minor subjects. From 1927 to 1929, he worked as a computational assistant at the astronomical observatory of the University of Helsinki. He studied probability theory under J. W. Lindeberg, who is now known for Lindeberg's condition for the central limit theorem. He wrote his (1934) dissertation under the supervision of Rolf Nevanlinna; his thesis studied Riemann surfaces and their uniformization. In the Nevanlinna theory of the values of meromorphic functions, Elfving's results were praised by Drasin.  Fianc√©e's death and his 1935 expedition to Greenland  Elfving was engaged to a young woman, who died in 1935, probably from tuberculosis. The grieving parents of his fianc√©e helped Elfving contact the Danish Geodetic Institute, which hired him as the mathematician for a cartographic expedition to Western Greenland in the summer of 1935. Elfving was photographed while he made theodolite measurements and peered from a tent. Heavy rains forced the expedition to remain sheltered in their tents for three days, during which Elfving started to think about the best locations to take measurements for least squares estimation. Statistical research optimal design of experiments, and so minimized surveyors' need for theodolite measurements (pictured), while trapped in his tent in storm-ridden Greenland. In statistics, Elfving did research in the design of experiments, probability theory, and statistical inference, as well as applications. Optimal design of experiments In statistics, Elfving is known as one of the founders of the modern theory of the optimal design of experiments. While accompanying a surveying expedition to western Greenland, extended and intense rains left Elving with three days in his tent, during which time he consider the best locations of observations to estimate parameters on linear models. Elfving's ideas appeared in his paper on the optimal design of experiments for estimating linear models. This paper also introduced concepts from convex geometry, including \\"Elfving sets\\" and Elfving's theorem.Studden, W. J. Elfving's theorem and optimal designs for quadratic loss. Ann. Math.

Statist. 30 1959 271‚Äì294. Other statistical contributions As a Professor at the University of Helsinki, Elfving was responsible for writing Finnish language texts, which were used for decades. In his texts and reviews, Elfving emphasized the decision-theoretic foundations of statistics, following Neyman, Pearson, and Wald, and recognized the value of Bayesian methods in statistics and also in operations research.Elfving, G. (1957b). Minimax character of balanced experimental designs. In XIII Congr. Math. Scand. 69‚Äì76. Elfving introduced the statistical symbol for probabilistic independence ‚ä•‚ä•, which is a stronger condition than orthogonality ‚ä•, by the 1950s. Elfving made notable contributions in many fields. In mathematics, he did research in complex analysis and probability theory (particularly Markov and point processes).

(eds.) \\"A Spectrum of Statistical Thought. Essays in Statistical Theory, Economics and Population Genetics in Honour of Johan Fellman\\", Publications of the Swedish School of Economics and Business Administration, 46, 1991 Academic and scientific offices Elfving graduated from the University of Helsinki. Elfving became the Professor of Mathematics at the Helsinki University of Technology succeeding Lars Ahlfors, who had moved to Harvard University. During the academic year 1946‚Äì1947, Elfving served as locum tenens professor at Stockholm University. Elfving visited William Feller at Cornell University in 1949 and 1950. He was an invited plenary speaker at the Third Berkeley Symposium on Probability and Mathematical Statistics in 1955. That same year, he visited Columbia University in the Spring, at the invitation of Theodore W. Anderson, Herbert Robbins, and Herbert Solomon. He visited Solomon again at Stanford University during the fall of 1960 and the spring of 1966. He was elected as a fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics in 1955 and an elected member of the International Statistical Institute in 1963. Elfving was elected as a foreign member of the Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1974, the same year that he was elected to the Royal Statistical Society. He served on the editorial boards of three international journals: Probability Theory and Related Fields (1962‚Äì1975), The Annals of Mathematical Statistics (1964‚Äì1967), and Mathematica Scandinavica (1953‚Äì1972). Elfving had a deep sense of honor and propriety: When he resigned from the editorial boards following decades of service, he requested that he not be sent complimentary issues of the journals; when he failed to accomplish high levels of research, he offered to return the funding to the granting agency. At the University of Helsinki from 1964 to 1975, Elfving acted as the \\"inspector\\" of the √Öbo Nation, a Swedish- speaking \\"nation\\" at the University of Helsinki. In Finnish and Swedish universities, \\"nations\\" are student associations with similarities to fraternities or cooperatives; the inspector is a highly respected university officer, usually a senior professor, who officiates and delivers addresses at formal functions.

Ausubel serves as Director and Senior Research Associate of the Program for the Human Environment of Rockefeller University. He is also a science advisor to, and former Vice President of Programs at the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation where his main area of responsibility is supporting basic research in science and technology. Career Mr. Ausubel received his bachelor's degree from Harvard College and two master's degrees from Columbia University. He began his career in 1977 as a resident fellow in the office of the President of the National Academy of Sciences, later became a staff officer of the National Research Council Board on Atmospheric Sciences and Climate, and from 1983-1988 Director of Programs for the National Academy of Engineering (NAE). From 1989-1993 he served as director of studies for the Carnegie Commission on Science, Technology, and Government, which aimed to improve use of scientific expertise in the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the U.S. government, as well as international organizations. Activities and research projects Mr. Ausubel played a major role in the formulation of the US and world climate research programs. He was instrumental in organising the first UN World Climate Conference which was held in Geneva in 1979. This led to the elevation of the global warming issue on scientific and political agendas. Later, he led the Climate Task of the Resources and Environment Program of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, near Vienna, Austria, an East-West think-tank created by the U.S. and Soviet academies of sciences. Beginning with a 1989 book on \\"Technology and Environment\\" (National Academy Press, JH Ausubel and HE Sladovich, eds.), Mr. Ausubel was one of the founders of the field of industrial ecology. With Arnulf Gruebler, Cesare Marchetti, and Nebojsa Nakicenovic he developed the concept of decarbonization, and with Robert Herman and Paul Waggoner the concept of dematerialization. Mr. Ausubel also participated in the creation of and served as founding chair of the Encyclopedia of Life, a biodiversity web site modeled on Wikipedia, aimed at cataloging all known and named species on Earth. The project harnesses the resources of contributors worldwide to become the world's most comprehensive resource aimed at helping the scientific community, and others, gain a better understanding of the wide variety of life forms with which we share the planet. Under the auspices of the Sloan Foundation, Ausubel participated in the development of an international program, titled the Census of Marine Life, to assess the diversity, distribution, and abundance of marine life‚Äîa task never before attempted on this scale. As an outcome of his deep involvement in the project, Ausubel also co-founded the movement in environmental genomics to develop very short DNA sequences for species identification, popularly referred to as the \\"Barcode of Life,\\" championed by the Consortium for the Barcode of Life. Mr Ausubel has in recent years been involved with the establishment of the international Deep Carbon Observatory. He has also fostered the initiation of an International Quiet Ocean Experiment.,http://phe.rockefeller.edu/docs/IQOE%20Oceanography.pdfhttp://seedmagazine.com/content/article/rethinking_light_and_sound/ With William Massy, Trevor Chan, and Ben Sawyer he developed and released in 2000 the first interactive simulation model of the US university, Virtual U. Recognition A new genus and species of deep sea lobster discovered off the coast of Luzon, Philippines during the Census of Marine Life, was given the scientific name Dinochelus ausubeli and the common epithet of \\"Ausubel's Mighty Clawed Lobster\\" in his honour. For his contributions to environmental research, Dalhousie University (Canada) awarded him an honorary doctorate in 2009 and St. Andrews University (Scotland) in 2012. For his participation in the leadership of the Census of Marine Life, he shared the International Cosmos Prize in 2011. In 2012, The Urban Coast Institute at Monmouth University honored Ausubel with its National Ocean Champion Award. In 2014, Ausubel was awarded the Paradigm Award by the Breakthrough Institute in recognition for his groundbreaking work on how humans liberate the environment.

It is a trick-taking game played with a dedicated war-themed 40-card pack based on the French-suited 36-card piquet pack. The suits are irrelevant for gameplay, and to a large extent the game is determined by four suitless special cards. Cards Jeu Royal de la Guerre was played with a dedicated pack of 40 cards. The pack consisted of a war-themed version of a piquet pack, which at the time still had 36 cards, along with 4 suitless cards. The suitless cards were Death, Force, Army General, and Prisoner of War. The remaining cards were Ace, King, Queen, Jack and 6‚Äì10 in each of the four French suits. The aces were styled as a cannoneer, a soldier with a drawn rapier, a battalion, and a squadron of horsemen. After removing the four suitless cards, the pack could be used for playing Piquet, Triomphe or Brelan. Rules The game is played for money, each player depositing the same amount before the cards are dealt. The number of cards each player receives was not specified in the published rules, although it is implicit that at least five tricks are played and at least one card must remain in the stock. Three of the four suitless cards have immediate effects on the players who find them in their hands. ;Death:The player who holds the Death card loses automatically and does not participate in trick-play. ;Force:The player who holds the Force card immediately wins from the pot twice what he or she paid. The player remains in the game and exchanges the Force card for another card from the stock. ;Prisoner of War: The player who holds this card must double his or her contribution to the pot or leave the game. The suits are irrelevant for trick- play. If the highest rank in a trick occurs more than once, the first card played of that rank wins the trick. The cards rank King, Queen, Army General, Prisoner of War, Jack, Ace, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6. Eldest hand leads to the first trick. Unlike in most trick-taking games, it is not the winner of a trick who leads to the next one. Instead, the lead passes from one player to the next in the direction of play. A player who loses the Army General in a trick must pay a \\"ransom\\" amounting to the total value of the pot to the winner of the trick. A player who wins a trick by playing the Army General wins the pot. Anything that remains in the pot at the end is won by the player who wins the greatest number of tricks. History The game first appeared in 1659 in √âtienne Loyson's La maison academique : contenant les jeux du picquet, du hoc, du tric-trac, du hoca, [‚Ä¶] & autres jeux facetieux & divertissans, a work modeled after the first French game anthology, La Marini√®re's 1654 Maison Academique. The rules were reprinted along with a short advertisement piece for the card pack (signed by \\"E. L.\\") in the 1702 Den Haag edition of Maison Academique. Unrelated novelty cards were advertised in the 1735 edition of Le Royal Jeu de l'Hombre et celui du Picquet. The pack consisted of 60 cards, ten each in the six suits yellow, white, blue, red, black and green. Within each suit, the ranks were simultaneously numbered and designated as King, Queen, Knight, Lady etc. down to Lackey.

With roots originating from Cape Verde, and work that began in commercial art more than forty years ago, Barboza‚Äôs artistic talents and successful career helped him to cross over and pursue his passions in the fine arts where he continues to contribute to the American art scene. Barboza has a prolific and wide range of both traditional and innovative works inspired by African-American thought, which have been exhibited in public and private galleries, and prestigious museums and educational institutions worldwide. He is well known for his photographic work of jazz musicians from the 1970s ‚Äì '80s. Many of these works are in his book Black Borders, published in 1980 with a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. In an article printed in 1984 in The City Sun,Bey, Dawoud, \\"A Light from a Darkroom\\", The City Sun, Arts Section, August 1, 1984: 15, 18. Print. he said, \\"When I do a portrait, I‚Äôm doing a photograph of how that person feels to me; how I feel about the person, not how they look. I find that in order for the portraits to work, they have to make a mental connection as well as an emotional one. When they do that, I know I have it.\\" Many of his photographs achieve his signature effect through the careful use of lighting and shadows, manipulation of the backdrop, measured adjustments to shutter speeds, composition, and many other techniques and mediums at his command. His most recent conceptual photographic artwork exhibit, Black Dreams/White Sheets, has toured internationally and was shown for the first time in New York City at the Bill Hodges Gallery in November and December 2010. Barboza takes a critical look at the role and experiences of the African Diaspora in the historical as well as contemporary context of race, sexuality, gender, politics, and social issues in American society and culture. Career Barboza came to New York City directly after graduating high school in 1963 at the age of 19 to study photography with Hugh Bell, a successful Black fashion photographer who became his mentor and allowed Barboza to work for free in exchange for the opportunity to gain experience in the field. Prior to that, he met Adger Cowans, another of the few successful Black commercial photographers of the time, who would introduce Barboza to a group of Black professional photographers who were members of The Kamoinge Workshop. This group was originally directed by Roy De Carava and was created to promote serious dialogues about photography at a time when African-American photographers were still being discriminated against and excluded from mainstream professional photography. They were professionals who joined forces to support and help promote each other‚Äôs work by offering group commentary and criticism, and by mounting exhibitions together. Barboza carries on this tradition as the current president of what is now known as Kamoinge, Inc. and continues to support other Black professional and aspiring photographers in their work. In 1965, Barboza was drafted into the Navy and became a full-time photographer for the Jacksonville, Florida-based newspaper The Gosport. It was there that he developed his craft and launched his career in a one-man exhibition at the Pensacola Art Museum and the Emily Lowe Gallery at the University of Miami. Photojournalism/editorial spreads Barboza‚Äôs work has appeared in photojournalist and editorial spreads for: The New Yorker, Newsweek, Business Week, TV Guide, National Geographic, Town and Country, Village Voice, Vibe, US, Vanity Fair, People, Esquire, GQ, Home, Elle (US, Canadian, French, and Spanish editions), Elle Decour, Vogue, McCalls, Interview, Details, Black Book, Harper's Bazaar, Self, Glamour, Ms., Woman's Day, Cosmopolitan, Playboy, Ebony, Black Enterprise, Geo (Germany), Art News, Washingtonian, Modern Maturity, Mode, Audubon, Redbook, Telegraph Magazine (U.K.), The Sunday Times Magazine (U.K.) Forbes, Fortune, USA Weekend, Dance Magazine, Life Magazine, and The New York Times Sunday Magazine. Advertising Other work Barboza has done has been for Coca-Cola, Pepsi, General Motors, Kraft Foods, HBO, Kodak, Revlon, AT&T;, the U.S. Army, the U.S. Marines, Sony, Miramax Films, Burger King, Aetna Life Insurance, Arista Records, Nissan, Coors, Absolut Vodka, Reebok, Random House, Hanes, Clairol, Amtrak, Bahamas Tourist Board, Avon, Columbia Records, L'Oreal, and many more. Television Barboza was a co-director for a TV commercial featuring his friend and jazz legend Miles Davis for Dentsu Advertising of Japan.

She defines bodily integrity as: \\"Being able to move freely from place to place; being able to be secure against violent assault, including sexual assault ... having opportunities for sexual satisfaction and for choice in matters of reproduction\\".Nussbaum, Martha C. Sex and Social Justice. Oxford UP, 1999. 41‚Äì42. Print. Government and law= Ireland  In the Republic of Ireland, bodily integrity has been recognised by the courts as an unenumerated right, protected by the general guarantee of \\"personal rights\\" contained within Article 40 of the Irish constitution. In Ryan v Attorney General it was pronounced that \\"you have the right not to have your body or personhood interfered with. This means that the State may not do anything to harm your life or health. If you are in custody, you have a right not to have your health endangered while in prison\\".Ryan v Attorney General [1965] 1 IR 294 at 295. Judgement by Kenny J: \\"That the general guarantee of personal rights in section 3 (1) of Art. 40 extends to rights not specified in Art. 40. One of the personal rights of the citizen protected by the general guarantee is the right to bodily integrity.\\" In a separate case M (Immigration - Rights of Unborn) -v- Minister for Justice and Equality & ors, the Irish Supreme Court ruled that the right to bodily integrity extended to the unborn.Judgement by the Irish Supreme Court: M (Immigration - Rights of Unborn) -v- Minister for Justice and Equality & ors, 7th March 2018. In a summary of the case in section 5.19, the Supreme Court stated: > ‚Äú‚Ä¶the only right of the unborn child as the Constitution now stands which > attracts the entitlement to protection and vindication is that enshrined by > the amendments in Article 40.3.3 namely, the right to life or, in other > words, the right to be born and, possibly, (and this is a matter for future > decision) allied rights such as the right to bodily integrity which are > inherent in and inseparable from the right to life itself‚Äù.  United States  The United States Constitution does not contain any specific provisions regarding the rights one has with respect to their physical body or the specific extent to which the state can act upon bodies.Lane, Julie. \\"Bodily Integrity, Reproductive Liberty and Legal Personhood authored by Lane, Julie.\\" All Academic Inc. 2005. 5 Apr. 2011 http://www.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/8/5/5/0/pages85503/p85503-3.php However, the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld right to privacy, which, as articulated by Julie Lane, often protects rights to bodily integrity. In Griswold v. Connecticut (1965) the Court supported women's rights to obtain birth control (and thus, retain reproductive autonomy) without marital consent. Similarly, a woman's right to privacy in obtaining abortions was protected by Roe v. Wade (1973). In McFall v. Shimp (1978), a Pennsylvania court ruled that a person cannot be forced to donate bone marrow, even if such a donation would save another person's life. Conversely, the Supreme Court has also protected the right of governmental entities to infringe upon bodily integrity. Examples include laws prohibiting the use of drugs, laws prohibiting euthanasia, laws requiring the use of seatbelts and helmets, strip searches of prisoners, and forced blood tests.  Canada  In general, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms defends personal liberty and the right not to be interfered with. However, in certain unique circumstances government may have the right to temporarily override the right to physical integrity in order to preserve the life of the person. Such action can be described using the principle of supported autonomy, a concept that was developed to describe unique situations in mental health (examples include the forced feeding of a person dying from the eating disorder anorexia nervosa, or the temporary treatment of a person living with a psychotic disorder with antipsychotic medication). One unique example of a Canadian law that promotes bodily integrity is the Ontario Health Care Consent Act. This Ontario law has to do with the capacity to consent to medical treatment. The HCCA states that a person has the right to consent to or refuse treatment if they have mental capacity. In order to have capacity, a person must have the ability to understand and appreciate the consequences of the treatment decision. The law says that a person is capable with respect to a treatment, admission to a care facility or a personal assistance service if the person is able to understand and appreciate the information that is relevant to making such a decision.  Human rights  Two key international documents protect these rights: the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Further the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities also requires protection of physical and mental integrity.Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Article 17 The Human Rights and Constitutional Rights project, funded by Columbia Law School, has defined four main areas of potential bodily integrity abuse by governments. These are: Right to Life, Slavery and Forced Labor, Security of One's Person, Torture and Inhumane, Cruel or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.  Women's rights  Though bodily integrity is (according to the capabilities approach) afforded to every human being, women are more often affected in violations of gender-based violence. These include sexual assault, unwanted pregnancy, domestic abuse, and limited access to contraception. These principles were addressed in the CCL Working Conference on Women's Rights as Human Rights. The conference defined bodily integrity as a right deserved by all women: \\"bodily integrity unifies women and that no woman can say that it does not apply to them\\". As defined by the conference participants, the following are bodily integrity rights that should be guaranteed to women: * Freedom of movement * Security of persons * Reproductive and sexual rights * Women's health * Breaking women's isolation * Education * Networking  Children's rights = United States  The debate over children's rights to bodily integrity has grown in recent years.Alderson, Patricia. Researching Children's Rights to Integrity in Children's Childhoods: Observed And Experienced. The Falmer Press, 1994. In the wake of the highly publicized Jerry Sandusky trial, parents have been increasingly encouraged to promote their child's sense of bodily integrity as a method of reducing children's vulnerability to being victims of sexual violence, human trafficking and child prostitution. Methods of increasing children's sense of bodily autonomy include: * Allowing children to choose when to give hugs/kisses * Encouraging children to communicate about boundaries * Offer alternative actions (e.g. a high five, handshake, etc.)  Medicine  The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states the following: \\"No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. In particular, no one shall be subjected without his free consent to medical or scientific experimentation\\". Genital integrity Activists who oppose genital modification and mutilation define themselves as intactivists (a portmanteau of \\"intact\\" and \\"activist\\") or genital integrity activists, who strive to defend the rights of male, female, and intersex children and babies to keep their sex organs intact, to raise awareness about the forced genital mutilations and to prohibit genital mutilation and involuntary or forced circumcision on children internationally. Various organisations have been set up specifically for the purpose, other organisations have stated their support for the movement. Some intactivists consider themselves to be an LGBT social movement, and have participated in LGBT pride parades ever since 2006. In North America, the genital integrity movement primarily focuses on non- therapeutic circumcision of male infants and children and to a lesser but still prevalent extent, intersex surgery. Intactivists also promote bodily integrity and tend to have little or no issue with consenting and informed adults undergoing surgery, since their main concern is to secure children from genital mutilations.

He had brought his family into the Alamo compound along with him. They were able to survive the battle and were not executed by the conquering army.

He married Ana (Anna) Salazar, they had a daughter and three sons. His family was also in the Alamo during the siege and were eventually freed after the siegeGroneman (1990), p. 45.

He traveled to La Bahia and joined with the forces gathered by Pl√°cido Benavides who participated in the Battle of Goliad #1 and would align with James Bowie while he was at Goliad.Lindley (2003), p. 113. The company then proceeded to San Antonio where they joined up under Juan Segu√≠n's command in October 1835. There he participated on December 5 through 9 in the house to house fighting, taking the plazas on the north side of B√©xar. He served up through December 10, when General Mart√≠n Perfecto de Cos surrendered.Groneman (1990), p. 45. General Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna was fast approaching San Antonio. John W. Smith had suggested that Esparza should gather Ana with the family and move to Nacogdoches, but time ran short and on the evening of February 23, he with his family entered at night through a window in the Alamo compound. He was an avid supporter of James Bowie and would not leave the Alamo when given the chance during an armistice, probably due to this relationship.Lindley (2003), p. 113. In the Alamo he commanded artillery at the rear of the Chapel, where he died on March 6, 1836.Todish (1998), p. 79. His Brother, Francisco, although a soldier in Santa Anna's army, did not participate in the battle but requested to locate his brother and was allowed to search through the bodies in the Alamo. He found the body shot and stabbed in the Alamo Chapel. His body was the only one of the defenders allowed to receive a Christian burial. He was buried by his brothers in the Campo Santo cemetery in San Antonio.Groneman (1990), p. 46. Esparza survivors of the Battle of the Alamo His family members were spared and are listed as official non-combatant survivors of the Battle of the Alamo. Mar√≠a de Jes√∫s Castro also known as Mar√≠a de Jes√∫s Esparza was the young step daughter of Esparza, who was also spared after the battle. His wife, Ana Esparza died in 1847, and the family was left without parents. Between 1850 and 1860, Gregorio's sons, Enrique, Manuel and Francisco filed pension petitions to gain the rights to land at Pleasanton, Texas. Enrique, a San Antonio truck-farmer, also in the Alamo during the siege, was rediscovered in 1901 and became a recorded eyewitness of what transpired during the siege. His brother, Manuel owned a general store in Pleasanton, and later served in the Confederate Army during the Civil War.

He has recorded over a thousand archaeological sites in the Midsouth, as well as aided in the preservation of sites and the conviction of looters who have destroyed some of the archaeological record in the area. Early life Thomas was born in 1948, and lived his early life outside of Indianapolis, Indiana. After graduating from a Catholic high school, he joined the U.S. Navy, where he served for four years. In 1975, he earned a bachelor's degree in Anthropology from the University of Florida, and also minored in Ecology.

His first field schools focused on Woodland period sites, the time around 2,000 BC to 1,000 AD, that within the Southeast includes the new technologies of food processing and storage, burial mounds with an emphasis on grave goods, and a great deal of pottery. Perhaps this was an influence that led Tom to choose pottery as a focus for his graduate thesis research. He participated in field schools at a burial mound site on Cades Pond culture sites. Under Milanich, he also participated in a historical archaeology field school that focused on an early-17th-century Spanish mission site.Des Jean, Thomas. Interview by Laura Cannon. 25 Feb 2011.

Let u,v be \\"q-commuting variables\\", that is elements of a suitable noncommutative algebra satisfying Weyl‚Äôs relation uv=qvu. Then, the quantum dilogarithm satisfies Sch√ºtzenberger‚Äôs identity :\\\\phi(u) \\\\phi(v)=\\\\phi(u + v), Faddeev-Volkov's identity :\\\\phi(v) \\\\phi(u)=\\\\phi(u +v -vu), and Faddeev-Kashaev's identity :\\\\phi(v)\\\\phi(u)=\\\\phi(u)\\\\phi(-vu)\\\\phi(v). The latter is known to be a quantum generalization of Rogers' five term dilogarithm identity. Faddeev's quantum dilogarithm \\\\Phi_b(w) is defined by the following formula: : \\\\Phi_b(z)=\\\\exp \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\int_C \\\\frac{e^{-2i zw }} {\\\\sinh (wb) \\\\sinh (w/b) } \\\\frac{dw}{w} \\\\right), where the contour of integration C goes along the real axis outside a small neighborhood of the origin and deviates into the upper half-plane near the origin. The same function can be described by the integral formula of Woronowicz: : \\\\Phi_b(x)=\\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{i}{2\\\\pi}\\\\int_{\\\\mathbb R}\\\\frac{\\\\log(1+e^{tb^2+2\\\\pi b x})}{1+e^{t}}\\\\,dt\\\\right). Ludvig Faddeev discovered the quantum pentagon identity: : \\\\Phi_b(\\\\hat p)\\\\Phi_b(\\\\hat q) = \\\\Phi_b(\\\\hat q) \\\\Phi_b(\\\\hat p+ \\\\hat q) \\\\Phi_b(\\\\hat p), where \\\\hat p and \\\\hat q are self-adjoint (normalized) quantum mechanical momentum and position operators satisfying Heisenberg's commutation relation :[\\\\hat p,\\\\hat q]=\\\\frac1{2\\\\pi i} and the inversion relation : \\\\Phi_b(x)\\\\Phi_b(-x)=\\\\Phi_b(0)^2 e^{\\\\pi ix^2},\\\\quad \\\\Phi_b(0)=e^{\\\\frac{\\\\pi i}{24}\\\\left(b^2+b^{-2}\\\\right)}.

In the late 1980s a successful effort was made in many of the clubs to open up membership first to racial or religious minorities and then to women. Strictly private clubs not open to the public and for which tax exemptions are not claimed maintain their right to discriminate on the basis of sex or race, and all clubs can discriminate on the basis of social standing. A state law against discriminating in the service of private businesses was gradually made applicable to social clubs that engaged in commercial activities. Rules against discrimination were also applied where clubs were the beneficiaries of government in any way, notably through taxes or subsidies. The first clubs The Bohemian Club was founded in San Francisco in 1872 as a journalists' social group,\\"Days and Nights in OId Bohemia,\\" San Francisco Chronicle, July 18, 1897, page 5 \`Library card required\` but it grew to become a refuge for some of the most powerful men in American business and politics. The similarly august California Club was founded in Los Angeles in 1888 when \\"at least 12 of the 125 founding members were Jews.\\" But \\"as the original Jewish members died off, this power center became off limits to Jews.\\" The Jonathan Club, a likewise prestigious social group, was established in Los Angeles in 1894. Legislative measures The Unruh Civil Rights Act, adopted in 1959, and as subsequently amended, outlaws discrimination based on age, ancestry, color, disability, national origin, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation and similar characteristics. The law applies to all businesses, including housing and public accommodations.Unruh Civil Rights Act Description, California Department of Fair Employment and Housing Section 125.6 of the state's Business and Professions Code, which took effect on January 1, 1976, threatened disciplinary action against \\"any holder of a state liquor license who discriminates on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, ancestry or national origin,\\" but it specifically exempted private clubs with \\"discriminatory membership policy.\\" The State Franchise Tax Board has forbidden business tax deductions for fees and expenses incurred at discriminatory private clubs. Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley on May 28, 1987, signed a bill sponsored by Council Member Joy Picus to ban discrimination at most of the city's large private clubs, based on \\"sex, sexual orientation, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin or disability.\\" It applied to any club with more than 400 members that \\"takes payments for meetings attended by non-members.\\" In 1988 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that cities may force large private clubs to admit minorities and women. It said that \\"clubs which serve meals and rent facilities to outsiders are more like business establishments than intimate social groups and therefore have no right to escape anti-discrimination laws.\\" Significant changes for minority groups=1960s In 1965, the Jonathan Club was charged with \\"anti-Negro\\" and \\"anti-Jew\\" bias and a complaint was raised that the membership dues of Mayor Sam Yorty were being paid by city taxpayers to support such discrimination. Yorty told a news conference he knew nothing about such a circumstance.Richard Bergholz, \\"Yorty Hits Roosevelt on Campaign Spending,\\" Los Angeles Times, March 11, 1965, page 11 \`Library card required\` The Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith said that, in 1962, twelve of the \\"leading country clubs\\" and eight of the \\"most prestigious city clubs\\" in the Greater Los Angeles area were open only to Christians, but by 1969 those figures had dropped to eleven and five. Six of the city and country clubs that discriminated in 1969 were listed in Los Angeles, five in Pasadena, two in Glendale and one each in La Habra, Long Beach and Upland.\\"Anti-Semitism Found Waning in Private Clubs,\\" Los Angeles Times, February 21, 1967, page 3 \`Library card required\` In July 1969, there were no Jewish members in the California Club but \\"at least one Jew\\" in the Jonathan Club, yet the latter club hadn't \\"taken in any Jewish members for at least two decades,\\" Neil C. Sandberg regional director of the American Jewish Committee, told Jack Smith of the Los Angeles Times.\\"Clubs' Barriers Thwart Careers, Study Discloses,\\" Los Angeles Times, July 3, 1969, page A-1 \`Library card required\` Smith wrote that a campaign had been going on for ten years to \\"quietly but unrelentingly\\" persuade \\"what has been called the 'last bastion' of anti-Semitism in America ‚Äî the downtown men's clubs of the nation's big cities\\" to allow Jews to become members. Led by the American Jewish Committee, \\"with the active aid of the Antidefamation League, American Jewish Congress ... and other Jewish organizations,\\" the campaign was successful in the case of the Stock Exchange Club, the University Club and the Chancery Club, but the Jonathan and the California clubs remained closed. The campaign was publicized upon the report of a seven-year study made at UCLA by Reed M. Powell, a sociologist. 1970sExamples of prejudice= In May 1975, a touring choir from the United States Air Force Academy decided not to give a proposed concert at the Jonathan Club because Academy officers had been informed that the club had a policy against hosting blacks. Loretta Thompson-Glickman, member of the Pasadena city Board of Directors, recalled that when first elected to the board in 1977, she and Jo Heckman, the only other female director, had to enter the University Club in that city through a side door. Attorney Candis Ipswich said she applied for membership the same year and was rejected because \\"I was the wrong sex.\\" J. Peter Dunston, a Washington, D.C., businessman who was spending a year in Los Angeles, was \\"surprised\\" in February 1978 to find \\"how directly\\" the prejudices of the Jonathan Club were expressed when he applied for membership and was interviewed by the membership committee. He was told that \\"Jews and blacks were not welcome in the club.\\" One of the committee members later \\"denied everything,\\" but the other said, \\"We explained it to him in a different way. We didn't use the word discriminate. 'Invite' was the word.\\"Barry Siegel, \\"Pride and Prejudice: A Progress Report,\\" Los Angeles Times, February 8, 1978, page F-1 \`Library card required\` President Coolidge with actor Al Jolson at the Hillcrest Country Club in 1924 In 1978 there was still only one Jew in the Jonathan Club and none in the Los Angeles Country Club. The two clubs were known for their discrimination against Jews. Yet the Hillcrest Country Club in Beverly Hills was the \\"Jewish\\" counterpart to the Los Angeles Country Club, and Lew Wasserman, chairman of the board of the Music Corporation of America, told Times reporter Robert Scheer that the Hillcrest club \\"has consistently discriminated against non-Jewish members.\\" \\"Line Drawn Between Two Worlds,\\" Los Angeles Times, January 30, 1978, page B-1 \`Library card required\` The Los Angeles Athletic Club had admitted blacks as members since the early 1960s, but it was discovered in 1975 that the club was admitting blacks \\"on a slower, more regulated basis than whites, in an effort not to offend or lose white men.\\" The club quickly changed its policies after complaints were made. Los Angeles bookseller Jake Zeitlin claimed in 1980 that many clubs, such as his city's Zamorano Club, an organization of bibliophiles, used a refusal to admit communists as a pretext for excluding Jews; he said he was denied admission for more than forty years under those circumstances.Jacob Zeitlin, Books and the Imagination, as told to Joel Garner (Los Angeles: Oral History Program, University of California, Los Angeles, 1980) =Outside pressure= By 1976 some businesses were deciding not to reimburse executives for the dues they paid to clubs that discriminated against minorities. Wells Fargo Bank banned meetings at discriminatory clubs in October 1975, and Bank of America was also one of the first, announcing moreover that it would not itself maintain such memberships, nor would it sponsor events anywhere \\"unless all business guests who should attend can attend.\\" Mayor Tom Bradley's office announced that he would no longer attend meetings at either the Jonathan or the California clubs. But a survey made by the Wall Street Journal in May 1976 \\"indicated that most companies felt any rules could be dodged,\\" primarily by giving employees a salary increase instead of paying their club fees.\\"B of A Breaks With Discriminatory Clubs,\\" Los Angeles Times, November 3, 1976, page E-10 \`Library card required\` Bohemian Club owl Responding to letters from the Jewish Federation Council, California Club president Luther Anderson wrote in September 1975 that the club \\"has no membership policy of any sort, and that individual decisions are made by an autonomous admissions committee over which the board of directors has no control.\\" A year later, on October 1, 1976, the council mailed letters to top officials at 160 major corporations in Southern California, urging them not to hold meetings or functions at the California Club and to \\"reconsider\\" their policies of paying club membership dues for their executives. In July 1978, the Los Angeles Times reported that Glenn Dumke, chancellor of the California State University system, belonged to the California Club and the Bohemian Club, while Paul F. Romberg, president of San Francisco State University, was a member of the Bohemian Club and Alistair W. McCrone, president of Humboldt State University, belonged to the Ingomar Club. Dumke and Romberg paid their membership fees with privately donated money, but McCrone used state money for his fees.Don Speich, \\"11 State University-College Officials in Private Clubs,\\" Los Angeles Times, July 31, 1978 \`Library card required\` =Policy changes = The Bohemian Club did make a push in 1970 for blacks to join up. Some, like Ernest J. Gaines, the first black to be awarded a creative writing fellowship at Stanford University, declined to join because he was \\"just sort of tired of being the first to go into things,\\" and he doubted he \\"would have found people with whom he could discuss [Ernest] Hemingway.\\" Cecil Poole, who was a black federal appeals judge, also would not join. Harold Brown was admitted to the California Club in 1976. In 1976 the California Club admitted a Jew, Harold Brown, the United States secretary of defense and former president of the California Institute of Technology, \\"several years after he was first nominated for membership\\" by Franklin Murphy, chairman of the board of the Times-Mirror Company, and after \\"a protracted struggle among club members.\\"Barry Siegel, \\"Pressures Mount Against Discrimination,\\" Los Angeles Times, December 6, 1976, page F-1 \`Library card required\` Jews were admitted to membership about 1966 in the Los Angeles Chancery Club, for attorneys, and in 1976 there was one black Chancery Club member ‚Äî Sam Williams, president-elect of the County Bar Association. Warner Heineman, vice chairman of Union Bank, who was Jewish, was admitted to membership in the Jonathan Club in October 1977. He said the action was \\"something of a breakthrough. ... I personally feel I am a whole citizen now. I can't explain what it means for someone who was persecuted in Germany to still be denied membership in a club of his peers. ... I feel emancipated.\\" Jonathan Club president Robert Brimberry said in February 1978 that \\"In recent years certain restrictions have been changing. ... we are accepting and considering all applications on their merit, including those of minorities and women.\\" Also in fall 1977, two Jewish men were admitted as members of the Los Angeles Country Club ‚Äî Sherrill Corwin, head of the Metropolitan Theaters chain, and Si Ramo, an executive at TRW Inc. 1980s The membership of William French Smith, President Ronald Reagan's choice for U.S. attorney- general in the discriminatory California and Bohemian clubs became an issue for him before Smith's nomination was approved by the Senate in January 1981.Barry Siegel, \\"Smith's Membership in Two Clubs May Be Confirmation Issue,\\" Los Angeles Times, January 15, 1981, page B-3\`Library card required\` In 1987 the Board of Governors of the State Bar of California voted to ban from participating in the annual Conference of Delegates any local bar association that patronized any private discriminatory club which excluded people from membership or use of its facilities because of their \\"race, color, creed, national ancestry, sex or sexual preference.\\" Other controversies in the 1980s included those in: =Avalon= In November 1988, Avalon city officials on Santa Catalina Island asked the city attorney to investigate the all-male Tuna Club after City Council Member Irene Strobel said she had \\" twice accepted invitations to visit the club in her role as a council member, but she refused to enter by the side or back doors that women are supposed to use. Instead, she went through the front door.\\" After \\"months of inquiry,\\" city officials agreed that the Tuna Club did not discriminate against women. A March 14 letter from the club said it \\"does not and will not discriminate ... on the basis of sex, race, religion and national origin.\\" The club, founded in 1898, leased its facilities from the city. =Los Angeles= In 1982, the city's Community Redevelopment Agency \\"barred its employees from conducting any business\\" at the Jonathan Club, and law firms, banks and government agencies adopted policies boycotting the club. In October of the same year, Prince Philip of Great Britain, on a visit to Los Angeles to inspect equestrian sites for the 1984 Olympics, turned down an invitation to an evening at the California Club when he discovered that his host, Mayor Tom Bradley, refused to attend because the club \\"prohibits women and has no black members.\\"Richard Stengel, \\"People,\\" Time magazine, October 4, 1982 On May 28, 1986, Lodwrick M. Cook, chief executive officer of the oil giant Arco, sent a memo announcing that the firm would no longer reimburse executives for memberships in \\"discriminatory private clubs.\\" The order affected \\"about 30\\" people who belonged to the California and Jonathan clubs in Los Angeles and the Dallas Petroleum Club. Hillcrest Country Club president Mark B. Levey said in April 1987 that the club had taken steps to recruit non-Jewish members and had \\"about two dozen\\" at that time. In February 1988, the California Club admitted its first black member in the person of Joseph L. Alexander, 58-year- old surgeon and former Army colonel. The club also approved Ivan J. Houston, the chief executive officer of the predominantly black Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company. A \\"number of Jews\\" were said to have been admitted in recent years as well. =Santa Monica= Santa Monica Beach At the beginning of 1985, the Santa Monica Planning Commission \\"grudgingly approved\\" a permit from the Jonathan Club to expand the club's facilities on the Santa Monica beach. The council also voted to send a letter to the state's Coastal Commission stating that the club's membership policies might affect \\"the public's right to beach access.\\" \\"Previous councils had refused to act on the matter because of the club's alleged discriminatory policies ... Councilwoman Cheryl Rhoden told a club official 'not one grain of sand' would be given to the club until it changed its membership policies.\\" On July 25, 1985, the Coastal Commission did order the club to adopt nondiscriminatory policies before it could expand its recreational use onto state-owned beach property. The decision was upheld by the state Supreme Court in May 1988 even though the Jonathan Club had said that it did not bar women or minorities as members. Women In March 1986, the Rotary clubs' federation Rotary International was ordered by a state appellate court to reinstate the Rotary Club of Duarte it had ousted in 1983 for admitting three women members, and three years later the University Club in Pasadena decided also to admit women. The all-male club had voted against the idea twice before ‚Äî in 1977 and 1980. John M. Robinson, president of the California State Club Association, wrote in a 1987 newsletter that \\"Clubs are under broad attack nationwide.\\" He said: > The proponents of anti-club measures consist principally of a relatively > small group of strident professional women in metropolitan centers, the > anti-Establishment news media, vote-seeking politicians, a few minority > leaders, do-gooders, the radical left, and social engineers who would > restructure our social system according to their own ideas. , , , the > essence of a club is its exclusiveness. Unless the right to select desired > members and to exclude unwanted members is unrestricted, the objective of > compatibility and congeniality of members cannot be accomplished. The right > thus to select and exclude necessarily includes the right to discriminate on > any basis whatsoever. An organization to which everyone has the right to > belong ceases to be a club in the traditional sense.\\" Beverly Hills The Friars Club, a 700-member club consisting mostly of people in show business or the movies, had four women members by February 1988, including attorney Gloria Allred, who in that month engaged in a \\"very heated meeting\\" with club officials over her demand that women be allowed to use the health facilities of the club. Kenneth Reich of the Los Angeles Times wrote that: > The Friars Club dispute is uncommon only in that it involves one of the > nation's most celebrated exponents of women's rights. Dispute over the new ‚Äî > if less well-known ‚Äî members of such facilities as dining rooms, golf > courses and health clubs has also marked the integration of other clubs in > Los Angeles and elsewhere. Eureka Carson Mansion In 1974, Ellen Stern Harris, vice chairman of the California Coastal Commission, was not allowed to join her fellow commissioners for an informal tour of the Carson Mansion in Eureka because the private Ingomar Club, housed there, admitted women \\"only on specified days.\\"Barry Siegel, \\"Gentlemen's Agreement vs. the Law,\\" Los Angeles Times, December 8, 1976, page H-1 \`Library card required\` The state attorney- general's office filed suit against the club in July 1974 after the Ingomar board of directors decided not to change the rule.\\"Ingomar Club Is Charged With Bias,\\" Los Angeles Times, July 25, 1974, page G-10 It was settled in early 1978 with the club agreeing that women have the right to enter \\"for any business, civic or political function.\\" It did not involve membership, though, \\"since state law does not prevent a private social club from barring members on the grounds of sex, religion or race.\\"\\"Women Win Guest Rights at Male Club,\\" Los Angeles Times, March 3, 1978, page B-2 \`Library card required\` Los Angeles In 1975 \\"neither the Los Angeles Country Club nor any other major country club\\" had changed \\"the traditional policy that bans single women as full members, and limits all women to specific starting times on the golf course. And neither the California nor the Jonathan club admitted women as members. Women guests were \\"limited to certain floors, dining rooms and entrances\\" but they \\"can now use the main elevator and lobby\\" at the Jonathan Club, a member told the Times in 1976, adding that \\"We no longer have a women's elevator.\\" =Brentwood Country Club= The city sued the Brentwood Country Club in August 1987 to force it to stop barring women from its \\"Men's Grill\\" and golf course during part of the day. It dropped the suit when the club agreed \\"to admit women to the restaurant at all hours and make the rules less restrictive to women golfers.\\" =California Club= In June 1987 the California Club took a vote on changing its bylaws and decided by a 4-1 margin to admit women. Club president Donald E. Butler said the decision was made by \\"a group of rational individuals trying to do the right thing.\\" In response to a vociferous campaign by the losers, the club scheduled another vote on the same issue, and in March 1988, the regular members voted 728 to 297 to accept women members. In a separate category of non-resident members, the vote was 149 to 38. The first new members admitted under the new policy were E. Camron Cooper, senior vice president and treasurer of the Atlantic Richfield Company, and Linda Hartwick, a partner in the Korn/Ferry International executive-search firm. =Hillcrest Country Club= The Hillcrest Country Club changed its bylaws in April 1987 to provide for women as members and to allow daughters and wives, as well as sons, to inherit the memberships of deceased members. =Jonathan Club= In 1977 the Jonathan Club \\"voted overwhelmingly\\" to admit women to membership. But Betty Bryant Morris, associate counsel at Union Bank, found treatment of her membership application \\"raised suspicions among some that the club has no real intention\\" of taking a woman as a member. Directors at first wanted to delay her nomination for one year, but, after pressure, they changed their mind and sent Morris's application to the membership committee.Barry Siegel, \\"Woman Tries to Join All-Male Jonathan Club,\\" Los Angeles Times, June 6,. 1977, page F-1 \`Library card required\` By 1988, however, \\"about a dozen women\\" had joined the club, one of whom was Brooke Knapp, an aviator who was the first pilot to circle the Earth at the poles in a private jet, but they were forbidden to enter the men's library, grill and bar. The city attorney in January of that year was preparing a suit against the club to end that practice. Knapp said she opposed the suit because it might \\"engender a backlash that will slow women's progress.\\" Club attorney John R. Shiner said in June 1989 that the Jonathan would thenceforth serve women in the bar and grill, \\"no questions asked.\\" =University Club= The University Club had been in the forefront of taking in blacks and Jews as members, and another breakthrough came in February 1975, when it became the first major downtown Los Angeles club to admit women. As late as 1976, though, it required \\"unaccompanied women guests\\" to wait in a \\"ladies' lounge ... and before 5 p.m. [they] must enter and leave the club through a specified door.\\" Newport Beach In February 1989, twenty-five of the ninety single women belonging to the Newport Beach Country Club sued, alleging that they had to pay $8,500 more for memberships than single men. Gloria Allred was their attorney. San FranciscoBohemian Club= Two state Assembly members, women lawyers' groups and a law firm called on the state Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission in July 1987 to revoke the liquor license of the Bohemian Club because it excluded members on the basis of race or sex. In the meantime, the city of San Francisco had passed an ordinance \\"aimed at forcing the 115-year-old club to admit women.\\" A Superior Court judge declined to overturn it, but the club continued to insist that \\"since the club does not accept money from outside businesses, it is not subject to the court ruling.\\" It fought bitterly, and successfully, to keep from admitting women as members. Women, including political office holders, \\"must enter via a side door and stay in the downstairs banquet rooms.\\" Dan Morain of the Los Angeles Times wrote: > A few men have quit, some will not join and some groups no longer use it for > social functions. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, for one, quietly > stopped holding its annual party there in 1979 after several judges, > including a black, a Jew and a few women appointed by President Jimmy > Carter, protested that it was a symbol of discrimination . . . When Gloria Allred asked former California Governor Edmund G. (Pat) Brown for a membership application for the Bohemian Club, \\"I turned her down,\\" he said. \\"I think she's a fine lawyer, but there are a lot of women's clubs she could join where they talk about sewing and raising babies.\\" Former U.S. Senator S.I. Hayakawa said women should not be allowed to join for the same reason he didn't \\"want to go to women's clubs and join a sewing circle, or a ladies' bridge club.\\" Yorba Linda Jan Bradshaw, an interior designer, sued the Yorba Linda Country Club in 1988 when she discovered that women could play golf only in the afternoons. On Sundays, there was only a single time for women's play \\"I've received death threats on the phone and nasty, anonymous letters,\\" she said. Gina Walthall, president of the women's board of directors, said that Bradshaw's suit \\"would ruin it for everyone else so we'll just have an open tee-time. And then you might as well belong to a public course.\\" Bradshaw was represented by Gloria Allred.

The region, with its rock pillars up to 30 m high, is one of the major tourist attractions of Bohemian Switzerland. The Tisa Rocks and their neighbouring Burschlicke Rocks (B√ºrschlick√© stƒõny) are protected as a national nature reserve.  Topography and geology  The Tisa Rocks are located at a height of about 600 m above sea level. They form a line of rock outcrops drawn up in an arc on the westernmost edge of the sandstone beds of the Elbe Sandstone Mountains from the Ore Mountain escarpment on Czech soil. About a kilometre west of them on the outskirts of Tisa stands the coarse- and medium- grained muscovite-biotite-orthogneiss of the Eastern Ore Mountain region. This also strikes eastwards on the hillside south of the village. The rocks are frequently vertically dissected; in many places the fissures being as deep as the rock pillars are high. Horizontal weathering is found in the upper layers and have created several bizarre shapes, such as the rock called the Steinpilz (\\"boletus edulis\\" - a type of edible mushroom) which is easily accessible. The \\"Great Tisa Rocks\\" begin near the official entrance by a restaurant. These consist of a northern and southern array of crags along an otherwise compact plateau. The crags to the west running off at an angle to the northwest are known as the \\"Little Tisa Rocks\\". They are more heavily dissected. The crags of the Tisa Rocks comprise mainly of medium-grained sandstone of the Lower to Middle Turonian of the Cretaceous. They belong lithostratigraphically to the Weissenberg Formation (Bƒõlohorsk√© souvrstv√≠) in the Bohemian Cretaceous System. The nearby area surrounding the Tisa Rocks to the north and south is covered by diluvial sediments of loam, sand and boulder-containing scree. In the sandstone are heavy concentrations of ferrous minerals on closely spaced strata, that can be identified from their yellow to red stripes of colour and predominantly horizontal. A striking feature in many places where the lower strata are visible are small and large cavities as well as occasional tunnels with an oval cross-section, whose walls are often covered with calcareous sinter deposits. These are relics of very old solution processes in the sandstone. In zones of strong weathering, the marked stratification over short distances is clearly visible. Features associated with cross-bedding occur relatively frequently.

V. Sridhar. The film stars Gemini Ganesan and Vyjayanthimala in the lead, with K. A. Thangavelu, M. N. Nambiar, M. Saroja and Vasanthi in supporting roles. The soundtrack was composed by A. M. Rajah while the lyrics were written by Kannadasan. The film deals with a young man Raj who falls in love with a young woman Shanti, but she disapproves of him. She returns to her home in Bangalore city, to join her father Sokkalingam and his newly married second wife on their honeymoon to Kashmir. Raj also joins them on tour, after being mistaken for Shanti's appointed manager (also named Raj), who no-one from the family has yet seen. Raj and Shanti eventually fall in love during the trip, but everything takes a drastic turn when the real Raj who was appointed as Shanti's manager arrives. Then Nilavu was the first film produced by Sridhar's production company Chitralaya Films, as well as the first South Indian film to be shot in Jammu and Kashmir, while additional shooting took place in Madras (now Chennai). Principal photography lasted roughly two months. The film was released on 30 September 1961, and became a huge commercial success.  Plot  A man named Raj meets a girl named Shanti at a cricket match in Madras, and falls in love with her. Shanti does not reciprocate his love and leaves for her home place Bangalore. Shanti's father Sokkalingam, a widower, marries Thangam. They decide to go to Kashmir for their honeymoon, and Shanti also wants to come. A friend of Sokkalingam suggests an alliance between Shanti and his nephew Raj who is now in Madras. Raj-2 ditches his wife Lalitha (who he had secretly married) when he learns of this proposed alliance and leaves for Bangalore but misses the train. Just then Raj-1 arrives in Bangalore for a different reason, and Sokkalingam mistakes him for his friend's nephew. Sokkalingam and Thangam leave for Kashmir along with Raj-1 and Shanti, who still dislikes Raj-1, but eventually returns his love. Raj-2 reaches Kashmir in search of Sokkalingam. Lalitha, fearing the safety of her husband, also reaches Kashmir in search of him. She meets Raj-1 and stays in his house. Lalitha meets Sokkalingam and tells that she is married to \\"Raj\\". Sokkalingam misinterprets this as Raj-1 and fires him as Shanti's manager. Meanwhile, Raj-2 meets Sokkalingam and explains everything, therefore he replaces Raj-1 as Shanti's manager, despite Shanti's dislike for him. Shanti later learns that Lalitha is Raj-2's wife and reconciles with Raj-1, while Sokkalingam and Thangam are still unaware. Raj-2 learns that Shanti loves Raj-1, and becomes jealous. At the same time, he meets Lalitha who he orders to return, or else she will be killed. Lalitha flees but secretly writes a letter to him showing her affection. Raj-2, touched by the letter, decides to take Lalitha on a boat ride but has another plan: to kill Lalitha and frame Raj-1. When Lalitha joins Raj-2 on the boat ride, he forcefully rides the boat, causing her to fall into the lake. Subsequently, he frames Raj-1. Sokkalingam files a complaint about Lalitha's murder to the Kashmir Police, and soon they chase Raj-1, who elopes with Shanti ‚Äî his only testimony of innocence. Raj-1 and Shanti run into a forest for shelter, where they discover that Lalitha is still alive, but kept under custody by a group of terrorists. Raj-1 and Shanti are also put into the same prison as Lalitha, who reveals what happened: she has washed ashore and was discovered by one of the terrorists. He started torturing her, and she pushed him off the cliff to his death, hence imprisoned for murder. Suddenly, a gypsy dancer from the terrorist group helps them escape secretly. But by the time they escape, the nearby guards see them and start shooting at them. The three escape onto a boat, but the boat develops a crack and starts drowning, leading to Raj-1's separation from Lalitha and Shanti. When he swims to the shore, the police capture him. During Raj-1's trial in the high court, Shanti and Lalitha arrive, leading to his acquittal. But the letter Lalitha wrote to her husband is discovered and after reading the last line (in which Lalitha advised her husband to kill her if wanted), the court suspects Raj-2 of the attempted murder. Lalitha saves him by claiming that she fell by herself into the lake, and does not reveal Raj-2 as her husband. The case is dismissed, and Sokkalingam and Thangam continue their honeymoon.  Cast  ;Male cast * Gemini Ganesh as Raj-1 * K. A. Thangavelu as Sokkalingam * M. N. Nambiar as Raj-2 ;Female cast * Vyjayanthimala as Shanthi * M. Saroja as Thangam * Vasanthi as Lalitha Other supporting roles were played by K. Natarajan, V. Mahalingam, Padmini Priyadarshini, Veeraragavan and Balakrishnan.  Production = Development  Then Nilavu was written and directed by C. V. Sridhar, and was the first film produced by him under his Chitralaya Films, which he founded in the early 1960s. A. Vincent was the cinematographer, Ganga was the art director and T. R. Srinivasulu was the editor. While Gemini Ganesan and Vyjayanthimala were cast as the male and female leads respectively, K. A. Thangavelu, M. N. Nambiar, M. Saroja and newcomer Vasanthi were cast in supporting roles.  Filming  Then Nilavu was the South Indian film to be shot in Jammu and Kashmir, unlike most Tamil films of that period, which were shot mainly within studios. The first scene of the film was shot during an India-Pakistan cricket match at M. A. Chidambaram Stadium, Madras (now Chennai). This scene was also used as the background for the film's introductory credits. Film News Anandan was Chitralaya's public relations officer for the film. While filming at Dal Lake, Vyjayanthimala almost drowned but was rescued by the cameraman. It was over here that the song \\"Nilavum Malarum\\" was filmed. The song \\"Oho Endhan Baby\\" was picturised on Ganesan and Vyjayanthimala water skiing; the latter refused to use a body double. Other shooting locations included Shalimar Bagh and Gulmarg. Principal photography lasted roughly two months, with the final cut measuring .  Soundtrack  The film's music was composed by A. M. Rajah, and the lyrics were written by Kannadasan. The song \\"Oho Endhan Baby\\" is set in the carnatic raga known as Keeravani. \\"Nilavum Malarum Paaduthu\\" is set in Mohanam. N. Krishnaswamy, writing for The Indian Express in 1988, claimed that \\"Kaalaiyum Neeye\\" was set in Hamsanandi, a view shared by Shoba Narayan, writing for Mint in 2009. Singer Charulatha Mani says it only has \\"Hamsanandi-like phrases\\", and is not strictly based on the raga itself. Carnatic musicologist Sundararaman identifies it as being set in Basant, while K. Easwaralingam, writing for Thinakaran, claimed it to be in Hamsadhvani. \\"Oorengum Thaedinaen\\" is set in Charukesi, and \\"Paattu Padava\\" is set in Keeravani. It was remixed by Aadithyan for the album Freak Out Remix (2011), and was later adapted into an entirely different song in Goli Soda (2014), titled \\"All Your Beauty\\". V. Balasubramaniam of The Hindu said, \\"A. M. Rajah's tryst with composing includes super duper hit songs from the films Kalyana Parisu, Aadi Perukku and Then Nilavu.\\" Film critic Baradwaj Rangan said, \\"Oh, the songs... Chinna Chinna Kannile, Kaalayum Neeye, Nilavum Malarum Paadudhu... I'm misting up as I write this!\\" Film historian Randor Guy wrote, \\"Jikki sang thousands of songs during her career and it is difficult to make a choice. However mention must be made of some of them\\", and mentioned \\"Oorengum Thaedinaen\\".  Release and reception  Then Nilavu was released on 30 September 1961. It was a huge success at the box office, and became one of Sridhar's biggest hits. Baradwaj Rangan said, \\"People from an older era may claim that the definitive Gemini romance was Missiamma, which reportedly was our grandmothers' Titanic, what with the actor wooing a charmingly young Savitri to the strains of Vaarayo Vennilaave. I, however, go with Then Nilavu, if only for the too-cool image of him in swimming trunks, water-skiing alongside the charmingly young Vyjayanthimala.\\" Writing for The Hindu, Mohan Raman praised Nambiar's villainous performance, calling it \\"unforgettable.\\" He also named Then Nilavu as one of \\"the best examples\\" where Thangavelu played a 'father' role. Juri of The Hindu Tamil praised Sridhar's script and direction. BBC News labelled the film as one of Gemini Ganesan's \\"memorable films\\". Thangavelu's dialogue \\"Kashmirikku ponakka cash meeruma?!\\" (Will we have cash left if we go to Kashmir?) attained popularity.  Home media  Then Nilavu was released on VCD by Moser Baer on 5 June 2007, and on DVD four years later, on 9 August.

The book was first published in the United States by Harper/Ecco on April 21, 2009. Kramer is a founder of the Holocaust Resource Center at Kean University in Union, New Jersey. Overview Clara Kramer is the teenage daughter of a Jewish factory owner at the outbreak of war in Europe in 1939. Her hometown of Zolkiew is initially in the Russian occupied part of Poland. She witnesses several friends and family being killed or deported by the Soviets, and hears stories of them being forced into labor. When the Russians switch sides and join with the Allies following Germany's invasion of Soviet Union, the Red Army retreats, and the town is quickly occupied by the Nazis. Jews are stripped of their assets and ordered to relocate to the ghetto, but having heard stories of the treatment Jews have been receiving at the hands of the Nazis, Clara's family and their friends take the decision to go into hiding. With the help of Valentin Beck, an ethnic German, and his family, Clara, her family and others are hidden in a purpose-built bunker under Melman's house [ who are also living in the bunker with Clara and her family], which the book describes as \\"a space no larger than a horse stall.\\" Beck, who is employed by the occupying forces as a storeman in an alcohol depot, has a reputation as an anti-Semite, a drunk and a philanderer. The author says that 18 people lived in the bunker for much of the time, while above them Beck's house was often used as lodgings for Wehrmacht troops and SS officers. In the bunker, Clara's mother urges her to begin writing a diary so that if they do not survive the war, the world will know what happened to them. Kramer recalls her day-to-day life in the bunker, the struggle to survive, how Beck brings them food and news of the war. She learns from Beck of the deportation of many of her friends to the death camps and other events associated with the Holocaust in Poland. She also recalls an affair that Beck has with one of the occupants, and how this puts them all in danger when Beck's wife, Julia, becomes aware of the relationship. There are also many occasions on which they are almost compromised. All but one of the occupants survives to see Zolkiew liberated by the Red Army, the one death occurring when the house catches fire and Clara's sister flees in panic and is captured by the Nazis. Kramer claims that of 5,000 Jews in Zolkiew before the war, only 50 survived.

In 1958, SOMECA became part of SIMCA Industries.  History  SAFAF (Soci√©t√© Anonyme Fran√ßaise des Automobiles Fiat), the company from which SIMCA was formed, began importing and later manufacturing licensed Fiat vehicles from a Nanterre factory in 1934. It also imported Fiat tractors as well as Steyr tractors into France. In 1953, SIMCA bought out the agricultural motors and tractors division of the company MAP, which it then used as the basis for the creation of SOMECA (\\"Soci√©t√© de MECAnique de la Seine\\"). SOMECA went on to produce the very first SOMECA tractors and parts for the last tractors to be produced by MAP. The first SOMECA tractor was the \\"DA 50\\", closely derived from the \\"MAP DR3\\" model, whose engine could develop 37 hp at 1500 rpm. The next model, the \\"SOM 40\\" was hugely successful in France. Launched in 1957, it was ranked among the largest tractors ever to be built in France. It was equipped with a Fiat OM COID 45 engine: a four-stroke, direct injection, 4165 cc diesel engine developing 45 hp at 1500 rpm. By 1964, 18,741 models had been manufactured, a new record for that time! With the arrival of petrol engines during the 1950-1960s, the same model became available with either a petrol or diesel engine. More than SOMECA tractors using the Fiat base engine had been manufactured by 1960. Come 1965, the year in which the \\"15\\" series was launched, SOMECA was only manufacturing licensed Fiat Trattori models. FIAT had always been SOMECA's majority shareholder and, in 1983, integrated the company into its agricultural subsidiary FiatAgri, which became Fiat New Holland in 1993 before becoming Fiat CNH Global, as it is currently known.  Someca in the rest of the world  In 1954 in Argentina, Fiat creat a subsidiary for the local manufacture of agricultural tractors which was named \\"Fiat Someca Construcciones C√≥rdoba\\" which will become Fiat Concord in 1959.

It is backed by the Federation of Egyptian Trade Unions and forms part of the Coalition of Socialist Forces. The party name is sometimes translated in English as Democratic Workers Party, Democratic Labour Party or Labour Democratic Party. History The party was initiated by the leftist front Hashd and the Revolutionary Socialists (RS) in response to the country's growing strike movement which preceded the revolution. WDP spokesperson Kamal Khalil says \\"Most leftist attempts to form a party include intellectuals as major players and a number of workers as members... This party aims at having workers as the main players and leaders of the party joined by a number of intellectuals.\\" Politics Although the RS have been instrumental in the formation of the party, the WDP does not present itself as a revolutionary party. Party officials claim socialist revolution \\"is not feasible in the current political environment\\", citing the Egyptian working class' \\"lack of political experience and the underdevelopment of the labour movement\\". They instead advocate the re-nationalization of industry and more genuine worker democracy. Although not a self-proclaimed revolutionary party, the WDP cites revolutionary language and theory. For example, on May Day, 2011 - the first May Day after Mubarak - the party chanted \\"A workers' revolution against the capitalist government\\" while marching to Tahrir Square. The same day, Hossam el-Hamalawy, a representative of the party, called for \\"a complete halt to the neoliberal program.\\" And Ahmed Ezzat, one of the founders of the WDP has admitted \\"Lenin's What is to be Done and April Notes helped shape our strategy, as did Marx's theories\\". Ezzat has also labeled the Muslim Brotherhood \\"counter- revolutionaries\\". On 10 May 2011, the WDP agreed to enter into a \\"socialist front\\" with four other Egyptian leftist groups called the Coalition of Socialist Forces. The new grouping includes the Revolutionary Socialists, the Egyptian Communist Party, The Socialist Party of Egypt and the Popular Democratic Alliance Party. Demands The party's most important principles are \\"the respect of all Egyptians' religious beliefs and bringing an end to discrimination on the basis of religion, color or sex.\\" The re-nationalization of industry is one of the WDP's key demands but unlike under Gamal Abdel Nasser, where the heads of state-owned factories were appointed by the President, the WDP calls on workers of these factories to appoint their own managers. The WDP stands for abolishing privatization and monopoly policies, and redirecting development plans to benefit \\"underserved social classes\\". The party is also coordinating with other forces to establish a higher minimum wage for Egyptian workers, the establishment of trade unions independent of the state, and to improve working conditions in all workplaces. They are also calling for \\"combating administrative corruption and reevaluating Egypt‚Äôs economic ties to Israel\\". Their slogan is \\"the workers must be united\\". Legality Under the current Political Parties Law, the WDP may not acquire official recognition, due to the law banning parties forming on a class basis. Also, party leaders are required to raise at least LE1 million to publish the names of at least 5000 founders in two widely circulated dailies. The WDP sees this as the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces way of discriminating against the poor and labour movement: \\"This shows that the old mentality is still there and that the government is siding with businessmen rather than workers.\\" The WDP is expected to defy the legislation and launch their party as soon as they recruit at least 10,000 workers and 10,000 farmers.

Williams was born in Sault St. Louis, Quebec, Canada, the son of Thomas Williams, and was educated at Dartmouth College. He published tracts and a spelling book in the Iroquois language, translated the Book of Common Prayer into Iroquois, and wrote a biography of Chief Te-ho-ra-gwa-ne-gen (Thomas Williams). Missionary career 1853 portrait In 1815, Williams joined the Episcopal Church. In 1817, Bishop John Henry Hobart appointed Williams to be a missionary to the Oneida people in upstate New York. In 1820 and 1821, Williams led delegations of Native Americans to Green Bay, Wisconsin, where they secured a cession of land from the Menominee and Winnebago tribes in the Fox River Valley at Little Chute and along Duck Creek. Historians have disputed the significance of Williams' leadership to this migration compared to that of the Oneida people themselves, including Oneida leader Daniel Bread. The following year Williams made his home there and was married to a Menominee woman named Madeleine Jourdain. In 1826 he was ordained a deacon. In 1839 and afterwards, Williams began to make the claim that he was the French \\"Lost Dauphin\\". During the 1850s he openly became a pretender to the throne of France, but he died in poverty at Hogansburg, New York. Williams was buried at Saint James' Cemetery in Hogansburg on August 28, 1858. In 1947, his remains and tombstone were moved to Holy Apostles Cemetery in Oneida, Wisconsin. His tombstone at Oneida indicates that he was a Freemason. Legacy William's plot of 19 acres of land at his Wisconsin home was designated Lost Dauphin State Park by the state. It was later taken off the list of state parks and the house was burned. It remains designated as Lost Dauphin Park with the land remaining state owned. The flagstone foundation of the house remains visible.

Spanning , it converts the town of Oak City in Millard County with the city of Delta and US-50 to the west, and the town of Leamington to the north. Route description SR-125 State Route 125 starts about east of Delta, at the intersection of US-50 and SR-136, and from there heads east towards Oak City. As the route approaches Oak City, it turns to the north before passing through the town as Main Street. After leaving town, the route gradually turns to the northeast before turning north again to enter the town of Leamington, ending at its intersection with SR-132. History The road from Lynndyl south to Oak City was originally designated as State Route 126 in 1931, and renumbered to State Route 125 in 1933. In 1953, the route was extended from its southern terminus in Oak City, taking over the western portion of Utah State Route 135 from Oak City to Delta. In addition, the original portion of the highway from Oak City north to Lynndyl was rerouted instead to run north to Leamington, some to the east, which reflects the current alignment of the route.
