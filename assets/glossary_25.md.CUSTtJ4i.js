The rectory was completed in 1770 and was listed by the Danish Heritage Agency on 1 October 1993. Since completion the rectory has been the home and workspace of the Astrup Church priest and is owned by the Church of Denmark along with the church itself.  History  In 1767 Christen Begtrup from Odder was assigned the Astrup Church pastorate and he commenced a large renovation project of the church and rectory. The church had a bell tower added in 1780 and east of the choir a sacristy was constructed. The main effort was directed at the rectory which was completely rebuilt and completed in 1770. The following years a number of buildings was added to the main building. In 1777 a barn and was added, in 1784 a smokehouse and in 1806 a wing for tenant housing. All these additions have since been torn down or burnt, leaving only the original main building.  Architecture  Astrup Church The rectory is a 44 meters long half-timbered brick building with a ridged roof tiled with red brick. The building has a large dormer window in the middle on each side of the building, facing north and south. The building originally had a traditional interior design with a hallway on the north side, running along the length of the building, while the south side was occupied by evenly sized rooms with doors aligned to make it possible to see through them, from one end of the building to the other. In the west end of the building a single large room cut the hallway short to make a, for the time, uncharacteristically large room which was likely used as a small dance or concert hall. The building has been renovated and altered from its original design a number of times. In the late 1700s a living room was expanded across the width of the building which cut the hallway off. In 1856 the rectory was extensively renovated with new floors, interior walls of brick instead of wood, new support beams for the ceilings and new, flat roofs on the dormer windows. The building has since been renovated in 1915, 1924, 1962 and 1990. In the 1924 the roofs of the dormer windows were restored to their original ridged state. The renovation in 1915 was done by Christian Kampmann for which he received the C. F. Hansen Medal in 1918.

It premiered on FOX on October 27, 2014 and was written by Ben Edlund, his first credit for the show and directed by TJ Scott. In the episode, Bullock (Donal Logue) relives traumatic memories after a killer he thought it was closed years ago while Gordon suffers the consequences of his actions. The episode was watched by 5.89 million viewers. Although this was a season low, it received positive reviews with critics commenting on Bullock's storyline. Plot The episode begins with a flashback set 10 years ago. A young Bullock (Donal Logue) and his partner, Dix (Dan Hedaya) sent to rescue a girl, Shelley Lawson, kidnapped by a vigilante known as the Spirit of the Goat, who kills the firstborn of Gotham's elite. They discover her dead and have a fight with the vigilante, revealed to be Randall Milkie. Dix falls into a trap while Bullock kills Milkie. In the present, the body of a girl, Amanda Hastings, is discovered with a pattern very similar to the Spirit of the Goat. This convinces Bullock that maybe the Spirit of the Goat wasn't working alone in his crimes or not even dead after all. After another girl is kidnapped, Gordon (Ben McKenzie) and Bullock at the same place ten years ago and they arrest the vigilante. The identity is a janitor, Raymond Earl (Christopher James Baker), who had no relation to Milkie. Bullock then discovers that both had the same psychiatrist, Dr. Marks (Susan Misner), turning out she hypnotized them to do their actions. When a longshoreman confesses witnessing Gordon killing Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor), Montoya (Victoria Cartagena) and Allen (Andrew Stewart-Jones) file an arrest warrant for Gordon. They arrest him in his apartment and they take him to the GCPD. Bullock tries to defend Gordon that he didn't kill Cobblepot and as everyone argues, Cobblepot appears in the door. Bullock then berates Gordon for his actions. Reception=Viewers= The episode was watched by 5.89 million viewers, with a 2.2 rating among 18-49 adults.

The episode received a rating of 69% on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on 26, with the site's consensus stating: \\"While Gotham finds its footing, 'The Spirit of the Goat' is a step in the right direction with much- needed character details about Oswald Cobblepot and Detective Bullock.\\" Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"good\\" 7.9 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict, \\"With baby steps, Gotham is getting better. But not in a way that expressly deals with its biggest problems. Though taking a break from Fish this week, while having less Cobblepot than usual, was a nice indicator that bigger, better episode shakeups could be on the horizon.\\" The A.V. Club's Oliver Sava gave the episode a \\"B-\\" grade and wrote, \\"Harvey Bullock takes the spotlight in 'Spirit Of The Goat,' and Gotham is all the better for it. I've mentioned quite a few times in these reviews that the series needs to spend more time fleshing out the history of its characters, and this week's episode takes a break from the overarching mob war storyline to focus on Bullock's character and how he's changed from his early days on the GCPD. The result is a considerable improvement over the last few weeks, although this episode still has its fair share of problems.\\" References External links  * * Category:Gotham (season 1) episodes Category:2014 American television episodes ","title":"Spirit of the Goat"},{"id":"49186682","text":"Virginijus ≈†ik≈°nys (born 26 January 1956) is a Lithuanian biochemist.

Built in 1888, the monument celebrates the tercentenary of the defeat of the Spanish Armada, which was sighted by English captains stationed in the city. It is a granite structure, decorated with bronze crests and a statue of Britannia. Background Painting by John Seymour Lucas depicting the scene on the Hoe when captains play bowls as the Spanish Armada comes into view (1880) The Spanish Armada (or just the Armada) was a fleet that unsuccessfully attempted a naval invasion of England. News of the Armada's approach reached Plymouth on the afternoon of 19 July and it entered into sight on 20 July. Tradition recorded that tidings of the approach came to the captains whilst they were playing bowls on Plymouth Hoe. Tradition also associates the following passage from Francis Drake: \\"There is time enough to play the game out first, and thrash the Spaniards afterwards.\\" In commemoration of the defeat of the Armada, it was customary for the bells of St Andrew's to ring a merry peal annually on the Saturday night preceding 25 July. This practice ended in the 19th century. A statue of Francis Drake was erected on the Hoe in 1884. History The foundation stone of the Armada Memorial was laid on 19 July 1888, by the Mayor of Plymouth, Henry Waring. The day was taken to celebrate the tercentenary of the first sighting of the Armada from the Hoe, but Richard Worth notes that this was actually on the 20 July. Excursion trains were run and crowds gathered for the ceremony, which was marked as a public holiday and banquet at the city's Guildhall. The memorial was inaugurated by the then Duke of Edinburgh, Alfred on 21 October 1890, with full civic pomp and imposing naval and military demonstration. The memorial became a listed building on 1 May 1975. Architecture The memorial was made by architect Herbert Gribble and sculptor William Charles May. The monument is sculpted of granite which frequently uses entablature and features sculptures and fittings made of bronze. The base of the monument has steps and is octagonal in shape. This supports a square plinth bearing a shield decorated with drapes and a crown. A panel shows the battle of the Armada inscribed with \\"HE BLEW WITH HIS WINDS AND THEY WERE SCATTERED\\". The tall plinth bears a wreathed medallion and a chest with a head, presumed by historian Nikolaus Pevsner to be that of Spanish admiral Sedonia. On top of the monument stands the bronze statue of Britannia (a female personification of Great Britain) with a lion. A series of cast-iron stanchions with chains act as a perimeter fence. The stone used in the memorial was quarried in Gunnislake, Cornwall and was noted as one of the whitest known granites with a close texture (in 1897).

This work of art was created as a plaster cast, and then later cast in bronze. It is unclear if the when or if the artist cast the final sculpture. Other sculptures created within the last months of the artist's life were cast in bronze posthumous. For example, the other monumental sculpture created in this period, Head of the Montserrat, II, was cast in bronze after the artist's death.  Context  The artwork, like many other plaster casts Gonz√°lez created between 1940-1942, embodies the artist's own feelings towards the injustice of war. By 1942, the artist witnessed the destruction of his native country through the Spanish Civil War, and then again in the beginning of the Second World War. The artist was directly affected by the latter war; his daughter and son-in-law went into hiding shortly after World War II began leaving the artist alone as his health failed; this is because his son-in-law was a known anti-Nazi, and thus was being sought by the German secret police. At this time, the artist began to focus on figurative drawings and plaster castings. The art produced during the last two years of his life are testimonies to the suffering and despair Gonz√°lez felt towards tyranny and war. His last casts suggest the extent of despair and terror he felt and witness; these include the La Montserrat Shouting, Abstract Figure, and the Raised Left Hand.  Description  Raised Left Hand is currently displayed in the modern art section of the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya. This bronze sculpture is installed next to a separate sculpture, Raised Right Hand. Both sculptures, as well as both plaster and bronze versions, are the same size: 37.2 √ó 19 √ó 15.2 cm. When viewed together, the two arms create the illusion that they are from the same body reaching out into space. The way the fingers are spaced out creates a sense of urgency. Emotions like anger, despair, terror, and confusion are evoked by the position of the hands. This is echoed by the direction the two sculptures are intentionally installed, and by the inconsistent surface level the artist uses to create the arms, hands, and fingers. These elements together interpreted within the historical context expresses a clear reaction. As scholar Vicente Aguilera Cerni suggests, the last sculptures cast by Julio Gonz√°lez are reminders of \\"man‚Äôs right to exist without the threat of terror and destruction, in security and dignity.\\"  Provenance  It is unclear where the sculpture was between 1942 and 1972. Very little is written about Raised Left Hand's appearance in museum collections or gallery exhibitions. The only provenance detailed by the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya is when the bronze sculpture was added to the permanent collection in 1973 by the donation of his daughter, Roberta. Roberta Gonz√°lez did not donate the plaster sculpture of the Raised Left Hand to the museum however; according to catalogues published by the Institut Valenci√† d'Art Modern, she donated the plaster copy to Gal√©rie de France, Paris. There is a Raised Left Hand No. 2 in the IVAM collection currently. It is unclear how many bronze casts, and by whom, were created after the artist's death.

He was a naturalised US citizen and settled on Mindanao where he engaged in commerce. and Blanche Anna Walker.Blanche was a volunteer at Emmanuel Cooperative Hospital, Tondo, Manila. Betrayed in January 1944 by a Japanese agent, Franco Vera Reyes, who had befriended them and won their trust, Blanche, with Dr. Hawthorne Darby, nurse Helen Jonaline Wilk, Methodist pastor Mary Litt Boyd Stagg, and another woman named Sybil were taken by the Kempeitai to the Cementerio del Norte where they were beheaded and buried on 28 or 30 August 1944: \\"Blanche was dead, executed in late August, 1944, hands tied behind her, blindfolded and kneeling over a newly-dug trench somewhere in Manila's North Cemetery, killed with over two dozen other civilians accused of various acts of conspiracy by the Japanese. For Blanche and the few other American women, death was by beheading by Samurai sword. For the men, it had been a single shot to the back of the head.\\" ‚ÄîLouis Jurika Their common grave was found in 1945 by Thomas Walker Jurika who threatened and forced the double-agent Richard Sakakida to reluctantly reveal the grave's location. Stephen had a brother, Thomas Walker Jurika (guerrilla assistant of Chick Parsons), and a sister, Katrushka (wife of Chick Parsons). Stephen spent much of his early years in the Philippines, where his father owned plantations, and went to school in the Philippines, China and Japan. He entered the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, graduating with the class of 1933. After service on the cruisers and , he became a naval aviator, completing his flight training at Naval Air Station Pensacola. He was then posted to Torpedo Squadron 3 (VT-3), on the aircraft carrier . He married Lillian Ursula Marie Smith, the daughter of a United States Marine Corps colonel, Harry Locke Smith. They had three daughters, Lillian, Jane and Anne. In June 1939, he became the naval air attach√© in Tokyo, a role in which his ability to speak fluent Japanese was invaluable. \\"As an aviator\\", he later recalled, \\"I was interested in more than just ships. I became interested in targets.\\" He returned to the United States in August 1941, taking up a posting with the Office of Naval Intelligence in Washington, DC. World War II In October 1941, Jurika joined the crew of the newly commissioned aircraft carrier as its Flight Deck and Intelligence Officer. He briefed the participants in the April 1942 Doolittle Raid on the best industrial and military targets in the city, and the best routes to get to them, and instructed them on how to identify themselves to people in China. He would later be portrayed by Leon Ames in the 1944 movie about the raid, Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo. Jurika served on the Hornet in the Battle of Midway in June 1942, and at the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands in October, during which the Hornet was badly damaged and had to be scuttled. In December he became the Operations Officer of AirSols. He was awarded the Legion of Merit and the Commendation Medal for conducting a survey of an airfield site on Japanese-held Munda on New Georgia with a three-man survey party. Returning to the United States, he served as a torpedo bomber training officer at Naval Air Station Fort Lauderdale and then the Naval Air Operational Training Command in Jacksonville, Florida from August 1943 until December 1944, when he became the navigator on the aircraft carrier . He was present on the bridge on the morning of 19 March 1945 when the Franklin was severely damaged and set ablaze by a lone Japanese dive bomber. When the fires reached the magazine, Jurika later recalled, \\"Whole aircraft engines with propellers attached, debris of all description, including pieces of human bodies were flung high into the air and descended on the general area like hail on a roof.\\" He remained at his post, and was one of 18 crewmen who were awarded the Navy Cross for their actions that day. He then served as operations officer of Carrier Division One. Post-war With his knowledge of Asian languages and customs, Jurika became the naval air attach√© in Australia in 1946. He felt that the Chifley Government failed to appreciate the danger posed by Communism, and was slow to move against a spy ring known to be operating in Australia. He felt that the Commonwealth Security Service, charged with responsibility for counter- espionage were amateurs and \\"flatfeet\\". On his recommendation, and that of the US Ambassador to Australia, Myron M. Cowen, intelligence cooperation with Australia was halted. Jurika returned to the United States to become the Executive Officer of the Naval Air Station Corpus Christi in Texas. He went back to the Pacific as an officer on the Carrier Division One staff. During the Korean War, he was the naval liaison officer with the Japan Air Self- Defense Force, for which he was awarded the Legion of Merit. His citation read: Later life After service on the staffs of Admirals Arthur W. Radford and Felix Stump, Jurika earned a master's degree from George Washington University in 1957. He commanded Carrier Air Wing Fourteen from 1957 to 1959, and then was Commanding Officer of the Stanford University NROTC program from 1959 to 1962. While there he was both teacher and student, earning his PhD in 1962, writing his doctoral thesis on \\"The political geography of the Philippines\\". After retiring from the Navy in 1962, he taught political science at Stanford from 1962 to 1964, at the University of Santa Clara from 1964 to 1975, and at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, from 1975 to 1986. He was concurrently a research scholar at the Hoover Institution from 1980 until 1986. Jurika died from cancer at a hospital in Menlo Park, California, on 15 July 1993, and was buried in Los Altos Cemetery. He was survived by his wife and three daughters, and his brother.

It has leafless stems up to tall, and clusters of flowers that often proliferate into branches. Description Isolepis prolifera has a caespitose (tufted) growth form, with round stems up to tall and wide. Cited in Flora of New Zealand. Its leaves are reduced to red or brown sheaths around the stem, sometimes with a small free lobe up to long. Its flowers are arranged in a cluster of spikelets, long and wide. Many of the spikelets are, however, replaced by branchlets, each long, and terminating in a further head of spikelets. This proliferation into branches gives the species its scientific name '. Each spikelet consists of up to 30 flowers, and the fruit is a nutlet with fine reticulations on its surface. Isolepis prolifera varies considerably in size, and smaller specimens may resemble the Australasian species Isolepis inundata, although I. inundata normally has some true leaves, and is not always proliferating. Distribution Isolepis prolifera is found in a number of countries around the world, although it is not clear where it is native, and where it is an introduced species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature considers it to be native only to South Africa, where it grows in the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Western Cape provinces. It is also widespread in New Zealand, occurring on the South Island, North Island, and on the Chatham Islands, and may be native there. In Australia, I. prolifera occurs in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania, as well as in the Mediterranean- climate region of Western Australia. It is also potentially native to Tristan da Cunha and Saint Helena, and has been introduced to France and California. Ecology Isolepis prolifera is a perennial plant that grows as a helophyte (marsh plant). It thrives in both eutrophic and oligotrophic wetlands, and can be a weed of drainages on farmland. Naming Isolepis prolifera was first described by Christen Friis Rottb√∏ll, a pupil of Carl Linnaeus, in his 1772 work ', as \\"Scirpus prolifer\\". It was transferred to the genus Isolepis in 1810 by Robert Brown, although it is different from other Isolepis species, and may be better placed in a different genus, such as Scirpoides. Isolepis prolifera has different common names in different parts of its range. In South Africa, it is known as ' in Afrikaans or ' in Zulu, in Australia as \\"budding club-rush\\", and in the United States as \\"proliferating bulrush\\". In New Zealand, it either has no common name or is known as \\"three-square\\".

It premiered on FOX on November 3, 2014 and was written by series developer Bruno Heller, and directed by Rob Bailey. In this episode, the mob war escalates while Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor) reveals a new component of his manipulative strategy, forcing Gordon (Ben McKenzie) to deal with the consequences of his decision to spare Penguin's life. The episode was watched by 6.63 million viewers, an improvement over the previous episode and received critical acclaim from critics, praising the deviation of the \\"villain of the week\\" concept. Plot Mooney (Jada Pinkett Smith), outraged to know Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor) is alive, tells Butch (Drew Powell) to kill him. In the GCPD locker room, Gordon (Ben McKenzie) calls Barbara (Erin Richards), telling her to meet him at the bus station as soon as possible. He is then attacked by Bullock (Donal Logue), who plans to kill him and bring his body to Falcone (John Doman) as a clemency. Gordon returns to his apartment to find Barbara held hostage by Butch and an enforcer. When Butch threatens to kill Barbara, he kills the enforcer and knocks out Butch. He then takes Barbara to a bus station, telling her to leave Gotham for a time. Gordon tries to get an arrest warrant for Falcone and Mayor James (Richard Kind) but finds little support from Essen (Zabryna Guevara). Falcone sends Victor Zsasz (Anthony Carrigan) to bring Gordon to him but he is saved by Montoya (Victoria Cartagena) and Allen (Andrew Stewart-Jones). Cobblepot, Frankie Carbone (Danny Mastrogiorgio) and henchmen arrive at a warehouse where they kill Falcone's ally, Nikolai (Jeremy Davidson). When Carbone reveals his intent to murder Cobblepot, Cobblepot then reveals Carbone's henchmen have allied with him for a raise, and stabs him fatally. Gordon realizes Zsasz has Barbara in custody and goes to talk with Falcone. After a talk, they manage to free Barbara. In Falcone's mansion, he is visited by Cobblepot. In flashbacks to the day Falcone saved Gordon and Bullock, he talked with an imprisoned Cobblepot, curious as to any other secrets he possessed. In exchange for these, Cobblepot requested being assigned to Gordon for his execution, in hopes of being spared to integrate into Maroni's circle. Learning that Mooney and Nikolai had been planning to kill him and usurp him, Falcone remarks that their present plans have played out well, but that he considers Gordon concerning. Oswald, however, thanks him for the gesture, suggesting that Gordon has a further role to play in their endeavors.

The episode received a rating of 88% based on reviews from 26 critics, on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, with the site's consensus stating: \\"Although 'Penguin's Umbrella' is a departure from the 'Case of the Week\\" form, Gotham finally lives up to its potential with a gritty serialized episode about a handful of key characters.\\" Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"great\\" 8.5 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict, \\"'Penguin's Umbrella' wasn't a perfect episode, but it was the best Gothams had to offer so far. I'm not sure how Penguin got to walk right out of the precinct after bowing and saying 'Hello,' and again, it will seem weird to see Gordon, after everything, simply return back to work - but the complete focus on immediate mob-related dangers and corruption, without having a 'case of the week' to distract from the seasonal arc, felt like the best course for this series. And, stemming from this, the whole 'no cop or lawyer will help' freeze out will probably start to thaw as allies come out of the woodwork.\\" The A.V. Club's Kyle Fowle gave the episode a \\"B-\\" grade and wrote, \\"Last week's episode included a bit of character backstory, and mostly stuck to a straightforward storyline, and the result, as Oliver Sava pointed out, was the season's strongest episode to date. While tonight's episode may not live up to its potentially explosive title, 'Penguin's Umbrella,' it once again shows that Gotham can craft an intriguing and compelling hour of television when it slows down its pace and focuses on juggling just a few characters and storylines at a time.\\" Simon Abrams of Vulture.com gave the film 4/5 and despite minor problems praised the episode for finally delivering \\"a serialized neo-noir with Godfather-size scope that also happens to be set in Batman‚Äôs world\\". Abrams called it the best episode so far, and concludes \\"one can only hope for more where this came from.\\" References External links  * * Category:Gotham (season 1) episodes Category:2014 American television episodes ","title":"Penguin's Umbrella"},{"id":"49186919","text":"thumb Yury Davidovich Levitansky (; January 22, 1922, Kozelets, Chernigov Oblast, Ukrainian SSR ‚Äî January 25, 1996, Moscow, Russia) was a poet and translator, a master of lyrical parody of genres, and Laureate of the State Prize of the Russian Federation in the field of literature and art in 1994.–£–∫–∞–∑ –ü—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–∞ –†–§ –æ—Ç 29.05.1995 ‚Ññ 537 Levitansky fought in the Great Patriotic War.

Such devices typically have a reading error of ¬±0.05 grams. Its name refers to its three beams, where the middle beam is the largest, the far beam of medium size, and the front beam the smallest. The difference in size of the beams indicates the difference in weights and reading scale that each beam measures. Typically, the reading scale of the middle beam reads in 100 gram increments, the far beam in 10 gram increments, and the front beam can read from 0 to 10 grams. The triple beam balance can be used to measure mass directly from the objects, find mass by difference for liquid, and measure out substances.  Parts of a triple beam balance  The parts of triple beam balance are identified as the following. # Weighing pan - The area in which an object is placed in order to be weighed. # Base - The base rests underneath the weighing pan and can usually be customised to fit on a workbench or set up with tripod legs. # Beams - The three beams on the balance are used to set the level of precision, with each beam working at different increments (1-10 grams, 10 grams and 100 grams). When using the triple beam balance, it is recommended that your start with the lowest level of precision e.g 100 gram increments and then work your way down. For example, if your object weighs 327 grams the 100 gram pointer will drop below the fixed mark on the 4th notch (400g), you will then need to move this back to the third notch (300g). This process will then need to be repeated for the 10 gram increments (20g) and then single figure units (7g). # Riders - The riders are the sliding pointers placed on top of the balance beams to indicate the mass in grams on the pan and beam. # Pointers - The scale pointer marks the equal point of the object's mass on the scale and mass on the beam # Zero adjustment knob - This is used to manually adjust the triple beam balance to the 'zero' mark (check to ensure that the pointer is at zero before use). Before using triple beam balance, the scale pointer should be at zero. The zero adjustment knob can be used to adjust the scale pointer. Place the objects on the pan and adjust the riders. The hundred rider should be initially adjusted and follow by the tens rider. Adjust the ones rider until the scale pointer is at zero again.

It was founded in 1978 by Clive Davies of the Sydney Go Club, Neville Smythe of the Canberra Go Club, and Bill Leveritt of the Brisbane Go Club, joined in 1982 by Melbourne and some year after that by Adelaide (clubs have existed intermittently in Perth and Hobart also). The Association is the Australian member of the International Go Federation. With the New Zealand Go Society it makes up the Oceania zone of the IGF and thus shares one seat on the IGF's board of directors. The aims of the association are: * to promote the game of Go in Australia; * to coordinate Go activities in Australia, in particular to arrange National Tournaments and confer National Titles and individual rankings; * to represent Australia in international go affairs, in particular by membership of the International Go Federation, and to select Australian representatives for international events such as the World Amateur Go Championships; * to promote mutual understanding and friendly relations with Go players throughout the world in association with foreign national Go associations. History * In 1977 the inaugural general meeting of the Association was held in Sydney. * In 1978 the first Australian Championships were held under the aegis of the Association, and have been held every year since. * In 2002 the first Toyota & Denso Cup World Go Oza regional tournament for Australia was held. These continued every two years until the global event was cancelled in 2008 by the sponsors. * In 2007 the first Korean Ambassador's Cup was held in Sydney. This is the national qualifier for competitors to the Korean Prime Ministers' Cup. * In 2009 the Association converted itself from a federation of clubs to a national association of individual members. * In 2015 the first Australian Go Congress was held, with a second one in 2016. Present day The AGA selects the hosts for the Australian National Go Championships every year, and runs the Australian Digital tournament directly. Based upon individual members' performance in tournament play, it selects the Australian competitors for the World Amateur Go Championships, Korean Prime Minister's Cup, and in appropriate years the World Amateur Pair Go Championships. There are a fair number of state championships and other first- class tournaments held around the country each year which earn their competitors Australian representative points. To sustain these activities, members pay an annual individual fee, although clubs may opt to pay this at a bulk rate on behalf of their membership.

In the latter she was a friend and compatriot of Vincent Pallotti. As a result of smallpox, Sanna was for the most part disabled and further ailments prevented her from returning to her hometown after departing on a pilgrimage; this forced her to take up residence in Rome where she later died. Sanna married and bore seven children but was widowed after almost two decades of marriage. Pope Francis proclaimed her to be Venerable in 2014 after determining that she lived a model Christian life of heroic virtue. The pope approved the miracle attributed to her in 2016 which allowed for her beatification to occur. Cardinal Angelo Amato ‚Äì on the behalf of the pope ‚Äì presided over the beatification on 17 September 2016. Life Elisabetta Sanna Porcu was born on 23 April 1788 as the second of five children to poor farmers of harsh economic conditions; a brother was Antonio Luigi. At three months old she contracted smallpox and as a result was never able to again raise her arms. She was able to move her fingers and wrists but could not bring food to the mouth nor make the sign of the Cross amongst other things. She received her Confirmation on 27 April 1794 from the Archbishop of Sassari Giacinto della Torre. She was later entrusted to the care of Lucia Pinna who was a member of the Secular Franciscan Order. Pinna taught Sanna the importance of frequent rosaries as well as Eucharistic Adoration and both proper treatment and love of the poor. Despite being in a strong household of fundamental Christian values she learned the importance of loving Jesus Christ while at school despite the fact that she remained illiterate during her entire life. Not long after she received her First Communion and her first Reconciliation. Each week Sanna attended sessions that her father's cousin Father Luigi Sanna held in which she learnt the basics of catechism; she encouraged others to follow suit. On one particular occasion Sanna dazed into a Crucifix and heard a voice: \\"Take courage and love me\\"; she realized that she had a personal mission to profess the message of the Gospel in the spirit of evangelization. On 13 September 1807 she married Antonio Porcu and the two went on to have seven children. The oldest was born in 1808 and the last was born in 1822 and two died soon after their births. Her husband died on 25 January 1825 when her oldest was seventeen and her last child was three. This meant she had to double the workload in the house in order to provide for her children. In 1829 Sanna met the priest Giuseppe Valle who soon became her spiritual advisor. The two decided to go on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land and as a result Sanna had to entrust her children to her mother and her brother Father Antonio Luigi; she also sought the help of her niece and neighbours. Sanna and Valle departed from Porto Torres to Genoa at the end of June 1830 where the pair waited for over a week for a ship to Cyprus. However the two could not continue further to their destination due to the fact that Valle had no visa and was forbidden to keep going. The pair decided to go to Rome and arrived there on 23 July 1830. Valle remained at her side as an assistant until 1839. Sanna became a professed member of the Secular Franciscan Order and she devoted herself to the example of Francis of Assisi. On a visit to Saint Peter's Basilica she met Father Camillo Loria who heard her confession; Loria ordered her to return to Sassari but she found with her ailments that she could not return home at all. She soon came into contact with Vincenzo Pallotti who took her in his care and contacted her brother to tell him that she was unfit to return home. Sanna wept but entrusted herself to God and His providence for sustenance. Around this time she also worked in the house of the future cardinal Giovanni Saglia. Pallotti continued to serve as her spiritual director for almost two decades and he held her in considerable esteem realizing her to be a true agent of God. In Rome she educated other children in catechism and she also prepared them for the sacraments. Her house was open to all women who wanted to learn religious litanies and of catechism in general. Sanna also visited the ill and comforted them in private homes and in the Hospital for Incurables. She knitted and the end result as well as gifts given to her were used to help the poor and the orphans in the two houses that Pallotti founded. She attended several Masses on a frequent basis and also took time for Eucharistic Adoration. People visited her for advice and even Pallotti and his Pallottines visited her for advice too. She soon witnessed the foundation of the Union of the Catholic Apostolate and she became an active member of that organization. With Pallotti's death in 1850 she felt alone more than ever before but she continued to place her complete trust in God despite this great personal loss. Elisabetta Sanna died in 1857 and garnered the strong recognition of being a great saint. She was buried in the church of San Salvatore in Onda in Rome. Beatification=Process and Venerable= The process for beatification was held on two fronts in both Rome and in Sassari. The first process opened on 15 June 1857 and concluded its work prior to the formal introduction of the cause decades later on 22 April 1880 under Pope Leo XIII; this conferred upon her the title Servant of God. The second process was then conducted and was closed before the Congregation of the Causes of Saints revitalized the cause and declared \\"nihil obstat\\" (nothing against) to the continuation of the cause on 4 March 1994; on 11 March 1994 the two previous processes were validated so that the next step of the process could commence. The postulation then submitted the Positio to officials for further investigation in 1997 and the cause was moved at once to its historical commission on 22 April 1997 as is the case with older causes. Pope Francis recognized that Sanna had lived a model life of heroic virtue on 27 January 2014 and proclaimed that Elisabetta Sanna was therefore Venerable. =Miracle and beatification= The miracle required for beatification was investigated in the diocese of origin and was validated before it could proceed to the Rome-based medical board; it met and approved the healing as a miracle on 26 March 2015. Theologians followed suit and approved it on 9 June 2015 and transferred it to the members of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints who approved the miracle also on 12 January 2016. The miracle in question concerned a Brazilian girl in 2008 who contracted an aggressive arm tumor and was cured of it as a result of the intercession of Sanna. Pope Francis approved the miracle on 21 January 2016 and this allowed for Elisabetta Sanna to be beatified. It was suggested that the beatification would take place either in the following September or October. On 25 January 2016, it was made public that the potential dates were either 17, 18 or 25 September 2016. Cardinal Angelo Amato presided over the beatification on the pontiff's behalf. =Postulation= The current postulator of the cause is Father Jan Korycki.

They are made of durable metals, allowing them to endure a very hot temperature when touching with the hot objects.  Crucible  A laboratory tool that is best fit with crucible tongs is a crucible, a small vessel made from ceramic. Its function is it is used to heat various type of chemicals that are required a very high temperature, usually solid chemicals. This tool is available in various size and form. It can be in a low form or a high form, depends on the types of work. In addition, this vessel can cope with a high temperature up to 565.56 degree Celsius.  Feature  As a crucible will be very hot when heating it in a furnace or a Bunsen burner, one cannot hold the crucible directly. Therefore, crucible tongs come to play a key role when burning, or doing anything with hot objects. The major types of metals used to produce the tongs are stainless steel, brass, and nickel. Moreover, some of them also have a special characteristic. For instance, a locking version of crucible tongs can be locked with the edge of a crucible, allow users to be more comfortable and more confidence while moving a very hot crucible from place to place. Hence, they provide more safety for the users.  Safety  It is necessary to wear safety goggles, gloves, and proper shoes as well, crucible tongs is not the only safety tool that one should take when holding a hot crucible. The scorching objects in crucible might be spilled off and cause a damage to a holder's skin. Since crucible tongs work with the crucible, knowing the safety use of crucible is a must. Here are some tips: * Before using the crucible, make sure that it is dry * Fill the crucible with sample chemicals to only 1/2 or 2/3, do not fill until it is full * If the user used the crucible to fuse the glass, waiting for the crucible to cool down before cleaning it * Squeezing the crucible or use some metal sticks to break the cooling glass out of the crucible * Wash it until it is clean enough  Additional images  File:Crucible_Tongs Drawing.JPG File:Crucible Tongs.JPGCrucible Tongs with Crucible File:Tongs3.JPG  References  Category:Laboratory equipment ","title":"Crucible tongs"},{"id":"49187294","text":"Ilya Reznik, 2013 Ilya Rahmielevich Reznik (; born April 4, 1938, Leningrad) is a Russian poet and songwriter, People's Artist of Russia (2003).–†–µ–∑–Ω–∏–∫ —É—à–µ–ª –∏–∑ –æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ç–∞ –ø—Ä–∏ –ú–í–î –∏–∑-–∑–∞ ¬´—Ç—Ä–∞–≤–ª–∏¬ª Honorary member of the Russian Academy of Arts.

He was a professed member of the Mariannhill Missionaries and assumed the name of \\"Engelmar\\" when he was admitted into the order. He became known as the \\"Angel of Dachau\\". In 2016, Pope Francis recognized the fact that Unzeitig died in odium fidei (in hatred of the faith) and Unzeitig was subsequently beatified on 24 September 2016 in a ceremony presided over by Cardinal Angelo Amato acting on the pope's behalf. Life Hubert Unzeitig was born on 1 March 1911 and had at least one sister. At the age of 18 he commenced his studies for the priesthood and also entered his novitiate with the Mariannhill Missionaries in Reimlingen; this was in contrast to his earlier intention to become part of the missions. He spent his time as a student of both theological and philosophical studies in W√ºrzburg. In May 1938 he made his final profession of vows into the order and was received into it with the name of \\"Engelmar\\". He was later ordained to the priesthood on 6 August 1939 just a month before the outbreak of World War II and celebrated his first Mass on 15 August 1939 on the Feast of the Assumption; he was soon after assigned as a parish priest in 1940 in Gl√∂kelberg in Austria. The Gestapo arrested Unzeitig on 21 April 1941 for defending Jews in his sermonsFischel, Jack / Ortmann, Susan M. (2004): The Holocaust and Its Religious Impact: A Critical Assessment and Annotated Bibliography, p. 101 and sent him to the Dachau concentration camp without a trial on 8 June 1941. While there he studied the Russian language in order to tend to the Eastern European prisoners and administered to all prisoners in general in his role as a pastor. In the autumn of 1944 he volunteered to help in catering to victims of typhoid but he soon contracted the disease himself. From prison he wrote to his sister: \\"Whatever we do, whatever we want, is surely simply the grace that carries us and guides us. God's almighty grace helps us overcome obstacles ... love doubles our strength, makes us inventive, makes us feel content and inwardly free. If people would only realize what God has in store for those who love Him!\\" Unzeitig died of the disease on 2 March 1945 and was cremated. His ashes were smuggled in secret to W√ºrzburg and he was hailed as the \\"Angel of Dachau\\". Beatification The process of beatification was held in W√ºrzburg and was conducted in a usual form since it was conducted in two forms: the case in which miracles would be required and another in which a recognition of \\"in odium fidei\\" would be required. The \\"nihil obstat\\" (nothing against) for the cause was granted on 5 September 1988 which allowed for the Congregation for the Causes of Saints to confer upon Unzeitig the title Servant of God. The process for heroic virtue was conducted from 26 July 1991 until June 1996; the process was declared valid on 11 January 2002. The Positio on his life and virtue was submitted to Rome for further investigation in 2005 and allowed for Pope Benedict XVI to proclaim him to be Venerable on 3 July 2009. The next step would have meant the recognition of a miracle for beatification and indeed a process for one such healing was initiated and validated on 2 June 2007; a medical board based in Rome even approved it on 25 March 2010. However a simultaneous process was conducted from 26 July 1991 to 25 May 2012 to investigate if Unzeitig qualified for a decree of martyrdom and the process was validated on 14 December 2012 with another Positio submitted to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints for additional investigation. Pope Francis approved those findings on 21 January 2016 declaring him to have been a martyr which would allow for his beatification, which was celebrated in Germany on 24 September 2016 with Cardinal Angelo Amato presiding on the pope's behalf.

Arrested in 2010, Davud was sentenced to eight years imprisonment in 2013. Early life Born Muhammed Rashidin, an ethnic Uyghur from the Xinjiang province in China, Davud came to Norway in 1999 as a refugee and was granted Norwegian citizenship in 2007. He changed his name to Mikael Davud the same year, in 2007. He has been described as deeply religious and to have refused to learn the Norwegian language for perceived religious purposes. In the 1990s he studied at a Quran school with alleged ties to the Taliban in Karachi, Pakistan. His activities in Pakistan and China's subsequent demand for extradition caused Davud to flee to Norway as a refugee in 1999. Arrest and conviction As part of the investigation of a suspected terror plot revealed in 2010, Davud was reportedly subjected to the \\"full arsenal of surveillance\\" of the Norwegian Police Security Service (PST). After cooperation with US and British intelligence, Davud was thought to be the leader of a Norwegian Al-Qaeda cell, with connections to the terror network responsible for the 2009 New York City Subway and United Kingdom plot. Evidence included series of emails, and having received bomb-making training abroad. He is suspected of having had direct contacts with the commander of the Turkistan Islamic Party (TIP), and Al-Qaeda tops like Saleh al-Somali thought to have ordered the attacks. Davud is alleged to have spent five months at an Al-Qaeda training camp in the Waziristan region in Pakistan from 2008 to 2009, although he himself claims to have received training in Iran and in Turkey as part of a solo terror plot to bomb the Chinese embassy in Oslo. Considered the ringleader, he was convicted to seven years in prison by the Oslo District Court for conspiracy to commit terror by plotting to bomb the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten and/or shoot cartoonist Kurt Westergaard. His solo terrorist claims, which would have avoided the stricter anti-terror law sentencing associated with conspiring with at least one other person, was dismissed by the court. His accomplice Shawan Bujak was sentenced to three and a half years, while the third suspect David Jakobsen was acquitted for terror charges due to having contacted and assisted PST. The verdicts were upheld following appeals to the Borgarting Court of Appeal and finally the Supreme Court of Norway, while Davud's sentence was raised to eight years. In 2016 Davud sued the Norwegian state, demanding to be released on probation as he had served two thirds of his sentence, claiming good behaviour.

Composition The opera, which was listed by Adayevskaya as her Op. 5, has a libretto by Rudolf Minzlow (also known as Muntzloff) (1811-1883) adapted by Georg von Schultz and translated from its original German into Russian by Peter Ivanovich Kalashnikov, who translated many lyrics for Adayevskaya's songs. The opera was composed in the period 1872/3, but was frequently revised by the composer up until the 1920s.H√ºsken, 309 The libretto in Russian was printed in St. Petersburg in 1873. The manuscript piano score bears the title, in German, Salomonida, die Tochter des Bojaren.H√ºsken, 310 Synopsis The opera is set in a castle near Novgorod at the beginning of the 16th century. The story is a fantasy based on the marriage of Tsar Vasili III and his historical wife, Solomonia Saburova. In the opera, Salomonida, the daughter of a boyar, is a victim of the prejudices of her father, who believes that his beautiful wife had once been unfaithful to him and has refused to even the evidence which would disprove this slander. He persuades his daughter that she is ugly, and even fills the castle with distorting mirrors to reinforce this idea in the mind of Salomonida. However, the Tsar is wandering in the neighbourhood disguised as a merchant. Seeing Salomonida, he immediately falls in love with her, and disabuses her (with the aid of a real mirror) of the lie about her ugliness. Demanding her hand from her father, Vasili also disproves the rumours about Salomonida's mother, and all ends happily.H√ºsken, 108 Performances No complete performances are documented. A soprano aria from the opera was performed in the mid 1870s in St.Petersburg by an unrecorded soloist with an orchestra conducted by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. On 23 April 1877, the overture and a number of extracts were performed at the Th√©√¢tre des Italiens in Paris. Participating were the alto Mlle.

For example, a forklift, loader or another truck.  Use  Tire manipulator is commonly developed and manufactured to customer specification because sizes of tires varies in every industry. In mining industry it is common to use tires with diameter over 3 meters. One of the biggest haulers in the world has tires with diameter of 4 meters. They can weigh over 2 000 kg. On the other hand, in agriculture tires are rarely greater than 2 meters, with weigh up to 1,000 kg. Companies started to use tire manipulators mostly because of safety and effectiveness. In the past, many people were injured, or even killed by heavy tires exploding or falling. It was also time consuming to change tires. Mainly for these two reasons companies realised there is a need for special equipment that can handle large tires and service heavy wheels.

Biography Williams was born in Surrey and would spend his teenage years in Llangynog in Carmarthenshire and Croydon in south London. Williams studied at Carmarthen Grammar School and would join the Croydon Advertiser after school, becoming the sports editor of the newspaper after a few years. Williams would subsequently work join the Daily Mail as a sub-editor having been recommended by his friend, the boxing commentator Harry Carpenter. Williams was appointed by the Daily Mail as its Manchester football correspondent after his predecessor, Eric Thompson, was killed in the Munich air disaster in 1958.

History There are controversies about its origins. The most credible hypothesis talks about how pilgrims brought this tradition thanks to the Camino de Santiago. Bowling is important in Asturian culture as it is mentioned in the Regional mythology, for example with the golden bowls of the xanes. The first reference of Asturian bowling, one of the oldest in Spain, dates back to 1495. Alonso de Quintanilla, major book-keeper of the Catholic Monarchs, complains Nuno Bernaldo de Quir√≥s of ruining the coat of arms during a bowling game at Campo de San Francisco in Oviedo. Thanks to this document, it is known that the pins were called byrlos and that betting was usual during the games. In the 18th century, according to Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos, in most villages and places of Asturias there's a bowling alley, a place where neighbors meet and play. During the 19th century and the early 20th, the Asturian bowling became the most widespread activity in the rural zones of the Region. Asturian bowling popularity grows during the 20th century with the creation of a Federation, that was dissolved during the Spanish Civil War. When it finished, competitions were reorganized and the Asturian Federation of Bowling was reestablished in 1962. Nowadays, due to the rural emigration, some bowling variations fell into disuse. Despite the emigration, the rise of interest in traditional culture is helping to keep the game, specially in the most played variations like cuatreada, birle or bolo celta. Variations *Cuatreada: the most extended variation, mainly played in the center and the East of Asturias. *Birle or bolo palma: played in the Eastern Asturias and Cantabria. *Bolo batiente or batiente rod√°u: played in the Western coast of Asturias. *Bolo of Tineo or bolo celta. *Bolo vaqueiro See also *Bowling Museum of Asturias References * Catalogue of the Bowling Museum of Asturias * Garc√≠a Acebal (E.): ‚ÄúDeportes‚Äù in Gran Enciclopedia Asturiana.

Pink capitalism is a targeted inclusion of the gay community which has acquired sufficient purchasing power (referred to in this context as pink money) to generate a market focused specifically on them. Examples of such targeted inclusion are bars and nightclubs, LGBT tourism, or specialized culture consumption. Zona Rosa como Territorio Queer. Entre la Empresarialidad, el Consumo y el Crisol de Identidades Gay. Universidad Aut√≥noma Metropolitana. November 2013. El mercado gay, sexy para hacer negocios. CNN Expansi√≥n. 1 February 2010. The concept is often invoked in discussions of the conflict between an increasing opportunity for homosocialization and the drive towards an assimilation of sexual diversity caused by companies' definition of new consumption patterns. The new body aesthetics and fashion trends set by advertising canons employing pink capitalism, for example, are sometimes argued to push gender-diverse communities towards socially accepted sexual standards.Cashing in on queers: from liberation to commodification. Canadian Online Journal of Queer Studies in Education. 2006. Capitalismo rosa: ser dinero o ser persona. Revista Hysteria. 16 March 2015.  Historical context  According to some authors, the global evolution of \\"pink capitalism\\" has been parallel to the development of modern capitalism in the West. Although historical evidence shows that diversity of sexualities has always existed, different periods in businesses' development targeted at the LGBTI community which have contributed to the construction of diverse sexual identities, can be distinguished.Out in the Market: A History of the Gay Market Segment in the United States. Journal of Macromarketing. June 2002. = Underground phase = LGBT Club Eldorado in Berlin during the 1920s Since the last decades of the 19th century, bars, cabarets, brothels and even some magazines targeted specifically at the LGBT community have existed in cities across Europe and the United States. Although members of the LGBTI community were still often publicly persecuted, the creation of these businesses corresponded to the beginning of the first drive for LGBTQ rights. This first LGBT movement was disintegrated between the First and Second World Wars and the rise of fascism in Europe. = Community- building phase = After the Second World War, Western culture was influenced by the homophobia of fascism. Although LGBTI consumption remained marginal, during this time various homophile associations were created to seek positive assessment of homosexuality by society through meetings, publications, or charity parties. These associations opposed behaviors associated with homosexuals deemed marginal and perverted, such as promiscuity, cruising, prostitution, saunas and erotic magazines.Gay Liberation Comes to France: The Front Homosexuel d‚ÄôAction R√©volutionnaire (FHAR) French history and civilization. 2005. = Integration in media culture phase = The Stonewall riots of 1969 marked the beginning of the LGBT liberation movement, characterized by increased public visibility of homosexuality, the aim of decriminalizing homosexuality, and increased social and political integration. The movement resulted in a negative social response, in part driven by the HIV/AIDS pandemic, which in turn led to the development of the queer movement by discriminated gay groups. Revoluci√≥n Queer en el Madrid de los 90. Tercera Informaci√≥n. 26 October 2007. During the 1990s, the discrimination of the gay community diminished, broadening LGBT people's access to formerly heteronormative jobs. This resulted in increased purchasing power for the LGBT community, or the creation of \\"pink money\\". Homosexuals in particular represented a large portion of this purchasing power. The trend is closely related to that of DINKs, couples with two incomes and no children. These processes are especially evident in the dynamics of gay neighborhoods, which attracted LGBT people with their affordability and the social security provided by living with other sexual minorities. These neighborhoods, after decreasing social stigma made them \\"trendy\\", then gradually underwent the gentrification process. Rising prices expelled the LGBT population that could not afford the new expenses.The 'gaytrification' effect: why gay neighbourhoods are being priced out. The Guardian. 13 January 2016.'Pink capitalism' can't avoid the rules. Green Left. 2 February 2000. An increasingly specialized market developed around LGBTI community in parallel with these other events. This market specifically serving the needs of the LGBTI community by selling services and products exclusively designed to meet their needs. Different companies and firms in turn began incorporating the defense of LGBT rights into their company policies and codes of conduct, and even financing LGBT events.Queer Anti-Capitalism: What's Left of Lesbian and Gay Liberation? Guilford Press. 2005. This kind of sociosexual relations appraisement is characteristic of gay modelling, which has its origin in the companies' new formation of a concentrated sexual market through rainbow capitalism:  Mechanisms  Although it is likely that without the political legitimacy given by the capitalist model of consumption some civil and political rights would not have been achieved, the acquisition of these has come at the expense of the integration of LGBT people in a heteronormative consumerist framework. In this sense, pink capitalism is similar to patriarchal postfordist capitalism, which has promoted the integration of women into productive labour while at the same time stimulating the incorporation of men to reproductive labor. \\"Es un enga√±o que el trabajo asalariado sea la clave para liberar a las mujeres\\".

This framework may promote a homogeneous and heteronormative ideal of the gay man, who has a certain beauty, a muscular and hyper-sexualized body, masculine behavior, career success and a specific purchasing power, establishing which bodies are desirable and which are not and marginalizing those do not fit this aesthetic model, even from the gay community itself:Consuming queer: the commodification of culture and its effects on social acceptance. Boston College Undergraduate Research. 2005. = Symbolic and material rights = While rainbow capitalism has resulted in the achievement of some symbolic rights (such as equal marriage or recognition of gender identity), these rights are subordinated to the people's resources, income and social position. In this regard, the trend the gay movement has not defined the political agenda, but instead has adapted heteropatriarchal and heteronormative capitalism into a new form of patriarchal capitalism. This new capitalism incorporates the social vision of family, property, body, economic organization and sexual experience from the heterosexual community. It has struggled for equal marriage, without questioning the concept of marriage, making the fight for equal marriage a goal of the LGBT movement that makes it seem there is nothing else to fight for.Homonormativity, Homonationalism and the Other 'Other'.

Historically, the political left has treated the LGBT movement (similarly to the treatment of feminism) as extravagance, without attending to the specific needs of non-heterosexual people, merely lumping them in with the rest of the working class. Lesbians, transsexuals and effeminate gays are relegated to unskilled jobs because they do not possess a certain patriarchal masculinity.Poverty in the Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Community.

Biography Francisco Garcia de Padilla was ordained a priest in the Order of Friars Minor. On November 15, 1504, he was appointed the first and only Bishop of Bayuna. The Diocese of Bayuna (located at Lares de Guahaba) was one of three dioceses - the other two being the Diocese of Magua, located at Concepci√≥n de La Vega, and the Archdiocese of Hyaguata, located at Santo Domingo - created in the New World by a Papal Bull Illius fulciti issued by Pope Julius II. The Bull never went into effect due to the objection of Ferdinand II of Aragon who opposed that the Bull gave the dioceses the right to receive a portion of the earnings from the gold and precious stones discovered in the territory. On August 8, 1511, Pope Julius II issued a new Papal Bull Pontifax Romanus which extinguished the previously granted ecclesiastical province and its dioceses and reassigned their delegated bishops. On 13 Aug 1511, Francisco Garcia de Padilla, Bishop Elect of Bayuna, was reassigned to the Diocese of Santo Domingo. His compatriots, Father Alonso Manso, Bishop Elect of Magua, was reassigned to the Diocese of Puerto Rico; and Pedro Su√°rez de Deza, Bishop Elect of Hyaguata, was reassigned to the Diocese of Concepci√≥n de la Vega. On 2 May 1512, he was consecrated bishop. He served as Bishop of Santo Domingo until his death in 1515.

Following the 1975 shutdown of the human rights organization in response to a political offensive by the Pinochet regime, Precht, then Vicar, allowed the ex-employees to issue grant requests to European commissions. One of the European applications was a project to create a news agency about international news. This request by Arturo Navarro, an ex-Comit√© employee, resulted in a grant of seven thousand dollars, and APSI was born. APSI was published on a weekly basis. Due to the climate of censorship in Chile the magazine focused initially on international news. APSI was published with support of the Popular Unitary Action Movement until late 1978.

The novel was shortlisted for the 2015 Carnegie Medal and received a Michael L. Printz Honor Award in 2016. The first story is written in short lines, in a writing style similar to poetry (though it does not rhyme). It is written from the perspective of a cave girl. The second quartet describes the life of a girl living in a small village in medieval Europe, who is later accused of witchcraft. The third quarter is about a man who has lost his wife and is conducting research on a mental asylum, and the final story is from the perspective of a man in the far future who is controlling a ship holding 500 people in deep sleep. They are headed for a distant planet and on this journey, the man discovers that he has been victim to misinformation on the government's behalf. It ends with the man landing on a planet he stumbles across during the ship's journey, and it is implied this planet is that on which the first quartet took place. each of the stories is differently written An author's note at the beginning of the book tells the reader that the four stories may be read in any of the four different orders, with each making a slightly different type of sense.

Recordings  The song was recorded by Jamaican musician Sam Manning in the mid-1920s and Lord Invader (of \\"Rum and Coca-Cola\\" fame) in 1946. A different version with a similar name, \\"Slide Mongoose Slide\\" was recorded in the Bahamas in 1935, performed by the Nassau String Band. The songs are clearly related but the version recorded in the Bahamas has notable differences, not only are the lyrics different but also the singing style and melody, it is in the style of other Bahamian folk songs recorded in 1935, like Bimini Gal, Bellamina, and Abaco is a Pretty place.https://www.allmusic.com/album/deep-river-of-song- bahamas-1935-vol-2-ring-games-and-round-dances-mw0000220061 Other Caribbean artists to record the song include The Gaylads, Aston \\"Family Man\\" Barrett, Ahadu & Light of Saba, Beverley's Allstars, Harry Belafonte, Max Woiski Sr. (under the alternative song title \\"Ba-Anansie\\"), Ernest Ranglin and Monty Alexander.

Born in Greater Manchester, Brodie studied chemical pathology to a doctoral level in Sheffield and was awarded a fellowship sponsored by National Institutes of Health. After 17 years of working in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts on oral contraceptives with Harry Brodie, whom she married, she switched focus to the effects of the oestrogen-producing enzyme, aromatase, on breast cancer. Brodie managed to get an aromatase inhibitor into a limited clinical trial in breast cancer patients in London, which had such a profound effect that it led to Novartis-sponsored trials, the development of formestane, the first aromatase inhibitor, eventually marketed in 1994. Brodie's work has been hailed \\"as among the most important contributions to cancer cure.\\" Early life and education Brodie was born Angela Hartley on 28 September 1934 in Oldham, Lancashire, England.Geoff Watts Obituary Angela Mary Hartley Brodie The Lancet. 12 August 2017 Her father, Herbert Hartley, was an industrial chemist working in polyurethanes who inspired her interest in science. Brodie was educated at a Quaker boarding school before studying at University of Sheffield, where she earned a degree in biochemistry. After leaving university, she took a job in a blood bank before finding a laboratory position as a research assistant in the Department of Hormone Research at Manchester's Christie Hospital Whilst there, she concentrated on oestrogen- dependent breast cancer for two years before joining the University of Manchester to study for her doctorate. In 1961, Brodie received her PhD in chemical pathology from the University of Manchester, where her research focussed primarily on the hormone aldosterone. Career, 1962‚Äì2016 As a result of her doctorate, she was awarded a National Institutes of Health sponsored, 1-year post-doctoral training fellowship, at Clark University and the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts. She researched at Worcester Foundation between 1962 and 1979. There, she worked initially on the oral contraceptive usage of aldosterone, alongside a number of scientists. This included Harry Brodie, whom she married in 1964, and Mika Hayano, who died of breast cancer in her 40s. Over the next few years, Brodie took time away from her work when her two sons, Mark and John Hartley Brodie (1970‚Äì2006) were born. When Brodie returned to work in 1971, she joined her husband's lab as staff scientist, moving into breast cancer research, especially its link with oestrogen and an enzyme that produces it, aromatase. They developed several steroidal aromatase inhibitors, she focused on 4-OHA. In 1979, she moved to Maryland, encouraged by Cornelia Channing to join the University of Maryland School of Medicine, first as an associate professor. Later she became Professor of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics along with an appointment in the Department of Physiology and a researcher role in the University of Maryland Greenebaum Cancer Center. She presented a paper on her aromatase inhibitors at a Rome conference in 1980, which led to collaboration with Charles Coombes, a British oncologist to start clinical trials on the inhibitor‚Äì4-hydroxyandrostenedione (4-OHA) in Royal Marsden Hospital. Coombes gave 4-OHA to 11 women in 1982, with 4 seeing a dramatic improvement. The results were encouraging enough that Novartis was willing to fund further clinical trials. 4-OHA, named Formestane, was the first aromatase inhibitor used on breast cancer patients and proved to be a significant improvement on tamoxifen, the standard cancer drug used to treat oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women. The drug was first marketed in 1994. In 2005, Brodie received the prestigious Kettering Prize, the first woman to receive the award, though she did not know she had been nominated. At the time, she was on the editorial board of multiple professional journals, reviewed grant applications for the NIH, had published over 200 papers in peer-reviewed journals, and was a member of the integration for the US Army Department of Defense Army Breast Cancer Program. In 2016, she retired from the University of Maryland. Personal life and death According to co workers Brodie \\"was kind and generous but not weak. She knew how to stand up for herself and push her own agenda.\\" She \\"had a steely determination combined with a positive can-do attitude.\\" Brodie's hobbies were horseback riding, hiking and gardening.In Memoriam: Angela Hartley Brodie, Ph.D. 7 June 2017 University of Maryland School of Medicine In 2006, her son John, died from accidental drowning. She never intended to retire, and collaborated with Vincent Njar on aromatase inhibitors in prostate cancer for the rest of her life. She died on 7 June 2017 at the age of 82 at her home in Fulton, Maryland, from complications due to Parkinson's disease.

ABMA was initially a group under the Army Ordnance Missile Command (AOMC). On 11 December 1961, ABMA was abolished and the personnel and mission moved directly to AOMC. The United States Army Missile Command (MICOM) was activated at Redstone Arsenal on 23 May 1962; Pershing and other project offices were transferred. On 31 January 1977, MICOM was split into the United States Army Missile Materiel Readiness Command (MIRCOM) and the United States Army Missile Research and Development Command (MIRADCOM). On 1 July 1979, MIRCOM and MIRADCOM were disestablished and combined again into MICOM. On 1 May 1987, the Program Executive Office (PEO) for Fire Support was established at Redstone Arsenal and the PPMO was transferred. After the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) between the United States and the USSR became effective on 1 June 1988, the PPMO returned to MICOM in March 1989. Responsibility for Pershing project management was placed under the direction of the newly established MICOM Weapon Systems Management Directorate on 27 August 1989.

As of 2017 it was in Phase II clinical trials. Miravirsen had been given by subcutaneous injection in early clinical trials as of 2017. It is antisense to a human microRNA called miR-122. miR-122 ferries an argonaute protein to 5'-UTR region of viral RNA, where it binds, protecting the RNA from being destroyed by normally present nucleases; by binding to miR-122, miravirsen removes that protection and the virus RNA can be destroyed. There is some evidence that the 5'-UTR region mutates under repeated exposure to miravirsen. Miravirsen is a modified oligonucleotide consisting of a chain of 15 nucleotides, the base sequence of which is designed to selectively bind to miR-122. Seven of the 15 sugar units are deoxyriboses, and the other eight are riboses with an additional bridge between the 2' oxygen and the 4' carbon atoms; this makes the molecule a locked nucleic acid.

Built in 1858 to a design by local architect Calvin Ryder, it is one of the first Second Empire houses to be built in the state of Maine. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 31, 1972. Description and history The house is located in a residential area northwest of downtown Bangor, on the northeast side of Court Street opposite Boynton Street, and next door to the historic Samuel Farrar House. It is a 2-1/2 story wood-framed structure, with a flared mansard roof, and a flushboarded exterior that has been scored and treated to resemble stone. The roof is pierced by a dormers, most of which have segmented-arch tops. The center section of the three-bay front facade projects slightly, and is topped by a large dormer with a round-arch window at its center. The entrance is sheltered by an ornately decorated porch with square posts and a bracketed and dentillated cornice. First floor sash windows are topped by bracketed cornices, while second floor windows are framed by eared hoods. It was built in 1858 for William Blake, a wealthy Bangor merchant, by his brother-in-law, Boston architect Calvin Ryder. It is probably one of the first buildings of the Second Empire style built in the state, and typifies the high-style houses built for Bangor's elite in the years before the American Civil War. The house now houses professional offices.

The party failed in an attempt to form an alliance with the Kenya African Union in 1950, but the two combined to oppose plans by the Elector's Union to maintain European control of the colony. The organisation was renamed the Kenya Indian Congress (KIC) in 1952 after Indians in Tanganyika formed the Asian Association. In 1960 the Kenya Freedom Party (KFP) was formed by a group of Indians who believed that the KIC was not sufficiently supportive of independence.Maxon & Ofcansky, p167 General elections the following year saw the KIC win three of the 53 elected seats in the Legislative Council with 1.2% of the vote, whilst the KFP won two seats.

Cretaceous strata This sandy bank has been exposed by the River Wey as it cuts through the Upper Greensand stratum (mid Cretaceous) near Shalford During the Early Cretaceous epoch (from about 145 to about 100 million years ago) Surrey alternated between a fresh-to-brackish water embayment depositing Hastings Beds and Weald Clay, comprising shales and mudstones that are often finely banded. Offshore muds (now shales and mudstones) of the Atherfield Clay were deposited followed by shallow marine sands of the Hythe, Sandgate and Folkestone Beds. Where not eroded to lower heights, there is then a marine layer of the sands of the Hythe Beds topped by chert seen on today's remaining Greensand Hills. Instead of the mudstone and sandstone-producing three beds mentioned before Hythe Beds, west of Dorking the marine Bargate Beds made of calcareous (chalk and limestone-rich) sandstone were deposited. The Folkestone Beds contain phosphatic and iron-rich nodules, which locally yield a rich fossil fauna of marine shells. Then under even deeper seas, Gault Clay and the Upper Greensand were deposited. The Gault Clay contains phosphate-rich nodules in discrete bands and has a rich marine fauna with abundant ammonites, bivalves and gastropods. The Upper Greensand comprises a variety of sediments with fine silts at the base giving way upwards into sandstones. Betchworth Quarry (Upper Cretaceous strata) on the south-facing scarp slope of Box Hill 90 million years ago the North Downs hard chalk was deposited, a white limestone which is over 95% calcium carbonate. It contains thin beds of marl and nodules of flint, either scattered or in bands. The North Downs extending from Farnham to Dover, Kent are formed by this chalk. They now have an often white, almost vertical south-facing slope. Cenozoic strata Just before the Paleogene, which included the mass-extinction event of the non-avian dinosaurs, sea levels dropped, exposing Sussex and Kent, and the marine Upnor Beds were deposited in Surrey. In the Paleogene, Southern England rose slightly, and the seas retreated, and the reddish and mottled clays of the Reading Beds were deposited by a large river sand delta system. Later, a rise in sea level, around 50 million years ago, caused widespread deposition, until 2 million years ago, of the London Clay across the County. The London Clay is a bluish-grey marine clay with isolated pockets of fossils especially where chalkier. The youngest part of the London Clay is known as the Claygate Beds and occurs widely in Surrey. This even sandier material represents a transition between the deeper water London Clay and the succeeding shallower water, possibly estuarine, Bagshot Sand. Major climate changes in Britain causing sea level changes in the last 2.58 million years, with mini Ice Ages, the ice sheets did not extend to Surrey but sand and gravel deposits swept towards the fledgling River Thames were spread in all lower parts. Gravel terraces at various heights on the valley sides are the remnants of successive floodplains, the highest terrace being the oldest and the lowest the youngest. The most prominent terraces mark the former levels of the Thames in north Surrey. Along tributary slopes, a deposit, head, forms the main sediment of latest age. Head comprises angular pieces of rock and soil derived locally from the extensive frost-shattering of rocks and the subsequent movement of this material down valley slopes. Large areas of clay-with-flints, derived from the weathering of material overlying the present day chalk, occur across the North Downs. One particular suite of sediments that occur in the Guildford vale is known as the Headley Formation and comprises gravel and sand on top of the chalk. These sediments contain marine fossils and were probably derived from erosion of the Greensand and Tertiary rocks during the Paleogene. A large geological fold, the Wealden anticline, is the major rock structure in the county.Natural England - Geodiversity This anticline was formed by the Alpine orogeny about 25 to 12 million years ago.  Soils  Mickleham is built with locally quarried flint and clunch arranged in a checkerboard pattern, in an homage to the flag of Surrey. The northeast of the county, such as the north of Tandridge (district), is in the wide part of the North Downs. Thus from the east, Tatsfield has two western pockets of slightly acid, loamy soils with free drainage otherwise has the expected shallow, lime-rich soil over chalk or limestone of the escarpment with lower parts of the escarpment summit here, where that topsoil has eroded, having slightly acid, loamy and clayey soils with impeded drainage soil. Westward, the shallow lime is found all the way along the North Downs to the western border, past Guildford only a few hundred metres narrow to Farnham Castle and even Dippenhall, the latter accompaniment is found on both sides only to Buckland, well before Dorking. A horseshoe of land including the rise north of Godstone of Godstone Hill that leads to the escarpment is free draining lime-rich loamy soil (i.e. alkaline). Continuing with the Downs, in a broad band, the far northern type soil slopes such as near Croydon come across the Surrey border at Banstead and Ewell, which is free draining, slightly acid but base-rich soils, producing extremely fertile pastures and deciduous woodland, which becomes the edging for both sides of the high escarpment at Box Hill and is just found for a brief while in a middle section in Polesden Lacey then throughout the northern slope carrying on westward. Chipstead, Banstead and Tadworth have the first free draining slightly acid loamy soil that tops the wider downs to Guildford and is found around Dorking and the across the Vale of Holmesdale north of the Greensand Hills. Equally it is this topsoil north of the Thames across Spelthorne (such as around Ashford) and west of the Thames in the east of Runnymede (such as around Thorpe): here the land is flat flood plain, mostly silt mixed with lime-rich London Clay.Cranfield University National Soil Resources Institute Between the Thames and the North Downs the land is overall slightly lower than south of the Downs but is less in the current flood plain, drained by the tributaries mentioned. There is more loam persisting the further from the alluvial plain of the Thames and tributaries; from the southbank at Thames Ditton (near Hampton Court southwest to Ripley, Send and Old Woking is still more free draining slightly acid loamy soil. Impeded drainage but rarely waterlogged soil features in Addlestone, north Knaphill and around Perry Hill, Worplesdon while Chobham lies in loamy soils with naturally high groundwater producing wet acid meadow and woodland edged by streamside fen/peat marshy brooklands. Heath: in Esher, Oxshott, Weybridge, Wisley, all around Woking, Brookwood, Deepcut, Pirbright, Frimley, Lightwater, Camberley, Chobham Common, Virginia Water and Ottershaw is naturally wet, very acid sandy and loamy soil which is just 1.9% of English soil and 0.2% of Welsh soil, which gives rise to pines and coniferous landscapes, such as pioneered at Wentworth and Foxhills estate (now spa, hotel, restaurant and golf club) by pro-American Independence statesman Charles James Fox. South, but not beyond the North Downs and to the south of the Greensand Ridge is slowly permeable loamy/clayey slightly acid but base-rich soil forming a band from Ewell and Claygate through Leatherhead, Little Bookham, the north side of Guildford to Farnham, whereas South of the Greensand is some thick (with some areas of free then poor drainage around East Grinstead/Felbridge). The Greensand ridge itself has the heath soil above and zones of slightly acid only freely draining sandy soils, which make those areas more densely wooded such as Thursley, Brook, Churt, Seale, Runfold and Puttenham.

The \\"corpus\\" or figure of Christ, was probably made in Winchester, and is in walrus ivory; the titulus and medallions are in cloisonn√© enamel, and apparently also English. The body of the reliquary, because of a technical \\"trick\\" in the gold filigree, is thought to be German, around the same date, probably from the area of Aachen and Essen.Wilson, 194 The V&A; says \\"the cross is one of the rare surviving pieces which give substance to descriptions in contemporary documentary sources of the sumptuous church furnishings of pre-Conquest England. The enamels are unique in Anglo-Saxon art and may have been made by an English goldsmith familiar with German work. The wood core of the cross was perhaps regarded as a relic of the True Cross. It is most unlikely because of its size and weight, that it was made to be worn as a pectoral cross and more probable that the suspension loop allowed it to hang above an altar or shrine.\\"  Description  The body of the cross is of cedar wood, covered with sheets of gold, the back with repousse decoration now badly crumpled and flattened, the front decorated with filigree work, enamels and an ivory corpus of the figure of Christ. This is carved in walrus ivory. Haloed and crowned, the bearded Christ wears an elaborately pleated loin-cloth, knotted through the folded girdle. The head leans towards the right shoulder and the long hair falls in several plaits onto the shoulders. The figure is held in place by golden nails through the palms. The titulus above Christ and four medallions with emblems of the Evangelists are of cloisonn√© enamel. The back of the cross shows the Holy Lamb and the emblems of the Evangelists in repouss√© or beaten work. The height of the cross is 18.5 cm, the width 13.7 cm, the depth 2.6 cm, the weight 0.22 kg. The height of the figure is 12.2 cm, the width 10.9 cm. In 1926, during cleaning work, a human finger, perhaps female, was found in a cavity underneath the corpus. A fragmentary and not totally legible inscription around the edge of the cross seems to list the relics of saints once contained in the cavity beneath the ivory figure of Christ. : 'IHS NAZARENUS' : RE(LIQVIE LIGNI) ....VLQ DE...O ET CAMIN....(IHS.XPS) AMD NIS//RV....EDA....DI....DI SIMEONIS ET MAR Despite Papal disapproval of the dismemberment of saints, a finger relic was by no means unusual in Anglo-Saxon England: King Athelstan bestowed one third of his extensive collection of relics to the monastery of St. Mary and St. Peter at Exeter in AD 932. The gift included a finger, purportedly that of Mary Magdalene. David Wilson points to the close similarity between the figure on the cross and that in a tinted drawing in the Ramsey Psalter, dated 980-1000.Wilson, 194-195 Notes References  * V&A; page, with more photos, and bibliography * Otto der Grosse: Magdeburg und Europa, herausgegeben von Matthias Puhle (Mainz, 2001) pp 434‚Äì436 Cat no.

It is part of the Western municipal district and covers an area of 30.3 km¬≤.  Geography  The Blockland is part of the marshes of the Hamme, a tributary of the Weser River, and the W√ºmme (its main source), both of which are tidal rivers. The average elevation is 1 meter above sea level. Without the dikes along the Hamme and the W√ºmme, it would be flooded twice a day. Since its cultivation in the 12th century, the Blockland is drained by a network of parallel trenches which cut the area into blocks, giving the area its name.  Population and landuse  The density of population is quite low, 14 inhabitants per square kilometre. The settlements are concentrated along the dike. Most of the land use is Greenland economy of pastures and meadows.www.statistik-bremen.de on Blockland For the inhabitants of Bremen, the Blockland is an important leisure resort. Cycling, hiking and skating on the small roads at the dikes and along Kleine W√ºmme, an affluent of the W√ºmme, are popular activities. The Kleine W√ºmme and the limiting waterways of W√ºmme and Kuhgraben are used for paddling. And if there is enough frost, the ancient navigation canal of Semkenfahrt becomes a natural ice-rink.

When Thomas Lloyd was removed from command of the garrison at St. John's in October 1704, Moody was left in charge. In January 1705, Moody's men at Fort William were attacked by French troops from Placentia; although heavily outnumbered, they were able to hold off the enemy.

When Britain was given control of Placentia by the Treaty of Utrecht, Moody was promoted to lieutenant-colonel and appointed deputy governor of Placentia; at the time, Placentia fell under the control of the governor of Nova Scotia, Francis Nicholson. Moody was able to purchase the estates of the departing French residents; this brought him into conflict with English fishing captains who visited the area and who used areas on shore to store and dry their catch.

He is popularly known as one of the officers who led the \\"Cry of Nueva Ecija\\" on September 2, 1896, and together with General Mariano Llanera commanded 3,000 guerilla troops who captured and momentarily held the provincial capitol of Nueva Ecija in the town of Factoria (now San Isidro). He is one of the three Fathers of The Cry of Nueva Ecija, along with Mariano Llanera and Manuel Tinio. Early life and education The ancestral \\"bahay-na-sim\\" where Pantale√≥n Valmonte was born Valmonte was born into an old and illustrious family at the so-called \\"Bahay- na-Sim,\\" in what is now Valmonte Street in Gapan City, Nueva Ecija on July 26, 1856, the son of Basilio Valmonte and Rosa Rufino. Basilio's father, Don Bartolom√© dela Cruz Valmonte, was Gapan's first capitan municipal, appointed in 1747, just 15 years after Gapan was proclaimed a local administrative unit in 1732. One of Basilio's sisters, Juana, was the original owner of the only Spanish reproduction of the image of La Divina Pastora in the Philippines, which arrived in the country through the Galleon Trade. The image is the object of an annual pilgrimage to the National Shrine of La Virgen Divina Pastora in Gapan, and is one of the patrons of the parish (the others being the Three Kings) since the 1800s, though it remained privately held in the home of the Valmontes until 1986. According to a descendant, journalist Ramon Valmonte, the family later adopted the surname \\"Valmonte\\" for its poetic meaning, being a conjunction of the Spanish words \\"valle\\" (\\"valley\\") and \\"monta√±a\\" (\\"mountain\\"). Valmonte's baptismal certificate Valmonte enrolled at the Universidad de Santo Tom√°s (UST) in 1871, before transferring to Ateneo Municipal de Manila. He was a contemporary of Philippine national hero Jose Rizal during his time at the Ateneo and might have belonged to the same class. This was because according to Pantaleon's son Joaquin, Rizal had paid the family a visit in the early years. Rizal would make a reference to Gapan's secondary patron saint, La Divina Pastora, in the chapter \\"A Cochero's Christmas Eve\\" of his novel El FilibusterismoJos√© Rizal (1996), El filibusterismo: Subversion, translated by Soledad L. Locsin and edited by Raul L. Locsin. University of Hawaii Press, Honolulu. Retrieved January 22, 2016. Capitan Municipal Valmonte's appointment as capitan municipal of Gapan Valmonte was appointed by Nueva Ecija Governor Antonio Diaz de Cendreras as Capitan Municipal (mayor) of Gapan on January 11, 1895. As a municipal head, Valmonte was able to ingratiate himself with Spanish authorities, to the extent that he named the nearby village of Manikling as San Leonardo after Diaz de Cendreras's successor and frequent house guest Leonardo Bal. Yet he was at odds with the clergy, owing to his refusal to conform to the custom of kissing the hand of the parish priest. When the provincial government discovered the existence of the Katipunan and began arresting its members, Bal found Valmonte's name on the list. Bal only went as far as to caution the mayor in honor of their friendship, never guaranteeing his safety from arrest. When Valmonte learned of the detention of several local Katipunan members including Mamerto Natividad and Marcus Ventus, he conferred with the capitan municipal of Cabiao Mariano Llanera to do something for their colleagues. Role in the revolution According to a version attributed to historian Leopoldo Serrano, the Filipinos, headed by Valmonte and Llanera, organized themselves on September 2, 1896 at Sitio Pulu, about 5 kilometers from Factoria, choosing 500 men for the initial attack, and employing the Cabiao Brass Band to disguise the military movement as a peaceful march meant to gain the release of those already arrested by the Spanish. There, the secretly armed groups from Cabiao and Gapan coalesced and unleashed a ferocious assault upon the Spaniards, who defended themselves in the Casa Tribunal and the Arsenal, as well as in other government buildings and in the houses of Spanish residents. The revolutionaries also freed incarcerated Katipuneros and ransacked government coffers. The Spanish commander of the guardia civil, Joaquin Machorro, was killed on the first day of battle. At the end of three days of fighting, the Spanish were driven out, and the revolutionaries initially prevailed before colonizers were able to retake the provincial capital and drive the revolutionaries as far out as Candaba, Pampanga in the south, San Miguel de Mayumo, Bulacan in the east and Jaen, Nueva Ecija in the west. The uprising and its attendant \\"Cry of Nueva Ecija\\" earned the province its place in the Philippine flag as one of the eight rays of the sun, each ray representing a province that revolted against Spain. According to other accounts Journalist, professor and family chronicler Ramon Valmonte (Pantaleon Valmonte's great-grandnephew) wrote a differing account based on the recollections of his grand-uncle Joaquin, who was mayor of Gapan during the Commonwealth period and was Pantaleon's youngest child. His account points to the fact that the short interval between Valmonte's capture, detention and execution puts into question the veracity of the three-day fighting during the \\"First Cry of Nueva Ecija.\\" According to Joaquin, the plan of the September 2 delegation to Factoria was purely to negotiate the release of the arrested Katipunan members. A brass band was brought as an introductory present to Machorro who was a known music lover. Like Val, Machorro also frequented the Valmonte residence as guest during Sunday luncheons. Prof. Valmonte describes the attack as told by his grand-uncle: Capture and execution The Mariano Llanera Shrine marker acknowledging Gen. Valmonte's participation in the First Cry of Nueva Ecija. On September 3, Valmonte, who did not go into hiding thinking he had no reason to do so, was apprehended in Gapan along with his deputy mayor Epifanio Ramos by Spanish soldiers and Filipino volunteers. They were jailed in Factoria, and on September 4 were taken to Barrio Calaba where they were shot to death and their bodies dumped in an unmarked grave that has never been found. Eleven other Gapan officials were rounded up and condemned to summary executions. The municipal treasurer Emilio Jacinto (not the national hero of the same name), along with the scribe Manuel del Corro and councilors Leocadio Liwag, Severino Tiangco, Valentin Liwag, Ramon Tinawin and Saturnino Magno was taken across the river from the old marketplace and shot to death. Juanario Malgapo, described as \\"head of the cordilleras\\" and Honorio Malgapo, cordillera, were arrested in a rice field and hacked to pieces. Faustino delos Reyes, director-secretario, was shot and killed in a rice field beside the town cemetery. Quintin Tinio, justice of the peace, was killed by a volunteer in adjacent Pe√±aranda town. Llanera managed to escape the carnage and continued fighting against the colonizers‚Äîfirst the Spanish, and then the Americans. Commemoration The Inang Bayan Shrine In honor of Valmonte and fellow patriots now called the \\"Thirteen Martyrs of Gapan,\\" the townspeople built a memorial called ‚ÄúInang Bayan‚Äù in 1938 at a junction in Barangay San Vicente, Gapan, where their names were inscribed on marble slabs that were eventually vandalized. The main roads of Gapan were named after them, with the former main street beside the river, where Pantaleon Valmonte‚Äôs house used to stand, becoming known as Valmonte Street. Valmonte, along with Tinio, Llanera, etc. who fought and died during the Revolution, was honored by Masonic District RIII-D in a ceremony at the Cabanatuan City Hall commemorating the Philippines' 112th Independence on June 12, 2010. Valmonte was raised and passed at Penaranda‚Äôs Masonic Triangle No. 80, which also counted among its lodge brethren fellow revolutionists Mamerto Natividad Sr., Domingo Cecilio, Marcos Ventus, Epifanio Ramos, Cipriano Sarile, and Teodorico Lagonera.

Plot Jo runs ‚ÄúBelgica‚Äù, an artistic pub in Ghent where all kind of people are welcome. His brother Frank is shareholder in a second-handed car company. The brothers are estranged due to their abusive, alcoholic father. One evening, Frank visits the pub of his brother. As he likes it he decides to come over more. When the adjacent warehouse is on sale Frank convinces Jo to buy it, to convert it into a dance hall and to restyle ‚ÄúBelgica‚Äù. Frank and Jo decides to become partners with each 50% of the shares. To get the money, Frank sells the shares of his own company, but due to a cashflow issue his business partner can only pay a small part of it, but they have an oral agreement the remaining sum will follow in a few months. The new dance room is inspected. The inspector gives a permission for a maximum total of 80 persons as there is only one legal emergency exit which ends up in a narrow alley. Frank bribes the inspector by giving him a huge amount of dark money. The restyled \\"Belgica\\" is a success and many employees, mostly friends, are hired. One evening, a recurring riot starts a fight. He is overwhelmed by Frank and his \\"security staff\\" and locked into a room until the arrival of the police. The police tells them it is illegal to confine a person and has a proposal: if Jo and Frank do not charge the riot, the police will turn a blind eye about what's going on in \\"Belgica\\" referring to the black money, supposed drug use... It is a fact drugs are used, even by the owners and staff. Some time later, the riot turns up again and Frank beats him up. Manu, who is responsible for security, does not approve Franks action, and resigns. Frank convinces Jo to hire a professional security team instead to rely on their friends. His ulterior motive is to deny access to riots, people from lower class, ... resulting in the rejection of many regular customers. The profits are lower than expected thus drinks become more expensive. Frank makes more and more one-sided decisions. He opens a VIP bar on the second floor as this will raise revenues but he neglects the additional costs. As ‚ÄúBelgica‚Äù is not anymore what Jo wanted to reach, he decides to quit and wants to sell his shares to Frank based upon the value according to the bookkeeping system. Frank is frustrated as he invested much black money in the business which is now neglected. Anyway, Frank agrees and calls his former partner only to find out he absconded meaning Frank will never get the remaining money. Ultimately, Frank quits. Jo continues with the pub with two investors. Frank and his wife build a house with the money they got by selling his shares. Jo returns to his pub but it has lost its name, glamour and customers.

The main deity has three faces in which Goddess Saraswathi devi is seeing her face in the mirror. The temple is carved from a single stone , Eka sila. Bhairavakona is 43 km from Udayagiri, a town in Nellore district. APSRTC's Udayagiri depot provides buses to Seetharamapuram which is 15 km from Bhairavakona.From Seetharamapuram one can take share Auto's to Bhairavakona. This place is home to an ancient Shiva temple. There is waterfall which falls from a height of 200 metres and there are eight temples carved in the hill there. An interesting feature that attracts devotees to Bhairavakona is that the moonlight falls on the idol of goddess Parvati at a temple there on Kartika Poornima day.it is a beautiful water fall in prakasam district. An important notice to the pilgrims, as the tourism authorities has been developing the area recently, those who travel there in unseason should take care of food provisions. It is hard to stay there at night although there are Panchayat guest rooms.(only 2).

She was a member of the Stuttgart Opera, later a voice teacher at the Musikhochschule Stuttgart. She performed at International festivals and recorded with conductors such as Marcel Couraud.  Career  Born in Regensburg, Sailer initially lived and worked in Ansbach as a kindergarten teacher after her marriage. Her talent at singing was discovered by chance and she began her career singing in operettas in the late 1940s. Her first performances of opera roles were for radio broadcasts by the N√ºrnberger Studio of the Bayerischer Rundfunk. These performances led to her engagement as a resident artist at the Stuttgart Opera in 1952. She toured to Paris with the company in 1954 and 1955, performing at the Paris Opera roles such as Marzelline in Beethoven's Fidelio. She took part in the premiere of Werner Egk's Der Revisor in May 1957 at the Schwetzingen Festival, performing the part of Marja. The production, with Fritz Wunderlich in the leading role, was staged by G√ºnther Rennert and conducted by the composer. Sailer performed the part also at the Vienna State Opera, conducted by Michael Gielen. She appeared at the Glyndebourne Festival in 1958 as Gretchen in Albert Lortzing's Der Wildsch√ºtz, and at the Salzburg Festival in 1959 as the First Lady in Mozart's Die Zauberfl√∂te. In May 1966 she sang in the premiere of Hermann Reutter's Der Tod des Empedokles, again at the Schwetzingen Festival. She also appeared in several lyric soprano opera roles at the Bavarian State Opera during her career. Sailer performed regularly in concert, singing Lieder recitals and oratorio, among others. She recorded several Bach cantatas, his Magnificat and Easter Oratorio with Marcel Couraud. She recorded his Mass in B minor with Hans Grischkat, and with Fritz Werner more cantatas and the St John Passion. Sailer was a voice teacher at the Musikhochschule Stuttgart. She died in Stuttgart.

The building was owned by a wealthy fashion designer, Paul Poiret, and the gallery was used for Poiret's \\"Salon d'Antin\\" exhibitions. The gallery showed the work of avant-garde artists such as Picasso, Modigliani, Gauguin, Matisse, Chagall, and Dufy. History In 1911 Henri Barbazanges rented part of the property at 109 Rue du Faubourg Saint Honor√© from his friend, the fashion designer Paul Poiret, and opened the Gallery Barbazanges with financial assistance from L. C. Hodebert. The gallery would exhibit contemporary art. The building was beside Poiret's eighteenth century mansion at 26 Avenue d'Antin. The Galerie Barbazanges leased the ground floor, with a total area of about . Behind the front room there were a number of smaller rooms leading to a room without windows, but with a glass roof high. This large back room may have been built by Barbazanges when he took control in 1911. A door was made between Poiret's mansion and one of the rooms of the gallery. Poiret reserved the right to hold two exhibitions each year. One of these was L'Art Moderne en France from 16‚Äì31 July 1916, organized by Andr√© Salmon. Salmon gave \\"26 Avenue d'Antin\\" as the address and called the exhibition the \\"Salon d'Antin\\". Artists included Pablo Picasso, who showed Les Demoiselles d'Avignon for the first time, Amedeo Modigliani, Mo√Øse Kisling, Manuel Ortiz de Z√°rate, and Marie Vassilieff. Poiret also arranged concerts of new music at the gallery, often in combination with exhibitions of new art. The 1916 Salon d'Antin included readings of poetry by Max Jacob and Guillaume Apollinaire, and performances of work by Erik Satie, Darius Milhaud, Igor Stravinsky, and Georges Auric. Satie's Musique d'ameublement (furniture music) was performed in public for the first time at the gallery on 8 March 1920 during intermissions of a play by Max Jacob. Paul Gauguin ‚Äì Self-Portrait with Halo and Snake In 1919 the gallery purchased Paul Gauguin's Self-Portrait with Halo and Snake from Fran√ßois Norgelet. The painting was later acquired by Lord Ivor Charles Spencer Churchill. In 1923 Pierre Matisse, son of Henri Matisse and Am√©lie Parayre, came to work at the gallery to gain experience in the art market before moving to New York in 1924. In March 1923 Raoul Dufy and Jean √âmile Laboureur organized the first Exposition du Groupe des peintres-graveurs ind√©pendents at the gallery. A second exhibition of this group was held in 1924. Another of Poiret's exhibitions, also organized by Salmon, was La Collection particuli√®re de M. Paul Poiret, from 26 April to 12 May 1923. Barbazanges retired in 1923, but Hodebert continued to run the gallery under the original name. Advertisements in 1926 also called it the Galerie Barbazanges-Hodebert. In the spring of 1928 the gallery moved to 174 Rue du Faubourg St. Honor√©, where the Galerie Camille Hodebert had been open since 1922. In 1929 this gallery was called the Galerie L.C. Hodebert. In January 1929 Hodebart transferred the space of the former Galerie Barbazanges to Georges Bernheim. It housed the Galerie Heim from the 1950s, which specialized in old master paintings.

In 2016, he pitched for the St. Lucie Mets where he was 10‚Äì9 with a 3.56 ERA in 25 starts. The Mets added him to their 40-man roster after the 2016 season. Flexen started 2017 with St. Lucie, and after posting a 2.13 ERA there while striking out over a batter per inning in 3 starts, he was called up to the Binghamton Rumble Ponies on May 31. Flexen made his MLB debut on July 27, 2017 against the San Diego Padres at Petco Park. He gave up 4 runs on 5 hits in the start. He also became the fifth Mets player in franchise history to give up a home run to the first batter he faced in the Major Leagues after allowing one to Manuel Margot on only his third pitch. On August 8, 2017, Flexen recorded his first Major League win against the Texas Rangers at Citi Field, pitching 5.1 innings, allowing 3 earned runs and striking out 4 batters. MLB.com ranked Flexen as New York's ninth-best prospect going into the 2018 season. On May 19, Flexen, who started the season in the Pacific Coast League, was promoted to the Mets. He made only four appearances for the big league club, including one start, struggling to a 12.79 ERA and 3.16 WHIP over those outings. He underwent knee surgery in early August, ending his 2018 season. =Doosan Bears= Flexen was designated for assignment on December 6, 2019, and on the next day, it was announced that Flexen signed a one year contract with KBO's Doosan Bears, the 2019 Korean Series Champion.

(1978). Stepwise mutation model and distribution of allelic frequencies in a finite population. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 75(6), 2868-2872. Description The original model assumes that if an allele has a mutation that causes it to change in state, mutations that occur in repetitive regions of the genome will increase or decrease by a single repeat unit at a fixed rate (i.e. by the addition or subtraction of one repeat unit per generation) and these changes in allele states are expressed by an integer (. . . A-1, A, A1, .. .). The model also assumes random mating and that all alleles are selectively equivalent for each locus. The SMM is distinguished from the Kimura-Crow model, also known as the infinite alleles model (IAM), in that as the population size increases to infinity, while the product of the Ne (effective population size) and the mutation rate is fixed, the mean number of different alleles in the population rapidly reaches a peak and plateaus, at which time that value is almost the same as the effective number of alleles. Differences in the length of \\"simple sequence repeats\\" (SSRs) between individuals can thus be used to construct phylogenies (i.e. determine relatedness of individuals) or determine genetic distance between groups of individuals. For example, more genetically distant individuals would show larger differences in the size of SSRs than more closely related individuals.Chen, X., Cho, Y., & McCouch, S. (2002). Sequence divergence of rice microsatellites in Oryza and other plant species. Molecular Genetics and Genomics, 268(3), 331-343. Given the underlying assumptions of the SMM, it has been widely adopted for use with microsatellite markers that contain repeat regions, are co-dominate, and have high rates of mutation.Ellegren, H.(2004) Microsatellites: Simple Sequences with Complex Evolution. Nature Reviews Genetics. 5: 435-445.Laval, G., SanCristobal, M., Chevalet, C. (2002). Measuring genetic distances between breeds: use of some distances in various short term evolution models. Genet. Sel. Evol. 34: 481-507. The original SMM has been modified in multiple ways, including: # taking into account the upper size limit to most microsatellites # factoring in the likelihood of large alleles to show higher rates of mutation than small alleles # and including variations that suggest that mutations are split between point mutations that disrupt stretches of repeats and the additions or removal of repeat units. This last assumption provides an explanation for why microsatellites do not evolve into enormous arrays of infinite size. A number of summary statistics can be used to estimate genetic differentiation using the SMM model. These include number of alleles, observed and expected heterozygosity, and allele frequencies. The SMM model takes into account the frequency of mismatches between microsatellite loci, meaning the number of times there are no mismatches, single mismatches, 2 mismatches, etc. Variance in allele sizes are used to make inferences about the genetic distance between individuals or populations. By comparing summary statistics at different levels of organization it is possible to make inferences about population histories. For example, we can examine the variance of allele size within a subpopulation as well as within the total population to infer something about population history. Construction of phylogenies under the SMM is, however, complicated by the fact that it is possible to either gain or lose a repeat unit, thus alleles that are identical in size are not necessarily identical by descent (i.e. they show marker-size homoplasy). _Estoup, A., Jarne, P., & Cornuet, J. M. (2002). Homoplasy and mutation model at microsatellite loci and their consequences for population genetics analysis. Molecular ecology, 11(9), 1591-1604._ __Therefore the SMM cannot be used to determine the exact number of mutational events between two individuals. For example, individual A might have gained a single additional repeat (from an ancestor who had 9) whereas individual B might have lost a single repeat (from an ancestor who had 11), resulting in both individuals with identical number of microsatellite repeats (that is, 10 repeats for a particular locus). Some important caveats and limitations to consider when choosing molecular markers for estimating the relatedness of individuals or distinguishing between populations include the following: # There are limitations associated with various marker types and the number of markers used can heavily influence analytical results (with a higher number of markers generally showing greater ability to resolve genetic differences). # Molecular markers provide only a ‚Äúsample‚Äù of the genetic information in which to compare individuals of populations, and can differ from actual genetic differentiation. For example, it is possible that two individual are identical at a given locus, having the same mutation even from its common ancestor, but could differ at other loci that were not observed (or sequenced).

She is best known for her autobiographical novel Deviazione, which recounts her experiences in Germany during World War II. D‚ÄôEramo‚Äôs writings are characterized by interest toward controversial subjects and a search of solutions that would liberate people from physical and mental constraints.  Biography =Early life= Luce d‚ÄôEramo (n√©e Lucette Mangione) was born in 1925 in Reims, France. The daughter of Italian parents, she lived in France until the age of fourteen. Her father, an illustrator and painter, lived in Paris from 1912 until 1915 and went back to Italy to fight in the Italian army during the First World War, as a military airplane pilot. After the war he got married and the couple moved back to France where he started a building company. Luce was the youngest of three daughters, of whom the oldest one died in infancy. Her mother served as a voluntary secretary of the Italian Fascio in Paris assisting Italian immigrant workers. In 1938 Luce and her family returned to Italy and stayed at her maternal grandmother‚Äôs house in Alatri, near Rome. There Luce attended a classical liceo (high school). The change of scene proved a social and cultural shock as Luce tried to adjust to her new life in Italy. The Parisian reality with its modern values and diverse political movements (in 1936, members of the workers‚Äô Front Populaire held demonstrations directly below their house) was in sharp contrast to the backward reality of the Ciociaria region, where processions of barefoot pilgrims walked to the Sanctuary of the Certosa di Trisulti, singing at the top of their voices. Priests and monks were everywhere because their convent stood right behind her grandmother‚Äôs garden. In Io sono un‚Äôaliena, Luce recalled how children in France branded her as the ‚Äúpetite macaroni‚Äù (the little macaroni girl) which her Italian classmates from Liceo ‚ÄúConti Gentili‚Äù replaced with a condescending ‚Äúla francesina‚Äù (the little French girl). The sense of separateness, of being an outsider without any permanent roots contributed to d‚ÄôEramo‚Äôs deep sensitivity to the plight of ‚Äúthe other.‚Äù =Youth and the war= After the outbreak of World War II, her father joined the military service as a pilot and later started working for the news office of the air force. The family moved to Rome where Lucetta (as the family called her) attended the last year at the classical liceo ‚ÄúUmberto‚Äù (now ‚ÄúPilo Albertelli‚Äù). After graduation she enrolled in the Faculty of Letters at the university of Rome and became a member of GUF (Association of Fascist Students), a natural choice for a girl brought up in a fascist family. After the fall of fascism, on July 25, 1943, Luce followed her family to Bassano del Grappa in northern Italy, where her father was nominated to be the undersecretary of the air force in the Republic of Sal√≤ (a puppet state led by Mussolini and supported by Nazi Germany and Italian fascist loyalists). While in Bassano del Grappa, Luce heard disturbing news about mass deportations and atrocities committed in Nazi camps. Torn between the idealistic loyalty to fascism and her own, ever-growing doubts, on February 7, 1944, she decided to find out the truth. She left her family to take on a job as a factory worker in Germany and was sent to a labor camp at the Siemens plant, and later at the IG Farben plant in Frankfurt. The brutal awakening to the cruel reality of oppression and exploitation carried on in the camps pushed her to take an active part in the resistance against the Nazis. She supported the Russian prisoners in solidarity with their plight and participated in a strike organized by the French resistance. After being imprisoned she tried to commit suicide. Because of her family‚Äôs political position she was released and sent to Italy. On her way back home, passing through Verona, she realized that she could not return to her previous life. She threw away her documents, joined a group of deportees being sent to Germany, and ended up in the Dachau concentration camp. She escaped from the camp during an air raid and began the nomadic life of a clandestine vagrant, taking on the most menial jobs to survive in a Germany plagued by relentless air raids of the Allied forces. On February 27, 1945, in Mainz, Luce was helping rescue the wounded buried under the rubble of a bombed building when a wall crumbled on top of her. She was gravely injured and the damage to her spine caused permanent paralysis to both legs, resulting in a handicap that would impact the rest of her life. =Post- war period= After the war ended, Luce returned to Italy and spent some time in Bologna as a patient in the Rizzoli Clinic where she met Pacifico d‚ÄôEramo, a survivor of the Russian campaign recovering from sustained injuries. They married and moved to Rome, where Pacifico became a professor of philosophy. They had a son, Marco, who was born in 1947. The marriage turned unhappy and ended in separation years later. Luce continued to use her married name even after the divorce. Once back in Italy, Luce resumed her studies, earning both her degrees in literature in 1951 (with a thesis on the poetics of Giacomo Leopardi) and philosophy in 1954 (with a thesis on Kant‚Äôs Critique of Judgment). After the publication of her first book Idilli in coro by a small publishing house in 1951, she met Alberto Moravia who admired her as a writer and accepted her short story Thomasbr√§u (later included in the novel Deviazione) for a prestigious magazine, ‚ÄúNuovi Argomenti.‚Äù Next came a highly original essay entitled Raskolnikow and Marxism, (1960, reprinted in 1997) in which she engaged with Moravia in a discussion regarding the Soviet Union. In Finch√© la testa vive (1963), a short novel also later included in Deviazione, she confronted the trauma of being confined to a wheelchair at the age of nineteen. In 1966 her writing career was profoundly affected by an encounter with Ignazio Silone, who became her lifelong friend and the subject of an acute critical study L‚Äôopera di Ignazio Silone published by Arnoldo Mondadori in 1971. In this monumental piece of meticulous research and original insight, d‚ÄôEramo examines the resistance of the Italian cultural milieu to a native Italian writer who achieved world fame as one of the greatest figures of the literary scene in the twentieth century. In the years of the so-called ‚Äústrategy of tension,‚Äù d‚ÄôEramo‚Äôs friend, Camilla Cederna (a Milanese journalist) brought to her attention the case of Giangiacomo Feltrinelli, the famous publisher who, according to the official version and the police, was blown up while placing an explosive under a high-voltage pole. D‚ÄôEramo‚Äôs essay \\"Cruciverba politico. Come funziona in Italia la strategia della diversione\\", offers a penetrating analysis of how the Italian press handled this case. D‚ÄôEramo rose to fame with the novel Deviazione, begun a few years after her return to Italy, but eventually finished and published over thirty years later, in 1979. Deviazione is an autobiographical novel that recounts the dramatic events experienced in her youth. It is also a mystery of memory: the memory of a deeply wounded woman who had to contend with the difficulty of recovering the true meaning of her war experience in the post-war context and of returning to the social sphere she had so hard struggled to escape. After Deviazione d‚ÄôEramo published several other novels and short stories. She spent the rest of her life writing and travelling in Europe, United States, and Japan. In 1980 she spent a year in Berlin as a writer guest of the DAAD (Deutscher Akademiker Austauschdienst [The German Academic Exchange Service]). During the entirety of her career as a writer, d‚ÄôEramo also collaborated with a variety of magazines (Nuovi Argomenti, La Fiera Letteraria, Studi Cattolici, Nuova Antologia, Tempo Presente) and newspapers (Il manifesto, L‚ÄôUnit√† and Avvenire). She died in Rome on March 6, 2001. She was buried at the Non- Catholic Cemetery in Rome (also referred to as the Protestant Cemetery or the Cemetery for Foreigners) where John Keats, P. B. Shelley, and Antonio Gramsci are also buried. Works D‚ÄôEramo‚Äôs writings have always gravitated toward uneasy or controversial subjects, in search of solutions that would liberate people from thousands of physical and mental constraints. This pursuit would lead them toward a better knowledge of the self and an acceptance of the unknown and of ‚Äúthe other,‚Äù abolishing barriers that divide and exclude, thus allowing for a congenial coexistence on our planet, a tiny speck in the universe. After addressing the issues of Nazism and World War II in Deviazione and in short stories (collected in 1999 under the title Racconti quasi di guerra), Luce d‚ÄôEramo has confronted a variety of hard situations, involving social and psychological problems: the fight of dissident communist groups during the period of terror and ‚Äúurban guerrilla‚Äù in Italy, called ‚Äúthe years of lead,‚Äù in the novel Nucleo Zero (1981); the plight of the elderly in Ultima luna (1993); the emotional deafness of young nazi skinheads in Si prega di non disturbare (1995); the mental illness in Una strana fortuna (1997); and finally, in Un‚Äôestate difficile, the psychological portrait of a domineering husband and a wife who fights for autonomy and faces the break-up of her marriage, despite the rigid social and cultural conditions existing in Italy in the fifties. The novel which d‚ÄôEramo herself regarded as her favorite was Partiranno (1986). It is a poignant chronicle of the stay on earth of the Nnoberavezi, gentle aliens who thirst for knowledge. D‚ÄôEramo‚Äôs passionate interest in them stems from her own sense of ‚Äúalienation,‚Äù as she revealed in her last book-interview Io sono un‚Äôaliena, published in 1999, two years before her death. Her best-known work Deviazione became a bestseller and sold hundreds of thousands of copies. It was translated into French, German, and Japanese. The novel Nucleo Zero, translated into German and Spanish, was adapted into a movie directed by Carlo Lizzani in 1984. Excerpts from Una strana fortuna (A Strange Fate) were translated into English and appeared in the anthology Resisting Bodies, Narratives of Italian Women Partisans (2008).

It has been described as one of Murnane's greatest and most ambitious works, although some reviewers have criticised its use of repetition, lack of clear structure and reliance on writing as a subject matter. Reviewing the book in 2012, J. M. Coetzee called it \\"the most ambitious, sustained, and powerful piece of writing Murnane has to date brought off\\". Set in the plains of Hungary, the United States and Australia, Inland explores themes of memory,Murphy, p. 2 landscape, longing, love and writing.  Inspiration  Typical draw well in the Puszta in Hortob√°gy National Park In 1977, Murnane read A Puszt√°k n√©pe (People of the Puszta) by the Hungarian poet and novelist Gyula Illy√©s. The book had such a profound effect on him that it not only made him learn the Hungarian language, but also compelled him to write a book ‚Äì Inland ‚Äì in order to \\"relieve [his] feelings\\", as he later put it. In a 2014 interview, Murnane described one passage in particular as having changed his life, a passage describing cowherds pulling the body of a young woman out of a well: > Of all the images that I have in mind, that one has probably has yielded the > most and has perhaps even still the most to yield. It caused me to learn the > Hungarian language, for one thing, and to be able to quote the whole of that > passage in Hungarian. [Speaks Hungarian] ‚Äì that‚Äôs the cowherds pulled her > out when they watered the cattle at dawn section. And I wrote the book > Inland and the well just keeps occurring ‚Äì I don‚Äôt go looking for it, it > comes looking for me. And it occurs in numerous places, as you‚Äôve said, in > other books and things I have written. A quote of this passage (from the English translation of A Puszt√°k n√©pe) appears towards the end of Inland itself.Murnane, p. 236  Plot summary  Inland has been described as a complex work of fiction,Murphy, p. 1 lacking plot and characters in the traditional sense. The early parts of the book are set in Szolnok County, Hungary, where the narrator is writing in \\"heavy- hearted Magyar\\"Murnane, p. 5 to his editor and translator, Anne Kristaly Gunnarsen. Gunnarsen lives with her husband in Ideal, South Dakota, where they are both working at the Calvin O. Dahlberg Institute of Prairie Studies. The second half of the book is mainly set in Australia and concerns the narrator's trying to find the address of a girl (referred to only as \\"the girl from Bendigo Street\\") he once knew as a child.  Interpretations  Inland is set partly on the Great Alfold in Hungary, partly in the grasslands of Tripp County, South Dakota and partly in Melbourne (between the Moonee Ponds and the Merri) and Warrnambool (between the Hopkins and Russels Creek), Australia. The geographical shifts in the book's narrative has been interpreted by someFawkner, p. 25 as indicating the presence of multiple, separate narrators, although Murnane himself denies this, stating that he \\"consider[s] the book to have only one narrator and not the several that some readers have seemed to find\\". Some commentatorsMurphy, p. 3Fawkner, p. 16-18 have taken the recurring plains and grasslands to be metaphors of the author's metaphysics. The book's narrator repeatedly declares what Murnane has called \\"a little musical phrase\\": that \\"no thing in the world is one thing\\"Murnane, p. 73 and that \\"each place is more than one place\\".Murnane, p. 80 In a Heideggerian reading, Murphy suggests that the narrator, in describing his experience of wind moving over a landscape, is able to \\"[transpose] his understanding of his immersion in the physical world to the ontological world\\".Murphy, p. 9 The book contains numerous references to other literary works. At one point in the book, the narrator discovers an epigraph in a novel by Patrick White: \\"One day in this room I read in the preliminary pages of an unlikely book these words: 'There is another world but it is in this one. Paul Eluard'\\".Murnane, p. 148 The narrator also describes at length his memories of having read Emily Bront√´'s Wuthering Heights and Thomas Hardy's Tess of the D'Urbervilles,Murnane, p. 173-177 and quotes from a number of works, including a book by W. H. Hudson,Murnane, p. 205 a biography of Marcel Proust,Murnane, p. 190 the New TestamentMurnane, p. 209 & 229 and, as mentioned above, Gyula Illy√©s's People of the Puszta. In a foreword to the 2013 edition, Murnane, worried that he might have put into the text \\"more of [himself] than was seemly\\", wrote that, as he was reading the page proofs for the reissue, he was \\"surprised and relieved to learn how much of the text must have sprung from not from its author's memory but from those other sources often called collectively the imagination.\\"Murnane, p. 1-2 (Foreword)  Reception  Internationally, Inland did not initially capture a large readership. It appeared in the United Kingdom, where it had only a single review and scant sales. In 1995, a Swedish translation of the book (Inlandet) was released; this edition did not garner much attention, although reviews of Murnane's work, including Inland, have generally been kinder in Scandinavia than in the US and UK. Helen Harris, reviewing the book for the Times Literary Supplement, wrote that \\"[by] constantly game-playing and undermining the edifice of his own fiction, Murnane is left with an end product too artificial to have much evocative force\\".Harris, Helen (1989). Times Literary Supplement. Another reviewer considered the book's use of repetition and its \\"disappointing, stagnant rendering of memory, time, and fantasy\\" to make it tedious to read. However, in 2012, after its having been re-released in the US, Inland was the subject of a lengthy review by Coetzee, published in the New York Review of Books, that described it as Murnane's most ambitious and powerful work to date. Coetzee wrote: \\"The emotional conviction behind the later parts of Inland is so intense, the somber lyricism so moving, the intelligence behind the chiseled sentences so undeniable, that we suspend all disbelief\\". Peter Craven, writing in The Sydney Morning Herald, called it \\"a work that dazzles the mind with its grandeur and touches the heart with a great wave of feeling\\". The book has also been the subject of several PhD theses and other scholarly work.Fawkner  References  Cited texts   Category:1988 Australian novels Category:Novels set in Hungary Category:Novels set in South Dakota Category:Tripp County, South Dakota ","title":"Inland (Murnane novel)"},{"id":"49188656","text":"Church of Saint-Fran√ßois-des-Cordeliers in Nancy Interior The Church of Saint- Fran√ßois-des-Cordeliers () is a Roman Catholic church located in Nancy, France, capital city of Lorraine.  History  It was constructed as part of a monastery under Duke Ren√© II of Lorraine following the Battle of Nancy, next to the Palace of the Dukes of Lorraine. It was consecrated in 1487. The monastery was Franciscan and the French name term cordelier refers to the simple rope belts the monks would tie their cassocks around. Since the monastery was under the patronage of the dukes, the church had close ties to the House of Lorraine and a number of its members were laid to rest there.

Theorem  Trillium theorem Let be an arbitrary triangle. Let be its incenter and let be the point where line (the angle bisector of ) crosses the circumcircle of . Then, the theorem states that is equidistant from , , and . Equivalently: *The circle through , , and has its center at . In particular, this implies that the center of this circle lies on the circumcircle..

A fourth point, the excenter of relative to , also lies at the same distance from , diametrally opposite from ..  Proof  By the inscribed angle theorem, : \\\\angle IBA = \\\\angle DCA, \\\\quad \\\\angle IBC = \\\\angle DAC. Since BI is an angle bisector, : \\\\angle DCA = \\\\angle DAC \\\\Rightarrow AD = CD.

For, let be the given vertex, be the incenter, and be the circumcenter. This information allows the successive construction of: *the circumcircle of the given triangle, as the circle with center and radius , *point as the intersection of the circumcircle with line , *the circle of the √≤ theorem, with center and radius , and *vertices and as the intersection points of the two circles.. However, for some triples of points , , and , this construction may fail, either because line is tangent to the circumcircle or because the two circles do not have two crossing points. It may also produce a triangle for which the given point is an excenter rather than the incenter. In these cases, there can be no triangle having as vertex, as incenter, and as circumcenter. Other triangle reconstruction problems, such as the reconstruction of a triangle from a vertex, incenter, and center of its nine- point circle, can be solved by reducing the problem to the case of a vertex, incenter, and circumcenter. Generalization Let and be any two of the four points given by the incenter and the three excenters of a triangle . Then and are collinear with one of the three triangle vertices. The circle with as diameter passes through the other two vertices and is centered on the circumcircle of .

The term transportation network company comes from a 2013 California Public Utilities Commission ruling that decided to make the TNC revenue model legal. Almost all modern peer-to-peer ridesharing schemes rely on web application and mobile app technology. Terminology In the early 2010s, several transportation network companies were introduced. These were advertised as ridesharing, but dispatch drivers in a fashion similar to a taxi service, where they do not share a destination with passengers. The first such service to appear on the market was the San Francisco-based company Sidecar (launched in 2011). Transportation experts have called these services \\"ridesourcing\\" to clarify that drivers do not share a destination with their passengers; the app simply outsources rides to commercial drivers.Rayle, L., S. Shaheen, N. Chan, D. Dai, and R. Cervero. \\"App-Based, On-Demand Ride Services: Comparing Taxi and Ridesourcing Trips and User Characteristics in San Francisco\\". University of California Transportation Center, 2014. Despite multiple efforts to re-name the category, it still is commonly referred to as, \\"ridesharing\\". Real-time peer-to-peer ridesharing Real-time ridesharing (also known as instant ridesharing, dynamic ridesharing, ad-hoc ridesharing, on-demand ridesharing, and dynamic carpooling) is a service that arranges one-time shared rides on very short notice.Amey, A., J. Attanucci, and R. Mishalani. \\"'Real-Time' Ridesharing ‚Äì The Opportunities and Challenges of Utilizing Mobile Phone Technology to Improve Rideshare Services.\\" TRB Annual Meeting, 2011. This type of carpooling generally makes use of three recent technological advances:Ecosummit TV ‚Äì ECO11 ‚Äì Young Future Mobility Leaders ‚Äì Panel ‚Äì ECOSUMMIT ‚Äì Smart Green Economy Network and Conference * GPS navigation devices to determine a driver's route and arrange the shared ride * Smartphones for a traveler to request a ride from wherever they happen to be * Social networks to establish trust and accountability between drivers and passengers These elements are coordinated through a network service, which can instantaneously handle the driver payments and match rides using an optimization algorithm. Like carpooling, real-time ridesharing is promoted as a way to better utilize the empty seats in most passenger cars, thus lowering fuel usage and transport costs. It can serve areas not covered by a public transit system and act as a transit feeder service. Ridesharing is also capable of serving one-time trips, not only recurrent commute trips or scheduled trips.Levofsky, Amber and Allen Greenberg. \\"Organized Dynamic Ride Sharing: The Potential Environments and the Opportunity for Advancing the Concept.\\" Transportation Research Board, 2001. Real-time ridesharing is especially suitable for daily commuting compared to driving alone. Because such trips tend to happen at peak travel times, when traffic jams cause cars to pollute an 80% more,M. Treiber. How Much does Traffic Congestion Increase Fuel Consumption and Emissions? Applying a Fuel Consumption Model to the NGSIM Trajectory Data\\". Dresden University. additional benefits for the urban environment and climate change mitigation are expected by a reduction in the number of cars riding daily by the cities with a single occupant, and their related CO2 and NOx emissions.  Potential market  A 2010 survey at the University of California, Berkeley found 20% of respondents are willing to use real-time ridesharing at least once a week; and real-time ridesharing was more popular among current drive-alone commuters (30%) than transit or non-motorized commuters.Elizabeth Deakin, Karen Trapenberg Frick, and Kevin Shively. 2012. \\"Dynamic Ridesharing .\\" Access, 40: 23-28. The top obstacles to using real-time ridesharing were short trip lengths and the added time of ride logistics.  Implementation  Early real- time ridesharing projects began in the 1990s, but they faced obstacles such as the need to develop a user network and a convenient means of communication.Dynamicridesharing.org Gradually the means of arranging the ride shifted from telephone to internet, email, and smartphone; and user networks were developed around major employers and universities.Chan, Nelson and Susan Shaheen. \\"Ridesharing in North America: Past, Present, and Future.\\" Transportation Research Board, 2010. As of 2006, the goal of taxi-like responsiveness still generally eluded the industry; \\"next day\\" responsiveness was considered the state of the art.United States Department of Transportation. \\"Advanced Public Transportation Systems: The State of the Art Update 2006\\". More recently taxi-sharing systems that accept taxi passengers‚Äô real-time ride requests via smartphones have been proposed and studied.Ma, S., Zheng, Y., Wolfson, O., \\"Real-Time City-Scale Taxi Ridesharing\\", IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, vol. 27, pp. 1782‚Äì1795. 2015 A number of technology companies based in San Francisco premiered apps for real- time ridesharing (as well as ride-hailing where the driver does not share a destination with passengers) around 2012. However, in the fall of 2012, the California Public Utilities Commission issued a cease and desist letter to rideshare companies Lyft, Uber, Wingz, and Sidecar, and fined each $20,000. In 2013 an agreement was reached reversing those actions, creating a new category of service called \\"Transportation Network Companies\\" to cover both real-time and scheduled ride-sharing companies. Transportation Network Companies have faced regulatory opposition in many other cities, including Los Angeles, Chicago, New York City,Uber shuts down New York City taxi beta, may see light at the end of the (Lincoln) tunnel in February (update: TLC responds) ‚Äì Engadget and Washington, D.C. Two dynamic ridesharing pilots in Norway received government funds from Transnova in 2011. One pilot in Bergen had 31 passengers in private cars during one day. Thirty-nine users acted as drivers or passengers between June 30 and September 15 with four ridesharing episodes or more. The phone apps that was used was Avego DriverAvego Ltd and HentMEG.no cell client,HentMEG.no website a prototype developed for the NPRA of Norway. The other pilot is run by the company Sharepool.Sharepool website (Norwegian) Some more advanced real-time ridesharing features have been proposed but not implemented. For example, longer trips might be facilitated using \\"multihop\\" matches in which passengers change cars to reach their final destination.  Ride-sharing caps  Some jurisdictions have considered and/or implemented caps on the number of drivers who can work for ride-sharing companies. A 2018 survey of leading economists showed that most of the economists believed that such caps would have adverse effects, with a near-consensus noting that congestion pricing would be a better way to reduce congestion than ride- sharing caps.  Impact  Several studies and analyses of ridesharing apps (such as Uber and Lyft) have found that they reduce DUI accidents and fatalities. One study concluded that Uber had no impact on DUI accidents and fatalities. Some studies suggest that ridesharing apps increase overall traffic accidents and fatalities, possibly because rideshare drivers are distracted by their mobile devices or have to drive erratically at times to pick up customers. One study concluded that ridesharing apps increase overall traffic and gas consumption and cause greater traffic delays. One study concluded that ridesharing apps reduce use of public transport, while another concluded that ridesharing complemented public transport and thus increased public transport use. A 2019 study found that \\"Uber drivers earn more than twice the surplus they would in less-flexible arrangements.\\"  See also  * Hitchhiking and slugging, also known as casual carpooling * Peer-to-peer economy * Traditional carsharing, which allows consumer to access automobiles for self-driven journeys and can be provided by a for-profit corporation, a nonprofit corporation or a cooperative. * Peer-to-peer carsharing, where customers drive themselves in cars rented from individual owners * Carpool * Vanpool * Demand responsive transport * Flexible carpooling * Illegal taxicab operation * Mobility as a service * Rideshare advertising * Sharing economy * Sustainable transport  References  Category:Road transport Category:Shared transport ","title":"Peer-to-peer ridesharing"},{"id":"49188774","text":"Teliphasa similalbifusa is a species of moth of the family Pyralidae.

Composition The opera, which was listed by Adayevskaya as her Op. 8, has a libretto by Richard Gen√©e, translated into Russian by Adayevskaya herself. A manuscript piano score bears the title, in German, Die Morgenr√∂te der Freiheit. The opera bears a dedication to Tsar Alexander II.H√ºsken, 312 Synopsis The opera takes place in Little Russia (present-day Ukraine) in 1762. Olga and Pierre have loved each other since childhood, but he is a serf and not of the legal social status to marry her. Olga is encouraged to marry the wicked Nyrkoff, and eventually agrees to do so if he will arrange Pierre's freedom. However, when Pierre learns of Olga's potential sacrifice for his sake, he commits suicide. The marriage is therefore forestalled and Olga retires to a convent, leaving Nyrkoff to his rancour. The opera ends with a prophetic chorus of peasants praising Alexander II's 1861 abolition of serfdom.H√ºsken, 109 Performances The work was not approved by the Russian censors of the period. No complete performances are documented. The overture and peasant's chorus from the opera were performed at the Th√©√¢tre des Italiens in Paris on 23 April 1877; the composer took part in this performance at the piano. On 23 March 1886, the overture and chorus, (the latter arranged for orchestra) were played at a concert at the University of Dorpat (now Tartu, Estonia). In the twentieth century the overture was played at a concert in Saalfeld on 5 May 1953.H√ºsken, 313‚Äî4 References ;Notes ;Sources *H√ºsken, Renate (2005).

Biography=Early life and career in Mexico= Both of Pepe's parents were originally from the state of Chihuahua, but they moved to Lerdo, Durango in 1908. Pepe's father was Vicente Baca Jaramillo, and his mother was Do√±a Enriqueta Garc√≠a. Pepe had a sister and three brothers. His sister's piano playing inspired the four-year-old Pepe to teach himself to play the piano by ear. His family arranged for private lessons with a local teacher, and Pepe later continued his private lessons with a Director of the M√©xican Conservatory of Music. In spite of his musical gifts, his family urged him to prepare for a success in a more stable profession. After studying dentistry for a frustrating two years, Pepe completed his higher education at the Milton Business Academy in M√©xico City, and he also devoted himself to learning English, French, Portuguese and Italian. Pepe then worked for several years for a British mining company in the state of Chihuahua. While visiting the bar at the fashionable Ritz hotel in M√©xico City, Pepe played their piano for the amusement of his friends and, consequently, was offered a job performing in the hotel's night club. This was the beginning of Pepe's lifelong career as a musician who specialized in Latin American rhythms (rumba, bolero, cha cha, samba, etc.) Pepe Jaramillo, \\"South of the Border,\\" Axis Records, 1960, LP, Liner Notes After a successful three- year stint at the Ritz, Pepe was next employed by friends who had built the \\"Quid Grill\\" restaurant and bar. Hollywood friends of the owners were successful in introducing Pepe to radio and television in M√©xico City, and he also became highly in demand as an accompanist for visiting singers.Castle, Charles (1965), \\"Pepe at the Movies,\\" Parlophone, LP, Liner Notes \\"(He has worked with a great many of the most famous Latin-American and Spanish artists.)\\" As the result of a 1957 visit to Paris with his cousin (who was employed at the M√©xican embassy), Pepe Jaramillo fell in love with Europe, decided to settle there, and soon moved to London. He appeared on a radio series with the BBC called \\"Stairway to the Stars.\\" After hearing an appeal on TV for new artists, Pepe sent a sample of some of his M√©xican releases to Norman Newell. Shortly thereafter his 20-year history (1959‚Äì1979) as an EMI recording artist was launched. =International fame and concert appearances= Pepe Jaramillo in concert As a seasoned professional performer in Mexico, at age 38 Pepe Jaramillo was well prepared to move to the international stage. Through his nightclub and theater performances in some of the world's major cities, he became known as the \\"Ambassador of M√©xico.\\" His performance venues in the Americas included Los Angeles, Harlem, New York City, Miami, Colombia, and Buenos Aires (at Teatro Col√≥n). European performances included (of course) London, Paris (at the Louvre), Madrid at (Plaza Mayor), Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Yugoslavia. During a world tour he performed in many theaters across Japan, (recording several releases there), and also performed in Tangier, Hong Kong (at the Mandarin Hotel), Thailand, and China. During his concert tour in Australia and New Zealand, he also performed with The Seekers. By popular demand, Pepe visited Durban (the Hotel Edward) and Johannesburg (the Dawson Hotel) for three tours of South Africa. In London, Pepe gave a private performance for the family of the Duchess of Kent. \\"Also during a visit to London of [the] former President of M√©xico, Luis Echeverr√≠a, [Pepe was] invited to play at the reception hosted by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth and the Royal Family..\\" Pepe Jaramillo rose to musical prominence during the mid 20th-Century's worldwide interest in Ballroom and Latin American dancing. In 1966, music critic Nigel Hunter explained Pepe Paramillo's appeal thusly: \\"A large part of Pepe's popularity and achievement undoubtedly lies in the utterly unpretentious simplicity of his style...[His approach] has been vindicated again and again by the impressive sales of his records, and the triumphs of his appearances...Being Mexican, Pepe has the Latin touch innately.\\"Hunter, Nigel (1966), \\"Carnival in Mexico,\\" Columbia, LP, Liner Notes Not to be overlooked is the fact that Pepe Jaramillo expanded his repertoire from traditional Latin American songs to one which included Broadway show tunes, music from movie soundtracks, and other popular songs of the day (all arranged to reflect authentic Latin American rhythms). In regard to the popularity of Pepe's authentic dance rhythms among dancers, \\"Peggy Spencer, the well known British dance teacher and formation team coach, [said] 'You haven't lived if you haven't danced to Pepe Jaramillo.'\\"Pepe Jaramillo, \\"Tequila Cocktail,\\" Telemark Dance Records, 1971, LP, Liner Notes =Personal life and recognition= When he was not working or staying in London, Pepe Jaramillo spent his free time at his villa Las higueras (The Fig Trees) on the Costa del Sol in Spain. He enjoyed swimming, tennis, and painting. Pepe's generous charitable benefits and sponsorships included organizations in his homeland like the Red Cross and the Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. Jos√© Jaramillo Garc√≠a was recognized in September 1991 by Lerdo as \\"Distinguished Citizen.\\" In November 1996, Pepe made anotherMayer-Serra, Otto (June 5, 1961), \\"Mexico.\\" Billboard, New York return visit to his hometown, gave several concerts, and donated a piano to the local Casa de la Cultura. =Death= On April 30, 2001, Pepe Jaramillo died of anemia during sleep at his residence located near the town of Mijas, Malaga province in (Andalusia) Spain. His ashes were returned to his family in Mexico. Discography Pepe Jaramillo's biographer, Jos√© Jes√∫s Vargas Garza,Jos√© Jes√∫s Vargas Garza, historian and chronicler for the city of Lerdo, Durango states that Pepe Jaramillo recorded more than 30 LPs, mostly in the UK, but several in Japan, Colombia, and one [new release] in Mexico for Columbia Records...and that the EMI family of labels distributed his music worldwide. The following discography attempts to be complete and includes his LPs, 45rpm Singles and EPs, and the newer CD releases that feed the continued demand for his music. The first LP section lists seven known albums recorded and released in M√©xico by Columbia Records at unknown dates, but certainly previous to 1957. The next LP section chronicles Pepe Jaramillo's history with the EMI family of labels. Pepe Jaramillo is the primary artist with three exceptions, which are noted. Because all of his recordings \\"contain only authentic Latin rhythms, they became popular for both listening and dancing,\\" and he frequently recorded under variations of the name \\"Pepe Jaramillo & His Latin American Rhythms.\\" Geoff Love was long associated with Pepe, and was the most frequent director of the musical accompaniment for Pepe's piano artistry. Geoff Love also arranged many of Pepe's recorded songs. There was a long association with Norman Newell, as the producer for Pepe Jaramillo's releases. With a few exceptions (in Japan and possibly Australia), all of Pepe's releases were recorded in the UK. Pepe Jaramillo composed a number of the songs he recorded on his many releases. =Studio albums (LP) M√©xico= * 195? ‚Äì Pepe Jaramillo y su Piano, Discos Columbia de M√©xico, DCL-90, M√©xicoPepe Jaramillo releases on WorldCat.com * 195? ‚Äì M√∫sica de Gonzalo Curiel, Vol. 2, Discos Columbia de M√©xico, DCL-114, M√©xico * 195? ‚Äì Pepe Jaramillo su piano y ritmos, Harmony, HL-8002, M√©xicoPepe Jaramillo releases @ MercadoLibre.com * 195? ‚Äì The danzante (The dancer), Discos Columbia de M√©xico, HL-8129, M√©xico * 195? ‚Äì Pepe Jaramillo su piano y ritmos, Harmony, HL-(unreadable number), M√©xico * 195? ‚Äì A bilar con sabor latino (A Dance with a Latin Flavor), CBS, M√©xico (no release number available) =Studio albums (LP) EMI= With a few exceptions, Pepe Jaramillo recorded in the UK with EMI's Parlophone label from 1959‚Äì1965.

It is 78 minutes in length, and features a little boy going for a walk in a natural landscape. Outline The film opens with a shot of a mountain, and then shows waves lapping at the shore. A little boy, the eponymous Gabriel, is shown standing with his back to the camera, looking out to sea. He wears shorts, a white T-shirt and a pair of brown hiking boots. In the next shot, he sits on a rock looking out at the ocean: this shot has an intense red filter over it. Naturalistic color returns, and the film then follows Gabriel on a walk, as he traverses first a riverside path, then a mountain path. In the middle section of the film, the boy does not feature at all: for about twenty minutes the film consists only of close-up shots of flowers and water. At about fifty minutes through the film, Gabriel appears again, walking through sparse woodland. A sequence of close up shots of birch trees follows. The final minutes of the film intercut Gabriel's walk with flower and water shots. He finishes his walk sitting on a hill, looking out at the view. The film ends with a shot of a rock in the sea with waves swelling over it. All the shots are handheld. The film is silent, apart from seven moments at which excerpts from Bach's Goldberg Variations come in for two or three minutes at a time. Production=Filming= Gabriel was shot on 16mm color film using an Arri Arriflex camera. Martin filmed over the course of three to five months and used no script and no storyboards. =Cast= The boy was played by Peter Mayne, who was from Cuba, New Mexico (where Martin lived at the time). Martin referred to Mayne as ‚Äòa little hippie boy‚Äô and noted that though he looks about ten years old, he was in fact fourteen. =Locations= Gabriel was filmed in various locations in the American Southwest, including California, Colorado and New Mexico. The scholar Matthew Jeffrey Abrams suggests that the mountain that appears in the opening shots of the film might be the Wheeler Peak in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. Artistic intent Martin said she wanted to make a film ‚Äòabout happiness and innocence. I‚Äôve never seen a movie or read a story that was absolutely free of any misery. And so, I thought I would make one. The whole thing is about a little boy who has a day of freedom, in which he feels free.‚Äô She also said that she made the film ‚Äòin protest against commercial movies that are about destruction, deceit. They‚Äôve sold out to the special effects. It‚Äôs just a series of physical shocks to go to the movies‚Äô. Arne Glimcher, Martin's friend and gallerist, notes that Martin originally wished the film to be distributed through commercial Hollywood channels, though she did not achieve this aim. On the title of the film, the artist noted that she chose an angel's name to represent innocence. Public screenings Gabriel premiered at the Museum of Fine Arts, New Mexico, USA (1977). This was shortly followed by a screening at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia, USA (April 1977) and at the Anthology Film Archives, New York, USA (14 May 1977). Rosalind Krauss saw the film when it screened at White Columns, New York, USA (1982). More recently, the film has been screened in Edinburgh, UK (1999); at Kettle's Yard, Cambridge, UK (June 2010); at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, USA (28 October 2011); at DIM Cinema, Vancouver, Canada (16 April 2012); at Anthology Film Archives, New York, USA (2013); at Tate Modern, London, UK (5 June 2015); at Experimental Film Club, Dublin, Republic of Ireland (28 July 2015); and at Summerhall, Edinburgh, UK (20 January 2016); at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, USA (21 October, 18 November, 16 December 2016); at Art Cinema OFFoff, Ghent, Belgium (7 October 2019); at the Roxie Theater, San Francisco, California, USA (18 February 2020). Critical reception and scholarship Gabriel has had a mixed reception, and has often been seen as an anomaly in Agnes Martin's oeuvre. After the film was screened at the Anthology Film Archives in New York, the filmmaker Jonas Mekas reviewed it in his ‚ÄòMovie Journal‚Äô column in the SoHo Weekly News. He wrote that, ‚ÄòAgnes Martin is a great painter and whatever she does has an importance. Her film is no great cinema, that I have to state at the outset. But it is a very beautiful film. [...] Agnes Martin's film is about water, about countryside, flowers, nature, and mystery.' The art critic Rosalind Krauss wrote about the film in her essay for the catalogue of the 1993 retrospective of Agnes Martin‚Äôs work (at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York). She writes that ‚ÄòIt is not a work Martin herself gives any indication of wanting to bracket away from the rest of her art. Yet it should be. For Gabriel constructs a reading of Martin‚Äôs own work as crypto-landscape, a reading that, since it is produced by the artist herself, tends to carry the weight of interpretative proof.‚Äô Arne Glimcher commented: 'It is not unlike a Warhol movie. It is incredibly boring. It's, like, two hours long, and after about twenty, thirty minutes you start to get into it. At the beginning the movie can be excruciating and then you realise what she's doing. It's almost like a sensory deprivation experiment, then everything you start to see becomes heightened because you're so hungry for some activity. [...] At the same time in the scientific world we were dealing with sensory deprivation experiments, where people were being put in chambers and their perceptual systems would begin to fire on their own. And I think Warhol was doing that and I think frankly some of Agnes's paintings do that.' Restoration Gabriel was restored by the Museum of Modern Art (New York) and Pace Gallery in 2011.

It was founded in 2015 as a watchdog of the European Charter on Freedom of the Press. The vision of the European Centre for Press and Media Freedom is a society where media freedom enables open discourse and everyone can seek, receive and impart information. The main activities of the ECPMF are monitoring press and media freedom violations, advocacy and practical help for journalists, such as legal support and a \\"journalists-in-residence\\" programme, and engaging diverse stakeholders across Europe.  History  In 2009, 48 editors-in-chief and leading journalists from all over Europe convened, and formulated the European Charter on Freedom of the Press. The goal of the initiative was to assert the charter‚Äôs validity across Europe and to make its adoption a condition in EU accession negotiations. The Charter was handed over to the European Commission in Brussels on June 9th, 2009 and to the Council of Europe in Luxembourg on October 26th, 2009. With the establishment of the Charter, it was necessary both to implement it, and to found an organisation which would oversee this implementation. The supporters of the Charter established a strong network of partners from across Europe, which were academics, unions, investigative journalism organisations, the media, campaigning and aid organisations, amongst other communities. Thus in June 2015, the ECPMF was founded as a non- profit European Cooperative Society (SCE) by 25 representatives from 16 countries in the fields of journalism, publishing and media law in Europe. Among them are the European Federation of Journalists, South East Europe Media Organisation (SEEMO), Index on Censorship (Index), Osservatorio Balcani e Caucaso Transeuropa (OBCT), Media Legal Defence Initiative, Association of Journalists of Macedonia, Ossigeno per l'informazione (Ossigeno), Independent Journalism Center, and the Media Foundation of Sparkasse Leipzig. The main initiator of the ECPMF was Hans-Ulrich J√∂rges, former member of the chief editorial office of the German magazine ‚Äústern‚Äù, who played a key role in conceptualising the European Charter on Freedom of the Press. A cross-party coalition at the European Parliament spearheaded by Martin Schulz (SPD), Alexander Graf Lambsdorff (FDP), and Elmar Brok (CDU) backed the initiative to form the centre.  Location  The Centre is located in Leipzig, Saxony, Germany. The city was chosen to root the centre‚Äôs work in the tradition of the peaceful revolution of 1989, which fought for press freedom and to overthrow the GDR regime. It was at the Leipzig Media Congress, held by the Media Foundation of the Sparkasse, in October 2010 on the 10th anniversary of the creation of its Prize for the Freedom and Future of the Media, that Hans- Ulrich J√∂rges, an initiator of the Charter, introduced the idea of creating a European Centre to work for the Freedom of the Press. Shortly after that Congress, the Media Foundation began working on a concept to serve as the basis for a search for new project supporters. Amongst them are members of the European Parliament (especially its President Martin Schulz), the Free State of Saxony, the City of Leipzig as well as the German Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The ECPMF is located at the Media Foundation's headquarters in Leipzig.  Structure and finance  The ECPMF cooperative had 39 members at the beginning of 2019. They constitute the General Meeting, which is the highest body of the organisation. According to the statute, this body is responsible for electing the members of the supervisory and executive boards. The Executive Board employs the Managing Director. Each member has one vote and must buy at least one share of the cooperative. All members have to obey the Code of Conduct. The centre started within a pilot project, funded at 70% by the European Commission. The Media Foundation of Sparkasse Leipzig, the Chancellery of Saxony, the German Foreign Ministry, and City of Leipzig provided additional third-party funding for the centre. Some projects and activities like the Journalists-in-Residence programme receive funding from other donors, such as the National Endowment for Democracy, the German Foreign Office, the Open Society Foundations, and the German Ministry for Culture and Media. The EPCMF‚Äôs budget is roughly 1 million euros per year. As the centre defines itself as a network and European hub for activities defending press and media freedom, it shares its budget with partner organisations.  Network  The ECPMF creates a network for the otherwise fragmented media and journalism community in Europe, bringing together individuals, academic bodies, unions, investigative journalism organisations, media industry, campaigning and aid organisations. It supports and coordinates the activities of its members. Together with local and international members and partners it organises solidarity, covering the broader European continent from Portugal to Russia and from Norway to Malta. Keys partners of the ECPMF include ARTICLE 19, the European Federation of Journalists (EFJ), Free Press Unlimited (FPU), the Institute for Applied Informatics at the University of Leipzig (InfAI), International Press Institute (IPI), and CCI/Osservatorio Balcani e Caucaso Transeuropa (OBCT).  Activities = Media Freedom Rapid Response = The Media Freedom Rapid Response (MFRR) is a Europe-wide mechanism, which tracks and reacts to press and media freedom violations in EU Member States and Candidate Countries. This project provides legal and practical support, public advocacy and information to protect journalists and media workers. The MFRR is organised by a consortium, led by the ECPMF and many of its partner organisations. It is co-funded by the European Commission. The mechanism was set up following increasing threats to press and media freedom across Europe, including the murders of Daphne Caruana Galizia, Jan Kuciak and Martina Kusnirova, Kim Wall and Lyra McKee. Additionally, the use of vexatious lawsuits to stifle journalistic inquiry, expanded state censorship, and the amending of national legislation to marginalise the press, prompted the development of a continent-wide, coordinated response. The MFRR comprehensively documents press and media violations on the Mapping Media Freedom platform. Comparison of participation in right-wing demonstrations and right-wing attacks on journalists 2015-2018 = The \\"Concept of the Enemy\\" reports on Germany = Since 2015, the ECPMF has been examining politically motivated attacks on journalists in Germany. The phenomenon became virulent with the rise of right-wing demonstrations and the denunciation of journalists as ‚ÄúL√ºgenpresse‚Äù (lying press). The reports investigate how such a \\"concept of the enemy\\" influences the willingness to commit violence, and document fact- checked cases of physical attacks against journalists. The reports were widely shared and quoted, including in the international press. = Journalists in Residence = The Journalists in Residence scheme offers a temporary safe haven to journalists who are under threat. Journalists relocate to Leipzig and in a secure and safe environment can continue their investigative work at their own pace, while taking part in training courses and networking opportunities. According to the ECPMF, the programme \\"is designed to allow journalists to work outside the hostile environment for some time, to extend their personal networks, and to highlight press freedom problems in their home countries ‚Äì if individual circumstances permit this\\". For example, Michelle Demishevich, a Turkish journalist gained employment as a TV presenter in Germany following the residency. = Fact Finding Missions = The ECPMF regularly organises fact finding missions to various countries across the wider European continent. The aim is to report on cross-cutting issues affecting media and press freedom, and to draw from experiences and best practices in different settings. The missions undertake interviews with journalists, trade unions, politicians and civil society organisations who are under threat. Several reports from these missions have been published, including on best practice in defending media freedom in Denmark and Sweden , the 'Judicial Silencing of the Fourth Estate' in Turkey, and Media Freedom in turbulent times in Croatia. = Press Freedom Police Codex = On 4 December 2019 the ECPMF launched the Press Freedom Police Codex, an eight-point code on how the police and media workers can work amicably together. The codex is based on research into areas of contention between the two professions, for example police violence, surveillance, accreditation, protection of sources and confiscation of journalistic materials. According to the ECPMF, the codex \\"is designed to give police and media professionals a clear set of guidelines on how to safeguard press and media freedom‚Äù. = Other activities = The ECPMF's Help Desk offers support to individuals from the journalism community who are at risk or face threats. Support is provided in the form of professional qualifications or training, legal support, language coaching and preventative safety measures. The ECPMF also has a Women's Reporting Point which encourages female media workers to report gender-based harassment or violence they encounter in their work. Legal support is also given by the ECPMF, for example in national or international litigation and in defamation or whistleblowing cases.  The European Charter on Freedom of the Press  The European Charter on Freedom of the Press is regarded as the ‚Äúbirth certificate‚Äù of the ECPMF. The Charter was signed by 48 editors-in-chiefs and leading journalists from 19 European countries in 2009 in Hamburg. It is available in several European languages on its homepage.

In 1967 Levine won first prize for sculpture in the Canadian Sculpture Biennial.Les Levine Bio Life and work A graduate of the Central School of Art and Design in London, Levine first moved to Canada in 1960. He eventually settled in New York City in 1964 and became a resident artist at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design in Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1973. Early in his career, Levine introduced the idea of a disposable art and was given the nickname Plastic Man. In 1965, Levine, with Nam June Paik, were among the first artists to buy and use portapaks. Thus he was one of the first artists to try television as a medium for the dissemination of art. He has also used the telephone for this purpose, as well.Art by Telephone In 1969 he exhibited White Sight at the Fischbach Gallery, a work consisting of a room as the inside of a featureless whitecube illuminated by two bright sodium vapour lights. This meant that the spectator was confronted with their own act of looking presented as an artifact. The installation was also included as a feature for a charity ball at the New York Museum of Modern Art, to attend which museum patrons had to pay $75 per couple. Whilst Levine regarded the installation as a great success, this view was not shared by all the patrons. The yellow light drained the women's dresses of color. One visitor said: \\"All the men looked as if they have been dead for two centuries. All the women looked like their grandmothers. The beautiful ladies fled within one minute.\\" One of these accused Levine of making the museum \\"look ugly and silly\\" and promptly transformed the artwork by pulling the main light switch. In 1984, Levine produced the short film Made in New York in collaboration with fashion designer Willi Smith. He also designed a T-shirt for Smith‚Äôs label WilliWear Productions that was featured in the film. Levine has written on art for Arts, The Village Voice, Art in America and the Saturday Review. He was awarded the National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship in 1974 and again in 1980.Les Levine Bio  Reference material  Expanded Cinema by Gene Youngblood (pp. 337‚Äì344).

Early life Aschan grew up on a farm in Vejbystrand. At the age of twelve, she moved to Gothenburg and then studied at a boarding school in England. After that she studied at Stockholms Filmskola between 1989 and 1999, and at Den Danskes Filmskole in Denmark from 2001 to 2005 to become a director. During her studies, she became known for the commercials Fuck the Rapist!, a number of commercial films about a rape- protection consisting of an awl-clad tampon. Her short films In Transit and Goodbye Bluebird, which were made during the same time, have been shown at different film festivals. Career In 2009, she was a director's assistant at Dramaten and directed the Danish TV series Thea & leoparden for DR's child TV section; the series has also been broadcast in Sweden and several other countries. The three-part series is about a girl who pretends to be a leopard. Aschan has stated that she likes to use animal parables in her productions to make it more clear about human behavioural patterns. In 2011, she released her first feature film, Apflickorna, which premiered at the Gothenburg Film Festival and won the Dragon Award Best Nordic Film and FIPRESCI awards. Apflickorna has also won the award for Best Narrative Feature at the 2011 Tribeca Film Festival, Best Cinematography at the Transilvania International Film Festival, as well as a Special Mention at the Berlin Film Festival. At the 2012 Guldbagge Awards, Aschan and Josefine Adolfsson won the award for Best Script for the film, and the film also won the Best Film and Best Sound categories. In 2011, Aschan was awarded the Stockholm Film Festival's newly created long-film scholarship of 5million Swedish kronor (about ‚Ç¨550,000, ¬£480,000, or $770,000 in 2011) for her new project, Det vita folket, a science fiction-inspired story about the camps where the government places foreigners that are awaiting deportation. Aschan declined the money as she did not feel that her project fell under the rules of the award. Aschan has described Det vita folket as a space epos with inspiration from the horror film The Shining. The film had its premiere in 2015. At the 2016 Guldbaggen Awards, Aschan was filmed in the audience giving the finger and saying \\"Fuck You\\" to Swedish cinematographer G√∂sta Reiland. This was after Reiland had won the award for Best Cinematography, and was on his way up to the stage to receive the award. Linda Wassberg, who had filmed Det vita folket, was also nominated in the same category, and Aschan called it a \\"spontaneous reaction\\" to Wassberg losing to Reiland.

A school district was in the valley in the early 1900s, but the school closed in 1948. Course Oak Run begins in a valley to the southeast of Long Hill in Muncy Township. It flows southwest through the valley for several tenths of a mile, receiving an unnamed tributary from the right and passing through a small pond. The stream then turns south-southwest for several tenths of a mile, passing through another small pond before turning south. A few tenths of a mile further downstream, it leaves its valley and turns south-southeast for several tenths of a mile. The stream then receives an unnamed tributary from the left and turns south-southwest for a few tenths of a mile before crossing US Route 220. It then continues south-southwest for a few tenths of a mile before reaching its confluence with Wolf Run. Oak Run joins Wolf Run upstream of its mouth. Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Oak Run is above sea level. The elevation of the stream's source is above sea level. The valley of Oak Run is relatively narrow and is about long. At its southeastern end, it enters the Muncy Valley. Oak Run itself is a small stream. There are beds of the upper Mahantango Formation in the vicinity of Oak Run; these underlie the Tully Limestone.

Sweat received her education in Portland public schools and the Roxbury Latin School. Mussey married Lorenzo De Medici Sweat at age 26 in 1849 and began keeping a journal. Her husband was a lawyer; he graduated from Bowdoin College and served in the United States Senate and Maine House of Representatives. Their home, known as the Sweat Mansion, is now part of the Portland Museum of Art. The Sweats traveled all over the world. She was fluent in French, German, Italian, and Russian. Sweat was an avid philanthropist; she bequeathed their home and an additional 100,000 dollars to the Portland Society of Art to construct a building adjacent to her home for the museum. Many of her donations were to Bowdoin College, where both her husband and her father, John Mussey, graduated. A noted poet, journalist, and author, Sweat wrote the first American lesbian novel, Ethel's Love Life.  Early life  Sweat loved horseback riding and driving out in a chaise with her friends. She was an avid theatergoer; her regret was \\"the lack of a first rate theater in the city.\\" She never missed a performance at local theaters. If she was not at the theater, she attended art exhibits, concerts, operas, and lectures. She often supported the women in these fields by inviting them back to her home and entertaining them. She left her home open for anyone. Sweat loved to cook; she wrote her own recipe books and prepared meals, typically on Sundays, that served a guaranteed 10 couples that she invited. She often had more guests due to her home being open to the public. A typical meal consisted of \\"tomato soup, broiled salmon with egg sauce, boiled lamb‚Ä¶ roast chickens, ham, lobster salad, potatoes corn, steamed custards, strawberry and vanilla ices, charlotte russe, coffee, champagne.\\" After 1900, Sweat's life was divided into three cycles: June to early fall Portland, Maine; late fall and early winter was spent in Washington; and the entirety of winter and spring was spent traveling the world. Sweat never started her trips without first checking her own personal \\"Requisites for Traveling.\\" Her list included: > \\"green tea, matches, teaspoon, knife, drinking cup, pocket mirror, ball of > twine, and Etna. Cold tea is best drink in traveling. Claret and water next > best. Leather strap to bind shawl and cloaks together. Arnica and laudanum.\\" Her summers in Portland involved attending the Gem Theater, picnics on Cape Elizabeth, Maine, and trips to the mountains. She moved in high social circles; she met with Alexander Graham Bell's wife, and attended a lecture by Susan B. Anthony. Surprisingly, Sweat was not a fan of Anthony's talk which she characterized as dull. She was also a prominent matron of Portland social circles. Sweat is described as a champion of various reform movements, including women's suffrage. From 1866, she served as vice-regent for Maine of the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association. The Annals of the Cobweb Club contributed to the Chimney Corner Club, two women's organizations to which Sweat was deeply connected.  Author and poet  Sweat was an author, poet and journalist. She was the first woman book reviewer in New England. She had many favorable notices in newspapers; her book reviews often used the term \\"prudy.\\" Sweat was associated with other Maine women writers including Elizabeth Oakes Smith, Sarah Payson Willis (Fanny Fern) and Elizabeth Akers Allen. Sweat's papers are in the Maine Women Writers Collection at the University of New England in Portland, Maine. Sweat wrote a weekly column for a local Portland paper, the Augusta Correspondence. This column was an up-to- date report on legislative sessions and the troops of the Civil War. She was one of three women to edit the North American Review, and also contributed to it; her first paper was issued in 1856, Ethel's Love-Life (New York, 1859), and Highways of Travel, or A Summer in Europe (Boston, 1859). = Selected publications = * Hither and Yon (Privately Printed, 1901) * Highways of Travel; or A Summer in Europe (Boston: Walker, Wise and Company, 1859) * Drift Weed (1856) * A Fortnight in St. Petersburg (1899) * = Controversy over Ethel‚Äôs Love Life = Sweat is widely known for writing the first sapphic novel in America titled Ethel‚Äôs Love Life. It was published in 1859 and more than one hundred copies were sold on the first day. She wrote the novel as a testing ground for social theory. Ethel's Love Life reunites radical American experimentalism with passional freedom. The remark was made that almost double that number would have been sold if they had had them. With its lesbian themes, the novel raised much tension and turmoil. On the inside of the title page Sweat wrote: > \\"If there is aught of truth within these pages, it will assert itself > without assistance and without explanation. If there is any power of > expression in these words, it will speak to the hearts which recognize it; > and if there is any charm of sentiment beneath the imperfect utterance, it > lays itself at the feet of those who give it welcome.\\" Sweat and Elizabeth Stoddard passed 55 letters between one another during the early 1850s. Theorists and literary critics believe that the two had romantic feelings for one another. Contemporary literary critics believed that Sweat was experienced in her knowledge of lesbianism and that she must have personally experienced these feelings or observed them closely. A second theory is that only Stoddard was homosexual and seeking Sweat's help. As an author, Sweat wanted Ethel, the main character of the novel, to talk in a sensual and passionate language. This romantic rhetoric has two women personas, Lenora and Claudia, who have strange and irrevocable ties. Sweat portrays feelings between women that were considered to be more pure and pious than those of men. Sweat claimed that intimate relationships between women were a form of training for heterosexual relationships. Husbands would leave their marital beds allowing the women to stay together longer. Sweat believes that gender roles need to be redefined to include all gender identities not just heterosexuals. For example, female sexuality is not directly linked to babies and reproduction. __Sweat believed that social tolerance was diminished, and that societies view of homosexuality was deviant and chaotic. The idea of change from 'normality' was viewed as corrupt and wrong. Sweat claimed that urbanization, industrialization, and immigration are three key components as to why society has these views. The novel raises the reader's consciousness of the erotic components of same sex relationship. Indications of lesbianism within the novel would have been overlooked at the time it was written; today one would consider the novel a work of lesbian erotica. However, during the Victorian period there had been no indication that there was any social or literary controversy. = Diaries = Sweat recorded seemingly everything in her life in a diary, journal or poem. Sweat never missed a day. All of her entries were written in cursive. She is well known for her journal entries and reports of all her and husband‚Äôs travels. Sweat wrote daily \\"for mental discipline!\\" She communicated with herself via her diary and journal. On days that nothing exciting happened she would write the word ‚Äòsame‚Äô and that was it. This word same appeared on a series of pages, some times up to five days in a row. Sweat recorded the weather, her friends' daily activities, and notes on world current events. Many of her entries recorded attendance at operas, plays, and other theatrical entertainments that she loved attending. She kept some of the tickets as keepsakes. Sweat did not write a lot about herself; instead her diary entries focused on other people. Sweat kept personal information in her diaries as well, including dates to remember such as birthdays, club meetings, and historical dates. She also wrote down the gossip she heard among her friends and in public; she enjoyed knowing so much information. She kept news articles about her husband and obituaries of people she knew. Sweat would edit the articles written about her husband, as if they were in error or not up to her literary standard. Sweat attended a lot of luncheons, it was one of her favorite things to do during the day. Sweat's sense of humor is evident in her journals. Sweat's first journal entry was on Tuesday, October 30, 1849; the day of her wedding. She described the marriage ceremony, and how she altered the wedding vows, which was considered very daring during this time period. When she and her husband travel together, she noted the number of miles traveled and the number of letters she received on every trip. For example, she traveled 24,000 miles in 1858. Sweat recorded her own and her husband‚Äôs health issues. She often stated her symptoms but failed to make a diagnosis or make sense of what her body was actually going through. She did not like to visit her doctor. Sweat believed that she was immune to depression; which almost all women at this time were prone to. Sweat mentions that she frequently did not feel well most days. She got sick on a few of her trips out of the country. She took opium belladonna daily. At one point during Sweat‚Äôs life, doctors believed she needed to be placed in an insane asylum. Her husband refused the advice on behalf of Sweat. Sweat thought of her husband very highly. She did not mention him much in her diaries, but when she did there is a lot of affection behind the text. She used pet names and describes how much she loved him. When her husband dies her journal articles became more prevalent; she felt lonely for the ten years she survived him.  The Washington Club  All 12 members signatures of the Cobweb Club = Cobweb Club = The first 5 commandments of the Cobweb Club Sweat organized The Cobweb Club in 1890. This club was one of the first effective women's clubs. The women described the club as \\"a woman‚Äôs literary club of much prestige.\\" The club's constitution stated, \\"the utmost freedom of expression shall be preserved. Conversation and discussion to be encouraged.\\" This club became the nucleus for the Washington Club in later years. With twelve members, the club had twelve commandments all members must follow. The club never expanded nor decreased. It was organized unconventionally and lasted only a few short years. Meetings were held every Monday at 11 at one of the member's home. Controversial topics discussed during these meetings were solely based on culture and recreational issues; oftentimes the members all read or prepared a paper on an issue or subject they felt needed discussing and then presented it to the members of the club. Unlike many women who were confined to their homes to take care of the house and children, Sweat and women like her who were educated, participated in many clubs. Sweat was white middle class, along with the majority of her friends, which granted her opportunities to participate in society. Generating this club, women were intellectually stimulated and driven to think progressively. The Cobweb Club's social mobility and public knowledge is what caused an uproar in the public. Women in these clubs were educated and could stand up for what they believed in; their voices were heard. = Washington Club = Commandments 6-12 of the Cobweb Club The Cobweb Club originally was a small private club that later developed into, and is now known as, the Washington Club. Mrs. Lee, widow of Admiral Willis Augustus \\"Ching\\" Lee, was the President of the Washington Club. The women expanded their group through literary circles, and within these circles they knew a lot of women. Members would read passages and essays together, or, one person would be assigned to write an essay and share with the group. One of Sweat's favorites was the art talks; she loved theater and art and discussions about them. Fencing classes and other extra curricular activities were offered to the members of the group. Sweat describes the difference between a women's club and a men's club: > \\"at first there was no thought of making the club a literary center, but > here is just the difference between a man's club and a woman's; to the > former his club is a place of recreation to the latter it must be a place of > self culture in some, direction or other.\\"  Notes  External links  * Excelsior Diary Category:1823 births Category:1908 deaths Category:American women poets Category:Writers from Maine Category:Writers from Portland, Maine Category:Roxbury Latin School alumni Category:19th-century American women writers ","title":"Margaret Jane Mussey Sweat"},{"id":"49189327","title":"Atlanta (TV series)"},{"id":"49189330","text":"Ian Rogers is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.

The bath house was completed in 1931 and was listed on the Danish national registry of protected buildings and places by the Danish Heritage Agency on 15 February 1989 as a fine example of the Nordic funkis style. The building was thoroughly renovated in 2010‚Äì12. The name Spanien (Spain) refers to the harbour district street where the bath house is situated. In Denmark, harbour district streets are normally named after foreign destinations.  History  In 1926, the at the time only public bath house in Aarhus closed and it was decided that a new one was to be built on an available lot on the street of Spanien. The project was budgeted at 750,000 Danish Kroner. Construction commenced in 1931 and was completed in 1933 but at a cost twice as high as initially projected. The finished building included an Olympic-size swimming pool, public showers on the ground floor, a luxury department on the 3rd floor, restaurant, hairdresser and other facilities. Spanien was constructed with the newest technology in mind. There was a system to create artificial pine-scented rain, underwater lighting, heated floors surrounding the pools, seawater was piped from the condensers of the nearby power plant, in the saunas chairs made of steel pipes were water cooled and every department had a phone line. The technological solutions drew much attention at the time and some 60,000 visitors, mainly from Jutland, came to see the new state of the art bath house and pool. In the 1930s, the swimming pool was frequently used for international competitions and numerous world records were set here. Prominent local swimmers at the time was Kirsten Busch-S√∏rensen, Fritze Nathansen og Eva Arndt.  Architecture and design  The large outside neon signs by night Spanien Public Baths was designed by city engineer Frederik Draiby and is a good example of Nordic functionalist architecture, commonly referred to as Nordic \\"funkis\\". It is a massive four story building with a six story tower, all in red brick and topped with plated copper hip roofs. Brick and copper are typical Danish building materials. The whole building has a spartan, clean style in the spirit of functionalism. The large main building is mostly free of decorations but the tower features flat brick columns reminiscent of classical pilastres. Classical Greek elements can also be found in some architectural details inside the swimming hall itself. The interior of the building is painted very colorful, breaking stylistically with the simple exterior and communicating the purpose of various areas and spaces, a characteristic feature of Nordic funkis. Marble, sandstone and polished stainless steel is used extensively inside the bathhouse and the railings and architectural glazing, both featuring prominently throughout, are other tell- tale signs of this particular architectural direction.

Facilities  The facilities were initially designed both to cater to the needs of the many working class citizens who lived without heated water and bathrooms in their city homes, and as a wellness facility for wealthier citizens. In modern times, there is no longer the same imminent need to cater for basic hygienic needs of the citizens so it was decided to repurpose larger parts of the interior in combination with a thorough renovation of the whole building. This project was realised between 2012 and 2014. Today the swimminghall holds a 25 meter exercise and fitness pool, a play area, a shallow hot water pool, a spa and showers. The large changing room departments offers sauna. The 3rd floor contains a wellness unit with several special facilities, most notably sauna, an ice water pool, steam baths, spa baths and massage pools. As originally, the complex is still home to a number of commercial leases and offers a small caf√©, hairdresser, acupuncture, craniosacral therapy and zone therapy. The first floor and basement is home to a fitness club.Husets andre tilbud  See also  * Listed buildings in Aarhus Municipality References External links  * Spanien Public Baths Website * Spanien Public Baths Facebook account Category:Listed buildings in Aarhus Category:Public baths in Denmark Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1933 Category:Functionalist architecture in Aarhus ","title":"Spanien Public Baths"},{"id":"49189399","text":"USMobile, Inc. is an Irvine, California-based corporation that developed the commercial enterprise version Scrambl3 of NSA's Fishbowl (secure phone) techniques.

It is realistic fiction and deals with the problem of standing by or helping out when chaos occurs. Plot Mitchell, a man who is clearly an Average Joe, he married a super mutant from fallout and adopted her two mutant dogs, they are normal. He is perfectly happy with life, but one day five stoned bikers enter his bar, and rape a young women who has entered too. He feels as though he should fight back against them, but instead does nothing except for calling the police. She is sent to the hospital. When he returns to work, the curse takes full effect, he sees everyone differently, and is greatly saddened by the events that have traumatized him.and Mitchell loses his joy in life, the \\"curse\\" in the title.  Analysis  The point of view is third person limited objective: Dubus tells everything from a neutral point of view, he talks about what happens to Mitchell with no interjections. He intentionally withholds information for a dramatic effect. Since this type of narration is the most common, it fits in with the type of story, and the fact that it could happen to anyone. At the very beginning of the story, the reader is treated with details about Mitchell, mostly physical. One is imbibed with the fact Mitchell is pretty darn normal: he is 49, he is fit and a normal height. He remains this way throughout the book, but Dubus says in the onset that he feels like an elderly, with an \\"exhaustion that could not be overcome with sleep and rest\\". He seems to be a kind man, he loves his wife and \\"children\\", he clearly cared about the victim in his bar. Dubus used both exposition and indirect characterization to create a likable and realistic character for The Curse. The setting in The Curse is pretty mundane: the first location is some bar near the boardwalk of a beach. Andre Dubus' writing style is actually very similar to Ernest Hemingway's style. He states facts, which in some ways break the classic rule of \\"show, don't tell\\". He lists all the facts about a location, yet he still uses his words to imply details about places or people. \\"Mitchell looked away, at the front door. He had put the chairs upside down on the table.\\"-Paragraph 2. Here, Dubus tells the reader what is going on, without obfuscating the meaning with needless adjectives or purple prose. This creates an easy read, one that is fit for a short story and will not confuse a reader. The tone is grim. It is marred by gloom and sadness. Dubus, of course, needed to let the reader know the mental anguish Mitchell feels. To do this, he reiterates the fact that Mitchell feels older and the details of the rape that he witnessed. The tone is absolutely perfect for the story, as it is a gloomy, regretful reflection of past events. Is would not have worked if Dubus described everything in a cheerful manner or with joy in his prose, it has to be grim. This helps play a role into the theme of guilt. The overarching theme of the story is simply guilt. Mitchell feels guilty because he did not assist the girl until after she had been raped mercilessly. As a result, he can not view anything in the same light anymore, he sees everyone in his bar differently, and he gets the inkling that they do the same unto him. He still has flashbacks to that night weeks after the event, hallucinating that she and the bikers are still in his bar, remembering every puny detail. Although it may not be obvious at first, the symbol in The Curse is actually the bar in which Mitchell works. It is a location where innocence comes to die. People come into the bar, xertzing their meals and getting into fights. The victim of the story is a young girl who walked in, not looking for trouble, and was fairly well off. Although she had purish intentions, she ended up getting raped by men who possess no respect for women. Andre Dubus crafted a clever tone where he shows an \\"average Joe\\" struggling with guilt after a woman is raped right in front of him. Although he penned this story almost 30 years ago, it is hardly less poignant to this day. Reception The online site Questia reviewed this work and called it a tale dealing with \\"guilt, inaction, and manhood\\", greatly praising the work and the effort put into it.https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-15801063/the-seirenes-will- sing-his-mind-away-andre-dubus-s ReferencesExternal links * -A detailed analysis on eNotes.

Catholicisation was a policy of the Holy See through the Papal States, Holy Roman Empire, Habsburg Monarchy, etc. Sometimes this process is referred to as re-Catholicization although in many cases Catholicized people had never been Catholics before. The term is also used for the communion of Eastern Christian churches into the Roman Catholic Church; the Eastern Catholic Churches that follow the Byzantine, Alexandrian, Armenian, East Syrian, and West Syrian Rites, as opposed to the Roman Catholic Latin Rite.

Catholic bishops Vinkoviƒá and Petretiƒá wrote numerous inaccurate texts meant to incite hatred against Serbs and Orthodox Christians, some of which included advice on how to Catholicize the Serbs. During World War II, the Axis Ustashe led the campaign of Genocide of Serbs in the Independent State of Croatia. An estimated 300,000 were converted to Catholicism, most temporarily. =Albanians= Christianity in Albania was under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Rome until the 8th century. Then, dioceses in Albania were transferred to the patriarchate of Constantinople. In 1054 after the schism, the north became identified with the Roman Catholic Church. Since that time all churches north of the Shkumbin river were Catholic and under the jurisdiction of the Pope. Various reasons have been put forward for the spread of Catholicism among northern Albanians. Traditional affiliation with the Latin rite and Catholic missions in central Albania in the 12th century fortified the Catholic Church against Orthodoxy, while local leaders found an ally in Catholicism against Slavic Orthodox states.

Biography = Childhood = Born Guido Hess on 10 October 1909 in Turin, he belonged to a Jewish family of Egyptian origin which had settled in Liguria.(Enciclopedia_Italiana)/ Treccani He was the son of Adolfo Hess, a mountaineer, and a descendant of Moses Hess. The choice of the Seborga pseudonym comes from a small town west of the Ligurian hinterland. It is linked to his love for the sea and for the city which he considered his true hometown: Bordighera, a constant point of reference in his many trips abroad. His lived at Via Pelloux 44 Bordighera and its hinterland are the background of Seborga's literary works; the Vall√©e des Merveilles and the Ligurian Sea are the references of his art. = The antifascist youth = Seborga lived in an apartment at Corso Galileo Ferraris. He attended the Massimo d'Azeglio Classical Lyceum, where was taught by Augusto Monti. He had his first artistic experiences with Casorati. He lived in Berlin just before the arrival of Nazism, and then in Paris, a city in which he frequently returned throughout his life. In Turin, he became friends with Umberto Mastroianni, who came from Rome in 1928, and with Lojze Spazzapan. Seborga also met the painters Mattia Moreni and Albino Galvano, the art critic Piero Bargis, the philosopher √ìscar Navarro, the director Vincenzo Ciaffi, the architect Carlo Mollino, and the music critic Massimo Mila, with whom he discussed art and politics. Antifascist groups in Turin led him to join the Italian resistance, first with the Action Party along with Giorgio Agosti, Alessandro Galante Garrone, Ada Gobetti and then as a partisan in the . = Post-war = After the war, he joined the Italian Socialist Party. In Rome with Lelio Basso he directed the magazine Socialismo and he managed the propaganda of the Popular front, which was the union of the leftist parties. Since the 1930s, he had worked together with Italian cultural magazines, such as Circoli, Campo di Marte, Prospettive, Letteratura Maestrale. After the war, he contributed to the republishing of the Turin newspaper Avanti!. He participated with Ada Gobetti, Franco Antonicelli, Felice Casorati, Massimo Mila and others in the foundation of the Unione culturale di Torino (\\"Cultural Union of Turin\\"). He was among the organizers of the production of the play Woyzeck by Georg B√ºchner, with Raf Vallone and performed in 1946 for the reopening of the Gobetti Theatre in Turin. In 1947 he decided to return to Paris, where he became the director of Italia Libera and worked with Europe and Minuit. From Paris, he continued to collaborate with the Italian newspapers writing about Parisian life and its intellectuals. Once back from Paris, Seborga lived between Turin and Bordighera. His love for Bordighera came to expression in his participation in the cultural life of western Liguria. In the 1950s and 60s, Seborga was part of the organization and of the jury of the \\"Cinque Bettole\\" award in the categories literature and painting, with the likes of Italo Calvino, Giancarlo Vigorelli, Elio Philip Accrocca, Charles Betocchi and Giuseppe Balbo. In the 1960s he chaired the lecture series \\"Meet the man\\" in Sanremo, featuring, among others, Salvatore Quasimodo. He also contributed to the creation and the development of the Cultural Democratic Union of Bordighera, for which he helped to organize exhibitions, debates, lectures and plays. Guido Seborga died in Turin on 13 February 1990.  Painting  From an early age Seborga stayed in Bordighera and wandered in its hinterland. He was impressed by the Vall√©e des Merveilles and its rock incisions which were studied by Clarence Bicknell. From the 60s he started sketching and painting by creating \\"ideograms\\", a form of original painting that combines dynamic signs and the black silhouette of archaic figures on a background of contrasting chromatic levels. Full of energy, he began painting with great enthusiasm, working for the realization of several exhibitions. Of its monographic exhibitions, the best known are those of Sforza Castle in 1973 and the Galleria Schettini in 1977 in Milan. He also exhibited in Turin in 1969 at the Galleria Il Punto in 1974 at the Galleria Narciso and Galleria Civica d'Arte Moderna in Rivoli. He also personal exhibitions in Liguria, including Alassio at Sanremo and several in Bordighera, where he spent long months in his house in Via Pelloux 44. He also exhibited abroad, in Amsterdam at the Sphynx Gallery (1969), in Menton in the Gallery Arts and Letters and during the Biennale (1970‚Äì1972), in Paris at the UNESCO Palace (1972), in Monte Carlo in 1979, in Marseille with the City Museum, in the Biennial of Bamberg, in Strasbourg in 1980, and then in other large cities such as Krak√≥w, London, Lugano, Antibes, etc. Guido Seborga always had a special focus on youth. There were many exhibitions and conferences in schools and high schools, with the stated goal of opening the minds of young people to the new artistic trends that roamed the world. His works are in private collections and Italian and foreign museums.  Journalism  Journalism was the first love of Seborga and he would work all his life with several Italian and French newspapers. From the '30s he began working with small political papers to eventually end his journalistic career with the great Italian weekly press such as La Stampa, Il Giorno, Il Secolo XIX La Repubblica, etc. In the ‚Äò40s he was appointed by Maria Luisa Spaziani as editor in chief of the literary magazine \\"Il girasole\\" first and then of \\"Il Dado¬ª. In the late '40s he lived in Paris where he was director of the Magazine \\"Italia libera\\".  Literature  Arnoldo Mondadori Editore published in 1948 in the prestigious series Medusa, \\"L'uomo di Camporosso\\" and, in 1949, \\"Il figlio di Caino\\". The two novels, set in western Liguria, will be greeted by Italian and foreign critics with great interest. Seborga is a writer of strong realistic inflection and, in his novels, he speaks generally of a world of outcasts who are struggling to survive in a tough and difficult land of Liguria, where work is hard and dangerous and where it becomes dangerous to defend beliefs at the time of the fascist regime. These first two novels will be followed by four other titles translated into several languages and a newspaper published in 1968. Seborga's characters are part of the drama of life, for better or for worse. They have no chance of escape without risking betrayal and of therefore becoming an accomplice of society. For Seborga automation is a danger, namely the risk of bloodshed by the techno-industrial society to which he opposes the moral rigor of Piero Gobetti which refers to civil commitment. Seborga also approached poetry, his first collection of poems was published in 1965 with the title \\"Se avessi una canzone\\", is dominated by the sea, the sun, the wind, rich olive border valleys and vineyards as wild as its inhabitants. He participated in the political and musical experience of the Turin group Cantacronache, which offered an alternative to commercial ditties by putting in music some of his poems.

She was a celebrity in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) before 1989. After that, from 1990 till 2013, she headed up the touring theatre company. Life Vera Franziska Oelschlegel was born in Leipzig. Her mother, Ruth Oelschlegel (born Ruth Lauterbach, 1914‚Äì2014), was trained as a journalist. Her father, the businessman Gottfried Oelschlegel (1910-1945), would be killed in World War II. She attended the prestigious St. Thomas School in Leipzig, passing her school final exams (Abitur) in 1956. After that she studied between 1956 and 1959 at the acting faculty of the , from which she emerged with a degree, and where she also served as the secretary for the faculty's Free German Youth section. Between 1959 and 1961 she worked at the Putbus Theatre on the Island of R√ºgen on the country's north-east coast. Her first radio experience had involved women's broadcasts with Radio Leipzig, and in 1961 she became a member of the DFF ensemble, remaining in one form or another a member of the state television broadcaster's drama team between 1961 and 1974. In 1966 she was a founding member of \\"Ensemble 66\\". In 1976, she was a co-founder of the Palace Theatre (Theater im Palast / TiP) in Berlin, an experimental theatre project that attracted controversy in the East German establishment. Oelschlegel served as the theatre's intendant from 1976 till 1990. During the 1980s she worked with Corinna Harfouch as her \\"master student\\" at the TiP. Oelschlegel was also producing plays; she staged D√ºrrenmatt's and Shakespeare's Merry Wives of Windsor and King John, along with works by Peter Hacks and Ulrich Plenzdorf. In 1981 Vera Oelschlegel began teaching at the Ernst Busch Academy of Dramatic Arts in Berlin where she conducted masterclasses in acting. In 1984 she became an honorary professor for acting at the academy. Oelschlegel's notability rests as much on her own acting career as on her work in theatre administration, production and teaching. Both within East Germany and more widely, she became particularly known for her Brecht interpretations, especially during the 1960s and 70s. During her years at the TiP (theatre) she also organised art exhibitions, poetry readings and \\"composer-portraits\\". The demise of the German Democratic Republic and the formal reunification of Germany a year later meant major upheavals psychologically and in practical terms for the old East German cultural elite. One response by Vera Oelschlegel was the publication of her autobiography, entitled \\"Wenn das meine Mutter w√ºsst\\" (\\"If my mother were to have known that\\"). The press response was mixed, with some critics complaining about details that had apparently been left out. The omissions that most troubled reviewers may well have been those involving Vera Oelschlegel's private life - all three of her husbands achieved notability as members of the East German elite - rather than those concerning her professional career. Her mother, Ruth Oelschlegel, had been closely involved in her daughter's early career, and her own work had concerned the management of East German performing artists more generally. The (\\"Theatre of the East\\") touring theatre company was founded in 1991. Vera Oelschlegel served as its principal, its drama director and leading actress. Vera Oelschlegel's retirement from it in 2013 marked its ending. The company showcased East German drama, employing actors such as Hans-Peter Minetti and the playwright Heiner M√ºller. There was also a focus on the crowd-pleasing classics. In contrast to the world she had known at the prestigious Palace Theatre, the Theatre of the East operated without public subsidy and was frequently short of money. It toured extensively across countries where German is widely understood, including Switzerland, Austria, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Family Vera Oelschlegel was one of her parents' three recorded children. One of her two brothers, Axel Oelschlegel (1942‚Äì1989), acquired a certain level of fame in East Germany as a novelist and journalist. She has been married three times. Her first husband, to whom she was married between 1961 and 1967, was the dramatist-film director G√ºnther R√ºcker. Between 1971 and 1976 she was married to the writer Hermann Kant. Her third marriage, between 1977 and 1987, was to the politician and senior Central Committee member, Konrad Naumann. Between 1988 and 2006 she lived with the screenwriter- journalist Gregor Edelmann. Her life partner since 2008 has been the architect and urbanist {Interlanguage link multi [Fritz Stuber]}.

He moved to New Zealand in 2002 to play for the Taranaki Stormers of the Conference Basketball League, helping the team win the league title and promoting them to the NBL in 2003. He continued on with the Taranaki franchise throughout the 2000s, carving out what was a decorated NBL career with numerous individual awards, but achieved little team success with the Mountainairs. Early life and career Abrams was born and raised in Little Rock, Arkansas, where he attended Little Rock Catholic High School. After graduating from Little Rock Catholic in 1992, he played two years of junior college basketball for the New Mexico Military Institute. As a sophomore playing for the Broncos in 1993‚Äì94, he averaged 18.9 points, 8.4 rebounds, 1.5 assists and 1.9 blocks per game. In 1994, Abrams transferred to Centenary College, where he played two years of Division I college basketball. As a junior in 1994‚Äì95, he averaged 11.9 points, 6.1 rebounds, 1.1 assists and 1.1 blocks in 27 games. As a senior in 1995‚Äì96, he averaged 18.3 points, 8.6 rebounds, 1.8 assists and 1.1 blocks in 27 games. Upon graduating from Centenary in 1996, Abrams attempted to play in Spain and had a stint with Bolivian club Ingenieros. Professional career=Taranaki Stormers (2002)= In 2002, Abrams moved to New Zealand and joined the Taranaki Stormers of the Conference Basketball League (CBL). He and teammate Willie Banks helped the Stormers win the CBL title that year after defeating the Kaikoura Whale Riders 85‚Äì81 in the grand final. Abrams subsequently earned CBL playoff tournament team honours after averaging 28.3 points and 16.7 rebounds over three games. The win gave Taranaki's bid for renewed National Basketball League (NBL) status the perfect springboard, and in 2003, they were readmitted to the league and took on the \\"Mountainairs\\" nickname. =Taranaki Mountainairs (2003‚Äì2013)=First season Abrams continued on with Taranaki in 2003 and showed he could play as an undersized power player at the higher level. In his first NBL season, he finished co-runner-up for the NBL scoring champion with 28.8 points per game, while also finishing fourth in rebounding with 10.0 boards per game. He appeared in all 18 games for the Mountainairs in 2003, but despite his great individual season, the team finished well outside the playoffs with a 5‚Äì13 win/loss record. He subsequently earned league All-Star Five honours. Following the 2003 season, Abrams gained New Zealand citizenship and attended the Tall Blacks' Olympic trials. Prosperous years Abrams remained with the Mountainairs over the ensuing years, playing in every game for the team between 2004 and 2006. He went on to have a career best year in 2007, earning numerous awards including Co-Kiwi MVP, Most Outstanding Forward and Most Outstanding Kiwi Forward/Centre. He again appeared in all 18 games for the Mountainairs in 2007, averaging 20.4 points and a league-leading 11.5 rebounds per game, earning him the Garry Pettis Memorial Trophy for being the rebounding champion. While the Mountainairs again failed to make the playoffs for the fifth year in a row, Abrams earned All-Star Five honours for a second time. In 2008, Abrams earned Player of the Week honours two times and finished the season as runner-up for rebounding champion with 9.8 boards per game. The Mountainairs again failed to make the playoffs, finishing just outside the top six with a 9‚Äì9 record. Knee injury Over six seasons with the Mountainairs, Abrams appeared in all 108 games. His successful run in the NBL was shattered in the opening game of the 2009 season after rupturing the patellar tendon in his right knee. He underwent surgery the next day and was ruled out for the rest of the season. Without Abrams, the Mountainairs had their worst season in franchise history, finishing the year with a 0‚Äì16 record. Abrams' injury kept him out of the 2010 season as well after the recovery took longer than expected. He returned to the Mountainairs' line-up for the 2011 season and managed to play in all 16 games for the team. Despite the team's disappointing season (finishing second last with a 5‚Äì11 record), Abrams managed to have a decent first year back with 10.8 points and 6.9 rebounds per game, as well as a league-leading .649 field goal percentage. Abrams felt his form in 2011 was mixed, with his assessment being \\"I played well at times. At other times I felt I was just getting used to things again. Probably the two-year break, a little bit of rust.\\" Last two seasons Abrams returned to the Mountainairs in 2012, appearing in all 16 games and averaging 11.7 points and 6.7 rebounds per game. He again couldn't lead the Mountainairs to a playoff berth, finishing just outside the top four with a 7‚Äì9 record. His final season came the following year, where he had his best season since his return from the knee injury. He again appeared in all 16 games for the Mountainairs in 2013, averaging 16.3 points and 8.2 rebounds per game. In his final NBL game on July 6, he recorded 27 points and 18 rebounds in what was a 144‚Äì137 quadruple overtime loss to the Otago Nuggets.

It was developed by Kalpana Seshadrinathan and Alan Bovik in the Laboratory for Image and Video Engineering (LIVE) at The University of Texas at Austin. It was described in print in the 2010 technical paper \\"Motion Tuned Spatio- Temporal Quality Assessment of Natural Videos\\". The original MOVIE paper was accorded an IEEE Signal Processing Society Best Journal Paper Award in 2013.  Model overview  The MOVIE index is a neuroscience-based model for predicting the perceptual quality of a (possibly compressed or otherwise distorted) motion picture or video against a pristine reference video. Thus, the MOVIE index is a full-reference metric. The MOVIE model is quite different from many other models since it uses neuroscience-based models of how the human brain processes visual signals at various stages along the visual pathway, including the lateral geniculate nucleus, primary visual cortex, and in the motion-sensitive extrastriate cortex visual area MT. Spatial MOVIE operates by processing spatial and temporal motion picture information in an approximately separable manner. A prediction of the spatial (frame) quality of a video is found by calculating a space-time frequency decomposition of both reference and test (distorted) videos using a Gabor filter bank. Following a process of divisive normalization based on a model of cortical (area V1) processing in the brain, the processed reference and test videos are combined in a weighted difference to produce a prediction of spatial picture quality. At the same time, a prediction of the temporal (time-varying or inter-frame) motion picture quality is calculated by using the responses of the same Gabor space-time frequency decomposition of reference and test videos, but in a different manner. Temporal MOVIE weights these responses using an excitatory- inhibitory weighting of the Gabor responses to motion-tune them in accordance with a local measurement of video motion. The motion measurements are also made using the space-time filter bank using a perceptually relevant measurement of phase-based optical flow. These measurements on the reference and test videos are then differentially combined and divisively normalized to produce a prediction of temporal picture quality. The overall MOVIE index is then defined as the simple product of the Spatial and Temporal MOVIE indices, pooled over time (frames).  Performance  According to the original paper, MOVIE index delivers better perceptual motion picture quality predictions than do traditional methods such as the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and mean squared error (MSE), which are inconsistent with human visual perception. In the same paper, the authors also show that it performs better than other video quality models such as the ANSI/ISO standard VQM, and the popular Structural Similarity (SSIM) model in terms of motion picture quality prediction performance. In another comparison, the MOVIE Index topped other models in terms of correlation with human judgments of motion picture quality on the LIVE Video Quality Database, which is a tool for assessing the accuracy of picture quality models.  Usage  The MOVIE index is commercially marketed as part of the Video Clarity line of video quality measurements tools that are used throughout the Television and motion picture industries.

The purpose of the pattern is to achieve a high degree of flexibility between components in a strongly typed language where new properties can be added to the object-tree on the fly, without losing the support of type-safety. The pattern makes use of traits to separate different properties of a class into different interfaces. The term \\"document\\" is inspired from document-oriented databases.  Definition  A document is an object that contains a number of properties. A property can for an example be a value like a number or a string, or it can be a list of other documents. Every property is referenced using a key. When traversing the document tree, the user specifies a constructor to be used for creating the implementation class of the next level. The implementations are often a union of various traits that extend the Document interface, making it possible for them to handle setting and getting properties on their own.  Structure  Abstract Document Pattern Example The interface \\"Document\\" states that properties can be edited using the \\"put\\" method, read using the \\"get\\" method and sub-documents can be traversed using the \\"children\\" method. The \\"children\\" method requires a functional reference to a method that can produce a typed view of a child given a map of the data the child should have. The map should be a pointer to the original map so that changes in the view also affect the original document. Implementations can inherit from multiple trait interfaces that describe different properties. Multiple implementations can even share the same map, the only restriction the pattern puts on the design of the implementation is that it must be stateless except for the properties inherited from \\"BaseDocument\\". = Pseudocode = interface Document put(key : String, value : Object) : Object get(key : String) : Object children(key : String, constructor : Map -> T) : T[] abstract class BaseDocument : Document properties : Map constructor(properties : Map) this->properties := properties implement put(key : String, value : Object) : Object return this->properties->put(key, value) implement get(key : String) : Object return this->properties->get(key) implement children(key : String, constructor : Map -> T) : T[] var result := new T[] var children := this->properties->get(key) castTo Map[] foreach ( child in children ) result[] := constructor->apply(child) return result  Usage  The Abstract Document Pattern allows the developer to store variables like configuration settings in an untyped tree structure and operate on the documents using typed views. New views or alternative implementations of views can be created without affecting the internal document structure. The advantage of this is a more loosely coupled system, but it also increases the risk of casting errors as the inherit type of a property is not always certain.  Example implementation  The full implementation of the Abstract Document pattern is available at https://java-design-patterns.com/patterns/abstract-document/. Here are the key classes shortly. Document.java public interface Document { Object put(String key, Object value); Object get(String key); Stream children( String key, Function, T> constructor); ); } BaseDocument.java public abstract class AbstractDocument implements Document { private final Map properties; protected AbstractDocument(Map properties) { Objects.requireNonNull(properties, \\"properties map is required\\"); this.properties = properties; } @Override public Void put(String key, Object value) { properties.put(key, value); return null; } @Override public Object get(String key) { return properties.get(key); } @Override public Stream children(String key, Function, T> constructor) { return Stream.ofNullable(get(key)) .filter(Objects::nonNull) .map(el -> (List>) el) .findAny() .stream() .flatMap(Collection::stream) .map(constructor); } } Usage.java var carProperties = ...; var car = new Car(carProperties); String model = car.getModel().orElseThrow()); int price = car.getPrice().orElseThrow()); var parts = car.getParts(); References Category:Software design patterns ","title":"Abstract Document Pattern"},{"id":"49189928","text":"Donald Hinds (born in 1934) is a Jamaican-born writer, journalist, historian and teacher. He is best known for his work on the West Indian Gazette and his fiction and non-fiction books portraying the West Indian community in Britain, particularly his 1966 work Journey to an Illusion, which has been called a groundbreaking book that \\"captured the plight of Commonwealth immigrants and foresaw the multicultural London of today\\". Biography Hinds was born in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1934 and grew up in a village in the parish of St. Thomas with his grandparents, his mother and stepfather having migrated to Britain.Anne Walmsley, The Caribbean Artists Movement 1966‚Äì1972, New Beacon Books, 1992, p. 22. In 1955, aged 21, he decided to travel to London, England, to join his mother. He had qualified as a probationary teacher in Jamaica but like many other West Indian migrants to the UK was unable to find employment that matched his qualifications. He eventually got a job with London Transport as a bus conductor, working out of Brixton Bus Garage in Streatham Hill. While working on the buses Hinds met Theo Campbell, a local Jamaican businessman who owned London's first Black record shop at 250 Brixton Road. The record shop shared the building with the West Indian Gazette. Campbell introduced Hinds to Claudia Jones, the newspaper's editor, and Hinds began working for the paper in the summer of 1958. As the paper's \\"City Reporter\\", he was a regular contributor until Jones's death in 1964. Between 1959 and 1963 Hinds was also broadcasting on BBC Caribbean, often reading short stories based on his experiences working on the buses. After The Observer published a piece by him on West Indians schoolchildren in Britain, he was approached by a literary agent, which led to the commissioning of a book by Heinemann. Receiving an advance of ¬£100 ‚Äî the equivalent at the time of eight weeks‚Äô wages as a bus conductor ‚Äî Hinds was emboldened to leave his job with London Transport to concentrate on his writings, and Journey to an Illusion: The West Indian in Britain ‚Äî a series of interviews, together with autobiographical writing and social comment ‚Äî was first published in 1966. \\"One of the great works of journalism to have come out of the Jamaican-British encounter\\",Ian Thomson, \\"‚ÄòMother Country: In the Wake of a Dream‚Äô, by Donald Hinds. ‚ÄòWhen I Came to England‚Äô, edited by Z.

It premiered on January 21, 2016, via YouTube, and first aired on televisions in Iowa and New Hampshire shortly before the Democratic Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary. On April 7, 2016, another version of the ad for New York was premiered on YouTube and is aired on television stations in New York before the New York State primaries take place, though with some changes. Content The advertisement features \\"America\\", a song recorded by Simon & Garfunkel for their album Bookends (1968). The ad starts with scenes of everyday American life over soft humming and gentle guitar strumming. As the line \\"let us be lovers, we'll marry our fortunes together\\" plays in the background, a middle-aged couple dances at a small Bernie Sanders for President rally. Then, Sanders is seen speaking to a few people in a backyard. As the ad continues, the crowds grow larger and more enthusiastic. A montage of many Sanders supporters appear, as the words \\"They've all come to look for America\\" flash on the screen. Sanders is then seen addressing a large outdoor gathering, interacting one-on-one with supporters, appearing before more energetic crowds, finally ending in a large auditorium filled to capacity with cheering people. American flags appear frequently throughout the ad. The Sanders campaign paraphernalia is predominantly blue, which is associated with the Democratic party. However, the color red, which is associated with the opposition Republican party, appears as an accent color in almost every shot. The closing scene shows Sanders standing on a stage at a podium as supporters applaud behind him. In the New York version, some scenes were replaced with scenes in New York (including the New Jersey turnpike) while also continued to add different scenes of everyday American life in the opening scene. Production The commercial was created by the advertising firm of Devine, Mulvey, Longabaugh. Use of the song was licensed by Simon and Garfunkel; licensing does not imply endorsement of the Sanders campaign. Garfunkel explained his reasons for permitting the campaign use of his song. In an interview with Politico, two months after the ad debuted, Sanders advisor Tad Devine, attributing the original idea for the ad to fellow Sanders advisor Mark Longabaugh, said that this, the \\"best known\\" Sanders ad, worked so well because Sanders' wife, Jane, had seen an early cut and said: ‚ÄòGee, I really love this, but when Bernie comes in it seems ‚Äî you know, it loses a lot of altitude,‚Äô\\" causing the team to produce an ad that does not show Sanders making a speech until the final frame, and, thereby, an ad that shows the people Sanders is working for, not the candidate. Reception The New York Times pointed out that Bernie Sanders was 74 years old when the ad was released, the same age as Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel, and described the ad as \\"powerful\\" and \\"a love song to America.\\" Rolling Stone called the ad \\"inspirational\\", The Hill called it \\"magnificent\\", Charlie Pierce said it was \\"just about the best political commercial I've ever seen\\", CNN praised it for being \\"so full of love, enthusiasm and patriotic uplift (complete with flag-waving) that it's downright goose bump-inducing\\", and Financial Times postulated that the ad would soften Sanders' \\"cantankerous, angry old man image.\\" The New York Times discusses the ad as part of Sanders' insistence that he is leading not a campaign, but a \\"movement\\", and predicts that the ad will stand out in a year filled with campaign ads \\"cluttered with deep-voiced narrators delivering somber warnings, harsh attacks and swaggering boasts\\", contrasting it in particular with a Hillary Clinton campaign ad released the same week. The ad, created to be shown in the early caucus and primary in Iowa and New Hampshire (predominantly white and rural states), was criticized for showing a mostly white, rural America, with Clinton supporter David Brock asserting the ad shows \\"black lives don't matter much to Bernie Sanders.\\" =Cultural impact= The original version of the ad received a million views on YouTube within 24 hours of being posted there. It made the AdWeek list of top-ten most-watched advertisement for January 2016, and a panel put together by the magazine in late February describe it as the \\"most successful\\" ad in the Democratic campaign to date, attributing the success to the fact that it taps into \\"what people are feeling\\" and \\"concerns possibilities and optimism.\\" According to Amy E. Jasperson, who chairs the department of political science department at Rhodes College, the ad is powerful because \\"[t]he song starts out slowly while the ad shows individual images of small towns, urban landscapes, ordinary people, farmers, and families... as the song builds, the people are brought together. By the end of the ad and the song, the viewer hears and sees the crescendo of huge, cheering, unified crowds.\\" According to Jaserperson, \\"the aspirational lyrics and tone also reference a common search for where people feel we should be going as a country... This ad suggests that Sanders can lead people to that answer.\\" Wired cites it as a leading example of the kind of alternative, online material that is proving more influential than traditional television ads in the 2016 campaign. While Bill McKibben cites it as evidence of why the impact of the Sanders campaign will \\"endure.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Category:2010s television commercials Category:2016 in American television Category:2016 United States Democratic presidential primaries Category:2016 United States presidential election in popular culture Category:2016 works Category:Political mass media in the United States Category:American television commercials Category:Bernie Sanders 2016 presidential campaign Category:Political campaign advertisements Category:Simon & Garfunkel ","title":"America (advertisement)"},{"id":"49190193","text":"Coder is an unincorporated community in Jefferson County, Pennsylvania.

The authorship of this text has been attributed to both Amadeo Bordiga and Martin Axelrad. However, the Programme communiste was a Bordigist (edited by disciples of Amadeo Bordiga) revue, publishing its texts anonymously in order to emphasize its character of a collective work.Bordiga's Auschwitz, or the Great Alibi, note by Mitchell Abidor.International Library of the Communist Left, Auschwitz or the big alibi. The work is seen by some as a form of Holocaust denial, arguing that the Auschwitz concentration camp could not have been created as an extermination camp because the bourgeoisie cannot act without a profit motive and therefore this was a labor camp in which members of the middle class exploited and exterminated other members of the middle class, thereby enabling capitalists to accumulate wealth. However, an actual reading of the text reveals that the existence of death camps were taken for granted and that the goal of the paper was not to deny death camps, but to explain why the bourgeoisie would view the extermination of Jews (and specifically Jews) as profitable. The text does not deny the horrors of the Holocaust, but instead makes the argument that the genocide was \\"a direct result of economic constraint\\".  Author  The article was published in issue 11, dated April‚ÄìJune 1960, of the Programme communiste,Archives de Programme communiste organ of the ICP. The article starts out with a critique of a poster published by the MRAP and largely supports its argument on the book The History of Joel Brand.Bordiga's \\"Auschwitz or the great alibi\\", note by Mitchell Abidor. It was at first published in French, referring to a French context, which in itself made the attribution to the Italian communist Amadeo Bordiga problematic. According to an article in 2010 in Le Prol√©taire, organ of the ICP, its author was in fact Martin Axelrad, a militant French Bordigist and of Jewish origin.¬´ Martin Axelrad ¬ª, Le Prol√©taire, 2010, n¬∞ 497.  Thesis  According to the author, or authors, of this article, the Nazis did not exterminate the Jews because they were Jews, but because they were an important group within the petite bourgeoisie, a social class condemned to disappear by the concentration of capital; and antisemitism in its modern form developed within that same petite bourgeoisie in an attempt to preserve itself as a class by sacrificing a particular part of itself. Concentrated German capital interests, when confronted with the economic crisis, it is claimed, saw this development as a windfall: \\"It could liquidate part of its petite bourgeoisie with the consent of the petite bourgeoisie, or even better, have the petite bourgeoisie itself take charge of this liquidation\\". Thus, according to the author(s), antisemitism was determined by socioeconomic conditions: The article refers to Adolf Eichmann's offer to \\"sell a million Jews\\" as related by the American relief worker Joel Brand to support the claim that the Nazis at first tried to get rid of the Jewish population by expelling them and that no other countries were prepared to receive them as these other countries were confronted with the same problems concerning their petite bourgeoisie. As the war aggravated the whole situation, the concentrated capital forces of Germany ended up organising the extermination of the Jews. The phrase \\"Auschwitz or the great alibi\\" refers to the more specific claim that after the war the Shoah was made use of in order to demobilize the working class as part of a propaganda effort establishing a belief that the \\"antifascist democracies\\" were of an entirely different nature from fascism, making the working class forget, by being exposed to the relics of the extermination, that these were in fact the outcome of the same logic of capitalism that they themselves also were obeying. In this perspective, the exhortations to fight fascism in the name of democracy were in fact a lure destined to make the proletariat forget that their true enemy is and continues to be the capitalist system: It is in this sense that \\"Nazi barbarism\\" would be the \\"great alibi\\" of the capitalist democracies.  Reception  The theses of Auschwitz or the great alibi have been contested by several organisations of the extreme left, notably those with a main objective of fighting the extreme right.¬´ Nouvelles attaques contre Auschwitz ou le grand alibi ¬ª, Le Prol√©taire, n¬∞454, juillet-ao√ªt 2000. On the other hand, the activist Pierre Guillaume, an adherent of Socialisme ou Barbarie, later with the Pouvoir ouvrier, referred to this text as part of a first stage that later led him to support negationism (disavowed by the ICP). This has made some say (notably Daniel Lindenberg,Daniel Lindenberg wrote (in √Ä gauche de la gauche, Histoire des gauches en France, √âditions La D√©couverte, Paris, 2004 ; volume 2 : \\"But it was the bordigists, in 1960, that \\"invented\\" what was to become the \\"negationism\\" specific to the ultra-left, above all that of La Vieille Taupe\\".

It is part of the River Derwent catchment area. The River Hertford starts close to Muston near the seaside town of Filey. Despite being only from the North Sea (to its eastern side) the river flows westwards for into the River Derwent at Haybridge. It has been referred to as a 'backward-flowing river' because it flows away from the sea. Ekwall suggests the name derives from a ford over the river, which became the name by back formation. Star Carr, a Mesolithic archaeological site, lies close to the river. Star Carr was on the edge of a nine-thousand year old Stone Age wetland known a Lake Flixton. This area is now known as the River Hertford Floodplain and extends from Muston in the east to Ganton in the west. Originally the river meandered, but the Muston & Yedingham Drainage Act 1800 resulted in the River Derwent and the River Hertford being straightened by cutting a new course for each. The Hertford was hand dug during the industrial revolution (local stories hold that the men who dug the new channel were prisoners from the Napoleonic Wars). The River Hertford catchment suffers from the discharges of three sewage plants at Folkton, Hunmanby and Seamer. This not only affects the quality of the river but also that of the Derwent downstream of Haybridge.

The battle was a major Byzantine victory. According to the 10th-century chronicler Theophanes Continuatus‚Äîwhose work was later reused almost without change by the 11th-century historian John Skylitzes‚Äîin the early years of the reign of the Emperor Basil I the Macedonian (), the Arab emir of Crete, Shu'ayb (\\"Saet\\" in Greek), son of the founder of the emirate, Abu Hafs, sent a Greek renegade called Photios, \\"a warlike and energetic fellow\\", on a major raiding expedition against the Byzantine Empire. The fleet led by Photios comprised over 50 vessels, including 27 heavy vessels (koumbaria) and many lighter galleys. This fleet plundered the shores of the Aegean Sea, looting and taking prisoners to be sold as slaves, and even penetrated into the Propontis and reached Prokonnesos, in the vicinity of Constantinople; the first time since the Second Arab Siege of Constantinople in 717‚Äì718 that a Muslim fleet had come so close to the Byzantine capital. The Byzantine response was headed by the droungarios of the Fleet, Niketas Ooryphas, who met the Saracen fleet in battle off Kardia, in the Gulf of Saros. The battle was a major victory for the Byzantines, who destroyed twenty Saracen vessels through the use of Greek fire, and forced the rest to flee back to Crete. Some time after this defeat, Photios led another raid against Greece, but Ooryphas once again caught up with him and destroyed his fleet, killing Photios. The dating of these events is unclear; Ekkehard Eickhoff (Seekrieg und Seepolitik zwischen Islam und Abendland, 1966) and Dimitris Tsoungarakis (Byzantine Crete: From the 5th Century to the Venetian Conquest, 1988) place the battle at Kardia in 872, while Warren Treadgold (A History of the Byzantine State and Society) and John Pryor and Elizabeth Jeffreys (The Age of the ŒîŒ°ŒüŒúŒ©Œù: The Byzantine Navy ca. 500‚Äì1204) place it in .

This volume was published in 1924. Nesth√§kchen is Annemarie Braun, a Berlin doctor's daughter, a slim, golden blond, quintessential German girl. The series follows Annemarie from infancy (Nesth√§kchen and Her Dolls) to old age and grandchildren (Nesth√§kchen with White Hair).Jennifer Redmann. Nostalgia and Optimism in Else Ury's \\"Nesth√§kchen\\" Books for Young Girls in the Weimar Republic. The German Quarterly, Vol. 79, No. 4 (Fall, 2006), pp. 465-483 Nesth√§kchens J√ºngste describes Anne Marie's life as her youngest child, Ursel, grows up and marries. Plot summary Temporal logic cast aside, Else Ury begins Volume 8 in 1945, but when she mentions the World War she means World War One, not World War Two, which she could not foresee and would not survive. Since the previous volume, 15 years have passed. Annemarie's physician husband Rudolf is now Privy Counsel and Professor. Daughter Vronli, serious, sensible, hard- working and humble, is a maternity nurse in Munich. Brother Hans‚Äô son, a poor student, is about to graduate and does not want to study medicine, contrary to the wishes of his father, but wants to be a farmer like his admired Uncle Klaus. The main character is the youngest daughter, Ursel, seventeen, who has just graduated from school and is very similar to Annemarie. Ursel has a beautiful voice and wants to be a singer, but her father insists that she start as a bank clerk. The difficult situation between father and daughter escalates angrily for a time, but Annemarie smoothes the waves and devises a compromise: Ursel joins the bank, but takes singing lessons from an aging opera diva. Annemarie's brother Klaus is married to Ilse and has four sons, while Marlene and Peter are parents of three daughters. Brother Hans is lonely since the death of his wife Ola, and has two wild sons. Annemarie's girlfriend Margot is his housekeeper and a little later his second wife. Annemarie's mother is widowed and considerably aged by grief. Since her apartment is too big for her and old Hanne, her cook, she takes in travelers, among them two rich Brazilian siblings, Milton and Margarida Tavares, children of a coffee plantation owner. The two meet Ursel and befriend her. Ursel and Milton fall in love, but Ursel fears leaving Germany. Ursel soon feels increasingly uncomfortable at the bank, and has a collision with her supervisor, much to the dismay of her parents. Everything eventually works out when her father‚Äôs patient, Music Professor Lange, hears Ursel singing and asks Rudolf Hartenstein to let Ursel attend the Conservatory. When Ursel is allowed to substitute at a major concert for a singer who became ill, she seems to be at the beginning of a great career. Ultimately, she realizes that her love is stronger than her singing voice. She marries Milton Tavares and goes with him to Brazil. Annemarie soldiers on despite her own pain at the separation. Numerous letters home describe Ursel‚Äôs new life, and at the end of the story she becomes the mother of twins Anita and Marietta, each named after their grandmother Annemarie. Similarities to Der Trotzkopf of Emmy von Rhoden Nesth√§kchen‚Äôs Youngest shows substantive similarities with the earlier Der Trotzkopf series. As daughter Ruth is Mother Ilse's copy, Ursel is Annemarie's younger self. Like Ruth Gontrau, Ursel Hartenstein also dreams of a singing career. Even the emigration to America is in Der Trotzkopf. There, Margaret's daughter Marianne is engaged to Fritz, who has become a successful businessman in America, and goes with him to San Francisco. After many years of separation, their American children return to Germany. Genre Else Ury, 1915 The Nesth√§kchen books represent a German literary genre, the Backfischroman, a girls' novel that describes maturation and was intended for readers 12 ‚Äì 16 years old. A Backfisch (‚Äúteenage girl‚Äù, literally ‚Äúfish for frying‚Äù) is a young girl between fourteen and seventeen years of age. The Backfischroman was in fashion between 1850 and 1950. It dealt overwhelmingly with stereotypes, traditional social images of growing girls absorbing societal norms. The stories ended in marriage, with the heroine becoming a Hausfrau. Among the most successful Backfischroman authors, beside Else Ury, were Magda Trott, Emmy von Rhoden with her Der Trotzkopf and Henny Koch. Ury intended to end the Nesth√§kchen series with volume 6, Nesth√§kchen Flies From the Nest, describing Nesth√§kchen's marriage. Meidingers Jugendschriften Verlag, her Berlin publisher, was inundated with a flood of letters from Ury's young fans, begging for more Nesth√§kchen stories. After some hesitation, Ury wrote four more Nesth√§kchen volumes, and included comments about her initial doubts in an epilogue to volume 7, Nesth√§kchen and Her Chicks. Author Else Ury (November 1, 1877 in Berlin; January 13, 1943 in the Auschwitz concentration camp) was a German writer and children's book author. Her best- known character is the blonde doctor's daughter Annemarie Braun, whose life from childhood to old age is told in the ten volumes of the highly successful Nesth√§kchen series. The books, the six-part TV series Nesth√§kchen (1983), based on the first three volumes, as well as the new DVD edition (2005) caught the attention of millions of readers and viewers.Patricia M.

M√©taboles was composed in 1963‚Äì64 and was first performed by Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra on 14 January 1965.  Description  In the early 1960s, Dutilleux wanted to move away from traditional musical forms and develop new structures that changed according to the internal logic of a particular piece. It is with this central concern in mind, a concern that the work's very title indicates, that he began to compose M√©taboles. In the composer's own words: In other words, throughout the work, various melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic ideas are presented and then gradually modified to the point that they transform into something radically different and undergo a complete change of nature. This new idea then serves as the basis for the next series of metamorphosis. The piece is cast in five overlapping movements that are played without pause. Each section, except the last one, highlights a particular instrumental group, allowing M√©taboles to be described as concerto for orchestra. It opens with a series of chords played by the woodwinds and centered on E natural, with short interjections by pizzicato strings and harp. The sound world is reminiscent of Stravinsky's early \\"Russian Period\\". The strings pick up a variant of the melody for a brief moment and this variant is then elaborated on in the radiant second movement, wholly dedicated to divisi strings. Similarly, an idea presented in a double bass solo becomes the seed for the third movement, which is dominated by brass instruments and in the fourth movement, percussions outline a slowed-down reminiscence of the preceding section. Finally, the fifth movement brings all the instruments together. It combines various melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic elements from the first four sections before reinstating the E natural chords heard at the very beginning and then rushing to an exhilarating coda.  Movements  The work is in five linked movements. Dutilleux indicates that \\"towards the end of each piece, a new motif appears as a filigree under the symphonic texture and 'sets the bait' for the next piece, and so on...\\".  Instrumentation  M√©taboles is scored for four flutes (3rd & 4th doubling piccolos), three oboes, cor anglais, two B-flat clarinets, E-flat clarinet, bass clarinet, three bassoons, contrabassoon, four horns, four trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, percussion (temple blocks, snare drum, tom-toms, bass drum, small suspended cymbal, Chinese cymbal, tam-tams, crash cymbals, triangle, cowbell, xylophone, glockenspiel), celesta, harp and strings.

Currently, it is also known as the \\"Admiral N√ñ-Meistercup\\". The football cup was one of the highlights, next to the championship, in the late 1920s to the 1950s in Lower Austria. After several interruptions, the competition has been held every year since 1984, under the official name of the N√ñ-Meistercup. Eligible teams to participate in the competition are the champion clubs of each of the Lower Austrian leagues. Organization The Lower Austrian Football Cup takes place after a qualifying round which is made up of five rounds, including the finals. The winner automatically qualifies for the 1st round of the next Austrian Cup. Eligible clubs are the champions of all leagues up to the 2nd division. The draw for the first round takes place in geographical terms. Clubs from the 2nd and 3rd division have, until the 3rd round, the rights to home advantage if they have to play against champions from the 2nd national league and area leagues. The champions of the country leagues have to also play abroad in the 2nd round, when they play against teams from the area leagues. For the semi- finals, the first drawn club has the option of home or away. History=The Landescup 1927-1975= The Lower Austrian Football Association was founded as an independent federation in the 1922. Before this time, it was a part of the Austrian Football Association, which also was the organizer of the Austrian Championships and the Austrian Cup. Although the N√ñFV had a joint management with the Austrian Football Association, it organized, for the 1922-23 season, the first Lower Austrian Championship. The football cup was introduced by the N√ñFV in 1926 and carried out for the first time in 1927. After the temporary union of the Vienna Football Association and the N√ñFV, the competition was set and reintroduced in 1931. With a few brief interruptions, the football cup was held yearly until 1941, until it had to be stopped because of World War II.

A passenger travelling from to , for example, would change at Siddick Junction. As a purely exchange station - like and elsewhere in the country - the owning companies would not need to provide road or footpath access or ticketing facilities as no passengers were invited to enter or leave the station except by train. Ten years later, in 1890, the community of Siddick had grown sufficiently to justify upgrading the station to handle the full range of passengers. The station was officially \\"Siddick Junction\\" but Bradshaw referred to it as plain \\"Siddick\\". History The coastal line through Siddick had existed for years when the C&WJR; was built in the late 1870s. The new line was one of the fruits of the rapid industrialisation of West Cumberland in the second half of the nineteenth century, specifically being born as a reaction to oligopolistic behaviour by the London and North Western and Whitehaven, Cleator and Egremont Railways. It was originally intended to drive the new line northwards across country to meet the Caledonian Railway and cross into Scotland by the Solway Viaduct, but an accommodation was made with the LNWR leading to the intended northern extension being greatly watered down to a line through and the short link from to Siddick. All lines in the area were primarily aimed at mineral traffic, notably iron ore, coal and limestone, none more so than the new line through to Siddick, where the junction was a general goods and passenger junction, but much more so a freight junction. The line earned the local name \\"The Track of the Ironmasters\\". The founding Act of Parliament of June 1878 confirmed the company's agreement with the Furness Railway that the latter would operate the line for one third of the receipts. The line and station became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway at the Grouping of 1923. The new line closed to passengers eight years later under this management, at a stroke depriving Siddick Junction of its greater passenger traffic. Though Siddick had grown it did not sustain the station on its own, so it closed in 1934. There were sidings by the C&WJR; lines to the southeast of the platforms, as well as an engine shed which opened with the line and closed in 1923 following a fire. Services C&WJR; passenger trains consisted of antiquated Furness stock hauled largely by elderly Furness engines referred to as \\"rolling ruins\\" by one author after a footplate ride in 1949. Most LNWR trains which called at Siddick were \\"Parliamentaries\\" calling at all stations. They had rolling stock which the company felt matched this provision. No Sunday passenger service was ever provided on the C&WJR; line. The 1922 timetable shows no LNWR trains calling at Siddick. The initial passenger service in 1880 consisted of * three up trains a day, leaving Moor Row at 07:40, 10:12 and 14:45, taking 30 minutes to Workington and an extra four to proceed to Siddick, where connections were made with northbound trains on the coastal line. * Down trains left Siddick at 08:45, 12:22 and 17:00 By 1922 the service reached its high water mark, with five Up trains a day from Moor Row through to Siddick, leaving Moor Row at 07:20, 09:50, 13:15, 16:50 and 1820, all matched by Down workings. All C&WJR; trains to and from Siddick made good connections with LNWR services, for example the 07:20 ex-Moor Row terminated at Siddick Junction at 07:54. A train for most stations to Carlisle called at 08:04. This also applied southbound. In 1922 three LNWR coastal trains in both directions called at the station at times when no C&WJR; trains were timetabled, with a fourth on Mondays only. An intermittent source of passenger revenue was people going to the beach at Siddick, in full sight and smell of the Steelworks, which was, after all, part of people's everyday lives. As with advertised passenger trains, in 1920 workmen's trains ran on the W%CJR from Siddick Junction to Moor Row, calling at all passenger stations except Moresby Parks, calling at instead. The 1920 Working Time Table shows relatively few Goods trains, with just one \\"Through goods\\" a day in each direction booked to pass Siddick. Mineral traffic was an altogether different matter, dwarfing all other traffic in volume, receipts and profits. The key source summarises it \\"...the 'Track of the Ironmasters' ran like a main traffic artery through an area honeycombed with mines, quarries and ironworks.\\" The associated drama was all the greater because all the company's lines abounded with steep inclines and sharp curves, frequently requiring banking. The saving grace was that south of Workington at least, most gradients favoured loaded trains. During the First World War especially, the company ran \\"Double Trains\\", akin to North American practice, with two mineral trains coupled together and a banking engine behind, i.e. locomotive-wagons- guards van-locomotive-wagons-guards van-banker. Such trains worked regularly between and . The practice was discontinued after dark from 1 April 1918. Most stations on C&WJR; lines had heavy industrial neighbours, such as ironworks next to Cleator Moor West, or served primarily industrial workforces, such as Keekle Colliers' Platform. Siddick Junction followed this pattern, with sidings, and engine shed, steelworks, a colliery and a dock within sight of the station. Like any business tied to one or few industries, the C&WJR; was particularly at the mercy of trade fluctuations and technological change. The Cumberland iron industry led the charge in the nineteenth century, but became less and less competitive as time passed and local ore became worked out and harder to win, taking the fortunes of the railway with it. The peak year was 1909, when the C&WJR; handled 1,644,514 tons of freight. Ominously for the line, that tonnage was down to just over 800,000 by 1922, bringing receipts of ¬£83,349, compared with passenger fares totalling ¬£6,570. Rundown and closure The high water mark for tonnage on the C&WJR; was 1909, the high water mark for progress was 1913, with the opening of the Harrington and Lowca line for passenger traffic. A chronology of the line's affairs from 1876 to 1992 has almost no entries before 1914 which fail to include \\"opened\\" or \\"commenced\\". After 1918 the position was reversed, when the litany of step-by- step closures and withdrawals was relieved only by a control cabin and a signalbox being erected at Harrington Junction in 1919 and the Admiralty saving the northern extension in 1937 by establishing an armaments depot at Broughton. Passenger services to Workington Central and beyond ended on 13 April 1931 when normal passenger traffic ended along the C&WJR.; Siddick Jnction station closed to all passengers three years later. Diversions and specials, for example to football matches, made use of the C&WJR; line, but it was not easy to use as a through north-south route because all such trains would have to reverse at Moor Row or . An enthusiasts' special reversed at Siddick on 6 September 1954 to gain access to the C&WJR; line, the only one to traverse the C&WJR; using main line passenger stock. The next such train to traverse any C&WJR; metals did so in 1966 turning onto the north end of the remains of the C&WJR; at Siddick Junction, a year after the line through Workington Central closed. The last C&WJR; metals to carry trains was accessed through Siddick Junction, followed by reversal at Calva Junction to gain access to the line through Seaton (Cumbria). This was the originally enfeebled Northern Extension which had been made all but redundant by the Workington Central to Siddick Junction connection. Ironically this outlived all other C&WJR; lines by nearly thirty years as the result of the Royal Navy using its combination of remoteness and dock access to establish an arms store at RNAD Broughton Moor. Afterlife The coastal route through Siddick Junction is very much a live railway. In 2009 bridges over the River Derwent were washed away. The temporary was built a short distance south of the site of Siddick Junction. In 2013 satellite images showed little trace of Siddick Junction station.

The cold blob in the North Atlantic (also called the North Atlantic warming hole) describes a cold temperature anomaly of ocean surface waters, affecting the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) which is part of the thermohaline circulation, possibly related to global warming-induced melting of the Greenland ice sheet. General AMOC is driven by ocean temperature and salinity differences. The major possible mechanism causing the cold ocean surface temperature anomaly is based on the fact that freshwater decreases ocean water salinity, and through this process prevents colder waters sinking. Observed freshwater increase originates probably from Greenland ice melt. Research=2015 and earlier= AMOC- Index since 900 CE with pronounced slowdown since ~1850; Rahmstorf et al. (2015) Climate scientists Michael Mann of Penn State and Stefan Rahmstorf from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research suggested that the observed cold pattern during years of temperature records is a sign that the Atlantic Ocean's Meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) may be weakening. They published their findings, and concluded that the AMOC circulation shows exceptional slowdown in the last century, and that Greenland melt is a possible contributor. Tom Delworth of NOAA suggested that natural variability, which includes different modes, here namely the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation through wind driven ocean temperatures are also a factor. A 2014 study by Jon Robson et al. from the University of Reading concluded about the anomaly, \\"...suggest that a substantial change in the AMOC is unfolding now.\\" Another study by Didier Swingedouw concluded that the slowdown of AMOC in the 1970s may have been unprecedented over the last millennium. =2016= A study published in 2016, by researchers from the University of South Florida, Canada and the Netherlands, used GRACE satellite data to estimate freshwater flux from Greenland. They concluded that freshwater runoff is accelerating, and could eventually cause a disruption of AMOC in the future, which would affect Europe and North America. Another study published in 2016, found further evidence for a considerable impact from sea level rise for the U.S. East Coast. The study confirms earlier research findings which identified the region as a hotspot for rising seas, with a potential to divert 3‚Äì4 times higher than the global average sea level rise rate. The researchers attribute the possible increase to an ocean circulation mechanism called deep water formation, which is reduced due to AMOC slow down, leading to more warmer water pockets below the surface. Additionally the study noted; \\"Our results suggest that higher carbon emission rates also contribute to increased [sea level rise] in this region compared to the global average.\\" Background In 2005, British researchers noticed that the net flow of the northern Gulf Stream had decreased by about 30% since 1957. Coincidentally, scientists at Woods Hole had been measuring the freshening of the North Atlantic as Earth becomes warmer. Their findings suggested that precipitation increases in the high northern latitudes, and polar ice melts as a consequence. By flooding the northern seas with excessive fresh water, global warming could, in theory, divert the Gulf Stream waters that usually flow northward, past the British Isles and Norway, and cause them to instead circulate toward the equator. Were this to happen, Europe's climate would be seriously impacted. Don Chambers from the USF College of Marine Science mentioned, \\"The major effect of a slowing AMOC is expected to be cooler winters and summers around the North Atlantic, and small regional increases in sea level on the North American coast.\\" James Hansen and Makiko Sato stated, \\"AMOC slowdown that causes cooling ~1¬∞C and perhaps affects weather patterns is very different from an AMOC shutdown that cools the North Atlantic several degrees Celsius; the latter would have dramatic effects on storms and be irreversible on the century time scale.\\" Downturn of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, has been tied to extreme regional sea level rise.

In 1958, three of his paintings represented Czechoslovak art at the World Exhibition in Brussels. Michl, being a free-minded and anticommunist spirit, was imprisoned in Plze≈à Prison in 1961. The trial was based on the accusation that Michl listened to Radio Liberty, which was considered by the totalitarian regime as treason. His name was blacklisted and his family persecuted. The diminished political pressure in 1967 opened new prospects for Michl's art in Czechoslovakia and abroad. In March 1968 his paintings were exhibited in Montreal. The Rullos Gallery in New York bought 165 paintings in November 1968. Unfortunately, preparation of Michl's exhibition in the London National Gallery was interrupted by the Soviet invasion in August 1968. The time of normalization brought back the ban on Michl's name. Michl was not allowed to publicly display his art (though several illegal exhibitions, organized by his friends, took place, camouflaged under fake titles, for example \\"Successes of building socialism\\"). After his first brain stroke in 1972, which left half of his body paralyzed, Michl kept painting. It was only after his sixth stroke that Michl remained permanently bedridden until his death on June 4, 1977. In 1991, Franti≈°ek Michl's name was fully politically rehabilitated, and his contribution to the anti-fascist and anticommunist resistance was recognized. Michl's work, however, is still awaiting public recognition. Gallery File:Michl ExLibris Kukral.St.jpgFranti≈°ek Michl: Ex Libris Stanislav Kukr√°l.

It was discovered in 2010 during a survey of rainforests in the northern part of the Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania. It is present at a single location in the Kindoroko and Minja Forest Reserves in the Pare Mountains. The forest area in which this frog lives is a remnant patch of a larger forest with trees in the surrounding area being felled for agricultural development, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated the frog's conservation status as \\"critically endangered\\". Description Callulina laphami is a robust species of brevicipitid frog with a plump body and distinctive ridges of glands on its arms and legs. It has no tympani and no enlarged pads on the tips of its fingers and toes. Males have a snout-to-vent length of while females vary from . This frog's dorsal surface is dark brown, its flanks are tan and its ventral surface yellowish-cream. In most individuals there is a red-coloured band between the eyes, but in some individuals, this band is green. The call, emitted by the male, is a rapid series of pulsed trills. Distribution This frog is known only from a single block of undisturbed forest in the northern Pare Mountains near the border between Kenya and Tanzania, at altitudes between ; the forest block is formed by the Kindoroko and Minja Forest Reserves and is surrounded by land that has been cleared for settlement. Ecology C. laphami is found in humid montane forests, sometimes occurring in the vicinity of streams and sometimes on drier ridges. It hides under rocks or logs during the day and at night can be found clambering in bushes and low trees a metre or two off the ground. Its breeding habits are unknown but it is likely that juvenile frogs develop directly from eggs laid on the ground without an intervening larval stage. Status The block of forest in which C. laphami lives has an area of about and is surrounded by cleared land which is unsuitable habitat for this forest- dwelling species. Although the forest parcel consists of two forest reserves where the frog receives some protection, small-scale logging and human encroachment continues inside the reserve boundaries. At the moment the frog is present in reasonable numbers but its restricted range makes it at risk from even small alterations to its environment, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as \\"critically endangered\\".

Life He was born in Paris, the younger brother of the flute-player Joseph-Henri Alt√®s. Sons of a soldier and brought up in the regiment, the boys were taught by their father to play the violin and fife from their earliest years. At age 12, Alt√®s wrote an air with variations for violin and piano, which was shown to Fran√ßois Habeneck, and procured his entrance into the Paris Conservatory. In 1843 he entered Habeneck's violin class; two years later he gained a second accessit for violin, in 1847 the second prize, and in the following year the first prize. In 1849 he obtained a second prize for harmony under Fran√ßois Bazin, after which he spent some time in studying advanced composition with Michele Carafa. From 1845 onwards he played in the Paris Opera band, and in 1846 was admitted to the Orchestre de la Soci√©t√© des Concerts du Conservatoire. In 1871 Alt√®s was appointed deputy conductor at the Opera in place of √âdouard Deldevez, who had just given up his post after twelve years' work. Fran√ßois George-Hainl was at this time conductor of the Opera, but at his death in 1873 Deldevez, who in the preceding year replaced Hainl as conductor at the Conservatory, was recalled. In 1877 Deldevez was succeeded at the opera by Charles Lamoureux, who being unable to agree with the new director, Auguste Vaucorbeil, retired at the end of 1879. Alt√®s, who was still deputy conductor, was now appointed conductor, and almost immediately gave up his post at the Soci√©t√© des Concerts, which he had held since 1877.

Twistor theory Twistor space is the geometry that results from solutions of Twistor equations. In 1967 Roger Penrose developed a general relativity approach called Twistor theory to apply to the study of quantum gravity. This theory proposes that the relationship between events in spacetime is crucial and focuses on causes as key to understanding the byproducts of these events.

It was a part of Gallipoli Campaign fought on the Anatolian (Asian) part of the Dardanelles Strait as a diversion from the main landings on the Gallipoli peninsula (European side of the strait). Kumkale during the naval campaign On 17 February 1915, a British seaplane from flew a reconnaissance sortie over the Straits. Two days later, the first attack on the Dardanelles began when a strong Anglo-French task force, including the British battleship , began a long-range bombardment of Ottoman artillery along the coast. A period of bad weather slowed the initial phase but by 25 February the outer forts had been reduced and the entrance cleared of mines. Royal Marines were landed to destroy guns at Kum Kale on the northern Asian coast and at Sedd el Bahr on the southern tip of the Gallipoli Peninsula, while the naval bombardment shifted to batteries between Kum Kale and Kephez. On 18 March 1915, the main attack was launched, the fleet, comprising with a supporting array of cruisers and destroyers, sought to target the narrowest point of the Dardanelles, where the straits are wide. Despite some damage sustained by ships engaging the Ottoman forts, minesweepers were ordered to proceed along the straits. According to an account by the Ottoman General Staff, by 2:00 p.m. \\"all telephone wires were cut, all communications with the forts were interrupted, some of the guns had been knocked out ... in consequence the artillery fire of the defence had slackened considerably\\". The was sunk by a mine, causing it to capsize with her crew of over . Minesweepers manned by civilians, under the constant fire of Ottoman shells, retreated, leaving the minefields largely intact. and were badly damaged by mines, although there was confusion during the battle about the cause of the damage, some blamed torpedoes. , sent to rescue the Irresistible, was also damaged by an explosion, and both ships eventually sank. The French battleships and were also damaged; the ships had sailed through a new line of mines placed secretly by the Ottoman minelayer Nusret ten days before. The losses forced de Robeck to sound the \\"general recall\\" to save what remained of his force. The defeat of the British fleet had given the Ottomans a morale boost and planning to capture the Turkish defences by land began. Prelude=Ottoman preparations= The Ottoman side was aware of the landing plans and the landing force which was waiting in the island of Lemnos. A new Ottoman army (5th Army) was established. The German general Liman von Sanders, the military advisor of the Ottoman headquarters (later the commander of the 5th Army) determined that the main landing would be made in the Anatolian side as well as in Bolayƒ±r, a narrow isthmus in the European side. So most of the 5th Army troops were situated in Anatolian side and in Bolayƒ±r. Although Mustafa Kemal, then the commander of the 19th Division saw the Gallipoli peninsula in the European side as the main landing area, he couldn't persuade the headquarters. Thus three Ottoman divisions of the 5th Army (3, 5 and 11) were situated in the Anatolian side of the strait. =Allied preparations= General Ian Hamilton, the commander of the Allied landing forces decided to land in two points, both in Gelibolu peninsula. But he also decided to make lesser landings in two places just as von Sanders anticipated. The purpose of these two lesser landings was to deceive the Ottoman side and delay any support to the Ottoman forces in the main landing sites. Another purpose of the Anatolian side campaign was to prevent the Ottoman Anatolian artillery to bombard the Allied troops in the Landing at Cape Helles (Sedd√ºlbahir) in Gelibolu peninsula. Hamilton commissioned the French troops for this task. However, there was disagreement about the exact location of the landing site. Albert d'Amade, commander of the French forces proposed a larger scale operation with landing in Edremit, sitƒ±uated far to the south. Hamilton however insisted on a landing closer to the strait. The commander of the landing forces was Colonel Ruef. He had the three battalions of the 6th Mixed Colonial Regiment (from the Corps exp√©ditionnaire d'Orient) as well as a battalion and auxiliary units under his command. The naval forces which supported this regiment consisted of 3 cruisers and 9 destroyers. While HMS Prince George was tasked to bomb the artilleries at the Anatolian side of the strait, the French battleships supported the landing. Battle=Landing at Kumtepe= The naval bombardment began at 5.15 on 25 April 1915 by the French battleships Jaur√©guiberry and Henri IV, the French armoured cruiser Jeanne d‚ÄôArc and the Russian cruiser Askold. The target of the bombardment was the village of Kumkale at .Kumkale map Kumkale is situated at the southern end of the Anatolian side of the strait. At 10.00 the first French troops (10th and 11th Senagalese companies) landed at Kumkale. In Kumkale there was only one Ottoman platoon. Towards the night the French regiment formed a bridgehead at Kumkale. =Clashes in Kumkale= Because of Be≈üige bombardment, and fear of another landing in Be≈üige, another possible landing site to the south, most of the 11th Ottoman division was unable to deploy in Kumkale. But Lieutenant Colonel Nurettin Bey, the commander of the 39th Ottoman regiment, counterattacked two times during the night, which resulted in failure, mostly due to friendly fire. Towards the morning, 39th regiment finally defeated the French forces. The French side sued for surrender. However, during negotiations, which were hampered by the language barrier, the sun rose and the navy opened fire, resulting in heavy casualties on the Ottoman side. The Ottoman regiment withdrew to reorganise. On the other hand, after the French withdrawal from Be≈üige, 11th division also prepared to attack. Hamilton ordered retreat from Anatolian positions and on the night of 26/27 April, Kumkuyu was evacuated by the French forces. =Be≈üige/Besika Bay= On the night of six French troop transports, with two destroyers and a torpedo boat, appeared off Besika Bay (now Be≈üik Bay, √áanakkale), about south of Kumkale. The warships commenced a bombardment and boats were lowered from the transports, to simulate a disembarkation. At the cruiser Jeanne d'Arc arrived and joined in the bombardment, before the force was recalled to Bozcaada at Be≈üige map Aftermath=Analysis= The Ottoman garrison was detained in the area until 27 April, although the Turkish Official Account recorded that the landings at Kum Kale and the demonstration at Besika Bay had been recognised as ruses. Transfers of troops from the Asiatic shore was delayed by lack of boats and the fear of Allied submarines, rather than apprehension about landings on the Asiatic side. It was not until 29 April, that troops from the area appeared on the Helles front.Be≈üige map After the landings, the Ottoman commander, General Weber Pasha was criticised for being caught unprepared, poor tactics, failures of communication and leadership, although the flat terrain had made accurate bombardment from offshore much easier. =Casualties= Casualties of the Ottoman side (including missing) were 1,735 men and French casualties were 786.

His artwork encompasses various themes from landscapes and architecture painted both in his native Ireland and on foreign travels, through still life to the floral and figurative works. Biography=Early years= Gerard Byrne was born in Finglas, Dublin, Ireland to parents Brendan and Kathleen. His father worked for many years as a self-employed customs agent, while his mother \\"Kay\\" reared the family of six: Brendan, Miriam, Gerard, Pauline, Janette and Irene. He attended the Sacred Heart school in Glasnevin, then the City Quay School and the St Kevin's Christian Brothers in Ballygall. Unrecognised and untreated dyslexia prevented him from making the most out of the school education. However his artistic talents had been recognised, and from an early age he was encouraged to draw. He wanted to enter the art college but was too young at the time to be accepted. At the age of 14 he left school and got his first job at Clery's, a landmark department store on O'Connell Street, where he worked as a lift boy for 4 years. Byrne made an attempt to enter an art college but not having sufficient qualifications he got refused. Following his parents' advice to get a \\"real job\\" he started an apprenticeship as an electrician. It led him to obtain his dream job: a lighthouse technician. Between 1978 and 1982 he mastered the trade but the innate curiosity made him move on in his life. He decided to leave a well paid pensionable post and in 1982 together with his best friend Fran organised a road trip to Australia in a vintage Volkswagen camper van. The two travelled across Europe but got stuck in Turkey when the visas to Iran had been refused due to the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. They made their way to Athens, sold the van in Greece and took a plane to Australia. The two hitchhiked around the continent and made their way to Darwin where both got jobs as flying electricians installing generators in aboriginal settlements. From Australia Gerard made his way back home via Asia, travelling through Indonesia, Burma, India and Russia mostly by train and then flew back from Moscow. =Towards life as an artist= Back in Dublin, Byrne continued working as an electrician taking various day time jobs. The longing to be a painter became predominant though. Gradually he developed an idea to leave the recession hit Ireland and travel to America to earn some money. His plan was to purchase an inexpensive house in an inner city and focus on becoming a full-time artist. Very determined to make his dream come true Gerard left for New York and worked tirelessly as an electrician for about two years. Upon his return to Dublin he spent all his savings on a cheap flat in the Liberties. Committed to sticking to his plan he led a humble life and focused on drawing and painting. He would mostly spend time in the local market, painting the people and the local scenes. Gerard befriended local traders, who were supportive of his art and even fed him, often leaving boxes of fresh fruit and vegetables on his doorstep. Finding it hard to support himself he took an electrician job again. However an electric shock that nearly killed him had a sobering effect. It made him fully realise that his true life ambition was to be an artist. By chance he saw a documentary on the forthcoming changes in East Berlin and felt a strong need to be there to experience it. He decided to leave Ireland again. =Making it happen= In early 1989 Gerard packed his paint and canvas into an old camper van and left for Germany. Passing through Checkpoint Charlie in East Berlin he encountered the underground movement whose members had offered him to become an artist in residence. It was a major breakthrough, he became a full-time artist. Seven months of working in the streets of Berlin, painting the local scenes and architecture resulted in a solo show of his works. An exhibition was organised under cover in a deteriorated, disused supermarket transformed for three weeks into an aesthetically pleasing art gallery called the People's Gallery. Although the theme of works was not politically charged the event itself was an act of freedom, a statement of the love of art and against the state interfering in the freedom of expression. A few months later, in November 1989 the Berlin Wall came down. Gerard stayed in Berlin through the unification process and shared the liberation experience with his new German friends. Art=Life as an artist= Upon a return to Ireland Gerard exhibited his Berlin artwork in the George Gallery in Dublin followed by the regular expositions in other Dublin galleries. He returned to America, this time with the sole purpose of painting. In New York he got cheap accommodation in the Spanish Harlem, a rough part of the city where he was the only white European and believed by the neighbours to be a cop under cover. When he came back to Dublin his New York work was presented in the Jo Rain Gallery. In 1996 he exhibited in the Harrison Gallery and took over the running of the gallery for the period of 2 years. Although very successful in managing it he realised he needed to decide whether he wanted to be a gallery owner or an artist creating his art. Once again he made a conscious decision to stick to the idea of being an artist. In 2003 a relationship with the mother of his daughter Clara broke and he travelled to Dingle, the West Coast of Ireland to find solitude and much needed inspiration. He stayed for a period of 3 months painting seascapes of Dingle Peninsula and Great Blasket Island and preparing for the group exhibition in Greenlane Gallery, Dingle to commemorate 50th anniversary of the last man leaving Great Blasket Island. As a result of his break up Gerard lost his only recently renovated home and studio in Sandycove. Shortly after he was offered by a complete stranger a basement to stay and work in a house in Killiney. To his great surprise it happened to be a house with a sea view capturing his much loved Sorrento. He stayed there for three years. Over a short period of time Gerard became close friends with the owner of the house, John. In 2005 Gerard made a painting trip to India and shortly after again to America. When he came home he focused on painting his beloved local Irish scenes: Dalkey, Killiney, Sorrento, Sandycove. His inspiration was fed by the beauty of the coast line, sea, light, local architecture and life. He became known as a local painter. In October 2007 Gerard flew to the USA once again, rented a camper van and drove upstate New York. He spent 6 weeks on the road capturing the colours of the fall. He came back with a number of big format pictures depicting the autumnal landscapes. In 2005 he bought a house in Dalkey, with the idea of having a home to celebrate the arts, where music nights, poetry readings, classical music events, jazz concerts would complement his life as a painter. In time his home grew to become a gallery and was named The Art House. It became a recognised spot on the map of Dalkey, a place where the creative vibe dominated the structure of the house, run not for profit but for love of art, something he had learnt in Berlin a decade before. The Art House was situated in the heart of Dalkey village, directly opposite a well known pub called Finnegan's which is featured in a number of Gerrard's paintings. It is here where in 2008 he met his future wife Agata, a Polish garden designer who was working as a waitress at the time. In August 2013 the artist opened The Gerard Byrne Studio in Dalkey hosting the reception of his wedding the following month. The gallery presented the artworks created over the previous years. In October 2014 Gerard moved to London and marked his arrival with a solo exhibition in The Gerard Byrne Studio in Clerkenwell. His work focused on painting London landmarks en plein air and the new studio works. In October 2015 Gerard and Agata's move to Brighton provided the artist an opportunity to capture the diminishing sea town architecture of the Victorian era, the Brighton Pier and the beauty of the coastal line. His studio work advanced towards floral and industrial abstract. In June 2017 the couple returned to London sharing the time between UK and Ireland. In November 2017 The Gerard Byrne Studio opened in a new central location in Ranelagh, Dublin 6. June 2018 marked Gerard Byrne's return to Ireland. He is based in Dublin and continues to work and travel internationally. =Artwork=Exhibitions=Solo exhibitions= * 1989 George Gallery, Dublin * 1990 People's Gallery, Berlin * 1991 George Gallery, Dublin * 1992 Brown's Gallery, Dublin * 1993 Fortune Society, New York City * 1994 Guinness Hop Store, Dublin * 1994 Jo Rain Gallery, Dublin * 1995 Jo Rain Gallery, Dublin * 1995 Harrison Gallery, Dublin * 1996 Harrison Gallery, Dublin * 1997 Bridge Gallery, Dublin * 1998 Gorry Gallery, Dublin * 2000 Gorry Gallery, Dublin * 2001 Dalkey Arts Gallery, Dublin * 2003 Gorry Gallery, Dublin * 2004 Dalkey Arts Gallery, Dublin * 2005 Irish Fine Art, Dublin * 2006 Irish Fine Art, Dublin * 2007 Gallery 4, Dublin * 2008 Greenlane Gallery, Dingle, Ireland * 2009 Gorry Gallery, Dublin * 2012 Jun ART House, Dalkey, Ireland * 2012 Aug ART House, Dalkey, Ireland * 2012 Dec ART House, Dalkey, Ireland * 2013 Feb ART House, Dalkey, Ireland * 2013 Jun ART House, Dalkey, Ireland * 2013 Nov The Gerard Byrne Studio, Dalkey, Ireland * 2014 Dec The Gerard Byrne Studio, Clerkenwell, London, United Kingdom * 2016 May Artists Open Houses Festival The Gerard Byrne Studio, Brighton, United Kingdom * 2017 Nov The Gallery Opening, The Gerard Byrne Studio, Dublin, Ireland * 2018 Apr Time is The Enemy The Gerard Byrne Studio, Dublin, Ireland * 2018 Jun Inside Outside & Beyond Gallery Space, National Botanic Gardens, Dublin, Ireland * 2019 Aug ‚Äì Nov Botanical Fusion People's Gallery, Singapore Botanic Gardens, Singapore * 2019 Nov ‚Äì Dec 30 Years in the Making, The Gerard Byrne Studio, Dublin, Ireland =Recent group exhibitions= * 2015 March Clerkenwell Design Week, Platform, Clerkenwell, London, United Kingdom * 2016 February Parallax Art Fair, Chelsea Town Hall, Chelsea, London, United Kingdom * 2016 April Focus LDN The Art of Regeneration,http://gerardbyrneartist.com/art-regeneration-menier-gallery- london/ Menier Gallery, Southwark, London, United Kingdom * 2016 May Revolution Show, The Observer Building, Hastings, United Kingdom * 2016 May Future Nepal Charity Auction, UCS Hampstead, Hampstead, London, United Kingdom * 2016 June Alzheimer's in the Frame, The Memorable Icons, Gallery Elena Shchukina, Mayfair, London, United Kingdom * 2016 June Alzheimer's in the Frame, The Memorable Icons, The Alzheimer's Show, Olympia, Kensington, London, United Kingdom * 2016 July Pintar Rapido, Chelsea Town Hall, Chelsea, London, United Kingdom * 2016 September Pintar Rapido, Posthoornkerk, Haarlemmerstraat, Amsterdam, the Netherlands * 2016 November Naked Eye Gallery, Hove, United Kingdom * 2016 December Focus LDN Winter Exhibition, Menier Gallery, Southwark, London, United Kingdom * 2017 June An Exhibition of 17th ‚Äì 21st Century Irish Paintings, Gorry Gallery, Dublin, Ireland * 2017 June SKY ARTS, Landscape Artist of the Year, Knaresborough Castle, Yorkshire, United Kingdom * 2017 July Pintar Rapido, Chelsea Town Hall, Chelsea, London, United Kingdom * 2018 June The New English Art Club, Annual Exhibition, Mall Galleries, London, United Kingdom Selected collections * Irish Embassy, Beijing * Irish Embassy, Singapore * Singapore Botanic Gardens * Department of the Marine * Department of Justice * Office of Public Works (OPW) Ireland * Electricity Supply Board * Guinness plc * O2 Ireland * Deutche Bank West LB * Woodchester Bank * Durkan Homes * Corrigan & Corrigan (Solicitors) * The Citadelle Art Museum, Texas, USA * Louis Walsh * Paula Rowan * Maeve Binchy and Gordon Snell * Diarmuid Gavin and Justine Keane * Sligo Park Hotel * Marlfield House * Ballymascanlon House Hotel * Finnegans Pub, Dalkey * Gresham Hotel, Dublin * Shelbourne Hotel, Dublin * Dylan Hotel, Dublin ReferencesExternal links * *Artist's Pinterest Page * No two journeys are ever the same video by Kirsten Kavendish (3:30 min) Brighton, March 2016 * Gerard Byrne at Pintar Rapido Plein Air Painting Competition London 2016 video by Henjo.tv (4 mins) London, July 2016 * Gerard Byrne at SKY Landscape Artist of The Year 2017 video (03:45 mins) Knaresborough Castle, June 2017 * Interview with Gerard Byrne.

His thought played a role in the development of German Idealism. Life H√ºlsen was born in Aken. In 1785 he enrolled at the university of Halle to study theology. He attended Friedrich August Wolf's lectures on classical philology. After his initial studies he rejected office as a preacher and became a private tutor, active in G√∂rtzke bei Ziesar. Kr√§mer 2001, pp. 23-26 As a tutor he was able to meet Friedrich de la Motte Fouqu√©, an important writer of German romanticism. In 1794 he enrolled for the University of Kiel and attended the lectures of Karl Leonhard Reinhold, a leading interpreter of Kant's philosophy. In 1795 H√ºlsen shifted to the University of Jena, where J. G. Fichte had succeeded Reinhold as a teacher. During this time he was also associated with the Gesellschaft der freien M√§nner.ADB 1881, p. 333. Around 1799 H√ºlsen attempted to establish his own Socratic school, but the project failed. During the same period H√ºlsen had picked up his literary work in collaboration with the Jena romantics.Posesorski 2012, p. 199. He later distanced himself from this circle; instead of writing scholarly treatises H√ºlsen wanted to promote a more ‚Äúpopular‚Äù spiritual culture.Posesorski 2012, p. 200. In 1803 H√ºlsen was invited by his friend Johann Erich von Berger and some other ex-members of the Gesellschaft to join their agricultural community in Holstein. He simultaneously ended his correspondence with the circle of Friedrich Schlegel. H√ºlsen was strongly opposed to their growing sympathy for the medieval past, which he considered reactionary.Posesorski 2012, p. 201. In 1804 H√ºlsen received a farm from his friends in the small village of Wagersrott. Henrik Steffens visited him here and reported that H√ºlsen and Berger had become interested in Naturphilosophie and that the both of them had conducted several experiments. In 1809 H√ºlsen moved with his family to Stechow near Rathenow, and he died there on 24 September, at age 44. Philosophical work His Preisschrift illustrates the development of a Fichtean history of reason, in which the dawn of modern critical philosophy is a central achievement after a series of antitheses of systems and doctrines. It is important to note that his concept of a historical development of philosophical reason in general has preceded that of Friedrich Schelling and Georg Hegel. H√ºlsen also states that humanity strives after one determined universal goal (bestimmten Zweck).Posesorski 2012, p. 103. Fichte was pleased with H√ºlsen's achievement and acknowledged his Preisschrift as a text that could facilitate the reading of his own Wissenschaftslehre.Posesorski 2012, p. 100. After finishing his Preisschrift H√ºlsen published other philosophical treatises in a number of journals. Most of these writings are characterized by a Fichtean style combined with more personal themes of H√ºlsen, such as universal equality, Bildung etc. meanwhile, however, H√ºlsen also develops his more personal, socratic philosophy, which deviates from Fichte and his views. H√ºlsen does not support a society of Gelehrten but rather reacts to a confused academic world where theoretical systems on truth and Buchstabe reign supreme. In opposition to these H√ºlsen promotes Geist, ein kindlicher Sinn for the truth and Leben. Other students of Fichte are characterized by the same evolution, such as Schelling and Novalis. For H√ºlsen it was crucial not to write philosophical books and treatises, but to express true philosophy into living speech and the practice of life. It was thus necessary to refrain from writing and to live in harmony with nature, family and neighbour. Although H√ºlsen was considered a part of the Schlegel Kreis for a short period, he did differ from the circle's defining traits in a number of ways. For instance, he did not idealise art or the medieval period. In a reaction to Christianity he praised the wisdom of ancient Greece and its mythology. Kr√§mer 2001, pp. 210-211. H√ºlsen came into contact with ancient literature while attending Friedrich August Wolf's lectures on philology at the university of Halle. Accounts from Rist and Fouqu√© also point out that H√ºlsen's individual philosophy was shaped and influenced by Plato's (that is Platonic Socrates') philosophy and its Theory of Ideas.

Life  He was born at Paris in 1781, and admitted into the Conservatoire de Paris in his fifteenth year. In 1799 he obtained a prize for his exercises in harmony, and four years afterwards, having gained the newly-established Prix de Rome for his Alcyone, he was sent to that city to study under Pietro Alessandro Guglielmi. During the first year of his residence in Rome, he made such progress that his master commissioned him to write a requiem and another sacred composition. The latter, performed during Passion Week, excited so much admiration, that he was engaged to compose an opera for the autumn. He had scarcely completed the last scene when he died on 19 August 1804. The following October a De Profundis of his composition was performed in his memory at the church of San Lorenzo in Lucina.

In his opera, Barnett effects a happier ending. The premiere was February 28, 1837 at the Drury Lane Theater, London. It ran for 50 performances. Critics were generally appreciative of the composition and Barnett's attempts to build an English grand opera, but complained of slow pacing in the libretto. Synopsis The scene is England, 1154-5. Act I opens in the home of Lord Clifford, who is with his daughter Rosamond, and her fiance Aubrey de Vere. They are paid a visit by a troubadour named Edgar, who is actually King Henry II in disguise. Lord Clifford is wary, de Vere is jealous, and Rosamond is entranced. Everyone dances. Rosamond runs off with Edgar. As Act II opens, Queen Eleanor is singing a song of farewell to her native France (\\"The lily no longer my brow must bind\\"). Rosamond has fled with Henry to a woodsman's hut, where her father, de Vere, and others catch up with them. Everyone fights. At that moment, Queen Eleanor arrives with her guard. As she tries to calm the dispute, she questions Edgar, but does not recognize him as King Henry. \\"Edgar\\" suggests that the disputing parties submit their appeals to King Henry at a later date. Eleanor agrees. Act III opens with a song of longing by de Vere, while all the parties gather for the coronation in Westminster. When Rosamond is introduced to the King, she recognizes him, and Eleanor suddenly realizes Henry is Edgar. Rosamond sings \\"Wild My Brain to Phrenzy Driven\\", and all parties take turns singing \\"Sounds of Discord Fill the Air\\". Act IV takes place in Rosamond's Bower, which is not like the maze of legend, but is represented as a garden pavilion here. Rosamond and Henry take turns singing ballads of longing, there is an interlude for a ballet, and a five-part Madgrigal is sung (\\"Merrily Wake Music's Measure\\"). Henry has to leave for royal responsibilities, after which de Clifford, de Vere, and others arrive to beg Rosamond to leave before the Queen can harm her. The all leave to catch Henry to ask him to return to protect Rosamond. When they are gone, Queen Eleanor arrives and offers Rosamond a choice - death by dagger or death by poison. Rosamond begs for her life, and stalls, until suddenly the King appears. He has sharp words with Eleanor until Rosamond begs him to forgive the queen. \\"Her pardon, sire, let me implore - and then farewell, we meet no more\\". Henry agrees.

The Tilghman family name according to evidence by historical findings is one of the oldest and most well researched surnames. The family motto is: Spes Alit Agricolam (Latin) \\"Hope Nourishes the Farmer\\" The first identified Tilghman was Johannes Tilghman, recorded in 1225 in Kent England and can be found in Stephen Fredrick Tillman's book \\"Spes Alit Agricolam.\\" There in Kent the Tilghmans held a family at the Snodland Parish called Holloway Court. However the origins of the Tilghman family go back beyond that. The Venerable Bede mentioned in Volume 1 of his writings that the Tilghman family settled in Kent England in 692. The oldest finding of the name Tilghman was in 692 and was that of a Monk Tilmon (Tilghman) [this was not however a surname nor likely to be handed on to heirs] who was with the Two Ewalds when they met their fate . Some who have researched the family believe the Tilghman family originated near the Rhine River as the French Von Till family and later migrated to England. Others who have researched the family however believe the Tilghmans came to England during the Anglo-Saxon invasions of the 4th century with the Jutes. Those who have done extensive research on the family also believe according to historical findings that the Tilghmans were thegns in medieval England and have traced their origins to that of William the Conqueror and Alfred the Great by way of Anna \\"Sanders\\" Tilghman circa 1572. Many of the Tilghmans in the United States today are descended from Dr. Richard Tilghman, a surgeon who sailed from England with his wife in 1660 and settled the \\"Hermitage\\" Tilghman family home in Talbot County, Maryland.

Vannett played his college football at Ohio State. Early years Vannett attended Westerville Central High School in Westerville, Ohio, where he graduated in 2011. Vannett played high school football for the Warhawks football team. Vannett achieved all-metro, all-OCC, and all-district selections in recognition of his contributions on the field. Vannett had 47 receptions for 606 yards and eight touchdowns in his senior season. He also played baseball in his youth but did not pursue the sport into college. College career Vannett committed to Ohio State on June 30, 2010 and signed his letter of intent on February 2, 2011. Vannett redshirted his first year at Ohio State but played in the next four seasons playing in 53 games totaling 55 receptions, 585 receiving yards, and six receiving touchdowns. Prior to his senior season, Vannett was ranked as the best tight end prospect by ESPN NFL Draft analyst Todd McShay. Professional career On December 8, 2016, it was reported that Vannett had accepted his invitation to play in the 2016 Senior Bowl. The week leading up to the Senior Bowl, Vannett impressed many scouts and analysts during practice with many surprised by his blocking skills and receiving ability. He was described as a physically imposing receiver with strong hands and ability to concentrate on contested catches. On January 30, 2016, Vannett caught three passes for 58-yards as a part of Dallas Cowboys' head coach Jason Garrett's North team who lost 16‚Äì27 to the South. Vannett was one of 15 tight ends who received an invitation to the NFL Combine and one of 14 players from Ohio state. A back injury, prevented him from completing all of the combine drills, including the 40-yard dash, 20-yard dash, and 10-yard dash. His performance was described by scouts as mediocre as he finished eighth in the bench press and seventh in the vertical. His best performances were in the short shuttle, where he tied for second, and tied South Carolina State's Temarrick Hemingway for first in the 60-yard shuttle. On March 11, 2016, Vannett attended Ohio State's Pro Day, along with Cardale Jones, Pat Elflein, Eli Apple, Marshon Lattimore, Braxton Miller, Michael Thomas, Joey Bosa, Vonn Bell, Darron Lee, Taylor Decker, Ezekiel Elliott, Joshua Perry, Jalin Marshall, Adolphus Washington, and Tyvis Powell. Along with positional drills, Vannett performed the 40-yard dash, 20-yard dash, 20-yard dash, vertical jump (29¬Ω\\"), and broad jump (9'5\\"). He performed well for the collection of over 122 team representatives and scouts, that included head coaches Mike Mularkey (Titans), Mike Zimmer (Vikings, Mike Tomlin (Steelers), Sean Payton (Saints), and Marvin Lewis (Bengals). At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Vannett was projected to be a third or fourth round pick by the majority of NFL draft experts and analysts. He was ranked the second best tight end prospect in the draft by Sports Illustrated, the third best tight end prospect by NFLDraftScout.com, and was ranked the fourth best tight end by NFL analyst Mike Mayock. =Seattle Seahawks= On April 29, 2016, Vannett was drafted by the Seattle Seahawks in the third round with the 94th overall pick in the 2016 NFL Draft. He was the third tight end selected, behind Hunter Henry (second round, 35th overall) and Austin Hooper (third round, 81st overall). Head coach Pete Carroll and General Manager John Schneider stated they originally drafted Vannett to be a traditional Y tight end that is more focused on blocking. He became more of a complete tight end after surprising Carroll and Schneider with his receiving skills in off season workouts. 2016 On May 6, 2016, the Seattle Seahawks signed Vannett to a four-year, $3.05 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $656,880. He entered his first training camp for the Seattle Seahawks competing against Luke Willson, Cooper Helfet, Ronnie Shields, and Brandon Williams, for the job as the second tight end. Head coach Pete Carroll named Vannett the third tight end to begin the regular season, behind veterans Jimmy Graham and Luke Willson. During the Seattle Seahawks' second preseason game against the Minnesota Vikings, Vannett caught one pass for a 15-yard gain, but suffered an ankle injury and was unable to finish the 18‚Äì11 loss. He missed the last two preseason games and the first four regular season games due to the high ankle sprain. On October 16, 2016, Vannett made his professional regular season debut during the Seahawks' 26‚Äì24 victory against the Atlanta Falcons. He played three offensive snaps and two on special teams in his debut. During the game, Seahawks' tight end Luke Willson left after sustaining a knee injury that would require surgery to repair damaged cartilage and stretched ligaments. Vannett moved up on the depth chart to take his place during Willson's absence. On October 30, 2016, Vannett made his first career reception during a 25‚Äì20 loss to the New Orleans Saints. He caught his first career reception from a pass from Russell Wilson and gained seven-yards before being tackled by Saints cornerback De'Vante Harris. During a Week 10 matchup at the New England Patriots, Vannett made his first career start as the Seahawks defeated the Patriots 31‚Äì24. On December 4, 2016, he earned his second career start and caught a season-high two passes for 25-yards, as the Seahawks routed the Carolina Panthers 40‚Äì7. Vannett was a healthy scratch through Weeks 16‚Äì17 and throughout the postseason as head coach Pete Carroll decided to instead play Jimmy Graham, Luke Willson and Brandon Williams. He completed the season with a total of three receptions for 32 receiving yards and played in nine games with two starts. 2017 Vannett was slated to be the third tight end on the Seahawks' depth chart to begin the season after Brandon Williams departed for the Indianapolis Colts in free agency. He played in the Seattle Seahawks' season-opener at the Green Bay Packers and had one reception for a ten-yard gain during the 17‚Äì9 loss. On November 26, 2017, Vannett caught two passes for 29-yards and scored his first career touchdown in the Seahawks' 24‚Äì13 victory at the San Francisco 49ers. His first career touchdown came in the third quarter as he beat 49ers' linebacker Eli Harold and caught a pass from Russell Wilson to score a 27-yard touchdown to help the Seahawks gain a 13‚Äì6 lead. The following week, Vannett started his second game of the season and made a season-high three receptions for 40 receiving yards in a 24‚Äì10 victory against the Philadelphia Eagles. He finished the 2017 season with 12 receptions for 124 receiving yards and one receiving touchdown. 2018 In the 2018 season, Vannett recorded 29 receptions for 269 receiving yards and three receiving touchdowns. =Pittsburgh Steelers= Vannett in a game against the Cleveland Browns in 2019 On September 24, 2019, Vannett was traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers for a 2020 fifth-round pick.

The car was an updated version of the Wartburg 353, with a 1.3 litre, four-stroke, four-cylinder engine as also used in the second generation Volkswagen Polo, instead of the original 1-litre, two-stroke, three-cylinder unit found in the 353. History In 1984 a deal was reached in which IFA would assemble Volkswagen's 1.3-liter EA111 engine under license, in the Barkas plant in Karl-Marx-Stadt (Chemnitz).St√ºnkel, p. 39 The engine was too long to be mounted longitudinally in the Wartburg 353, and too long to fit between the front wheels in a transverse installation. One prototype with the longitudinal engine was built, nicknamed Nasenb√§r (Coati) because of its long nose. Wartburg chose the transverse option, and thus the Wartburg 1.3 only entered production in October 1988 as a new transmission also had to be developed, as well as an entirely new front end (everything ahead of the A-pillar was new). The track was widened by in front and by in the rear, necessitating small fender extensions. The new drivetrain also meant that the gearshifter migrated to the floor, instead of on the column where it was usually found on Wartburgs. The considerable changes meant that the development costs far outreached the projected expense of manufacturing the four-stroke 1600 cc engine developed by Wartburg's own engineers in the early seventies. The appearance was also altered by the installation of a new front clip, with large wraparound turn signals and a smoothed-off appearance. Being rather expensive (nearly twice the price of the 353 W), the 1.3 sold slowly from the get-go. The two-stroke 353 W continued to be built until 1989, when imported cars became available. Being a four-stroke was not enough of a novelty to convince buyers, especially in Western export markets. After the reunification in late 1989, the Wartburg 1.3 was no longer competitive, and production slowed down until it was discontinued on 10 April 1991. A pickup version (not available within the Eastern Bloc) called the Wartburg 1.3 Trans was also available, although only about 920 were built. A total of 152,757 Wartburg 1.3 were built, about half of them intended for export. The engine originally developed , after July 1990 this was increased to . Karmann showed a more luxurious prototype based on the Tourist, called simply the \\"Tourist L\\". It had a glass sunroof, roof rails, tinted windows, and an upgraded interior. Irmscher developed a modernized, sportier-looking version with 14-inch alloy wheels called the 1.3 New Line. Wartburg could see the writing on the wall, however, and only two New Lines were built. A Wartburg 1.4 was also developed in 1990, with a Renault engine. This was in an attempt to lower costs (which were rising rapidly after the reunification) by thirty per cent, and the Barkas-built drivetrain was the most expensive part. One operational prototype was built, but it was decided to liquidate Automobilwerk Eisenach rather than continuing production. A joint venture with Opel was chosen, and in the Wartburg plant was replaced by one building the Opel Vectra.

His mother, Mary Ellen Newman Fulton, oversaw the family as George Fulton learned his trade from his father. During the 1850s he worked as a brick maker and Bricklayer, but by 1856 he had moved to Richmond, Virginia, to work in the pottery shop of David Parr. There he is known to have decorated a 20-gallon cooler. Military service George Fulton was 28 years old when he enlisted as a private in the Union Army on July 23, 1862, with Company E of the 9th West Virginia Volunteer Infantry Regiment. In November 1864 he transferred to Company B of the 1st West Virginia Veteran Volunteer Infantry Regiment. A family tradition says that George Fulton was made a prisoner by Confederate forces at White Sulfur Springs, West Virginia. It was while escaping from the Confederate troops that he saw the clay deposits in a cave near Potts Creek. Pottery business After his military service and marriage to Sarah Ellen Schaffer and work in Parkersburg, West Virginia, George Fulton moved to Potts Creek in Allegheny County, Virginia, where he established his business from 1867 to 1875.

The New York, Ontario and Western Railway (NYO&W;) had running rights along the West Shore and sometimes stopped at Ridgefield Park. First opened in 1872 it was one of three passenger stations in the village, the others being the Little Ferry station to the south and Westview station to the north. (Secondary sources note a later opening date.) Service on the West Shore Railroad began in 1883. The station house, built at a cost $100,000 opened in 1927. Southbound service crossed Overpeck Creek and continued to terminals on the Hudson River waterfront where there was connecting ferry service across the Hudson River to Manhattan. Northbound near Bogota the parallel NYSW and West Shore lines diverge and continue into northern New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and upstate New York. Passenger service ended in 1966. History In 1866, the Ridgefield Park Railroad (a predecessor to West Shore), was established to create a right of way (ROW) along foot the western slope of the Hudson Palisades parallel to the Hackensack River from Ridgefield Park to Marion Junction, where it could use the Bergen Hill Cut to the Pennsylvania Railroad Depot on the Hudson Waterfront in Jersey City. In 1873 the Jersey City & Albany Railroad (another predecessor to the West Shore) incorporated the original Ridgefield Park Railroad ROW into its projected line. The West Shore instead built the Weehawken Tunnel (at the southern end of what became North Bergen Yard) in conjunction with the opening of Weehawken Terminal. It opened its station in Ridgefield Park in 1883. NYC's service was discontinued in 1959. The New Jersey Midland Railway (a predecessor to the NYSW) built a line through the Ridgefields in 1872. It joined the Erie Railroad Northern Branch at Granton Junction near Babbitt, and reached the community of New Durham. With a similar intention to reach a terminal on the Hudson River, in 1873 it built the Hudson Connecting Railroad which ran south to West End Junction, just north of Marion Junction, with access to Erie's Long Dock Tunnel and Pavonia Terminal. Passenger service on the NYC's West Shore Railroad ended in 1959, having been truncated to West Haverstraw in 1958. Passenger service on the NYSW made use of the West Shore's Ridgefield Park station to Pavonia Terminal until it was retracted to Susquehanna Transfer (near the point now under New Jersey Route 495) and eventually terminated in 1966. Status CSX Transportation River Line and the NYSW both operate along the freight lines that pass the station. The station house has become a commercial building. NYS&W; maintains a small yard in the village. One of the so-called CP5 bridges, the CSX bridge, over Overpeck Creek has been replaced with a two-track swing bridge. As of 2015, the NYS&W; bridge was slated for replacement. The bridge collapsed in 2018. Numerous studies to restore passenger service have been conducted, but not materialized. The station has been recommended for historic designation by the county's historical agency. The station is a very popular location for train watchers.

The primordial River Thames, followed a more northerly path than it does today along the valleys of the modern River Colne / River Lea . This channel is known to have been blocked by the large ice sheet that entered the Thames estuary during the Anglian glaciation . With its path to the sea blocked by ice this primordial river would have ponded back to form a periglacial lake. This would have eventually overflowed and found a new path to the sea. The Finchley gap is a hypothetical glacial drainage channel that carried the waters south during the Quaternary ice age when the valley of the primordial Thames was blocked by ice and moraines. The Finchley gap is itself considered to have been blocked by later stages of the ice sheets advance known as the Anglian glaciation and a subsequent overflow channel then developed in the region of Staines which remains the course of the River Thames today. The Finchley feature was first detected and described by Professor Sidney Wooldridge (1938 and 1960), who dated it to the Anglian Stage glaciation around 450,000 BP, when ice and boulder clays advanced up the Thames valley as far as Bricket Wood in the northwest , Finchley in the west and Hornchurch to the south. Later work (by Moffat and Catt, 1982; Avery and Catt, 1983; Green and McGregor, 1983), which matched gravel deposits in the Vale of St Albans with those in the modern lower Thames valley suggests that the Finchley overflow route is unlikely.and that once ponded back by the ice the primordial Thames overflowed directly into its current route around Staines. Bridgland, D.R., (1994), page 5 The Mutton Brook, Dollis Brook, River Brent channels are more likely to have been cut by melt waters from the lobe of glacial ice that occupied Finchley when the ice sheets were at their maximum extent.

Hill, fatally shot by US police officer Robert Olsen, suffered from mental illness and was naked and unarmed at the time of the incident. The incident was covered in local and national press and sparked the involvement of Black Lives Matter and other advocacy groups who demonstrated their anger at the shooting. In January 2016, a grand jury indicted officer Olsen on two counts of felony murder and one count of aggravated assault. Nearing the fourth anniversary of the homicide, it was decided that Olsen's trial would be rescheduled for September 23, 2019, with delays including three successive judges having recused themselves in the case.Olsen trial rescheduled for September 23, by Christian Boone and Bill Rankin, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, March 07, 2019Vigil today honors Air Force veteran shot, killed by DeKalb police officer 4 years ago, by Nick Sturdivant, Lauren Padgett, March 9, 2019, 11Alive WXIA-TV Atlanta, Georgia Background Anthony Hill, born in Moncks Corner SC USA, a veteran of the United States Air Force who had served in Afghanistan, was 26 years (6/15/88) old and, according to his family, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. He had been medically discharged from the Air Force two years before after being diagnosed with bipolar disorder. On a Twitter account apparently belonging to Hill, he acknowledged suffering from the disorder. According to his girlfriend, he had recently stopped taking his medication due to muscular side effects, believing he would see his doctor at the VA within the week. Hill had been an intern at Berkeley County Sheriff's Department before joining the US Air Force. He had been a staunch supporter of police officers, before being shot by one. Shooting Hill was noted to be acting erratically when police were called; he had hung from his second-story balcony in his apartment complex, and his speech was slurred. He had reportedly been running around the complex naked and knocking on doors asking for his medicine and lying and crawling on the ground. The woman who called 911 told Hill's family's lawyer that she had called in order to get medical personnel to come for Hill. Officer Robert Olsen, employed by the Dekalb County Police Department for seven years, was dispatched to the scene and found him in the parking lot of the complex. Olsen waited in his car for several minutes, possibly for backup, when Hill began approaching from about away. Olsen exited the car and began moving backward. Hill, apparently unarmed, ran toward Officer Olsen, who stepped back and called to him to stop. Hill began to walk naked with hands to side, failing to comply with orders to stop. Olsen shot him twice. They were six to seven feet apart when the shots were fired. Hill died at the scene. Olsen had also been carrying a Taser, police baton, and pepper spray, but DeKalb Police Chief Cedric Alexander said Olsen chose the firearm over those options. Several residents witnessed the shooting. Olsen said later that he had believed Hill was a threat to the officer's safety and under the influence of drugs like phencyclidine or bath salts. He told the grand jury deciding whether to indict him on charges of murder about other cases in which suspects who had used these drugs had attacked police. Aftermath The Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) began investigating the shooting within days, and Olsen was placed on administrative leave for the duration. He remained on paid leave through the time of the criminal grand jury hearing. In April 2015 the GBI handed its findings over to the district attorney. The shooting prompted outcry about the police department's approach to handling people with mental illness, as well as critiques about race. The shooting came in the wake of national social unrest and racial debate after the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, which inspired the Black Lives Matter movement. As they had in other parts of the country, protests arose in Atlanta over race and police killings and use of excessive force. Hill had remarked on the national debate three days prior to his death, posting on Facebook, \\"[t]he key thing to remember is, #blacklivesmatter, ABSOLUTELY, but not more so than any other life.\\" He remarked via Twitter, \\"[i]f 99 out of 100 cops [are] killing black men like its hunting season that leaves 1 just doing his job.\\" In the context of increased attention of police killings of racial minorities, prosecutors face greater pressure. Hill's family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Officer Olsen, the police department, Dekalb county, and its department of commissioners. =Grand jury= A civil grand jury convened in October 2015 determined that the shooting should be further investigated. Olsen had told the jury that he had felt threatened by Hill. It decided that a criminal grand jury would hear the evidence. In January 2016, District Attorney Robert D. James Jr. of DeKalb County announced that he would ask the criminal grand jury to indict, and that a warrant had been issued for Olsen's arrest. Two weeks later, on January 21, 2016, the criminal grand jury indicted Officer Olsen for two counts of felony murder, one count of aggravated assault, one count of making a false statement and two counts of violation of oath by a public officer. Felony murder implies the defendant killed someone while committing another felony; the two felonies are the assault and violation of oath charges. The district attorney said that Olsen was charged with making a false statement because he had told another officer during the investigation that Hill had hit him in the chest. He also said the violation of oath charges had to do with his violation of department rules and use of force. An arrest warrant was issued for Olsen on the 21st. He turned himself in that day and was granted a bond of $110,200 and released. Olsen's indictment marked the first time in six years that an officer was charged with murder in Georgia for shooting someone while on duty. An investigation by news outlets found that no officers had faced prosecution for shootings in Georgia in the previous five years‚Äîwhich saw 184 shootings by police. Unlike any other state in the US, Georgia allows officers (but not regular civilians) to be present during the entire grand jury hearing and to make a statement at the very end that is unchallenged by anyone. In anticipation of the announcement in late January, dozens of activists known as Rise Up Georgia camped outside the courthouse in tents, displaying hand-made signs in support of Hill for several days before the grand jury announced the indictment of Officer Olsen on all six counts; the group maintained a 24-hour operation in front of the courthouse by sleeping in shifts. A crowd of several dozen began cheering and chanting when the decision to indict was announced outside the courthouse. Groups involved in the demonstration included Rise Up Georgia, Black Lives Matter, Southerners On New Ground (SONG), and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Olsen resigned from the DeKalb County Police Department on January 25, 2016. Until that time, this officer was still being paid by DeKalb County. = Trial and sentencing = Olsen pleaded not guilty on June 6, 2016. The Georgia Supreme Court ruled October 16, 2017 that the prosecution can resume after a year on hold. Olsen and his attorney had argued that the Grand Jury process was compromised, and the indictment should be thrown out, but their motion was denied. Jury selection began Monday, September 23, 2019 at the DeKalb County Courthouse. Superior Court Judge LaTisha Dear Jackson presides over the trial proceedings. Three previously assigned judges had recused themselves from the case, which undoubtedly contributed to the delay in setting a trial date. The jury was seated on the morning of Thursday, September 26, with opening statements being delivered, as well as the testimony of three state witnesses. On October 14, 2019, Olsen was convicted by a jury of one count of aggravated assault, two counts of violating his oath of office and one count of making a false statement. The jury was composed of seven women and five men, with a racial composition of five blacks, five whites, one Asian and one Hispanic. The jury was divided 9 to 3 in favor of conviction on felony murder but to avoid deadlocking they acquitted him of felony murder and convicted him on the remaining charges. The prosecution argued for a 25-year prison sentence followed by five years probation. Olsen was sentenced on November 1, 2019 to 12 years in prison, followed by eight years of probation by DeKalb County Superior Court Judge LaTisha Dear Jackson. Olsen is also banned for life from working in law enforcement, prohibited from possessing firearms or profiting from the case.

Renjin's development is primarily supported by BeDataDriven, but ultimately made possible by several current and past contributors including Mehmet Hakan Satman, Hannes M√ºhleisen, and Ruslan Shevchenko. History Renjin's roots lie in an abortive 2010 attempt to compile the GNU R interpreter for the JVM via nestedvm, a toolchain which involves cross-compiling C and Fortran code to a static MIPS binary, which nestedvm can then translate to JVM bytecode. This proved challenging as GNU R had grown to rely heavily on dynamic linking and the best C standard library implementation available at the time for the MIPS architecture, Newlib, was not fully compatible with the GNU C Library, against which GNU R had been developed. The experience with the R4JVM project provided the BeDataDriven team with in depth look at the GNU R codebase, and convinced them that a new implementation, written in Java, was a feasible undertaking. Development on Renjin began in October 2010, and rapidly resulted in a functional, if minimal, interpreter for the R language.

Sutton was the father-in-law of Edward Barton who was also heavily involved in Brisbane's electric lighting. From The Telegraph, Brisbane; 24 Feb 1921. \\"Mr. W. M. L'Estrange, of the Ipswich Electric Supply Company, Limited; had stated that the residence of Mr. C. Hardie Buzacott, of Chelmer, was one of the first houses in Australia to be lit up by electric light, as Mr. Buzacott had brought a plant out from England about the year 1887, and which he had installed at his residence for lighting purposes. Mr. L'Estrange also stated that about the same time Mr. Sutton, of Laurel, avenue, Chelmer also installed an electric plant at his residence, and, that probably Mr. Sutton's residence with that of Mr. Buzacott's could be claimed to be the first private dwellings to be lit up by electricity in Australia.\\" Education pioneer Sutton was keenly involved in all things educational. Sutton was a founding member of the Brisbane Technical College from September 1882. The college was originally part of the Brisbane School of Arts. In November 1892 Sutton was involved in organising the separation from the School of Arts. Sutton became the chairman of the subcommittee (1897), handling the separation and obtaining a new building. By 1900 Sutton was Chairman of the Brisbane Technical College 1899‚Äì1901. In Aug 1900 Sutton was appointed a member of the council of the Brisbane Technical College. By donating to the building fund Mr and Mrs Sutton became life members of the college. Sutton was reappointed to the council in November 1903. He remained as an ordinary member till post 1904. Sutton was also involved with having physics as a foundation discipline in its own right included in the curriculum for the University of Queensland. Post 1904 Sutton's health (most likely deteriorating from his exposure to radiation from X-rays as well as to radium) caused him to slowly withdraw from public life. Photographic pioneer Joseph William Sutton was involved in the very beginning of the Queensland Photographic Society: From \\"The Week\\" newspaper Brisbane Sat 20 Sept 1884: \\"PHOTOGRAPHIC SOCIETY.‚ÄîThe newly formed Queensland photographers' society held a meeting on Monday in rooms over Sloss', confectioners, Queen-street. There was a good attendance of members. The following officers were elected for the ensuing year:‚ÄîPresident, the Hon A. C. Gregory; vice-presidents, Professor Pepper, and Mr. J. W. Sutton ; secretary, Mr. J. R. Hall; committee, Messrs. Rickardo, Lyons, and Service.\\" From the beginning Sutton was often availing his steamers to be used to take members along the Brisbane river for photo shoots, as seen from The Brisbane Courier 17 Feb 1885: \\"The chairman (Sutton on this occasion) notified his intention of taking the members down the Bay, probably on Saturday next, for the purpose of giving them an opportunity to exhibit their skill in \\"snapping\\" pretty glimpses of river scenery.\\" In these early days many of the society meetings were held at the Sutton household: Brisbane Courier 25 Jan 1886. \\"A MEETING of the Queensland Photographic Society was held on Saturday evening at Mr. J.W. Sutton's house. Mr. Sutton, who is vice-president, took the chair..... Mr Sutton very kindly placed his large veranda at the disposal of the members, together with the use of his dark-room for practical demonstrations on the nights of meeting, and also his optical lanterns for exhibitions of transparencies, which generous offer was accepted with a hearty vote of thanks.\\" The Telegraph 17 Mar 1886: \\"The monthly meeting of the Queensland Photographic Society was held at Mr. J. W. Sutton's house on Monday evening. That gentleman presided....... Mr. Sutton exhibited specimens of prints done with Morgan and Kidd's contact paper, and promised to give a practical demonstration of the process on the next meeting night.\\" The Brisbane Courier 27 July 1886: \\"A CONVERSAZIONE was held last night at the School of Arts by the Queensland Photographic Society to celebrate the first anniversary of their formation..... The society, which had just completed its first year, at first encountered great difficulties, but through the kindness of several of their members ‚Äì notably Mr. J. W. Sutton, who had placed many facilities they could not otherwise have obtained at their disposal, they had been very successful. The society now numbered 133 members, and had a satisfactory balance at the bank at its disposal.\\" The Brisbane Courier 1887: The second annual conversazione of the Queensland Photographic Society was held last night in the lecture hall of the Y.M.C.A. with great success...At 9 o'clock Mr J. W. Sutton exhibited, by means of the oxy-hydrogen limelight, a large collection of lantern-slides. This exhibition opened with a number of very fine views of Melbourne buildings and streets and Victorian scenery.\\" The New Photography; Sutton was the first in Brisbane to demonstrate X-Rays and X-Ray photography, only four months after Roentgen's discovery 29th February 1896.

In early July 1896, Sutton was the first to demonstrate X-rays in Brisbane for physician Dr. John Thompson. (See also The Queenslander, illustrated article; radiograph of keys and of hand, on 18 July page 117.) On 8 August 1896, at the invitation of the Royal Society of Queensland, Sutton performed a demonstration of R√∂ntgen rays and in doing so left his mark in the annals of history an Australian pioneer of X-rays in Queensland.Sutton, J. W. (1897). Experiments with R√∂ntgen rays. (Report of demonstrations.) Royal Society of Queensland. Proceedings., 12 (1897): 86-88.Sutton, J. W. (1900). Presidential address. Royal Society of Queensland. Proceedings. 15 (1900): viii-xxv. Sutton opened with a review of the historical aspects of what was known of the subject. Then he produced a diagram on the blackboard of the electromagnetic spectrum and reviewed the various portions that included the visible, ‚Äòinfra red‚Äô, ‚Äòheat rays‚Äô, ‚Äòultra violet‚Äô spectrums and the 'unmapped rays'. An account of the evening recalled: > \\"He proceeded to state that photography had revealed the fact that > photographically active rays extended a distance of nine or ten times the > length of the visual spectrum. and both from the ultra violet and the infra > red portion of the spectrum; there emanated a long series of rays which, > though quite invisible, possessed chemical energy and heat, and with which > it was quite possible to make radiographs through many opaque substances, > and it was supposed that somehow in these outskirts of the spectrum, the > X-rays would be found if they are associated with light at all.\\" Sutton then explained the apparatus he had prepared to demonstrate. The contraption consisted of an electric battery and large induction coil which provided the electric current to illuminate the Crookes focus tube. He asked the audience to observe an ordinary vacuum tube or Geissler tube. He passed electric current through the tube, a large three-bulb tube, and the tube was instantly filled with the well-known phosphorescent glow. Sutton remarked that X-rays were emanating from the tube, but the rays were so diffuse as to be of no effect. Next, the Geissler tube was replaced by a Crookes tube. Electric current was passed through the Crookes tube. He explained that the Crookes tube had \\"a more complete vacuum\\" and \\"other improvements made\\". Sutton explained that it was necessary to make additional improvements and refinements in the vacuum tube which required \\"a more complete vacuum\\". The final step involved an arrangement of aluminium and platinum discs utilized to focus the X-rays. Further recollections of the evening: > \\"Having thus explained the apparatus, Mr. Sutton made several exposures of > plates with remarkably good results. One interesting exposure was a > collection of various articles, offering various degrees of opacity to the > rays. The development of the plates was admirably carried out by Mr. > Ferguson under circumstances decidedly unfavourable to such delicate work, > with capital results. The exhibition of articles on the fluorescent screen, > where the wonderful effects of the X-rays were at once visible, called forth > frequent applause. Coins placed in a cigar case were plainly seen, and so > were similar articles placed between two-inch thick deal boards, or in the > middle of a thick book. Neither the wood nor the paper seemed to offer much > resistance to the light. The proceedings were terminated by a hearty vote of > thanks to the lecturer and demonstrator.\\" There are many references in the newspapers of the time of Sutton subsequently performing many demonstrations of these invisible rays using himself and other volunteers from his audiences. He later went on to also demonstrate the invisible rays of radium. Ships built by J. W. Sutton and Company The following is a partial list of ships built by J. W. Sutton and Co. at Kangaroo Point.

Daniel Stevens, formerly a senior researcher at CREW, became deputy director for CfA, and in 2017 became CfA's executive director. Activities In May 2015, the CfA filed a lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission, seeking to compel the agency to promulgate a regulation requiring corporations to disclose their political contributions that would inform investors how corporations are spending their money. The CfA acted on behalf of Stephen Silberstein, a shareholder of Aetna Inc. who had unsuccessfully sought to gain information on the company's political contributions.Jonathan Stempel, SEC not required to make firms disclose political contributions: judge, Reuters (January 5, 2016). In January 2016, Judge Rosemary M. Collyer of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed the suit, ruling that the plaintiff had not demonstrated that SEC had a \\"clear legal duty\\" to open a rulemaking proceeding or that its failure to do so was arbitrary and capricious. In November 2015, the CfA asked the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the Federal Election Commission to get to the bottom of allegations that the Macau casino operations of Sheldon Adelson's Las Vegas Sands Corp. are tied to organized crime.Isaak Arnesdorf, Group asks for probe of Adelson contributions; Politico (November 3, 2015). Weismann said that \\"Given the extent to which Mr. Adelson's wealth derives from Macau and his dominant role in funding Republican candidates, it seems highly likely that illegal foreign money has made its way into American elections.\\" A spokesman for the Las Vegas Sands Corp. denied the allegations, and the CfA subsequently issued a retraction of its statement, saying: \\"The available evidence supports further investigation into these alleged matters but does not support the statements made by CfA outside of its filings\\" with the Senate committee and the FEC.Statement Regarding Sheldon Adelson (press release), Campaign for Accountability (November 24, 2015). In December 2015, the CfA asked the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate David H. Stevens, the chief executive of the Mortgage Bankers Association and the former commissioner of the Federal Housing Administration, for possible violations of \\"revolving door\\" ethics laws. The National Legal and Policy Center joined this call several months later.Gretchen Morgenson, Ethics Group Urges Inquiry of Mortgage Banking Lobbyist Who Led F.H.A., New York Times (February 29, 2016).Megan R. Wilson, Watchdog Urges DoJ Probe of Former Housing Officials; The Hill (December 15, 2015). In January 2016, the Center for Responsive Politics published a report showing that the largest contributors to the campaigns of Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, were the tenants of a commercial building that the senator owns in Chattanooga. Stevens of CfA said that a tenant's ties to Corker raise questions on whether it was paying fair market value in rent. Separately, the CfA filed ethics complaints against Corker with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and U.S. Senate Ethics Committee, accusing him of insider trading in three particular hedge funds. Corker denied the allegations, calling them \\"categorically false\\" and \\"baseless.\\" In March 2016, the CfA made a request to Kim Davis--the controversial county clerk of Rowan County, Kentucky, who had gained international attention the previous year after defying a federal court order to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples--for access to public records under the Kentucky Open Records Act. The CfA specifically sought copies of retainer agreements and lawyer-client engagement agreements between Davis and Liberty Counsel, the religious advocacy organization that represented Davis in the marriage-license dispute.John Cheves, Kim Davis violated Open Records Act, attorney general says, Lexington Herald-Leader (July 5, 2016).Morgan Watkins, AG opinion: Kim Davis violated Open Records Act, Courier-Journal (Louisville, Ky.) (July 6, 2016). Liberty Counsel, which responded to the request on Davis' behalf, refused to comply, arguing that the documents were preliminary and private records not subject to the Act. The CfA appealed to the Office of the Kentucky Attorney General, which under Kentucky law has the authority to make binding rulings on the Open Records Act, and resubmitted its request to Davis' office in April 2016. In May 2016, the Attorney General's Office sought to privately review the records at issue to determine if an exemption applied, but Liberty Counsel refused to make most of the documents available for a private review. In an opinion issued on June 30, 2016, the Attorney General's Office made a finding favorable to the CfA, determining that Davis had violated the Open Records Act, saying that her conduct had the effect of \\"intentionally frustrating the attorney general's review of an open records request\\" which \\"would subvert the General Assembly's intent behind providing review by the attorney general.\\" In April 2016, the Campaign for Accountability launched the Google Transparency Project, a website on Google's \\"influence on government, public policies, and our lives.\\" Funding for the project, and for the Campaign, was not disclosed, but in August 2016 Ken Glueck of Oracle confirmed that Oracle, who had been conducting a high-profile lawsuit against Google, was one of the funders. In 2017, the group petitioned to unseal the divorce records of Andrew Puzder, who was at the time Donald Trump's nominee to become the United States Secretary of Labor. Puzder's ex-wife called the group's attempt to unseal her divorce records an \\"unfair invasion of my personal life.\\" CfA also filed ethics complaint against Republican congressional aides who had worked for the Trump transition team. The group also filed a lawsuit arguing that the United States Department of Justice is failing to comply with a provision in the Freedom of Information Act that requires government agencies to make public \\"statements of policy and interpretations which have been adopted by the agency.\\" In March 2017, CfA and other groups asked Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum to investigate solar panel sales practices that \\"are designed to trick homeowners into buying or leasing solar panels\\" in violation of Oregon's Unlawful Trade Practices Act. The request to Rosenblum \\"singled out one company: California-based SolarCity.\\" The organization reviewed 58 consumer complaints and said that the complaints indicated \\"a widespread pattern of apparent fraud and abuse by solar companies.\\" A spokesman for CfA said, \\"Solar companies often seem to target vulnerable populations, leaving senior Oregonians and those living on fixed incomes with higher monthly utility costs and loans that often exceed what they can afford to pay, plunging them into debt.\\" In April 2017, CfA filed a complaint with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Missouri, calling for a federal grand jury investigation into Missouri State Senate President Pro Tem Ron Richard's acceptance of a $100,000 campaign contribution from a Joplin, Missouri businessman, six days after introducing a bill \\"that would have affected a lawsuit against that donor's company\\" by restricting the ability of plaintiffs to sue under Missouri's consumer protection law.Jason Hancock, Watchdog group calls for investigation of Missouri Senate leader Ron Richard, Kansas City Star (April 19, 2017). Both Richard and the contributor denied wrongdoing, saying that the allegation of pay to play was false. On May 2017, CfA filed a complaint with the Office of Congressional Ethics, asking the office to open an investigation into whether U.S. Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, Republican of New Jersey, the chair of the House Appropriations Committee, violated House ethics rules. The complaint involved a campaign fundraising letter that Frelinghuysen had written to a bank board member in which he criticized a progressive activist who was employed by the bank; Frelinghuysen added a handwritten note to the letter: \\"P.S.

Early life and education Anna Heyward Taylor was born November 13, 1879, in Columbia, South Carolina, one of eight children of Benjamin Walter Taylor‚Äîa physician and surgeon who had served in the Civil War in the Army of Northern Virginia‚Äîand Marianna (Heyward) Taylor. The Taylor family was prominent in the cotton industry and in the development of the city of Columbia. Her older brother Thomas Taylor would later build Taylor House, which became the first location of the Columbia Museum of Art. Taylor received education at the South Carolina College for Women, graduating in 1897. She traveled to Holland in 1903 to study with the painter William Merritt Chase, afterward traveling around Europe for another few years as well as to China and Japan in 1914. Taylor served eighteen months in the American Red Cross in France and Germany during World War I, spending most of the years 1917‚Äì19 in France. She was the first woman from South Carolina to serve with the Red Cross in France during the war. On her return to America, Taylor went to Radcliffe College for graduate work and spent the summers of 1915 and 1916 in Provincetown, Massachusetts, studying printmaking with B.J.O. Nordfeldt at the Provincetown Print workshop. There she became expert in a technique she would often use, white-line woodblock printing, in which most of the print is a solid color with the image formed by white (uninked) lines. This technique makes it possible for an artist to print multiple colors from the same block rather than requiring a separate block for each color. Career As a mature artist, Taylor painted in both oils and watercolor, but she preferred printmaking, especially woodcuts and linocuts. Her style is pictorial with strong graphic lines showing the influence of both modernism and her travels in Asia. Her images were generally printed either in bold colors or in stark black-and-white. With flattened perspective, large areas of color, and limited details, Taylor's prints have echoes of Arts and Crafts prints by artists such as William S. Rice, as well as some of Henri Matisse's work. She also worked occasionally in textiles such as batik-printed silk. In 1916, Taylor accompanied William Beebe's expedition to British Guiana as a scientific illustrator, and she returned again with Beebe in 1920. On both trips, she made botanical studies that greatly influenced her work and that she later translated into prints and batik textiles. For some of these works, her designs drew not just on visible plant parts but also on microscopic sections of stems, ovaries, etc. They were shown at the Museum of Natural History in New York and at the Brooklyn Botanic Gardens in 1922, and they may represent the first time that microscopic details of plants were used in decorative art. Taylor moved to New York City in 1920, remaining there until the end of the decade, when she returned to South Carolina, settling in Charleston. She lived at 79 Church Street and opened a studio on Atlantic Street, where several other leaders of the Charleston Renaissance also had studios. Although she thereafter became closely associated with Charleston's art scene, she continued to travel at intervals; for example spending time in the 1930s in an artist's colony in Taxco, Mexico. In Charleston, Taylor became known for her prints illustrating life in the South Carolina Lowcountry, including agricultural subjects both past and present, local fauna and flora, architecture, street scenes, and the city's tradespeople. A print of African- American women harvesting rice (Harvesting Rice, ca. 1930) was one of five works chosen to represent the city at the 1939 New York World's Fair. In 1949, she illustrated a book by Chalmers Swinton Murray entitled This Our Land: The Story of the Agricultural Society of South Carolina, which provided a picturesque account of aspects of the state's agricultural history. Along with Alice Ravenel Huger Smith, Elizabeth O'Neill Verner, and Alfred Hutty, Taylor is today considered one of the four leading artists of the Charleston Renaissance. Her works are in the collections of the Columbia Museum of Art, the Greenville County Museum of Art, the Gibbes Museum of Art in Charleston, the Morris Museum of Art in Augusta, the American Museum of Natural History, the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens, and other institutions. In 2010 her nephew, Dr. Edmund Rhett Taylor, along with Alexander Moore, had a collection of her letters published by the University of South Carolina Press - Selected Letters of Anna Heyward Taylor, South Carolina Artist and World Traveler. Taylor died March 4, 1956. Her letters and other papers are in the collection of the South Caroliniana Library at the University of South Carolina.

Applin completed her Bachelor of Arts degree in 1919 from the University of California, Berkeley. Later, she completed a Master's degree which was focused on microfossils. She was a leading figure in the use of microfossils to determine the age of rock formation for use in oil exploration in the Gulf of Mexico region. Applin's discoveries were crucial to successful drilling operations across the entire oil industry. Additionally, her contribution to geology, more specifically in the study of micropaleontology, put women geologists on the map, and was pivotal in making them as respected as men in the geological field of science. Early life and education Applin was born as Esther Richards on November 24, 1895, in Newark, Ohio, to Gary Richards, a civil engineer with the United States Army, and Jennie DeVore. Because of her father's work, she lived in various cities in Ohio, then later lived in Fort Des Moines, Iowa, and eventually moved to San Francisco at the age of 12. Richards lived on Alcatraz Island with her family from 1907 until 1920, while her father worked on the construction of Alcatraz Prison. From Alcatraz Island, she traveled to school (high school and later University) via the ferry. Richards attended the University of California, Berkeley, graduating in 1919 with an honors degree in paleontology, geology, and physiography. In 1920, she left California and moved to Houston to work for the Rio Bravo Oil company. While at Berkeley, Richards focused her studies on larger fossils; however, this theoretical education proved to be of little value for underground drilling because remnants of the fossils in drill cuttings were too small to effectively identify. She determined that the microfossils found in the drill cuttings could be useful in the correlation of underground rock formations. She then returned to California and studied micropaleontology, earning her Master's degree. In 1923, Richards married Paul Applin, who was also a geologist. She had two children: a daughter, Louise (born in 1926), and a son, Paul Jr. (born in 1927). Career and achievements  In 1921, Applin presented a paper in Amherst, Massachusetts, stating her theory that microfossils could be used in oil exploration, specifically the dating of the rock formations in the Gulf of Mexico region. Her theory was ridiculed by geologists with more experience and disputed by professor J.J. Galloway of the University of Texas at Austin. Galloway was quoted saying \\"Gentlemen, here is this chit of a girl, right out of college, telling us that we can use Foraminifera to determine the age of formation. Gentlemen, you know that it can't be done.\\" In 1925, Applin co-authored a paper with Alva Ellisor and Hedwig Kniker, which reported her findings that oil-bearing rock formations in the Gulf Coast region could in fact be dated using microfossils. Applin remained with Rio Bravo until 1927, continuing to lead the use of micropaleontology in the oil industry. Applin was able to have a successful career with the Rio Bravo Oil Company due to the fact her micropaleontology studies provided index fossils to the company which was vying for the best oil bearing stratigraphic layers. The matching of micro index fossils between stratigraphic layers in not only the Gulf Coast region, but other regions as well, was the main form of oil exploration for oil companies. Applin's discoveries proved to be essential and irreplaceable to drilling operations, up until the use of electric logs became more feasible. Applin contributed a lasting impact on both women previously in, and soon entering, the relatively newer field of geology. Applin's discoveries transformed geology into a field of study that women could feel much more open in‚Äîmuch more than other, more established fields. After her stint working for Rio Bravo Oil that lasted from 1920-1927, Applin was sought after to work as a consultant to various other oil companies and did so until 1944. It was then, in 1944, that Applin and her family moved to Tallahassee, Florida where she worked alongside her husband at the United States Geological Survey, with the task of linking the oil fields of East Texas, across the southeaster United States, and into Florida, using micropaleontology and other methods. In 1960, Applin received a well-earned plaque from the Gulf Association of Geological Studies, in recognition of her accomplishments and contributions to the field. Following the \\"oil boom\\" decline, Applin and her family moved to Jackson, Mississippi. From there, Applin still wrote papers on stratigraphy, structure of southeastern states, and foraminifera. In 1962, she retired from the Geological Survey, but following retirement, she still continued to do research and publish works.

After his stashhouses are attacked by Luke and his money seized as retaliation for Pop's murder, Cottonmouth condescendingly calls Mariah \\"Black Mariah\\" in one of their many on-screen arguments, which provokes her into throwing a martini glass at him. Later, in another altercation after Cottonmouth is arrested for killing Detective Scarfe, Mariah beats him to death with a microphone stand when he suggests that she actually seduced their uncle Pete, rather than being raped by him as Mariah claims. Ultimately with help from Shades, Mariah pins Cottonmouth's death on Luke. After Diamondback is arrested, Mariah redirects the blame of Cottonmouth's death on him while saying Luke's real name on television, enabling the United States Marshals Service to show up and arrest Luke. By the end of the season, Mariah runs Harlem's criminal underworld out of Harlem's Paradise while entering into a relationship with Shades. ** Although Mariah does not appear in The Defenders, set in between the first two seasons of Luke Cage, it's established that she is still active in Harlem during Luke's time in Seagate Prison. In the episode \\"The H-Word\\", an ad for Mariah's New Harlem Renaissance project appears on the side of the bus that Luke takes back into Harlem. When Misty is catching up with Luke, she mentions that Mariah and Shades have been keeping a low profile. Luke initially suspects them to be behind a string of recent murders in Harlem that are being committed by The Hand, until he learns from Turk that they are the work of the mysterious \\"White Hat\\". ** In season 2 of Luke Cage, Mariah is preparing to go legitimate and retire from her family's gun dealing business, while also trying to reconnect with her estranged daughter Tilda Maybelline Johnson, who was a product of her uncle Pete's rapes. She gets involved with Raymond \\"Piranha\\" Jones, a Wall Street broker and childhood friend of hers, who gives her and Shades insider information about the impending purchase of Atreus Plastics by Glenn Industries. To ensure that the buyout goes through, Mariah sets up a honey trapping scheme where she has a new hostess at Harlem's Paradise, Stephanie Miller, seduce Atreus CEO Mark Higgins, while compromising photos are taken of them together which are used to blackmail Higgins. Unbeknownst to Mariah, Stephanie is a plant by Bushmaster, the son of Mama Mabel and Buggy Stokes' late business partner Quincy McIver, who seeks revenge on Mariah for their murders of his parents. Bushmaster starts his war by killing Nigel Garrison, a Yardie that Mariah is trying to sell her gun business to, and takes over his gang. After acquiring the Stokes' arsenal, Bushmaster makes several attacks on Mariah, leaving the severed heads of Higgins, Cockroach and Ray-Ray on pikes in the entrance to her new Shirley Chisholm community center, killing Piranha after getting him to deplete Mariah's bank accounts, tying up Mariah in her brownstone before burning it down (which she only survives thanks to Luke's intervention), and lastly, attempting to kill her while Luke and Misty are sheltering her in a Rand clinic. Mariah eventually retaliates by leading an attack on a restaurant owned by Bushmaster's family, burning his uncle alive and gunning down Stephanie and several innocent patrons. Shades is disgusted with Mariah, turns himself over to the police, and decides to wear a wire to entrap Mariah. Tilda, meanwhile, is picked up by Bushmaster to brew a concoction to heal him. Having learned the truth about Mariah killing Cottonmouth and the massacre itself, she helps Bushmaster make another attempt to kill Mariah in her den at Harlem's Paradise, but Luke thwarts the attempt. Mariah is subsequently arrested and prosecuted by Blake Tower. In a last-ditch effort to save herself, Mariah orders the assassinations of anyone who might be able to testify against her, including her publicist Alex Wesley, and an attempted hit on Shades. However, her luck runs out, as Tilda fatally poisons her during a family visit. Following her death, Mariah bequeaths Cottonmouth's electric piano to Tilda, and Harlem's Paradise to Luke, in hopes that he will be corrupted trying to run the club and broker peace between Harlem's gangs.

It started out as a solo project for former Pyramids and Everlovely Lightningheart member Faith Coloccia that later saw several session musicians and collaborators, most consistently Aaron Turner of Isis fame and who would later become Coloccia's husband. Turner and Coloccia also perform in House of Low Culture together. Mamiffer has released several albums, splits and collaborations through various record labels, most prominently through Turner's now-defunct Hydra Head Records and Turner and Coloccia's own SIGE Records. The band is known for its collaborations, including albums recorded with Locrian, Circle and Daniel Menche; and working with session/guest artists from bands including members of These Arms Are Snakes, Helms Alee, Sunn O))) and Wolves in the Throne Room.  History  The genesis of Mamiffer was born out of creative ideas from Faith Coloccia's then-defunct band Everlovely Lightningheart. Coloccia invited Aaron Turner to participate, but later grew to become \\"a more permanent member.\\" Coloccia and Turner would also later begin dating and eventually got married. Mamiffer released its debut album Hirror Enniffer on September 23, 2008 through Turner's Hydra Head Records. The album featured numerous session musicians, including members of Seattle post-hardcore band These Arms Are Snakes (Chris Common, Brian Cook and Ryan Frederiksen) and the Seattle sludge metal band Helms Alee (Hozoji Matheson-Margullis and Ben Verellen) in addition to Turner. Hirror Enniffer was well received by music critics. Tom Forget of AllMusic said: \\"Rather than being played, their instrumental compositions seem to unfold, revealing their mysteries at a pace that requires patience,\\" while Cosmo Lee of Pitchfork Media said: \\"The record doesn't mandate how to listen to it. Played loud, its distorted bass could blow heads off. Played softly, its piano makes a fine background.\\" Three years after the release of its debut album, Mamiffer released its second full-length album titled Mare Decendrii in 2011 through Conspiracy Records. Like its predecessor, Mare Decendrii features several guest and session musicians, including members of Melvins, Earth, Circle, Sunn O))) and Wolves in the Throne Room. This album was quickly followed up by the critically acclaimed Bless Them That Curse You‚Äîa collaboration album between Chicago drone act Locrian, released on July 9, 2012 through Profound Lore Records. Coloccia said the recording process, despite so many musicians between two cities, was surprisingly easy. She elaborated: \\"We found connections between seemingly disparate sounds and images, and unified them into harmonious relationships. With the artwork, it was great to collapse personal narrative, and meaning into something made for the specific purpose of packaging the recording, and keeping in mind the aesthetics and feelings that both bands have created.\\" Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic gave Bless Them That Curse You four-out-of-five stars, stating the album, \\"could be said to muster an unsettling new age for the dark age, and it's ultimately that passion for contrasting sounds and viewpoints that makes this collaboration so powerful and seductive.\\" Craig Hayes of PopMatters gave the album eight-out-of-ten stars, stating: \\"Bless Them That Curse You illustrates the full potential of two idiosyncratic and hugely creative entities working together harmoniously‚Äîseeking out the ties that bind.\\" In September/October 2013, Mamiffer toured North American with French shoegaze band Alcest and British prog rock band Anathema. Aaron Turner of Mamiffer performing live in 2015. In 2014, Italian fashion designer Prada reached out to Mamiffer through SIGE requesting permission to use their song \\"Flower of the Field\\" in a commercial featuring Ethan Hawke. The band used the money it received from this deal to fund the recording of their upcoming studio album due out later that year. On November 18, 2014, Mamiffer released its third non-collaborative studio album, Statu Nascendi. At the time of its release, the album was described as a \\"warm-up\\" release for a more ambitious upcoming album. A year later, on November 3, 2015, Mamiffer released a collaborative album between Portland, Oregon noise artist Daniel Menche titled Crater. Turner and Coloccia previously worked together with Menche on various remixes and videos, and decided to make an album together. Crater also saw the group collecting field recordings, which had Turner, Coloccia and Menche enjoying themselves while \\"hiking and exploring nature\\" together. Pitchfork included Crater on is Best Experimental Albums of 2015 list. Mamiffer released The World Unseen on April 1, 2016 through SIGE. The band began writing songs for The World Unseen as early as 2011 and recorded it between 2013 and 2014. Coloccia described the album as thematically feeling incomplete and imperfect and that it's \\"an exploration of subconscious and psychic bonds between the past and present, and the ways in which the musical devices of repetition and incantation create hands across the chasm that divide the human from the divine.\\" In November 2017 it was announced that Mamiffer will release a compilation of samples they used throughout the years at live shows and on studio albums titled Recordings For Lilac III. The album would be released as cassette edition limited to 150 copies only through The Tapeworm label. The compilation is put together semi-chronologically with the earliest materials going back to 2008 and is set to be shipped in December 2017.

The ten book Nesth√§kchen series follows Annemarie from infancy (Nesth√§kchen and Her Dolls) to old age and grandchildren (Nesth√§kchen with White Hair).Jennifer Redmann. Nostalgia and Optimism in Else Ury's \\"Nesth√§kchen\\" Books for Young Girls in the Weimar Republic. The German Quarterly, Vol. 79, No. 4 (Fall, 2006), pp. 465-483 Volume 9 (1924) describes Anne Marie's life as her youngest child, Ursel, Ursel's husband and children, return to Germany after 16 years in Brazil. Plot summary It is 1961. Sixteen years have passed since Ursel‚Äôs wedding, and she has not seen her family in Germany. Ursel lives with her husband, Milton Tavares, her fourteen year old, very different twins Anita and Marietta, and her little son, Juan (Hans), in S√£o Paulo. The rich family has a luxurious existence, but Ursel works to improve the lot of the exploited plantation laborers. Marietta wants to emulate her mother, while the spoiled Anita thinks only of herself. One day Marietta gets lost on a neighboring plantation and finds a little German girl, Lotte M√ºller, whose mother is in a mud hut dying. The orphaned Lotte is adopted by the Tavares family and taken on their long-planned trip to Germany to find the mother's relatives. Annemarie suffers severely during the extended separation from her youngest, Ursel. She has become the most beloved \\"Omama\\" of Vronli‚Äôs daughter, Gerda, and of Hans' children Lilli, Eva, Ned (presumably named after Annemarie's father, who is originally Edmund and called Ned by his wife) and Heinz. Annemarie's brother Hans has died. His second wife Margot and his two sons Herbert and Waldemar have disappeared from the story. When Anita and Marietta arrive in Germany, they have problems, because the two rich girls find it difficult to get used to the simple life, and do not want to help Rudolf and Annemarie with housework. However, the modest Marietta soon adapts, as she distances herself from her dominant twin sister. Little Lotte lives in the Hartenstein house with the servant couple Kunze; she is a replacement for their daughter. Her relatives ‚Äì originally from Silesia, after 1945 from Westphalia‚Äîcannot be found. A dramatic turn occurs when Rudolf suffers a heart attack and is afraid to die without having seen Ursel again. Secretly, Marietta sends a telegram to her mother and tells her of the illness of her father. One day, Ursel appears unannounced at the door with the small Juan. Her husband arrives soon after. At the end, fifteen year old Marietta decides to stay in Germany with Rudolf and Annemarie. Genre Else Ury, 1915 The Nesth√§kchen books represent a German literary genre, the Backfischroman, a girls' novel that describes maturation and was intended for readers 12 ‚Äì 16 years old. A Backfisch (‚Äúteenage girl‚Äù, literally ‚Äúfish for frying‚Äù) is a young girl between fourteen and seventeen years of age. The Backfischroman was in fashion between 1850 and 1950. It dealt overwhelmingly with stereotypes, traditional social images of growing girls absorbing societal norms. The stories ended in marriage, with the heroine becoming a Hausfrau. Among the most successful Backfischroman authors, beside Else Ury, were Magda Trott, Emmy von Rhoden with her Der Trotzkopf and Henny Koch. Ury intended to end the Nesth√§kchen series with volume 6, Nesth√§kchen Flies From the Nest, describing Nesth√§kchen's marriage. Meidingers Jugendschriften Verlag, her Berlin publisher, was inundated with a flood of letters from Ury's young fans, begging for more Nesth√§kchen stories. After some hesitation, Ury wrote four more Nesth√§kchen volumes, and included comments about her initial doubts in an epilogue to volume 7, Nesth√§kchen and Her Chicks. Author Else Ury (November 1, 1877 in Berlin; January 13, 1943 in the Auschwitz concentration camp) was a German writer and children's book author. Her best-known character is the blonde doctor's daughter Annemarie Braun, whose life from childhood to old age is told in the ten volumes of the highly successful Nesth√§kchen series. The books, the six-part TV series Nesth√§kchen (1983), based on the first three volumes, as well as the new DVD edition (2005) caught the attention of millions of readers and viewers.Patricia M.

It comes under article 293 of the 1997 revision of the People's Republic of China's Penal Code, and carries a maximum sentence of five years. The crime is defined as undermining public order by creating a disturbance in a public place. As this is an ill-defined crime, it has frequently been used as an excuse to arrest human rights activists, civil rights activists, and lawyers in China, and hold them in detention pending more serious charges such as inciting subversion of state power.

It was built from 1883 to 1988. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  A Temporary Reserve for Public Recreation of , bounded by Anne, Deane, Bridge and Church Streets, Charters Towers, was proclaimed on 15 May 1883. In 1888 the reserve was named Lissner Park after Isidor Lissner, a Charters Towers businessman and politician and later a minister in the 1893 Griffith Ministry. Discovered in late 1871, Charters Towers became the richest of the North Queensland mining fields. The field was proclaimed a town in 1877, and by the early 1880s was a prosperous settlement which made a major contribution to the social, political and economic development of North Queensland. The predominant vegetation of the Charters Towers district was Eucalyptus woodland and open Eucalyptus woodland, which was quickly destroyed as timber was felled and used as shoring for the mines, for building purposes, and as fuel for the Cornish boilers. Concern that the environment was being destroyed led to protests about the loss of vegetation from leading citizens, including Anglican Bishop Gilbert White and Isidore Lissner MLA. As a result of the devastation and in keeping with the prevailing belief that the development of gardens improved the moral character and social well being of the community, Lissner encouraged the Charters Towers Municipal Council to request that a reserve be set aside for recreation and botanical purposes. A Temporary Reserve for Public Recreation, proclaimed on 15 May 1885, was placed under \\"the control of the Municipal Council\\" and on 17 August 1891 the park became a permeant reserve with the Municipal Council appointed as trustees. The park was named after Isidor Siegfried Lissner who arrived in Charters Towers in 1873 after living for some time on mining fields in southern Australia. During his time in Charters Towers Lissner developed a financial empire based on mining and commercial interests. He took a keen interest in community affairs and pushed for the establishment of sporting facilities and public amenities such as Lissner Park. At the urging of his friend Robert Philp he stood for the seat of Charters Towers in 1883. After his election to the Queensland Legislative Assembly, he became a strong advocate for better community services for the municipality and he won the approval of the community when he opposed the introduction of cheap Asian, Kanaka and German labour into the mining and sugar industries. Lissner was also a supporter of the North Queensland Separation Movement and he became Minister for Mines and Public Works in 1893. Development of the park was funded by government grants of in 1885 and in 1889. Early work included clearing stumps and rubbish, leveling the ground and tree planting. Tenders were called for a gardener in June 1889 after the first plantings died. The new gardener replanted the park with trees supplied by Ben Gulliver of Acacia Vale Nursery in Townsville. While Ben Gulliver was actively involved in supplying plants to several botanical gardens in North Queensland there is no evidence that Lissner Park was developed as a botanical gardens. Some of the Gulliver trees which still survive include tamarinds, figs, various palms and pine trees. Bandstand in Lissner Park, ca. 1905 The public quickly saw the value of an area reserved for recreation and took advantage of the cleared ground to build a cricket pitch. Attending concerts in the park became a favourite evening pastime as well. As the popularity of attending social and musical events in the park grew, the Lissner Park Committee, set up to raise funds to oversee the development of the reserve, suggested that a Band Pavilion Fund be established to pay for the construction of a pavilion. In 1889, Charters Towers architect William George Smith jnr, designed a structure which cost to build. The design was octagonal with a diameter platform in the centre for the band. Around this stage there was space for dancing or for seating. The corrugated iron roof was supported by ornamental iron pillars and provision was made in the design for curtains to be let down to protect the band if rain fell. Other celebrations held in the park included Queen Victoria's Jubilee, the birth of Federation, memorial events at the death of Queen Victoria and events to honour people who went to the Boer War and World War I. Fountain at Lissner Park, ca. 1906 During the Boer War a South African Patriotic Fund was established in Charters Towers to assist families and soldiers affected by the war in Africa. was left in the fund after the war and the Municipal Council suggested that a kiosk be built in Lissner Park as a memorial to Charters Towers people who served in the war. In 1909 the Council offered a prize for the best design for a Memorial Kiosk. Mr F Jorgensen, Director of the Technical College, won the competition, however, during construction his design was slightly altered when the floor design of the Australian Flag and the Union Jack, to be created in tiles, was removed because it was seen as inappropriate that people would walk on the flags. It is not known who built the kiosk but the iron work was supplied by local foundry Walton & Millgate. An honour board, erected at the western end of the kiosk, contains the names of those soldiers from the district who lost their lives during the Boer War. Over 7000 people attended the opening ceremony and enjoyed the promenade concert after the opening by Mayor Sydney Hood Thorp. The celebrations lasted all day and during the evening the band rotunda, fountain and kiosk were brightly lit for the concert. Because the park had become a recognised central gathering place it became the obvious location for protest meetings in the late 1880s and early 1890s. On 24 March 1889 a vocal group from the Charters Towers Mining Union met in the park to pass a resolution asking the government to amend the 1884 Land Act to give miners the right to mine lease hold land. In another meeting in the park in July 1889 2500 miners and local people assembled to discuss and give support to the strikers at the Day Dawn PC Mine who were out on strike over measures taken by the owners to prevent gold being stolen. A gathering in August 1889 gave support to the government's proposal to introduce an eight-hour day and a meeting, called by the Charters Towers Branch of the Australian Labor Federation, met in the park on 1 March 1891. The issue under discussion was the need for a resolution of the dispute between shearers and pastoralists over working conditions and wages. The Lissner Park meeting requested that the government bring both parties together to resolve the issue and that conciliation boards be established by the government to settle such disputes in future. Photographic evidence indicates that a bush house, which no longer exists, was constructed in April, 1891. A \\"tin\\" fountain, installed prior to 1910, was removed from the park in 1964 or 65 when the Lions Club built a ceramic tiled fountain. The original tin fountain, which no longer works, has recently been returned to the park. A small lake was constructed in 1911 and the toilets and lighting were extended in 1912. A small zoo, which was constructed at the northern end of the park along Plummer St, is now being slowly removed because the care of animals is costly and time consuming. A new, smaller, animal enclosure was developed in 1988 on the site of the 1911 lake. A memorial to Joseph and William Hann, early explorers and pastoralists in the Kennedy District, was erected in 1959 to celebrate the centenary of pastoral settlement. The stone used in the memorial was taken from Basalt River near the Bluff Downs homestead where William Hann first settled. Extensive concrete paths were constructed under the Red Scheme in the 1970s. These walkways follow the line of some earlier \\"cinder\\" paths which crisscrossed the park. The recreation reserve was reduced in size in 1971 when a swimming pool was constructed at the northern end of the park on land bounded by Plummer and Church Streets. It was probably at this time that Mosman Creek, which now forms the boundary between the park and the pool, was lined with concrete and stone along the section bordering the park. Roosting flying foxes in Lissner Park, 2016 Some renovations to the kiosk were carried out in mid 1970. The Boer War Veterans Memorial Kiosk was entered on the Register of the National Estate in 1978 and in 1989 a National Estate Grant of $31,300 was awarded for conservation work on the kiosk. The bandstand has recently been repaired and painted and the installation of an irrigation system to water the whole park has created a pleasant, cool environment which is being utilised by the local community and travellers. Since at least 2010, Lissner Park has attracted large number of roosting flying foxes, which are disliked by the residents. However, they are a protected species and humane methods to discourage them have been ineffective.  Description =Lissner Park= Bandstand, Lissner Park, 2016 Lissner Park is a recreational reserve of some . It is bounded by Anne, Church, Plummer, Deane and Bridge Streets, and is located three blocks to the north of Gill Street, the main street of Charters Towers. It is well grassed with a scattering of perimeter trees and remnant avenues, and a collection of structures and enclosures. The structures include the Band Rotunda and the Boer War Veterans Memorial Kiosk. The park is relatively flat, rising gently towards Anne Street to the south. Memorial to William Hann, Lissner Park, 2016 Mosman Creek separates the northern end of the park from the remainder. The central part of the park includes many of the park's structures and several mature trees including large figs. The southern end of the park is grassed, gently sloping and bound by perimeter trees. There is some remnants of a central axis formed by structures and planting. The trees within the park include figs, jacarandas, eucalypts, tamarinds, palms and silky oaks. The Band Rotunda is located on the central axis of the park towards Mosman Creek. It is octagonal in plan with a corrugated iron pyramid roof and cast iron finial. Constructed in timber, it has posts paired at each corner and a cast iron fringe between. The chamferboard base is largely hidden by a small hedge. The structure is encircled by palm trees, and nearby are several large fig trees. At the boundary to the west of the bandstand, are wrought iron gates with gate posts and some cast iron fence posts. Further to the south of the bandstand, and also on the central axis is the remnant of the fountain. It is encircled by a ring of trees and a small bougainvillea hedge. The fountain is raised on a small platform, bound by a low concrete retaining wall with a moulded top. The fountain has a crucifix form in plan, is constructed from folded \\"tin\\" sheets, and exhibits evidence of removed decorative elements. Other elements of the park include a playground, the 1959 memorial to William Hann, the 1988 fernery, the 1988 animal enclosure and the 1972 Rotary centenary pond. Traversing the park, Mosman Creek is now lined with stone and concrete, and is crossed by two timber and steel footbridges. Across the creek two animal enclosures with some emus and a kangaroo. In the north-eastern corner is the Kennedy Regiment Memorial Swimming Pool which is not part of the park. =Boer War Veterans Memorial Kiosk= Boer War Veterans Memorial Kiosk, 2016 Standing to the west of the fountain is the Boer War Veterans Memorial Kiosk. It lies on an east-west axis, with both ends semicircular in plan, and is constructed in cast iron and steel. The kiosk is an open structure, with an inner and outer ring of cast iron columns with Corinthian capitals. These support the red bellcast corrugated iron roof and encircling concave verandah. The roof is punctuated with three small louvred dormers to each side, and has ridge ventilators, cast iron cresting and flagstaffs at each end. The outer ring of columns have cast iron brackets. To the south- western corner are panels of timber louvres between the columns. Raised one step on a concrete plinth is the inner ring of columns. Running between these is a cast iron balustrade. Above is a series of steel struts providing the bracing. At the western end of the kiosk, behind the louvres is a servery with marble benches. Above the benches are three marble plaques facing east, with gilded lettering naming some eighty local soldiers who served in the Boer War. Facing the kiosk at the eastern end are two canons.  Heritage listing  Boer War Veterans Memorial Kiosk and Lissner Park was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Boer War Veterans Memorial Kiosk, constructed in 1909, is significant because it exemplifies a widespread social movement expressing Australian patriotism and nationalism during the early twentieth century and belongs to a class of commemorative memorials which record local community response to events such as war. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Boer War Veterans Memorial Kiosk, constructed in 1909, is significant because it exemplifies a widespread social movement expressing Australian patriotism and nationalism during the early twentieth century and belongs to a class of commemorative memorials which record local community response to events such as war. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Lissener Park has retained its fine Victorian character as a result of the survival of many of the trees supplied by Ben Gulliver, Townsville nurseryman and botanist. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The park has been a focus for community cultural and social activities since its inception and was the venue for commemorative events and for political gatherings during the turbulent years of the rise of the Labor Party during the last decade of the nineteenth century. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Lissner Park, named after Queensland MLA and local businessman Isidor Lissner, is important as the earliest recreation venue in Charters Towers. The park, developed as a response to the prevailing belief that gardens improved the moral character and enhanced the social well being of the community, was established with the support of Lissner.

The problem is that Rafael, later finds out that he is the son of In√©s Echegoyen (Gig√≠ Ru√°), who is then killed in an operation by Luciana (Juana Viale) who wanted staying with the inheritance, Rafael began a relationship with her after being in an accident on the street; but he will also feel a strong attraction for Victoria (Julieta Cardinali), a biochemist who interned her sister Teresa (Mar√≠a Abadi), whom she accused of her mother's death, and Ana (Sabrina Garciarena), her employer, who is taken as crazy, since she was ill medicated for 15 years. Ana was in love with Rafael all her life, but he never looked at her until she arrived with a new boyfriend who allegedly returned her sanity after being hospitalized after an attack. Her boyfriend Gabriel (Esteban P√©rez) is with her for her money even if she tries to deny it, when her sister Sol (Jazm√≠n Falak) appears, saying after learning that Ana loves Rafa, that he loves her for her money. It also meant that they were relatives of Luciana and Ines. Then Gabriel threatens her not to say it and invents that she has mental problems. Love is also addressed between Elena (Agustina Cherri), a maid who is Lisandro's unrecognized daughter and Agust√≠n, the youngest son of the Villalba family, who is an inveterate drunk, this relationship will be constantly threatened Josefina, Agust√≠n's wife, and Pedro (Mariano Torre), Elena's husband, who besides being a policeman, even sleeps with Josefina and has a son with her to separate Agust√≠n from Elena. There are also the stories of the other employees: Esther (Leonor Manso), Rafael's adoptive mother who had an affair with the current priest of the town, Evaristo (Alberto Mart√≠n); Marisol (Malena Solda) who only tries to look for her lost son, \\"El Negro\\" (Alberto Ajaka), who will do everything possible to hide Julian (Federico Barga), the lost son of his cousin Marisol; Juan Domingo (Nicol√°s Riera), a pawn who first falls in love with Elena and then with Emilia (Laura Laprida), a stagnant; Cuca (Miriam Odorico), an employee who does not look for anything out of the ordinary but will be very flushed by Osvaldo (Guillermo Arengo), who is in love with her and Jackie (B√°rbara Lombardo), a Maid who comes to the stay fleeing justice.

Finally, a very deep story. It is a lagoon of the room that according to Marcial (Luciano C√°ceres), the current mayor of La Cruz, has healing properties. Thanks to this, Marcial, along with Victoria and Lisandro, will carry out many experiments to \\"contribute to science\\". What Marcial really wanted is to use this water to heal his father Humberto (Carlos Weber), who has been in a coma for a long time. When his father wakes up, he tells Marcial that he had a son with Ang√©lica. Marcial knowing this, he starts looking for his lost brother to make his life impossible.

Therefore, one day after many conflicts, Marcial shoots Agust√≠n and is helped by Pedro to make everything look like it was suicide. Agust√≠n is resurrected thanks to Victoria, who injected the formula of the lagoon. But when you revive you have memory loss. Although all these stories take their course, they all intertwine with several aspects: the death of Angelica, the end of finding her murderer, the healing lagoon and the greed to possess her, in addition to the different love relationships of the inhabitants of Santa Elena. The problem is that after Ang√©lica's death, nothing will be as before. For none of the inhabitants of the room will be seen with the same eyes and all will suspect everyone because of ambition. = The End = After Antonio lets Laura and Lisandro escape, the Santa Elena stay prepares for Esther's birthday and retirement.

On the other hand, Marcial who is isolated from everyone and with a personality problem believing that he is his mother is visited by Victoria, who is going to Sweden to continue the investigation of the formula. When she said goodbye to Marcial she told him that she never hated someone with as much love as she had done with him. Already at the party Juan Domingo and Emilia return from their trip and talk with Cuca and Osvaldo, who were in charge of the bar. Production The first episode had a cameo by the actress Norma Aleandro, whose character is killed at the end of the episode. She returned to the telenovela when Bernarda was killed, as a ghost who takes her to the afterlife. Initially, the characters of Castro and Gonz√°lez were meant to become a couple, but according to Gonz√°lez, the writers kept her with Darthes because of the positive reception to the couple. Castro was upset because of those comments, because he had initially suggested the producer Adri√°n Suar to take Gonz√°lez for the role. He requested the writers to make some other romance for him, and for this purpose Juana Viale joined the cast in July. Benedetto and Ajaka were removed from the telenovela when their contracts expired. The characters of Benedetto were killed, and Ajaka escaped from the police.

It is designed to showcase the pen computing capabilities of Microsoft's Windows 8/8.1 and Windows 10 operating systems.  First generation  The first Surface Pen was introduced in 2012 alongside the Surface Pro, which uses Penabled technology designed by Wacom. It features one physical button on the side to simulate a right-click when the pen comes into contact with the display, as well as an eraser tip at the top of the Pen that removes ink strokes when it comes into contact with the display. It was bundled with the Surface Pro and Surface Pro 2, but is not compatible with other models. The button on the pen doubles as a magnetic clip which can be used to attach the pen to the Surface charging port (although not while simultaneously charging the device). Although the technology was deprecated with subsequent generations and is now branded as \\"Pro Pen\\", it can still be purchased as an accessory for the Surface Pro and Surface Pro 2 as well as other Penabled-compatible devices such as those from Lenovo ThinkPad lineup.  Second generation = Surface Pro 3 = A new version of the Surface Pen was launched in 2014 with the Surface Pro 3. Based on technology developed by N-trig (a separate company at the time, though subsequently acquired by Microsoft), the Surface Pro 3 version lacks the eraser tip present in the previous generation; erasing is done by drawing over the ink strokes while holding down one of two physical buttons on the side, above the button used for right-clicking. A third button, located in place of the eraser tip, sends a Bluetooth signal to a paired Surface PC which instantly opens OneNote, even when the device is locked (although advanced editing functions are disabled in this case). Unlike the Wacom-powered Surface Pen, it requires two batteries: one AAAA battery for stylus operation, and two size 319 coin cell batteries for the top button. The pen is included with all Surface Pro 3s but is also compatible with and available as an optional accessory for the Surface 3. Unlike the previous pen, this version can be stowed away by sliding it into a self-adhesive felt loop which can be attached to the Surface Type Cover (optional extra). It is also compatible with all subsequent Surface PCs, which uses the same basic technology. Surface Pro 3 Pen is able to detect 256 levels of pressure on its tip. Model numbers are 3UY-00001 (Silver), 3UY-00012 (Black), 3UY-00021 (Red), 3UY-00030 (Blue).  Third generation = Surface Pro 4 = With the release of the Surface Pro 4, Microsoft introduced an updated version of the Surface Pen. While using the same technology as the Surface Pro 3 pen, it has only one (non-customizable) button on the side rather than two, and brings back the top-mounted eraser (retaining the button functionality) and also allows customizing the button (called the \\"magic button\\") to perform different actions. The default options are: single-click opens OneNote, double-click takes a screenshot, press-and-hold launches Cortana. This generation saw the return of the magnetic attachment, although this time the pen snaps into place on the opposite side of the Surface device, thereby freeing up the charging port (now called the Surface Connect port). This version of the pen is bundled with the Surface Pro 4, the Surface Book and the Surface Studio; it can also be purchased separately for the Surface Laptop. It is also compatible with the Surface Pro 3 and Surface 3. Surface Pro 4 is able to detect 1024 levels of pressure on its tip. Latency drops to just 45 milliseconds in comparison with Surface Pro 3 Pen. Model numbers are 3XY-00001 (Silver), 3XY-00011 (Black), 3XY-00021 (Dark Blue) and 3XY-00051 (Gold). A set of 4 interchangeable pen tips were included with this pen, but only made available as an option (Model RJ3-00003) for the fourth generation pen. The tips are marked using the same nomenclature used for pencil hardness 2H, H, HB, B. = Surface Hub = The Surface Hub, released in June 2015, ships with a pair of digital pens that employ technology similar to the Surface Pen for PCs. Holstered to each side of the device, they have eraser tips but no extra buttons. They integrate with the built-in Whiteboard app and, unlike the Surface Pen, can both be used for simultaneously inking by multiple users.  Fourth generation = Surface Pro (2017) = With the release of the Surface Pro 5th gen, Microsoft introduced an updated version of the Surface Pen. Unlike previous generations of the Surface Pen, this version of the pen is sold separately at a higher price of $99. It is also compatible with Surface Pro 6, Surface Pro 4, Surface Go, Surface Studio, Surface Book 2, Surface Book, Surface Laptop 2, Surface Laptop, Surface Pro 3, and Surface 3. The new Surface Pen is able to detect 4096 levels of pressure and has 1024 levels of tilt sensitivity, which was not available on previous generations. It has 21 milliseconds of latency, making it \\"the fastest digital pen on the planet‚Äù at the time of release, according to Microsoft. Model numbers are EYU-00001/EYU-00002 (Black), EYU-00009/EYU-00010 (Platinum), EYU-00017/EYU-00018 (Cobalt Blue), EYV-00025/EYU-00025/EYU-00026 (Burgundy), EYU-00041/EYU-00042 (Poppy Red) and EYU-00049/EYU-00050 (Ice Blue).

In June 2017, he was released by North Korea in a vegetative state and died soon afterward. Warmbier entered North Korea as part of a guided tour group on December 29, 2015. On January 2, 2016, he was arrested at Pyongyang International Airport while awaiting departure from the country. He was convicted of attempting to steal a propaganda poster from his hotel, for which he was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment with hard labor. Shortly after his sentencing in March 2016, Warmbier suffered a severe neurological injury from an unconfirmed cause and fell into a coma, which lasted over a year. North Korean authorities did not disclose his medical condition until June 2017, when they announced he had fallen into a coma as a result of botulism and a sleeping pill. He was freed later that month, still in a comatose state after 17 months in captivity. He was repatriated to the United States and arrived in Cincinnati, Ohio on June 13, 2017. He was taken to University of Cincinnati Medical Center for immediate evaluation and treatment. Warmbier never regained consciousness and died on June 19, 2017, six days after his return to the United States when his parents had requested his feeding tube to be removed. A coroner's report stated that he died from an unknown injury causing lack of oxygen to the brain. Non-invasive internal scans did not find any signs of fractures to his skull. In 2018, a U.S. federal court found the North Korean government liable for Warmbier's torture and death, in a default judgment in favor of Warmbier's parents after North Korea did not contest the case. In 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump caused controversy after saying that he believed the word of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un that Kim was not responsible for Warmbier's death. In response, Warmbier's parents criticized Trump for making excuses for Kim and \\"his evil regime\\".  Early life  Otto Warmbier was born on December 12, 1994, the eldest of three children of Cynthia (\\"Cindy\\", n√©e Garber) and Fred Warmbier. He was raised in Cincinnati, Ohio. He attended Wyoming High School, where he was considered popular and studious, and graduated in 2013 as salutatorian.\\"As he prepared to leave high school, Otto Warmbier celebrated 'finale' and the future ahead\\" , wcpo.com, June 20, 2017; accessed June 22, 2017. He went on to enroll at the University of Virginia, where he was pursuing a double major degree in commerce and economics, and did a foreign exchange at the London School of Economics. His minor was in global sustainability. He was a member of the Theta Chi fraternity. Warmbier's mother is Jewish, and Otto was active in Hillel on his college campus. He had an interest in other cultures, and had visited Israel (on a Birthright trip), Europe, Cuba, and Ecuador.  North Korea  Warmbier was scheduled to undertake a study-abroad program in Hong Kong in early 2016, and decided to visit North Korea en route over the New Year period. He booked a tour of North Korea with Young Pioneer Tours, a China-based budget tour operator whose slogan is \\"destinations your mother would rather you stayed away from\\". Warmbier's father Fred said that Young Pioneer advertised the trip as safe for U.S. citizens and that Otto was \\"curious about their culture... he wanted to meet the people of North Korea.\\" On December 29, 2015, Warmbier flew via Beijing to North Korea with his tour group, which included ten other U.S. citizens, for a five-day New Year's tour. The tour group celebrated New Year's Eve by carousing in Pyongyang's Kim Il-sung Square before returning to their accommodations at the Yanggakdo International Hotel, where they continued drinking alcohol. Early in the morning of New Year's Day, Warmbier allegedly tried to steal a propaganda poster from a staff-only area of the hotel. The poster stated (in Korean), \\"Let's arm ourselves strongly with Kim Jong-il's patriotism!\\" Damaging or stealing such items with the name or image of a North Korean leader is considered a serious crime by the North Korean government. = Arrest = The Yanggakdo International Hotel in Pyongyang, where the alleged attempted theft took place On January 2, 2016, Warmbier was arrested at Pyongyang International Airport while awaiting departure from North Korea. Danny Gratton, a British member of Warmbier's tour group, witnessed the arrest. He said: When the group's plane was about to leave the terminal, an official came aboard and announced, \\"Otto is very sick and has been taken to the hospital.\\" Some media reports indicated that Warmbier spoke by phone to a Young Pioneer tour guide following his arrest, but this was denied by a Young Pioneer spokesman who told BBC News that \\"none of its employees had direct contact with Otto after he was escorted away.\\" The others in his tour group left the country without incident. North Korea's state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) initially announced that Warmbier had been detained for \\"a hostile act against the state,\\" without specifying further details. North Korea refused to elaborate on the precise nature of his wrongdoing for six weeks, although a Young Pioneer spokeswoman advised Reuters there had been an \\"incident\\" at the Yanggakdo Hotel. In a press conference on February 29, 2016, Warmbier, reading from a prepared statement, confessed that he had attempted to steal a propaganda poster from a restricted staff-only area of the second floor of the Yanggakdo Hotel to take home. It is not known whether the confession was forced, as Warmbier never regained consciousness after his return to the U.S. However, various sources, including Gratton, said that he was clearly under duress. Former prisoners of North Korea have later recanted their confessions after their release, stating they were made under duress.\\"Detained US Student Admits 'Very Severe' ‚Äî And Totally Absurd ‚Äî Crime in North Korea\\" , Vice News, February 29, 2016\\"The strange ways North Korea makes detainees confess on camera\\" , The Washington Post, February 29, 2016\\"After nearly a year detained in North Korea, little progress made to free American student Otto Warmbier\\" , Fox News, December 24, 2016 Warmbier's confession also stated that he had plotted to steal the poster at the behest of a Methodist church in his hometown and the , a secret society at the University of Virginia that he wished to join, both of which he said were allied with the Central Intelligence Agency. These claims, which Time magazine called \\"fanciful\\" and \\"implausible,\\" were disputed by both the church and the . The New York Times remarked that \\"the unlikely nature of the details suggested the script had been written by Mr. Warmbier's North Korean interrogators.\\" U.S. negotiator Mickey Bergman later stated that Warmbier's family were advised to maintain silence about his Jewish heritage while he was under arrest, as negotiators believed that publicly repudiating Warmbier's purported affiliation with a Methodist church would antagonize the North Korean regime. = Trial and conviction = On March 16, 2016, a few hours after U.S. envoy Bill Richardson met in New York with two North Korean diplomats from the United Nations office to press for Warmbier's release, Warmbier was tried and convicted in North Korea's Supreme Court. He was charged with subversion under Article 60 of North Korea's Criminal Code. The court held that he had committed a crime \\"pursuant to the U.S. government's hostile policy toward [North Korea], in a bid to impair the unity of its people after entering it as a tourist.\\" Evidence at his trial, which lasted one hour, included his confession, CCTV footage, fingerprint evidence, and witness testimony.\\"North Korea sentences U.S. student to 15 years hard labor\\" , CNN, March 17, 2016 A video purporting to be the hotel's security-camera footage of the theft of the propaganda poster was released by KCNA on March 18, 2016. In the brief low-resolution video, time-stamped 1:57a.m., a figure removes a poster from a corridor wall and places it on the floor, leaning it against the wall. The footage released does not display subsequent events. Warmbier indicated in his confession that he abandoned the poster after discovering it was too large to carry away. A hotel staff member told the court: \\"When I got off work, there was nothing amiss. But when I returned, I thought someone had deliberately taken the slogan down, so I mobilized security to prevent damage to it and reported it to the authorities.\\" Warmbier was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. Human Rights Watch called the hearing a kangaroo courtRobertson, Phil. \\"Death of Otto Warmbier Highlights North Korea Rights Abuses\\" , Human Rights Watch, June 20, 2017 and described the sentencing as \\"outrageous and shocking.\\" U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner stated it was clear that North Korea used arrested American citizens for political purposes despite its claims to the contrary.  Release  Fred and Cindy Warmbier met with numerous Obama administration officials, including then Secretary of State John Kerry, and with the Swedish ambassador, who served as an interlocutor between the U.S. and North Korea. In May 2017, Fred Warmbier said the Obama administration had encouraged them to keep a low profile about their son's situation, but that he and his wife wanted their son to be part of any negotiations between the United States and North Korea.Parents of Otto Warmbier, US citizen detained in North Korea, want son to be part of negotiations . Fox News Channel. May 1, 2017. On June 13, 2017, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson announced that North Korea had released Warmbier. Tillerson also announced that the State Department had secured Warmbier's release at the direction of President Donald Trump, and the State Department would continue discussing three other detained Americans with North Korea. Subsequent media reports revealed that, at a meeting in New York on June 6, North Korean officials had advised U.S. State Department Special Representative Joseph Yun that Warmbier had contracted food-borne botulism shortly after his sentencing and had fallen into a coma after taking a sleeping pill. A delegation headed by Yun flew to Pyongyang to oversee Warmbier's repatriation. After 17 months in prison, Warmbier, in a comatose state, was medically evacuated to Cincinnati and arrived in the evening of June 13. He was taken to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, where doctors tried to determine what caused his coma and if there were signs of recovery. = Medical condition = Warmbier's physicians at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center stated that he was in \\"a state of unresponsive wakefulness,\\" commonly known as persistent vegetative state.\\"Doctors: Ex-North Korea detainee Otto Warmbier has severe brain injury\\" , CNN, June 16, 2017 He was able to breathe on his own and blink his eyes, but otherwise showed no signs of awareness of his environment, such as understanding language, nor did he initiate any purposeful movements. Medical records from North Korea showed that Warmbier had been in this state since April 2016, one month after his conviction. During his release, the North Koreans provided a disc containing two magnetic resonance imaging brain scans, dated April and July 2016, showing damage to the brain. According to his medical team, brain scans revealed Warmbier had suffered extensive loss of brain tissue throughout his brain, consistent with a cardiopulmonary event that caused the brain to be deprived of oxygen. Doctors said they did not know what caused the cardiac arrest, but that it could have been triggered by a respiratory arrest, while a neurointensive care specialist at the hospital stated that there was no evidence indicating botulism. His doctors found no evidence of physical abuse or torture; scans of Warmbier's neck and head were normal outside of the brain injury. They added \\"We didn't see any evidence of healing fractures or healed fractures that would have been within that time frame\\" and that \\"We believe that for somebody who had been bedridden for more than a year, that his body was in excellent condition, that his skin was in excellent condition\\". Warmbier's father held a press conference on June 15 but declined to answer a reporter's question as to whether or not the neurological injury was caused by an assault, saying he would let the doctors make that determination. He stated that his family did not believe anything the North Koreans told them. He expressed anger at the North Koreans for his son's condition, saying, \\"There is no excuse for any civilized nation to have kept his condition secret, and denied him top-notch medical care for so long.\\"  Death  After his parents requested his feeding tube be removed, Warmbier died in the hospital at 2:20 p.m. on June 19, 2017, at the age of 22. His family issued a statement expressing their sadness, thanking the hospital staff for their actions. President Trump issued a statement regarding Warmbier's death: \\"There is nothing more tragic for a parent than to lose a child in the prime of life. Our thoughts and prayers are with Otto's family and friends, and all who loved him.\\" He added: \\"The United States once again condemns the brutality of the North Korean regime as we mourn its latest victim.\\" North Korean officials said their country was the \\"biggest victim\\" from Warmbier's death as a result of a \\"smear campaign,\\" stating their treatment of him was \\"humanitarian.\\" A spokesman added: At the request of Warmbier's family, an autopsy was not performed, and only a postmortem external examination was conducted. Doctors speculated that the cause of death could have been a blood clot, pneumonia, sepsis, or kidney failure. Sleeping pills could have caused Warmbier to stop breathing if he had botulism and was paralyzed from it. The University of Cincinnati doctors found no evidence of botulism, but several neurologists said that botulism cannot be ruled out, given the length of time before Warmbier's return to the U.S. GQ journalist Doug Bock Clark suggested that Warmbier may have attempted suicide some time after his sentencing. A funeral for Warmbier was held on June 22, 2017, at Wyoming High School; more than 2,500 mourners attended. He was buried at Oak Hill Cemetery in Glendale, Ohio, and students tied ribbons on every tree and pole along the three-mile route taken by the funeral procession from the high school to the cemetery. Public reactions Public reactions to Warmbier's death were strong. U.S. senators John McCain and Marco Rubio called it \\"murder\\". Nikki Haley, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said \\"Countless innocent men and women have died at the hands of the North Korean criminals, but the singular case of Otto Warmbier touches the American heart like no other.\\" South Korean president Moon Jae-in conveyed his condolences to Warmbier's family, and said \\"We cannot know for sure that North Korea killed Mr. Warmbier. But I believe it is quite clear that they have a heavy responsibility in the process that led to Mr. Warmbier's death.\\" Michael Kirby, chairman of the United Nations commission of inquiry on human rights in North Korea, wrote: \\"A young American's fate becomes a metaphor, a kind of symbol, of a big story about thousands of nameless statistics locked up and oppressed in North Korea. They are voiceless. But Otto Warmbier speaks of their suffering from his grave. He reminds the world of the human rights wrongs in North Korea. He joins the voices of the many witnesses who gave testimony to the UN commission.\\" The media reported on a wide range of other reactions. Some criticized the Obama administration for alleged inaction in Warmbier's case, a claim disputed by Obama spokesman Ned Price. Some found fault with Young Pioneer Tours (the travel agency that organized Warmbier's North Korea trip) for its alleged drinking culture and for understating the risks of travel to North Korea. Following Warmbier's death, Young Pioneer announced it would no longer accept American citizens on its tours. It also amended its website to emphasize that North Korea has \\"what amount to extremely strict l√®se-majest√© laws.\\" Some questioned Warmbier's decision to visit North Korea in the first instance. Robert R. King, former U.S. envoy for North Korea human rights issues, remarked that Warmbier had disregarded the U.S. State Department's travel advisory, which \\"strongly warns\\" American citizens not to travel to North Korea. Some commentators suggested that Warmbier had been framed by the North Korean regime for removing the propaganda poster, while others concluded that he was guilty of doing so,  and in some cases criticized Warmbier for violating the law as an American visiting a hostile country.  Aftermath  In July 2017, the U.S. government announced that it would ban American tourists from visiting North Korea as of September 1, 2017, with Warmbier's detention given as one of the reasons. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence at Cheonan memorial with North Korean defectors and Fred Warmbier, February 2018 In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly on September 19, 2017, President Donald Trump mentioned Warmbier while lambasting North Korea as a rogue state. One week later, Trump posted on Twitter that Warmbier was \\"tortured beyond belief\\" by North Korea. His post followed a televised interview given by Warmbier's parents, in which they spoke of their son's death and expressed their wish for North Korea to be relisted as a state sponsor of terrorism. The following day, responding to the parents' interview, the Ohio coroner who had examined Warmbier denied that there were signs of torture, and said: \\"They're grieving parents. I can't really make comments on their perceptions.\\" The coroner said that Warmbier had died due to brain damage following an interruption of blood flow. She said his skin condition was excellent, and his muscle volume was reasonably good given the circumstances. On November 20, 2017, the U.S. Department of State relisted North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism. President Trump mentioned Warmbier's case when making this announcement. In June 2018, Warmbier's parents praised President Trump for his comments about the family and stated that they hoped something positive would come from the first North Korea‚ÄìUnited States summit, which was held that month. In February 2019, at the conclusion of the second North Korea‚ÄìUnited States summit, Trump announced that he had discussed Warmbier's treatment with North Korean leader Kim Jong- un, and said, \\"He [Kim] tells me he didn't know about it, and I will take him at his word.\\" President Trump also argued that it would not have been to Kim's advantage to allow Warmbier to be treated poorly. Following President Trump's comments, Warmbier's parents released a statement, saying: \\"We have been respectful during this summit process. Now we must speak out. Kim and his evil regime are responsible for the death of our son Otto. Kim and his evil regime are responsible for unimaginable cruelty and inhumanity. No excuse or lavish praise can change that.\\" Trump later said his remarks had been \\"misinterpreted\\" and added, \\"Of course I hold North Korea responsible for Otto's mistreatment and death,\\" without mentioning Kim specifically. In April 2019, The Washington Post reported previously undisclosed news that at the time of Warmbier's medical evacuation, North Korean officials had presented the U.S. delegation that repatriated him with a bill for US$2 million for his medical treatment while in Pyongyang. President Trump denied that the U.S. government had paid the bill. =Lawsuit= In April 2018, Warmbier's parents sued the North Korean government in the United States federal district court in Washington, D.C., accusing North Korea of torture and murder. Although private citizens are not usually able to sue foreign nations and their governments, damages may be paid to the victims of nations designated as state sponsors of terrorism, like North Korea, from a special fund established by the United States Congress. North Korea did not contest the case in court, although the director of the Pyongyang hospital where Warmbier had been treated issued a press release reaffirming North Korea's denials that Warmbier had been tortured by the regime. Although the coroner's post-mortem examination had found that Warmbier's teeth were \\"natural and in good repair\\", two of Warmbier's private dentists testified that his post-mortem dental x-rays indicated that some of his lower teeth were bent backward when compared to his earlier dental records, consistent with \\"some sort of impact.\\" A scar on Warmbier's foot, previously described by the coroner as \\"inexplicable\\", was held up by some expert witnesses as evidence that Warmbier may have been subjected to torture (such as electric shock) by his North Korean jailers. On December 24, 2018 Chief Judge Beryl A. Howell handed down a default judgment ordering North Korea to pay $501 million in damages. A copy of the judgment couriered by the court to North Korea's foreign ministry in Pyongyang was sent back to the court. VOA News remarked that \\"it is unlikely North Korea will pay the judgment since there is no mechanism to force it to do so\\", but that the Warmbier family \\"may nonetheless be able to recoup damages through a Justice Department-administered fund for victims of state-sponsored acts of terrorism, and may look to seize other assets held by the country outside of North Korea.\\" In July 2019, the Warmbier family filed a claim on a North Korean cargo ship, Wise Honest, that had been judicially seized in Indonesia by the U.S. government in May 2019 for allegedly transporting and selling North Korean coal in violation of international sanctions. U.S. federal judges ordered that the vessel be sold to compensate the Warmbiers, and also the family of Kim Dong-shik, a Korean-American missionary believed to have died in North Korea after being abducted from China in January 2000.

It featured after-hours jam sessions that went until dawn in the 1940s‚Äì1950s. The name originated from the specialty of the house which was fried chicken and shoestring potatoes served in a rattan basket with mixers and ice. There was no alcohol served at the venue, but it was BYOB or patrons were encouraged to go to a local vendor on the corner to buy half-pints of whisky. Jack's Basket Room also hosted Sunday afternoon matinees and had an annual Christmas dinner for underprivileged children of all races. The dinner was started by owner Jack Johnson and manager Bill Hefflin. They served up to 1,000 turkey dinners with all the trimmings and ice cream for desert. Located in Historic South Central Los Angeles (at 3219 S. Central Ave.), Jack's Basket Room was in the heart of the Jazz Corridor, which was the center of jazz in Los Angeles between the 1920s and 1950s. Among the venues on Central Avenue, Club Alabam was one of the best known.  History  The years of operation for Jack's Basket Room are unclear. According to City of Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety, building owner Sam Jack Jackson applied for the permit in 1944 and sold the building in 1951. The Negro Motorist Green Book listed the venue from 1947 to 1955. \\"The location was such an ideal spot for impromptu jams that Jack's became the center of the Central Avenue modern jazz scene ... modern music being played on the stand, and the layout of the room gave the proceedings a concert hall aura. In fact, the restaurant must have served at one time as a cabaret or meeting hall, because a large stage, on which sat an old but serviceable upright piano, dominated one end of the room.\\" A typical Friday night in 1947 was \\"Sportsman's Night\\" featuring the L.A. Sportsman Scholarship Benefit Club to honor UCLA's basketball and football stars. There were also late Monday night jam sessions with musicians Howard McGhee, Dick Sanford, Sammy Franklin and his Atomics. Joe Lutcher's band and female impersonators entertained crowds with two floor shows between 12:30am and 3:15am. People even stayed for the breakfast dance at 6am. There were no musicians on the payroll, Wild Bill Moore, who was in charge on hiring the musicians, would keep a rhythm section there. Musicians would show up and start impromptu jams there all night. Bill Sampson broadcast sessions from there every Monday night from KAGH. Many great musicians played there, Charlie \\"Bird\\" Parker was one of the regulars. There was a historical event In February 1947, when he got out of Camarillo State Hospital and appeared at Jack's Basket Room. Trumpeter, composer and bandleader Gerald Wilson remembered : \\"The place was packed. Couldn't even sit down. Bird came to the bandstand, and a roar went up from the crowd like the one for Clinton at the inauguration. It could be heard all up and down Central Avenue.\\" Buddy Collette also recalled the same story in his autobiography ‚Äì Jazz Generations: Many businesses have been through the building after the Basket Room. Currently the building that contained Jack's Basket Room stands empty and abandoned. If you look carefully enough you can still see the faded writing on the building with the motto \\"Chicken aint't nuten but a bird\\" and the original name \\"Jack's Basket Room\\". There is also a small plaque outside the building stating its historical importance.

The film features archival footage of Aldous Huxley, Timothy Leary, Mike Wallace, and Igor Stravinsky, and photographs from Laura and Aldous Huxley‚Äôs personal collection, as well as other historical archives. History Italian-born Laura Huxley, a teenage violin virtuoso, played for European royalty and made her American debut at Carnegie Hall before leaving the concert stage to become a renowned psychotherapist and author. In 1956, Laura married Aldous Huxley, a famous writer and prophet of the 20th century. His 1933 novel Brave New World had established him as an English literary giant. Laura was his muse but also tripped right alongside him. Together they exploring the likes of LSD and mescaline. These sessions helped spark the psychedelic movement of the 1960s. The Huxley home in the Hollywood Hills was a center of the west coast avant garde. Regulars at their Saturday luncheons included celebrities such as Orson Welles, Igor Stravinsky, George Cukor and Christopher Isherwood. Laura guided Aldous through the psychedelic sessions that inspired his final novel, Island. Aldous, in turn, encouraged Laura to become a psychotherapist and write her first book, You Are Not the Target, which became a national bestseller. In 1960, the Huxleys began experimenting with Dick Alpert (now Ram Dass) and Timothy Leary, from whom Aldous later split over his free wheeling approach to psychedelics. The following year, Aldous‚Äôs lectures at UC Berkeley on the Human Potential Movement became the inspiration for the founding of the Esalen Institute, a gathering place for developers of revolutionary ideas, transformative practices and innovative art forms.

He had been playing at his foster grandmother's house with his sister, and was wearing a Spider-Man suit at the time of his disappearance. Tyrrell is believed to have been abducted. Despite extensive investigations, as of 2020, Tyrrell has not been found, or his abductor(s) identified. On 12 September 2016, a reward of was offered for the recovery of Tyrrell and does not require the arrest, charging or conviction of any person or persons. Disappearance On 11 September 2014, three-year-old William Tyrrell, his foster parents, and his five-year-old sister travelled four hours from Sydney to visit his foster mother's mother in Kendall. His foster grandmother's house on Benaroon Drive is directly across the bushland road from the Kendall State Forest, about south of Port Macquarie. Between 10:00 and 10:25 am on 12 September, Tyrrell and his sister were playing hide-and-seek in the front and back yard, while his foster mother and foster grandmother were sitting outside watching them. His foster mother went inside to make a cup of tea; she became worried after she had not heard him for five minutes and began searching the yard and house. Shortly after, Tyrrell's foster father returned after going to Lakewood on business and began searching the street and door-knocking neighbours. At 10:56, his foster mother phoned 000 emergency services to report him missing and the police arrived at 11:06. His foster mother's last memory was that Tyrrell was imitating a tiger's roar (\\"raaaarrrr\\") while running towards the side of the home, and then there was silence and he had disappeared. His mum looked for him but to no success. Investigation= Initial search efforts = Hundreds of police, members of State Emergency Services, Rural Fire Service and members of the community searched day and night for Tyrrell. Specialist police, including the sex crimes squad from Strike Force were immediately formed. Motorcycles and helicopters were brought in to search. Two hundred volunteers searched overnight, hundreds of people combed rugged terrain around the home and police divers searched waterways and dams. The police searched every house in the estate that surrounds Benaroon Drive several times. The police detection dogs were brought in and they managed to detect Tyrrell's scent, but only within the boundaries of the backyard. \\"Strike Force Rosann\\" was established with specially trained investigators from the State Crime Command who are experienced in the unexplained disappearance of young children. They supported the police, other emergency services workers and members of the public involved in the search. After five days, police said they were unable to come up with any leads. = Sighted vehicles = An artist's impression of two cars seen near the Tyrrell home on the morning Tyrrell disappeared The police later began investigations into finding the drivers of two cars that were seen parked on the dead end road on the morning Tyrrell disappeared. The cars, described as a white station wagon and an older-style grey sedan, were parked between two driveways of the acre lot of land. They were seen with their driver's side windows down and were unknown in the neighbourhood where locals are friends. These cars were noticed by Tyrrell's mother and they have not been seen again since the time he disappeared. The police regard these particular vehicles with suspicion, as there seemed to be no logical reason why they would be parked on the street before William's disappearance. Reportedly, at 9:00 am, a green or grey sedan car drove past the Tyrrell home while Tyrrell and his sister were riding bikes in the driveway. The car drove into the no through road, did a U turn in the neighbour's driveway and drove out of the street. Secondly, another 4WD was sighted driving out of Benaroon Drive at about 10:30 am, about the time he disappeared. The same vehicle was later seen speeding down another Kendall street. The police said that they have known about these cars since the investigation started. However, as part of investigative strategy, the information about these vehicles was not released to the public until 12 months after Tyrrell disappeared. = Suspected paedophile ring = The police cleared Tyrrell's family of any involvement in the disappearance and earlier believed the boy was abducted by an opportunistic stranger who may have a connection with a paedophile ring. The police also believed that the boy could be alive in the hands of a group of people suspected of paedophile activity, but it is no longer believed the kidnapper is a member of a paedophile ring. The police have interviewed dozens of people including a number of paedophiles. A Current Affair reported that about 20 registered sex offenders were living in the surrounding area of Kendall where Tyrrell went missing. Two persons of interest in the case, both convicted child sex offenders, may have met up on the day Tyrrell vanished. The family of one paedophile, who had 90 convictions against his name including aggravated indecent assault of a minor, said he was going to visit another child sex offender on that day and returned home drunk that afternoon. But he told police he spent that day in the bush collecting scrap metal. It was reported that both men lived in the Kendall area and had been driving vehicles that matched the description of the grey sedan and white station wagon that had been seen near the Tyrrell house around the time he disappeared. They also had been members of an organisation called GAPA (Grandparents As Parents Again) and were friends. The pair have both been questioned by the police and they categorically denied being friends, or having any involvement in the disappearance. Another man who repaired a washing machine at Tyrrell's foster home is facing unrelated historical child sex charges in Victoria and was due to appear in court on 4 July 2016. The police had charged the man with multiple child sexual offences, including various counts of indecent assault and sexual intercourse with children between 1983 and 1985 in Victoria. The man posted an online video in September 2015 denying any involvement in the Tyrrell disappearance and that he had been to the Tyrrell home on 9 and 18 September but not to that street on 12 September, the day Tyrrell disappeared. = Reported sightings = More than 1,000 suspected sightings were reported to the investigation team in the two years after Tyrrell disappeared. It includes a photo taken of a man, and a young boy from Queensland, who looked strikingly similar to Tyrrell. However, 24 hours later, the police received another call to confirm that the boy was not him. In early 2015, two passengers and a member of the New Zealand-bound flight crew thought they saw Tyrrell on their aeroplane. The police met the aircraft at the airport and soon discovered it was not him. Another photo came across to the police showing a young boy and a woman in a McDonald's restaurant in Central Queensland. The boy looked similar to Tyrrell, and the woman who was with the boy looked like his grandmother. The police later confirmed that the mother and boy were not them. = Later developments = Strike Force Rosann  On 16 September 2014, Strike Force Rosann was established to investigate Tyrrell's disappearance. It consists of 14 detectives and analysts working full-time to solve the case. The team will also sift through hundreds of pieces of information pouring in from the public. The ramped-up investigation comes after a personal plea from Tyrrell's parents to members of State Parliament, Deputy Premier and Minister for Justice, at a private event in late 2015. The family spokesperson said that \\"They just want to reinforce that police believe he could still be alive and they're just asking members of the public not to give up on him.\\" The investigation is now the state's largest, involving dozens of analysts, investigators and two strike forces, Rosann, run by the Homicide Squad, and Rosann Two, which provides assistance from the Armed Holdup, Sex Crimes and Fraud Squads.  One million dollar reward  On 12 September 2016, the second anniversary of Tyrrell's disappearance, the NSW government announced a $1 million reward for information on his whereabouts. The police say that the reward will usually be paid out as conditional on the arrest and conviction of the offender, but the recovery of Tyrrell had been added as a condition on this reward. It is the largest ever reward offered to find a missing person in NSW's history and double the amount of the state's previously highest standing reward of $500,000, attached to the 1999 case of murdered teenager Michelle Bright.  Case data  The case has led to a record number of over 2,800 calls to NSW Crime Stoppers alone since Tyrrell disappeared. The police have interviewed more than 1,000 people in connection with the case. There have been 11,000 documents created by the police. The search has gone global as far as Europe and the US. Crime Stoppers websites in up to 26 countries have been asked by the Australian Federal Police to post an appeal for information about the case. The police have identified 690 persons of interest to their inquiry and have called in other specialist squads within the State Crime Command to investigate many such persons as low-priority targets so that the rest are being questioned by \\"Strike Force Rosann\\". The Australian reported that it is possible detectives have already interviewed the person or persons involved.  2018 search  On 12 June 2018, police announced that they will undertake a \\"large-scale forensic search\\" in bushland around Kendall, which will last for three to four weeks and be run by search experts from the Public Order and Riot Squad. Parents, legal matters and criticism Tyrrell was in foster care at the time of his disappearance which prevented his biological parents from being named for legal reasons. The legal reasons bound by the legislation prevented them being identified publicly or holding any press conferences for the purpose of appealing publicly about their missing son. On 24 August 2017, the New South Wales Supreme Court of Appeal ruled that Tyrrell's status as a foster child and the fact he disappeared while in state care with foster parents was \\"one of legitimate public interest\\". His parents were previously allowed to speak during a 60 Minutes interview on the condition that they did not show their faces. The father of murdered teenager Daniel Morcombe had criticised the NSW government's refusal to allow Tyrrell's parents to speak publicly about their son's disappearance as it was vital in helping to generate information that was then followed up by the police. They also feared the decision may have hindered the police investigation during the crucial weeks following Tyrrell's disappearance. But the NSW government released a statement saying its \\"key priority is to always act in the interests of the safety and wellbeing of children and not in any way to jeopardise ongoing police investigations\\". Current status Despite various search efforts by the police and the forensic testing which failed to turn up any trace of Tyrrell or clues about his disappearance, police have yet to conclude what actually happened to him.

Protagonists=Rei= is a human Reionics, ZAP Spacy's latest member and the main protagonist of Ultra Galaxy Mega Monster Battle and its succeeding series, Ultra Galaxy Mega Monster Battle: Never Ending Odyssey. He was once a baby that appeared during Bullton's attack on Planet Boris. During the series, he first appeared after being trapped inside the carcass of a Peguila and in amnesiac state, appearing to be hostile towards ZAP Spacy members despite saving their ship, Space Pendragon, twice while only cares about recovering his forgotten background. In the end, after being persuaded by Hyuga, Rei decided to join ZAP Spacy. During his membership within the ZAP Spacy crew, he was haunted by the image of the giant buried in the rock and challenged by a mysterious woman named Kate. At the end of the series, after defeating Kate, he discovered the woman as his older sister and the buried giant is Ultraman, whom asked his help to free him. Rei as well had awakened his true potential as a Reionics, becoming a figure known as . During the second season, Rei participated into the Reionics Battle to determine the successor of Alien Raybrad to conquer the galaxy. Among them was Grande, an Alien Keel whom claimed to be his rival. Unlike the others, Rei on the other hand competed in the battle only to face Alien Raybrad, not wanting to inherit the latter's role as the ruler of the galaxy. In the middle of the series, he also encounter another giant, Ultraseven, which he rescued from Armored Darkness. After facing Alien Raybrad, he was finally brought to Earth for the first time. Sometime later in the movie, having recently finished Zaragas, Rei was spirited by Mebius, as he was predicted to be the chosen one capable of defeating Ultraman Belial. However, during the remaining Ultras' battle against Belial's army, he was corrupted by Belial into joining his legion until ZAP Spacy members awakened him from his senses. Followed by the arrival of Zero and the Leo Brothers, Rei was able to hijack Belial's Giga Battle Nizer to ease the Ultra's battle, allowing Zero to finish him. As a Reionics, Rei's initial monsters in his Battle Nizer was Gomora, before he adopted Litra and Eleking during the series' progress. With other Reionics, Rei is subjected to the life-link rule with his monsters, thus would lose his life as well when one of them died in said battle, unless either Rei or his monsters sever their connections to save each other's lives. After Eleking's death by Grande's Tyrant, this caused Rei to succumb to his injuries until Kate upgraded his Battle Nizer, allowing him to be on par with Grande's Tyrant. He was temporarily received Miclas by Ultraseven as a gratitude for saving him from the Armored Darkness until his final battle with Alien Raybrad.

When in burst mode, his blue markings change to a crimson colour, black markings cross his body, and his eyes turn bright red. In this state, he becomes so powerful that he often loses his ability to tell his friends and enemies apart, but can be calmed back to his normal form with some effort. Reimon's attacks are the ray and a reviving ray, used to free and revive Ultraman. In the console game Ultra Coliseum, Reimon is capable of summoning a spectral version of himself to fight giant opponents. His finisher in the aforementioned game is , summoning EX Gomora to perform EX Super Oscillatory Wave. Rei's personal monsters are: *: Rei's primary monster, Gomora is specialized in melee combat, such as the use of flying kick and its tail, . Its finisher attack is , originally a technique used by its brethren to burrow underground but can be used as a ranged beam attack. Another variation can also be performed, called where Gomora impales the target with its horn and fires the Oscillatory Wave at point blank before throwing them aside. Gomora can also evolve through Rei's command in certain situations, but although facing against opponents that possess the combat knowledge of Gomora's evolved forms, said monster itself is still able to defeat them with some effort, either through both his and Rei's continuous combat experience or external forces. **: Through Rei's command, Gomora can transform into EX Gomora, an evolved variation of itself.

Eleking in the end was killed by Grande's Tyrant, but although the rules of Reionics Battle stated that Rei were supposed to die as well, Eleking managed to sever their connection, saving Rei at the expense of its own life. This act allows Rei to progress further into the Reionics Battle and avenge Eleking's death by having Gomora killing Tyrant. *Capsule Monster Miclas: See here.

It is one of the oldest mosques in India, and the oldest surviving monument in Ajmer. Designed by Abu Bakr of Herat and constructed by Qutb-ud-Din-Aibak in 1192 CE, the mosque is an example of early Indo-Islamic architecture. The structure was completed in 1199 CE and was further beautified by Iltutmish of Delhi in 1213 CE. An early example of the Indo-Islamic architecture, most of the building was constructed by Hindu masons, under the supervision of Afghan managers. Some of the materials used for the original construction may have come from destroyed Hindu and Jain temples. The mosque retained most of the original Hindu and Jain features, especially on the ornate pillars, with only the effigies of Hindu Gods and Goddesses removed neatly. The structure was used as a mosque up to 1947. After the independence of India, the structure was turned over to the Jaipur circle of ASI (Archaeological survey of India) and is today visited by people of all religions, as a fine example of a mix of Indian, Hindu, Muslim and Jain architectures.  Etymology  \\"Adhai Din Ka Jhonpra\\" literally means \\"shed of two-and-a-half days\\". Alternative transliterations and names include Arhai Din ka Jhompra or Dhai Din ki Masjid. A legend states that a part of the mosque was built in two-and-a-half days (see #Conversion into a mosque below). Some Sufis claim that the name signifies a human's temporary life on the earth. According to the ASI, the name probably comes from a two-and-a-half- day-long fair that used to be held at the site. Indian academic Har Bilas Sarda points out that the name \\"Adhai-Din-ka-Jhonpra\\" is not mentioned in any historical source. Before the 18th century, the mosque was simply known as a \\"Masjid\\" (\\"mosque\\"), since it had been the only mosque in Ajmer for centuries. It came to be known as a jhonpra (\\"shed\\" or \\"hut\\") when fakirs started gathering here to celebrate urs (death anniversary fair) of their leader Panjaba Shah. This happened during the Maratha era, in the second half of the 18th century. The urs lasted for two-and-a-half days, resulting in the modern name of the mosque. Alexander Cunningham described the building as the \\"Great Mosque of Ajmer\\".  History = Pre-Islamic structure = Hindu-style pillar The site of the mosque was originally a Sanskrit college building commissioned by Vigraharaja IV (alias Visaladeva), a king of the Shakambhari Chahamana (Chauhan) dynasty. The original building was square-shaped, with a tower-chhatri (dome-shaped pavilion) at each corner. A temple dedicated to Sarasvati was located on the western side. A tablet dated to 1153 CE was found at the site in the 19th century; based on this, it can be inferred that the original building must have been constructed sometime before 1153 CE. According to the local Jain tradition, the building was originally constructed by Seth Viramdeva Kala in 660 CE as a Jain shrine to celebrate Panch Kalyanaka. The relics in the modern building show both Hindu and Jain features. According to KDL Khan, the building materials were taken from Hindu and Jain temples. According to Caterina Mercone Maxwell and Marijke Rijsberman, the Sanskrit college was a Jain institution, and the building materials were taken from Hindu temples. ASI Director-General Alexander Cunningham hypothesized that the pillars used in the building were probably taken from 20‚Äì30 demolished Hindu temples, which featured at least 700 pillars in total. Based on the pillar inscriptions, he concluded that these original temples dated to 11th or 12th century CE. = Conversion into a mosque = The original building was partially destroyed and converted into a mosque by Qutb- ud-Din-Aibak of Delhi in the late 12th century. According to a local legend, after defeating Vigraharaja's nephew Prithviraja III in the Second Battle of Tarain, Muhammad Ghori passed through Ajmer. There, he saw the magnificent temples, and ordered his slave general Qutb-ud-Din-Aibak to destroy them, and construct a mosque ‚Äì all within 60 hours (that is, days). The artisans could not build a complete mosque in 60 hours time, but constructed a brick screen wall where Ghori could offer prayers. By the end of the century, a complete mosque was built. The central mihrab in the mosque contains an inscription indicating the completion date of the mosque. It is dated Jumada II 595 AH (April 1199 CE). This makes the mosque one of the oldest in India, and the second mosque to be built by the Mamluks of Delhi (the first being the Quwwat- ul-Islam mosque). Another inscription, dated Dhu al-Hijjah 596 AH (September‚ÄìOctober 1200 CE), names Abu Bakr ibn Ahmed Khalu Al-Hirawi as the supervisor of construction. This makes Adhai Din Ka Jhonpra one of the oldest mosques in India, and the oldest surviving monument in Ajmer. Iltutmish, the successor of Qutb-ud-Din-Aibak, subsequently beautified the mosque in 1213 CE, with a screen wall pierced by corbelled engrailed arches ‚Äî a first in India. An inscription on the central arch of the screen as well as two inscriptions of the northern minaret contain his name. The second arch from the south names one Ahmed ibn Muhammad al-Arid as the construction supervisor. = Archaeological survey and restoration = The mosque seems to have been ignored by the later kings. It does not find a mention in Taj-ul-Maasir, the earliest history of the Mamluk dynasty. It is not mentioned in Khalji, Lodi, Rathore, Sisodia and Mughal chronicles either. The Maratha leader Daulat Rao Sindhia (1779‚Äì1827) restored the central dome of the building, and imposed a ban of removal of stones from the structure. An inscription dated Saavan 1866 VS (1809 CE) exhorts Hindus and Muslims not to remove stones from the ancient building. In 1818, Ajmer came under the Company rule. James Tod visited the mosque in 1819, and described it in his Annals and Antiquities of Rajast ºhan as \\"one of the most perfect as well as the most ancient monuments of Hindu architecture.\\" Subsequently, Alexander Cunningham, the Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) inspected the building in 1864, and described it in the ASI report of that year. Tod believed the earlier structure to be a Jain temple. However, Cunningham pointed out that this could not be correct, since the pillars in the building feature several four-armed figures (characteristic of Hindu gods) besides a figure of the Hindu goddess Kali. During an 1875‚Äì76 archaeological survey, inscriptions referring to a Sanskrit college were unearthed in the mosque premises. Several sculptures and 6 Devanagari basalt tablets (slabs) were recovered from the site. These artifacts are now exhibited at the Ajmer Museum. The tablets are as follows: * Tablets 1 and 2 contain large fragments of a Sanskrit play Lalita-Vigraharaja Nataka. It was composed by Mahakavi Somadeva, in honour of the king Vigraharaja. The play, as restored by Lorenz Franz Kielhorn from the fragments, depicts the story of king Vigraharaja. It tells of his love with princess Desaldevi, and his war preparations against a Turushka (Turkic) king named Hammir. * Tablet 3 and 4 contain fragments of Harakeli Nataka, a play attributed to Vigraharaja himself. The play is written in honour of the god Hara (Shiva). It is inspired by Bharavi's Sanskrit play Kiratarjuniya. The play is dated to 22 November 1153 in an inscription. * Tablet 5 contains portions of an untitled Sanskrit poem, which praises several devas (deities). The last deity mentioned in the poem is Surya (the sun god). The poem states that the Chahamana (Chauhan) dynasty descends from Surya (see Suryavanshi). * Tablet 6 contains the fragments of a prashasti (praise) of the Chahamana kings of Ajmer. The inscription states that the king Ajaideva moved his residence to Ajmer, and defeated the king Naravarma of Malwa. After handing over the throne to his son, he took up Vanaprastha (retirement) in the forest of Pushkar. His son adorned Ajmer with the blood of the Turushkas (Turkic people), and captured the elephants of the kings of Malwa. The inscription also mentions the name \\"Kumar Pal\\", but nothing can be made out of this name because of missing portions. The tablets containing the plays were engraved by Bhaskar, son of Mahipati and grandson of Govinda, hailing from a family of Huna chiefs. Another Devanagari inscription is located on a marble pillar in the balcony of an entrance gate. It records the visit of Dharma, a mason of Bundi in the Jyeshtha 1462 VS (1405 CE), during the reign of Rana Mokal. During the tenure of Viceroy Lord Mayo, between 1875 and 1878 CE, repairs to the structure were carried out at a cost of 23,128. Another restoration, costing 7,538 was carried out in 1900‚Äì1903, under the supervision of Ajmer-Merwara commissioner ALP Tucker. ASI archaeologists Alexander Cunningham and D. R. Bhandarkar carried out a restoration of the building in the first half of the 20th century. Cunningham remarked that no other building of historical or archaeological importance in India was more worthy of preservation.  Architecture  Plan of the building The mosque is among the earliest examples of the Indo-Islamic architecture. It was designed by Abu Bakr of Herat, an architect who accompanied Muhammad Ghori. The mosque was built almost entirely by Hindu masons, under the supervision of Afghan managers. The mosque is much larger than the Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque of Delhi. The exterior of the building is square-shaped, with each side measuring 259 feet. There are two entrances, one at the south, and another at the east. The prayer area (the actual mosque) is located in the west, while the north side faces a hill rock. The actual mosque building on the western side has 10 domes and 124 pillars; there are 92 pillars on the eastern side; and 64 pillars on each of the remaining sides. Thus, there are 344 pillars in the entire building. Out of these, only 70 pillars remain standing now. It has a square dimension measuring . The tall and slender pillars are not overcrowded and the ones in the courtyard are symmetrically placed. The sanctuary measures by . The mihrab is built with white marbles. It is believed that Iltumish added the seven arch screen by 1230, is considered to be an architecturally most notable feature of the mosque. The large central arch is accompanied by two small fluted minarets.

The main arch is nearly 60 feet high, and is flanked by six smaller arches. The arches have small rectangular panels for passage of daylight, similar to the ones found in early Arabian mosques. The archway features Kufic and Tughra inscriptions and quotations from Koran, and is reminiscent of Islamic architecture from Ghazni and Turkistan. Some of the carvings feature Arabesque floral and foliate patterns; their geometric symmetry is reminiscent of Persian tilework. Their filigree sets them apart from Hindu-style carvings in the same building. The Hindu patterns are similar to the ones seen in the 10th century structures at Nagda and the 11th century Sas-Bahu Temple at Gwalior. The 19th century American traveler John Fletcher Hurst described the screen as \\"a gem of great renown throughout the Mohammedan world.\\" File:Adhai-din-ka- Jhopra 07.jpg  Ornate carvings and Kufic inscriptions File:Adhai-din-ka- Jhopra 08.jpg  Floral motif File:Adhai-din-ka-Jhopra 05.jpg  Arches with inscriptions from Koran File:Adhai Din-ka-Jhonpra Screen wall decorative work (6134515460).jpg  Decorative screen wall File:Adhai Din-ka-Jhonpra Screen wall decorative work (6133943561).jpg  Inscriptions on the screen wall The interior of the building is a quadrangle measuring 200 √ó 175 feet. It comprises a main hall (248 √ó 40 feet) supported by cloisters of pillars. The pillars feature varying designs, and heavily decorated, similar to the ones in Hindu and Jain rock temples. They have large bases, and taper as they rise in height. According to K.D.L. Khan, the pillars and roofs are from the pre- Islamic structure, but the original carvings were destroyed by Muslims. Michael W. Meister believes that some of the pillars were newly created by Hindu masons for their Muslim masters; these were combined with the older, plundered pillars (whose images were defaced). Similarly, he states that the ceilings combine newer and older work by Hindu workers. The muazzin's towers are located in two small minarets (10.5 in diameter). These minarets are located at the top of an 11.5 feet thick screen wall. The minarets are now ruined, but their remnants show that they were sloping hollow towers with 24 alternately angular and circular flutes, just like the ones in the Qutb Minar of Delhi. Alexander Cunningham praised the architecture of Adhai Din Ka Jhonpra and Quwwat-ul-Islam mosques in the following words: Scottish architectural historian James Fergusson similarly remarked: File:Adhai Din-ka- Jhonpra Window detail (6134516480).jpgWindow File:Adhai Din-ka-Jhonpra Niche detail (6134503056).jpgNiche File:Adhai Din-ka-Jhonpra Dome decorative work (6134499928).jpgDome interior File:Adhai Din-ka-Jhonpra Corner minaret (6134483396).jpgMinaret File:Adhai Din-ka-Jhonpra Bracket detail (6133956361).jpgBracket File:Arcade pillars of Adhai Din Ka Jhonpra.jpgArcade Pillars Today, the site is visited by people of all religions, as a fine example of a mix of Indian, Hindu, Muslim and Jain architectures.

They are tasked with conducting with underwater Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) as well as EOD operations on land. The training is very physically and mentally challenging which is why meticulous tests are done before selection. History In 1953, then lieutenants Rolf Hamilton and G√∂sta Fahlman underwent a special course of light diving for commando at the United States Navy Underwater Demolition Team (UDT), the precursor to the United States Navy SEALs, in San Diego, USA. After completing the education in the United States, captain Rolf Hamilton became head of the first explosive ordnance disposal course Gullmars Base in Skredsvik, Uddevalla Municipality in 1954. From 1956 and a number of years ahead, combat divers were also trained in Skredsvik. Later the training was concentrated to include only clearance divers. Selection The selection can be divided into two steps: 1\\\\. Selection test at the Recruitment Authority. The test includes, among other things, theoretical tests aimed at measuring general talent/intelligence, medical examinations such as vision and hearing examinations, physical exams with the purpose of examining the oxygen uptake ability (fitness), strength tests and psychological interviews. Those who meet the basic requirements for r√∂jdykare can apply for the second step of selection. 2\\\\. Complementary tests (KP). Those who fulfill the basic requirements of the selection test are called for a complementary testing. The tests are conducted during four days in Karlskrona. During the KP, physical tests such as running tests are carried out, including three km, strength tests in the form of chins, dips, situps, deadlifts, pushups, back extensions and various water exercises (underwater physical training) such as diving, somersaults, underwater swimming, treading water etc. These water exercises are performed at a high intensity over a long period of time. Thorough medical examinations are also conducted to make sure that the prospective divers can cope with the service as a diver. In addition to this, there are interviews with officers from the r√∂jdykar-division. KP R√∂jdyk is very physically challenging and places high demands on both physical performance and motivation. Only 20% of those who come to the KP remain on day 4. The main reasons why a certain proportion of the test takers fail the tests are lack of motivation and poor preparation. Activities Personnel from the unit continuously participate in domestic EOD operations as well as providing support to Swedish and allied forces during operations abroad. Personnel from the Navy EOD Division have participated in Operation Atalanta, integrating with the Swedish Marine Boarding team. They have also done several deployments in Afghanistan as well as in Mali, embedding with line units to provide counter-IED support.

Background Founded in 1983, the Purcell Quartet had their debut concert six months after forming, on 14 February 1984, at St John's, Smith Square, London. Tess Knighton, of The Times, wrote of the world class ensemble: \\"The 'minimalist' approach as adopted by the Purcell Quartet draws the listener into the textual and musical rhetoric in an intimate and immediate way, and with singers and players as excellent as these the experience is utterly convincing.\\" BBC Music Magazine said that the ensemble's \\"playing is infectiously uninhibited and technically immaculate. . . of unqualified pleasure.\\" The Purcell Quartet has toured extensively in the United States, Chile, Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, Turkey, as well as throughout Europe. In October 2001, they toured in Japan with a fully staged production of Monteverdi's opera, L'Orfeo. The cast of over forty starred the British tenor Mark Padmore. In 2004, the group celebrated their twentieth anniversary with a highly acclaimed concert in their hometown at Wigmore Hall. The group is a champion of Purcell's music, as the name suggests, having recorded his works extensively. Additionally, they have performed music by Vivaldi, Corelli, Handel, Heinrich Ignaz Franz Biber, and others. Most recently, the group has focused on works of Johann Sebastian Bach and Dieterich Buxtehude. The Purcell Quartet should not be confused with the Canadian Purcell String Quartet, which was active from 1968 till 1991.

Education Moody received his B.A. from Colby College and his M.A. (1966) and Ph.D. (1970) from the University of Connecticut, all in economics. Research Moody has done research on the relationship between gun laws and crime. He has also published studies pertaining to other subjects in the field of criminology, such as the effectiveness of increasing the prison population on crime rates. In a 1995 study in the journal Criminology, Moody and his colleague Thomas Marvell reported that they found little evidence that sentence enhancements for gun crimes were effective at reducing crime rates or gun use. Marvell and Moody have also conducted studies on the effect of three- strikes laws, which, according to their research, are associated with higher homicide rates. Their results were originally published in 2001 and replicated the following year. In a 2002 study, Moody, along with Grant Duwe and Tomislav Kovandzic, found very little, if any, evidence that right-to-carry laws affected the number of mass shootings. In 2008, he co-authored a study, along with Dave Kopel, that found that countries with higher gun ownership rates tend to have higher levels of political and civil freedom. Views Moody has said, that right-to-carry laws lead to lower crime rates. The National Research Council in 2004 were undecided on the topic. His research on the subject suggests that such laws deter crime but only slightly. He has said that his research suggests that states with higher prison populations have lower crime rates.

The episode received a rating of 83% on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, with the site's consensus stating: \\"The appearance of a familiar Batman villain and a bullying scene at Bruce's school make 'The Mask' an important episode, though it returns to Gothams procedural format.\\" Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"good\\" 7.8 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict, \\"The 'case of the week' and Barbara's decision to unravel into a mess and leave Jim again (!) - which felt like the show was purposefully giving up on her and forcing her out more than anything - gave us plenty to roll our eyes at this week. But the fact that Gordon's relationship with his co-workers had become a critical topic was excellent. As was, believe it or not, Bruce's bully story. Kid Wayne still hasn't quite found his place on the series, but this was a spectacular moment between him and Alfred. With Alfred finally figuring out how, with his limited parenting skills, he could best help young Master Wayne.\\" The A.V. Club's Oliver Sava gave the episode a \\"C+\\" grade and wrote, \\"Very little comes of the procedural this week. It may not be as ludicrous as the Balloonman, but there's little to no stakes here. Sure, Gotham tries its damnedest to get us to care about Gordon's ongoing battle to 'stand up for the city,' giving Bullock a speech (though he wouldn't call it a speech) that rouses the police force to spread out across the city and find Gordon, who's gone missing while investigating the fight club. When Sarah Essen shows up at the episode's end and helps save Gordon, it doesn't feel like a triumph of the system, or a sudden turn for the GCPD towards actual policing. Instead, it's a tidy end to an episode that's supposed to make us cheer for Gordon, but only continues to outline how sloppy and inconsequential these procedural storylines can be.

The number of wells on each plate vary from 12 to 24 wells allowing multiple reactions to be performed at a time. Plates can vary in their sizes, color and diameter and cavity depth. They are commonly white in color, allowing easy observation of reaction changes and color changes. Porcelain spot plates are considered to be reusable, stronger, highly resistant to the actions of concentrated chemicals and also autoclavable.

He was latterly responsible for developing the Army's personnel policies and supporting its people.Army conducts Top Level Organisational Review Defence News, 9 December 2009 The Adjutant-General usually held the rank of general or lieutenant general. Despite his administrative role, the Adjutant-General, like most officers above the rank of major general, was invariably drawn from one of the combat arms, not from the support corps. History In origin the Adjutant-General was chief staff officer to the Commander-in-Chief of the Forces. The post of Adjutant-General is first recorded in 1673 and it was established on a permanent basis in the English Army from 1680. For a time there were two Adjutants-General, one 'for the Foot' and one 'for the Horse' until the two were consolidated into a single appointment 'of the Forces' in 1701. Until the passing of the respective Acts of Union there were Scottish and Irish Adjutants-General; on occasions a separate Adjutant-General would be appointed for deployments overseas; and the Board of Ordnance had an independent Adjutant-General and Deputy for the Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers (respectively) until they were integrated into the British Army in the 1850s. In the 18th century the Adjutant-General was tasked with issuing orders to the Army, receiving monthly returns from the Regiments, regulation of officers' appointments and leave of absence, and oversight of military reviews, exercises, manoeuvres and matters of discipline. By the early 1800s the Adjutant-General had responsibility for 'all subjects connected with the Discipline, Equipment and Efficiency of the Army'; he also took on general responsibility for recruitment at this time. A century later he is described as 'a general officer and at the head of his department of the War Office, which is charged with all duties relative to personnel'. In the 20th century the Adjutant-General was the Second Military Member of the Army Council and its successor the Army Board.The Army in 1906: A Policy and a Vindication By Hugh Oakeley Arnold-Forster, Page 481 Bibliobazaar, 2008, Headquarters Adjutant-General was latterly based at the former RAF Upavon, now Trenchard Lines, Upavon, Wiltshire. On 1 April 2008 it amalgamated with HQ Land Command to form HQ Land Forces under 'Project Hyperion'.Drumbeat In December 2009 it was announced that the responsibilities of the Commander Regional Forces (i.e. responsibility for support) would be subsumed within those of the Adjutant-General to the Forces who henceforth would take responsibility for both personnel and support. In 2015 the post was re-designated Commander Personnel and Support Command (renamed Commander Home Command the following year). In evidence to the House of Commons Defence Committee the Chief of the General Staff explained: :\\"In my new operating model, I no longer have an Adjutant-General.

Added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, it formerly carried the tracks of the Southern Pacific Transportation Company over the McKenzie River southeast of Coburg. It has since become a pedestrian and bicycle bridge. The Whipple through truss bridge, resting on concrete supports, is long, wide, and high. Built in 1887 for the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company by George S. Morison and installed over the John Day River in north-central Oregon, it was bought by the Southern Pacific in 1907 and moved to the McKenzie River by the American Bridge Company. Made of iron, it replaced a wooden covered bridge constructed at the site in 1891. The earlier bridge, long, was one of the longest such structures ever built. It replaced the function of Spores Ferry, which began operation a short distance upstream in 1847 and was an important crossing for wagon trains. Coburg Road crosses the river on a highway bridge next to the railway bridge, and Interstate 5 crosses on a different highway bridge slightly further upstream. Armitage County Park, about north of Eugene, is along the south side of the river near the bridges.

It is known for having housed and provided studios for dozens of prominent artists in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Entrances to the site, when open, are from Piazzale Flaminio, Avenue Madame Letizia, and across from the Villa Poniatowski, part of the National Etruscan Museum. History The aristocratic Alsatian Alfred Wilhelm Strohl (1847-1927) was exiled from his native land soon after the German occupation in 1870. By 1879, he had purchased a substantial plot of land at the site, and built the main villa, and additional housing and studio facilities, and organized the gardens at the site. Strohl also designed the casino and gave it the name by adding the adjective \\"fern\\" (far away) to Strohl, to emphasize his exile.Comune of Rome, entry on Villa. The park contains odd elements such as cement trees, fountains adorned with stalactites, grottoes, covered bridges between sections of land at different levels, and an artificial pond with a cement boat on its bank.Website describing the Villa's park. The property is best remembered for the diverse artistic community that Strohl gathered there, at small chalets in the park. Among the many artists who stayed at the site were Nicola D‚ÄôAntino; Bruno Barilli; Alfredo Biagini; Amedeo Bocchi; Arnold Bocklin; Anton Giulio Bragaglia; Renato Brozzi; Ercole Drei; Emil Fuchs and his mistress, the painter Barbara Leoni; Vincenzo Gemito; Baldomer Gili i Roig; John William Godward; Virgilio Guidi; Carlo Levi; Arturo Martini; Umberto Moggioli; Ludwig Nick; Cipriano Efisio Oppo; Ilya Repin; the poet Rainer Maria Rilke and his wife in 1903-1904; the sculptor Clara Westhoff; Aleardo Terzi; Francesco and his son Antonello Trombadori; and Mikhail Alexandrovich Vrubel.Art Renewal Website , entry on JW Godward.

After his death in 1927, Strohl was buried in the Protestant Cemetery, near the Pyramid of Cestius; and the property was willed to the French Government with a number of restrictions, including on the maintenance of the structures and purpose. In 1957 transferred it to the Lyc√©e Chateaubriand. The property has been undergoing much needed restorations.
