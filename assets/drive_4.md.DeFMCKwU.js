He is famous for his vibrantly colored paintings of the Southern California desert, especially in the Death Valley and Mojave Desert area, which remarkably express the immensity, colors and solitude of these landscapes. He also dabbled in Orientalist art, while travelling through Europe and North Africa. Early years Born in Hagerstown, Maryland, of Swedish descent, on November 13, 1857, Fernand Lungren was raised in Toledo, Ohio. He showed an early talent for drawing but his father induced him to pursue a professional career and in 1874 entered the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, to study mining engineering. However, after meeting the painter Kenyon Cox (1856-1919), he was determined to follow a career as a visual artist.\\"Fernand Lungren,\\" in The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art, Volume 1, by Joan M. Marter (ed), Oxford University Press, 2011, p. 197 At the age of 19, and following a dispute with his father, Lungren was finally permitted to enrol at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, where he studied under Thomas Eakins (1844-1916) and Robert Frederick Blum (1857‚Äì1903). He also studied briefly in Cincinnati and in 1882, he furthered his studies in Paris at the Acad√©mie Julian, but only remained there for brief period, abandoning formal study for direct observation of Parisian street life.\\"Fernand Lundgren,' [Biographical notes], Lundgren Art Museum, Online: http://lagunaartmuseum.org/fernand-lungren/; Art Institute of Chicago, http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/59908 It was during this period that he painted In The Cafehttps://www.artic.edu/artworks/59908/in-the-cafe Illustrator in New York City Illustration from St. Nicholas, (serial) (1873) In 1877, now twenty years old, and upon completion of his studies, Fernand Lungren moved to New York City. There he rented a studio with the prominent painter and pastellist Robert Frederick Blum. In New York City, he found work as an illustrator for Scribner‚Äôs Monthly (renamed Century in 1881) during the period known as ‚Äòthe Golden Age of American illustration.‚Äô His first illustration appeared in 1879 and he continued to contribute to Scribner‚Äôs Monthly until 1903. He was also an illustrator for the children‚Äôs magazine, Saint Nicholas from 1879 to 1904 and later for Harper‚Äôs, McClure‚Äôs and The Outlook. His illustration work in these periodicals focussed on portraits, landscapes and social scenes, which gave him some notoriety as the illustrator of New York street scenes.\\"Fernand Lundgren,' [Biographical notes], Lundgren Art Museum, Online: http://lagunaartmuseum.org/fernand- lungren/; also Biographical Notes at Sullivan Cross Art Gallery, Online: http://www.sullivangoss.com/fernand_Lungren/ In 1878, he helped found The Tile Club, an association of young artists who gathered for the purpose of painting on decorative tiles. Among the members of the club were William Merritt Chase, J. Carroll Beckwith, John Twachtman, Winslow Homer, J. Alden Weir, and Robert Frederick Blum. Visit to Europe, return to New York, Cincinnati Il caf√®, painting by Fernand Lungren, 1882-84 In 1882, Fernand Lungren traveled to Paris with Robert Frederick Blum. In Paris, Lungren enrolled briefly at the Acad√©mie Julian and saw French Impressionist artists at work. Disappointed with the academic art that he observed, and eager to experience life, Lungren left his Paris studies and traveled to the town of Barbizon, South East of Paris, near Fontainebleau, where a colony of artists had been established just a decade earlier. In the village of Grez-sur-Loing, near Barbizon, he became acquainted with artists who were practicing plein-air (outdoor) painting. Returning to America in 1883, Lungren first settled in New York, then moved shortly thereafter to Cincinnati, Ohio. There, he was encouraged to explore Western subjects by fellow artists Frank Duveneck, Joseph Henry Sharp, and Henry Farny, who were teaching at the Art Academy of Cincinnati. Coincidentally, while teaching an illustration course in Cincinnati, he convinced Ernest Blumenschein to change his studies from music to art, and was therefore instrumental in forming Ernest Blumenschein's career as a renowned artist, noted for his paintings of Native Americans, New Mexico and the American Southwest.Ackerman, G.M., American Orientalists, ACR edition, 1994, p. 22 Discovering Santa Fe: South-Western and Indian themes In 1892, the Santa Fe Railway hired Lungren to sketch scenes along its route. He spent eight months in Santa Fe, New Mexico, visiting the Indian pueblos and the next year spent several months living with the Hopis in Arizona.Grauer, M., Rounded Up in Glory: Frank Reaugh, Texas Renaissance Man, University of North Texas Press, 2016, p. 124 He was eventually made a member of several Indian tribes and priesthoods. In 1895, Lungren created illustrations of the Moquis, Navajo, and Apache for Harper‚Äôs Magazine. His most famous illustration \\"Thirst\\", depicting a dying man and a dead horse, was published in 1896 in Harper‚Äôs Weekly and attracted much attention across the U.S.\\"Fernand Lungren,\\" [Biographical Notes], Terra Foundation, https://collection.terraamericanart.org/view/people/asitem/items$0040null:279/0;Grauer, M., Rounded Up in Glory: Frank Reaugh, Texas Renaissance Man, University of North Texas Press, 2016, p. 124 From this time, he turned his attention to painting and sketching Indian people and their culture. He married Henrietta Whipple in 1898, then spent three years in London, England. During his stay, he exhibited some of his views of the American desert and produced a number of images of London street life. During their three-year stay, Lungren became highly skilled at the use of pastel, a chalk-like colored drawing medium, exhibiting the results with success. Lungren met many prominent artists in London, including James Abbott McNeill Whistler, with whom the couple became good friends.Ackerman, G.M., American Orientalists, ACR edition, 1994, p.122 During this period, he exhibited at the Royal Academy. He also participated in shows at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool.\\"Fernand Lungren,\\" [Biographical Notes], Terra Foundation, https://collection.terraamericanart.org/view/people/asitem/items$0040null:279/0 Late in 1900, he traveled to Egypt for seven months with the medical scientist Henry Solomon Wellcome. There he created pastels of the pyramids, but many of the pastels and sketches that resulted were lost when his baggage was damaged on the return journey.Ackerman, G.M., American Orientalists, ACR edition, 1994, p.121-22  California  Illustration from Art in California: A survey of American Art, 1916 In 1901, Lungren returned to the United States. After settling initially in New York, he moved to Los Angeles, California, in 1903. Three years later, he established his home in Santa Barbara, commenting in 1914 that \\"as a field for artistic endeavor, it would be impossible to find a spot more favored than Santa Barbara\\".\\"Fernand Lungren,\\" [Biographical Notes], Online Archive of California, Online: http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt4g50195q/ In 1909, Lungren made his first of many trips to the Death Valley and Mojave Desert region, North East of Los Angeles, California, where he focused on scenes of the desert in all conditions of weather, seasonal change and time of the day, producing several famous paintings of these landscapes, with often poetic rendition of the specific desert atmosphere.Skolnick, A. (ed), Paintings of California, University of California Press, 1993, p. 10 In the same period, Fernand Lungren authored the illustrations of three books by the American nature writer Stewart Edward White, i.e. The Mountains (1904), The Pass - Mountaineering Through the Late 19th and Early 20th Centuries (1906) and Camp and Trail (1907), based on the experience he had acquired when staying and painting in New Mexico and Arizona, while, in return, Stewart Edward White wrote the foreword for the first Fernand Lungren biography written by John A. Berger and published in 1936 (Schauer Press, Santa Barbara, CA). An important figure in the Southern California art scene in the early twentieth century, Fernand Lungren helped found the Santa Barbara School of the Arts in 1920 with the sponsorship of the Community Arts Association of Santa Barbara. He remained a resident of Santa Barbara until his death in 1932. Although not born and educated in California, Fernand Lungren can be associated to the California Plein-Air Painting school, by his outdoor subjects and his impressionist style during the last third of his life when he was living in California.\\"Fernand Lungren,\\" [Biographical Notes], Online Archive of California, Online: http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt4g50195q/; Starr, K., Material Dreams: Southern California through the 1920s, [E-book edition] Oxford University Press, 1990 Collections of Fernand Lungren works Fernand Lungren donated 320 of his paintings and drawings to the Santa Barbara State College, which ultimately became the University of California, Santa Barbara; his collection is kept at the University's Art, Design & Architecture Museum (formerly the University Art Museum). https://www.museum.ucsb.edu/collections/fine-arts, , https://www.independent.com/2013/06/05/artist-fernand-lungren/ In addition to the University of California, Santa Barbara, other public collections with works by Fernand Lungren include the Santa Barbara Museum of Art; the Orange County Museum of Art, Newport Beach, California; the Laguna Art Museum https://lagunaartmuseum.org/artist/fernand-lungren/; the Hubbell Trading Post Museum, Ganado, Arizona; the Art Institute of Chicago, Illinois; the Terra Foundation for American Art, Chicago, Illinois; the Toledo Museum of Art, Ohio; the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; the Mead Art Museum, Amherst College, Massachusetts; the Wallace Collection, London.

Biography Born in Maida Vale, Jack was the son of Moses Gaster, the leader of the Sephardic Jewish Congregation in London, and Lucy Friedlander. He studied at the London School of Economics and then entered a legal career, qualifying as a solicitor in 1931, and soon thereafter forming a socialist law practice with Richard Turner.Victoria Brittain, \\"Obituary: Jack Gaster\\", The Guardian, 13 March 2007. In 1926, Gaster joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP), inspired by its support for workers during the British General Strike. He became prominent in the party, and was its representative at the arrival of the Jarrow March in London. However, he was a champion of unity with the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB), and to this end was a founder of the ILP's Revolutionary Policy Committee. The Committee successfully persuaded the ILP to disaffiliate from the Labour Party, but could not convince members to merge with the CPGB. As a result, in 1935, he joined the majority of the Committee in resigning from the ILP and joining the CPGB. Gaster joined the British Army during World War II. He was posted to the Royal Sussex Regiment and was watched closely by British intelligence.Dan Carrier, \\"Why Jack Gaster never went to war\\", Camden New Journal, 13 March 2008. However, he was injured in training and instead spent the war educating illiterate soldiers. In 1946, Gaster was elected to the London County Council in Mile End, alongside fellow communist Ted Bramley. However, he lost the seat in 1949, and was again unsuccessful in 1952.Geoffrey Alderman, London Jewry and London Politics 1889‚Äì1986, p. 106. He subsequently acted as the principal legal consul to the CPGB, and became a vice-president of the Haldane Society of Socialist Lawyers.\\"Gaster Jack\\", Compendium of Communist Biography. During the Korean War, Gaster travelled to the North to study the situation, as part of an international legal team. The group produced a report covering a range of issues, including the conditions for prisoners of war, but were heavily criticised for their allegations of germ warfare by the United States. Gaster remained a prominent communist solicitor until he retired in 1990, and an activist in the CPGB until it was disbanded in 1991, a decision with which he strongly disagreed. He subsequently joined the Socialist Labour Party, but soon left, later re-joining and then again resigning.John Haylett, \\"Obituary: Jack Gaster\\", Morning Star, 20 March 2007.

Declining ratings and the cancellation of other soap operas in the late 2000s and early 2010s prompted concern that the show would not reach the milestone until new management led to a turn- around. Other events were organized to commemorate the occasion, with media promoting the milestone and commemorative memorabilia being released by ABC. Begun in 1963, General Hospital eventually became the top daytime soap opera before a decline in the late 1970s, which was followed by a resurgence that peaked in the early 1980s. In honor of the anniversary, the producers reintroduced previous major characters and created storylines reminiscent of notable arcs of the past with the focus of the anniversary week on the show being the return of the popular Nurses' Ball event. Cast members also made appearances on several programs and at various media events to mark the anniversary. The Nurses' Ball is always a fan favorite episode to watch with many of the cast getting to show off talents other than acting. Background General Hospital is the third longest-running soap opera in history and the longest-running American soap still in production. Started on April 1, 1963, the show became the highest rated show on daytime television within a decade, eclipsing previous leader As the World Turns. In 1977 General Hospital started to suffer a major drop in ratings and was at risk of being cancelled when Gloria Monty was hired on as executive producer. Monty refocused the series on younger characters and the show became the most successful daytime soap on television, with the 1981 episode featuring the wedding between characters Luke and Laura garnering 30 million views, setting a record as the most widely watched episode of daytime television in history. When the show began focusing heavily on mob storylines in the 2000s, ratings saw a heavy decline. The show was one of several daytime dramas that was at risk of cancellation in the wake of falling ratings in the late 2000s and early 2010s with long-running soaps As the World Turns and Guiding Light being pulled off the air. Two soaps that aired alongside General Hospital on the ABC network, All My Children and One Life to Live, were also cancelled in September 2011 and January 2012 respectively. Members of the General Hospital cast began to believe that the soap would not be able to reach its 50th anniversary as ABC Daytime started prioritizing reality programming. Frank Valentini, who was executive producer of One Life to Live, took over as executive producer of General Hospital after One Life to Lives cancellation. He was joined by One Life to Live writer Ron Carlivati and are together credited with revitalizing the series. The show began bringing in a new cast to put an emphasis on younger characters and moved away from the show's mob storylines. It has subsequently seen its best ratings in five years with an average of 3 million viewers, the biggest increase being amongst the 18-34 female demographic. Storylines To honor the anniversary, several storylines were introduced that harkened back to historic periods in the series. Valentini described the plans for the anniversary storylines as being \\"not only to celebrate what's happening now, the resurgence of 'General Hospital' and a spike in its ratings in the past year, but what it means in terms of the history of the show.\\" He stated that organizing the celebration was difficult due to the festivities going on both on and off-camera. Anthony Geary, who portrayed Luke Spencer, stated that the anniversary could have passed with minimal fanfare but that Valentini and head writer Carlivati were \\"determined to make it something special for the audience.\\" Several characters returned to the show in preparation for or to commemorate the anniversary including Audrey Hardy, who first appeared six months into the series. Audrey, portrayed by Rachel Ames, appears in the official anniversary episode, which aired a day after the anniversary due to scheduling changes prompted by the naming of Pope Francis. In the episode, Chris Robinson, Stuart Damon, and Natalia Livingston also returned in the roles of Rick Webber, Alan Quartermaine, and Emily Quartermaine respectively, whose deceased characters appeared as ghosts to the living character Monica Quartermaine, portrayed by Leslie Charleson. Genie Francis returned in her role as Laura Spencer in the lead-up to the anniversary and together with Geary as Luke became part of a storyline involving Helena Cassadine that Geary described as reminiscent of the Luke and Laura storylines created by Monty during the 1980s. Another storyline element that was revived was the Nurses' Ball, which serves as the focus of the anniversary week programming. The fictional charity event to promote HIV/AIDS awareness was popular with viewers of the series since it began in 1994 and until it ended in 2001. Valentini revived the event on the show partially out of a desire to mark the anniversary. Lucy Coe, portrayed by Lynn Herring, also recently returned to the series and the character continued in her capacity as the master of ceremonies for the Ball. Musician Rick Springfield reprised his role as Noah Drake to do a performance during the Ball and Richard Simmons, who had been a recurring presence on the show in the 1980s (portraying himself), returned as a choreographer for the ball. Regular character Sam Morgan, portrayed by Kelly Monaco, performed a dance number during the special with a character portrayed by Maksim Chmerkovskiy of Dancing with the Stars. Originally, Valentini wanted to have Maksim's brother Val Chmerkovskiy appear on General Hospital to perform the number since he was Monaco's partner during her stint on Dancing with the Stars, but his schedule would not permit it. For the first time the fictional charity gala was linked to a real non-profit devoted to HIV/AIDS research, amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research, as part of a partnership between the organization and ABC. Valentini stated with regards to the partnership that \\"by linking the ball to amfAR we partner in their efforts to raise awareness beyond the town of Port Charles.\\" Other commemorations TV Guide featured an advertisement for the anniversary on the back cover of its 60th anniversary issue consisting of an image collage depicting Luke and Laura from their 1981 wedding. In addition to storylines on the show, ABC released limited-edition commemorative prints depicting various iconic scenes from the series including a group photo of present and past cast members as well as individual character prints. Only 1,963 prints of the cast photo have been made, signifying the year General Hospital premiered. Members of the cast, Valentini, and Carlivati, rung the opening bell for the New York Stock Exchange on April 1 to celebrate the anniversary. Finola Hughes and Jason Thompson, who portray Anna Devane and Patrick Drake respectively, made an appearance on the April 1 and April 2 airings of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? where they performed a mock soap opera scene with host Meredith Vieira. Together they competed for money that would be donated to The Art of Elysium, a non-profit that encourages people in the entertainment industry to work with children suffering from serious illnesses, and managed to win $500,000. Katie Couric had a \\"Countdown to the General Hospital 50th Anniversary Extravaganza\\" on her daytime talk show Katie, releasing exclusive interviews with cast, which culminated in an April 4 program of the show focused on the soap opera. Couric further anchored an April 6 20/20 behind- the-scenes special for the anniversary, \\"General Hospital - The Real Soap Dish\\", discussing the impact the show has had on popular culture and how some of its storylines have delved into societal topics. For a February collector's edition issue, People magazine ran a special cover honoring the 50th anniversary. TV Guide, itself celebrating its 60th anniversary with a special edition issue, had an in-depth four-page feature about General Hospitals anniversary and a full-page advertisement for the event on its back cover. The feature reflected on the show's troubled state a year before the anniversary, its resurgence, and past revivals. For the back cover, the magazine depicted an image from the 1981 wedding of Luke and Laura formed by a collage of images from the show. Both the feature and back cover ad were well received by soap opera commentators. SOAPnet aired a 50-hour marathon the weekend before the anniversary with an encore of the marathon airing the following weekend. The marathon began with the first episode of the series and some of the most noteworthy moments in the story over every decade, such as the wedding of Luke and Laura, the Ice Princess storyline, and the death of Stone Cates from HIV/AIDS. A panel called \\"General Hospital: Celebrating 50 Years and Looking Forward\\", moderated by William Keck of TV Guide, was organized by the Paley Center for Media for April 12 to commemorate the anniversary. The panel consisted of several major cast members, along with producer Valentini and head writer Ron Carlivati. During the panel, audience members asked the panelists questions about the show and the soap opera genre. Panelists reflected on the show's history, discussed their roles in the anniversary storylines, and remembered deceased cast members, such as John Ingle who played Edward Quartermaine until his death in 2012, and John Beradino who played Steve Hardy.

According to Harvey Klehr, \\"The American Federation of Teachers' Local 5 in New York, the union's largest affiliate, was [Communist] Party stronghold. Its vice president, Dale Zysman, was a Communist who used the pen name of Jack Hardy.\\" Klehr also mentions that Bella Dodd was a close associate. In Dodd's memoir, she states: \\"We had one man in the [Teachers] Union who was so talented that he was regarded as the Stalin of the Union -- Dale Zysman, also known as Jack Hardy.\\" Dismissal In 1938, Zysman remained vice president of the Teachers Union. In 1939, he was listed as a party official using the name \\"Jack Hardy, identified as a New York schoolteacher\\" when providing visa for a false passport obtained for Fred E. Beal (fugitive from justice and a leader of the 1929 Gastonia strike).\\" In 1940, U.S. Representative Martin Dies, Jr. (Democrat - Texas, 2nd district) had already marked him out as a subversive: \\"Dale Zysman, teacher in the public schools of New York, has written books for the Party under the name of 'Jack Hardy'.\\" In February 1941, he championed the plight of other teachers before he, too, got call to testify. By March 1941, Zysman was implicated again: > A conference of Communists attended by history teachers from both Brooklyn > College and City College to lay out a broad program of publication of > pamphlets and brochures giving the Communist interpretation of history was > described to the Rapp-Coudert legislative committee today at a public > hearing. The committee's star witness so far, William M. Canning, City > College instructor who resigned from the Communist Party last year, also > added 17 more names of alleged City College Communists to the 34 he cited > yesterday, and described how - the Communists sought, usually with success, > to dominate meetings of the College Teachers' Unions. The meeting of the > Communist historians, Canning said, was held in the office\\"of Alex > Trachtenberg, president of International Publishers. 'The purpose,' he said > under questioning by committee counsel Paul Windels, 'was to discuss a > program for proving the validity of the thesis the Communists were then > using that Communism was Americanism of the 20th Century.' Canning did not > give the date of the meeting, but it apparently was before the signing of > the Hitler-Stalin pact in 1939. Those present, he said, included Dale > Zysman, vice-president of Local 5 of the Teachers Union, teachers Henry L. > Klein and Emil Morais of Brooklyn College, Philip and Jack Foner of the CUNY > history faculty, and two well-known Communists who were not teachers, Anna > Rochester and Henry Aptheker, as well as Canning himself. Another paper reported that \\"Dale Zysman,\\" vice president of the Teachers Union, asserted that he knew of a 'dozen or so' high school teachers who have been subpoenaed by the committee and the latter group confirmed that a number of such Instructors had already testified as to conditions in their schools.\\" Later that March, the New York Sun reported that Zysman was not only the communist \\"Jack Hardy\\" but also \\"Richard Enmale,\\" a name devised \\"by taking the first two letters from the names, Engels, Marx and Lenin.\\" On June 5, 1941, William Levich, former assistant director of the Workers School, and Benjamin Mandel testified before the Coudert committee that Zysman, then a Manhattan P.S. 39 teacher and vice president of the Teachers Union, that he a communist and someone who had recently been to the Soviet Union, and had used the Party name \\"Jack Hardy.\\" That same day, Alfred J. Brooks, a teacher at Brownx P. S. 61, and Howard Selsam, a professor at Brooklyn College, refused to testify. Two of the day's witnesses were Benjamin Gitlow and Joseph Zach, both former high-ranking Communists. Gitlow testified that Brooks had lived in the Soviet Union from 1926 until 1932 and worked a Comintern office under the name of \\"A. G. Bosse.\\" Seven teachers, including Henry L. Klein and Zysman, refused to testify that day. \\"Mr. Zysman insisted he was not \\"declining to answer,\\" but \\"refraining from answering,\\" reported the New York Sun. The following day, Friday, June 6, 1941: > Dr. Harold G. Campbell, superintendent of schools, acting upon evidence of > alleged Communist activity by the teachers, canceled Klein's assignment and > suspended Alfred J. Brooks of Public School 61, the Bronx, and Dale Zysman, > vice president of the Teachers Union of Public School 89, Manhattan. On June 10, 1941, Zysman had a letter to the Brooklyn Daily Eagle published: > Editor School Page ‚Äî Sir: Statements about me on the School Page of June 6 > are inaccurate and misleading. You state that \\"for years there has been > speculation\\" as to whether Dale Zysman and Jack Hardy are the same person > and that \\"Mr. Zysman has remained mum on the subject.\\" The facts of the > matter are that nearly two years ago I addressed a communication to the > Board of Superintendents advising them that \\"I have published several books > under the pen name of Jack Hardy.\\" This has long been a matter of common > knowledge to all of my friends and most of my associates. I sent a copy of > this communication to the Board of Education and shortly thereafter it was > quoted in the New York Teacher, monthly organ of the Teachers Union. I also > advised the Coudert Committee of the same fact when I appeared before them > at a private hearing on October 9 last. When so much was made of this fact > at the public hearings of the Coudert Committee on June 4, I was at a loss > to understand what the \\"exposure\\" was all about. Except, of course, that for > reasons of their own Messrs. Coudert and Windels seem to prefer to do things > this way. DALE ZYSMAN. Vice-president, Teachers Union By June 12, the board had affirmed the suspension of two of the teachers who refused to testify before the Rapp-Coudert Committee: Alfred J. Brooks and Dale Zysman. On September 9, 1941, Zysman went en trial at the Board of Education for refusing to testify before the Rapp-Coudert legislative committee, investigating subversive activities in public schools. Harold C. Campbell accused Zysman Communist party involvement, hampering the legislative inquiry, giving false testimony at private hearings, then refusing to testify at open hearings. \\"Zysman has filed a general denial of the allegations.\\" On September 17, 1941, the New York Sun ran the headline \\"Zysman Identified as Red: Teachers Union Leader Tried in Absence After He Walks Out on Hearing.\\" The article states: > Dale Zysman, teacher at P.S. 89, Manhattan, and vice president of the > Teachers Union, today walked out on a trial begun by the Board of Education > to inquire into charges that he had been guilty of subversive activities > and, under the party name of Jack Hardy, had written a number of tracts > expounding communistic doctrines. Zysman's attorney Vito Marcantonio had asked for a ten-day stay because the Board had failed to present \\"an itemized bill of particulars,\\" which stay the Board denied, so Zysman walked out. The Board's counsel, Charles C. Weinstein, declared that charges served on Zysman in July been itemized and constituted a bill of particulars. Weinstein called the walk-out a \\"smokescreen\\" and asked that the trial proceed, a request granted. Benjamin Mandel, a former teacher and former communist, then testified that he had known Zysman in the party as \\"Jack Hardy.\\" Further, Zysman/Hardy was \\"especially active in the Pioneer Youth, the junior wings of the Reds.\\" Lastly, Mandel stated that any Communist teacher was expected by the Party to \\"inculcate communistic ideals in children.\\" (By 1941, Mandel had become a special investigator for the Dies Committee and later served on the committee's successor HUAC as chief researcher during the Hiss-Chambers Case. In his 1952 memoir, Chambers noted, \\"I knew personally just one member of its staff‚ÄîBen Mandel, its able chief researcher... the former business manager of the Daily Worker.\\") On September 18, 1942, the Brooklyn Daily Eagle reported that the trial committee of the Board of Education was ready to open a new trial tomorrow of another teacher facing similar charges, after \\"having completed its trial of Dale Zysman, teacher at P. S. 89, Manhattan, and vice-president of the Teachers Union, accused of communistic activities and of writing communistic books under the name of Jack Hardy.\\" In 1942, Zysman filed a lawsuit to recover his pension after his dismissal: > The pension board voted to file a letter from Dale Zysman, publish school > teacher who was dismissed from service last December as a result of the > Rapp-Coudert investigation, Mr. Zysman had asked permission to have his > accumulated pension contributions in the pension fund at 4 per cent > interest, arguing that this privilege is granted to resigned teachers for a > period of five years after they leave the service. Mr. Zysman was > represented at yesterday's meeting by Samuel Greenfield of the Teachers > Union, who cited the pension law as proof that no distinction is made > between persons who are dismissed and those who resign... \\"Mr. Zysman is > asking for no special privilege.\\"... Mr. Zysman is appealing against his > dismissal and the Retirement Board has informed him that it will hold his > money and will pay interest on it if the appeal is sustained. (In 1952, Chambers recalled, \\"Circa 1941, Zysman's party membership was suspected or discovered. He was eased out of the schools in an incident that made a day's headlines. Later, he went to work for the Communist Labor Research Group, which included among others, Comrade Grace Hutchins.\\" Chambers is probably referring to the Labor Research Association.) Works Hardy was at least a fellow traveler, as indicated by his frequent publisher (International Publishers) and by the inspiration for his book The First American Revolution: \\"The thesis of this book is taken from V. I. Lenin's famous address to American workers: \\"The history of modern civilized America opens with one of those great, really liberating, really revolutionary wars... It was a war of the American people against English robbers who subjected America and held it in colonial slavery...\\" His book Labor and Textiles formed part of a series by International Publishers which included: Labor and Steel by Horace B.

Biography Born in Brockport, New York, he was the son of Alonzo J. Howe, a professor at the old University of Chicago, and Julia M. Osgood. During his youth he developed an interest in the stars, witnessing the spectacular Leonid meteor shower of November, 1866. He matriculated to the old University of Chicago, where he graduated with an A.B. in 1875 at the age of sixteen. Joining the staff of the Cincinnati Observatory as an assistant, he worked primarily on computing orbital elements and observing double stars. In 1877, he was awarded his A.M. degree from the University of Cincinnati under Professor Ormond Stone. Long hours of work had left him with health issues, and in 1880 he had two severe pulmonary hemorrhages. As a consequence, he began to consider moving to a different climate. Fortunately, the chancellor of the recently formed University of Denver in Denver, Colorado offered Howe a position as teacher. His move to Colorado greatly improved his health, so he decided to remain with the institution despite the lack of astronomical observing facilities at the site. He was made professor of mathematics and astronomy, becoming the first astronomy professor for the university. He was married to Fannie Shattuck, the daughter of the state superintendent of instruction, in 1884. The same year, he received his Sc.D. degree from the university with thesis work on solutions for the Kepler problem on orbit determination. In 1888, the university received a gift of $50,000 from Humphrey Chamberlin, an amateur astronomer, which Howe used to fund an observatory. Construction began in 1889, based around a aperture lens that Howe purchased from Alvin Clarke & Sons. At the time of assembly, the refractor telescope was the fifth largest instrument of its kind in the United States. Howe was named director of the Chamberlin Observatory in 1892, and trial observations with the telescope began in July 1894. Most of Howe's work at the observatory consisted of observations of neglected nebulae from the New General Catalogue, measurements of double stars, and positional work on comets and asteroids. In 1892, Howe was named the dean of the College of Liberal Arts, serving in this capacity until 1926. Unfortunately, his work in this capacity limited the time he could spend on astronomy. In 1899, he served as the acting chancellor of the university. He received an LLD from Denver University in 1910, and a second LLD from Colorado College in 1913. By 1926 his health was starting to fail, so he began to train his eventual successor at the observatory, Albert Recht.

Every 17 years, Brood II tunnels en masse to the surface of the ground, lays eggs, and then dies off over the span of several weeks. Although entomologist C. L. Marlatt published an account in 1907 in which he argued for the existence of 30 broods, over the years a number have been consolidated and only 15 are recognized today as being distinct. Brood II is among the 12 different broods with 17-year cycles. History In 1775, Thomas Jefferson recorded in his \\"Garden Book\\" Brood II's 17-year periodicity, writing that an acquaintance remembered \\"great locust years\\" in 1724 and 1741, that he and others recalled another such year in 1758 and that the insects had again emerged from the ground at Monticello in 1775. He noted that the females lay their eggs in the small twigs of trees while above ground. Brood II last appeared in the late spring and summer of 2013, and will emerge again in 2030 and 2047. The 4-centimeter long (1.5 in) black insects do not sting or bite. Once they emerge, they spend their short, two-week adult lives climbing trees, shedding their crunchy skins and reproducing. They can number up to a million per hectare (2.5 acres). 2013 emergence A cicada from the 2013 Brood II emergence rests on an elementary school parking lot. In 2013, to aid in accurately mapping the geographic range of Brood II, National Public Radio's science show Radiolab created the Cicada Tracker project. It encouraged listeners to use a mix of Arduino-based tools to report the underground soil temperature so as to predict when the cicadas would appear. The National Geographic Society sponsored a citizen science project, the Magicicada Mapping Project, to track actual emergence. Clarinetist David Rothenberg performed with these cicadas, and has also performed with Brood XIX.

The rear of the cart swings forward when a cart is shoved into it, hence the nesting feature. Orla E. Watson (June 3, 1896 ‚Äì January 17, 1983) was an American inventor, engineer, and draftsman. He is most remembered for his invention of the rear swinging door feature on grocery shopping carts allowing the cart to telescope, or \\"nest\\" in order to save space. Watson was a World War I veteran and had a number of jobs including machinist, draftsman, and foreman. Watson experimented with his various ideas on the side, including the development of a Model T timer to replace the stock electrical device on Model T automobiles. In 1933, he opened a business making air conditioners. In 1946, Watson opened Western Machine Co., a machine shop and contract manufacturing business. In 1946, Watson made a prototype of his new cart and presented it to a group of 10 grocery store owners in the Kansas City area. One of those present during the presentation was local grocery store owner Fred E. Taylor who was impressed with the design and would later become co- founder of Telescope Carts, Inc. George O'Donnell, a salesman from Oak Park, Illinois would also join the company. Watson's design was a major improvement to those previous to the introduction of the telescope cart. Orla Watson was granted a patent #2,479,530 on August 16, 1949 for the \\"Telescope Cart\\" which could be \\"nested\\" together in order to save space without disassembly after each use. Up to that point, the most common design in use at grocery stores within the United States was based on a \\"folding chair\\" and removable basket design introduced by Sylvan Goldman. Watson's work on the evolution of the shopping cart forms the basis of all subsequent designs up to the present. Watson also developed the power-lift shopping cart to raise the lower basket of the two-basket design to assist in the retrieval of items while at the checkout counter. Only a few of the power-lift designs were produced. The patent application was abandoned and never granted. Watson also applied for and was granted four patents prior to the telescoping shopping cart. These patents included improvements to mechanical valves, pumps, and gauges, none of which were ever licensed or manufactured.

The actor received a request through his agent to audition for the role of Jett. After two weeks, he was shocked to learn that he had won the part. Home and Away marks McDonald's first television role. He made his first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 7 May 2012. In May 2015, it was announced that McDonald was to leave Home and Away, Jett departed on 1 July 2015. McDonald has since reprised his role for guest appearances in November 2015, May 2017, and March 2019. Jett was introduced as a rebellious teenager, who had plenty of attitude, but needed someone to trust him. He was forced to fend for himself at a young age because his mother was a drug addict, who often moved them from place to place. Following his mother's death, Jett was fostered by Gina (Sonia Todd) and John Palmer (Shane Withington). Todd thought that Jett was \\"a much-needed light\\" when the Palmer's relationship began to suffer. In February 2013, Jett developed a crush on Indigo Walker (Samara Weaving), which spiralled out of control when her husband was injured. The character was later involved in a boating accident. McDonald earned a nomination for the Most Popular New Male Talent Logie Award for his portrayal of Jett. Casting The character and McDonald's casting was announced in late April 2012. McDonald had learned from his agent that there was request for him to audition for Home and Away. Two weeks after auditioning, he was informed that he had won the part of Jett. McDonald told Andrew Mercado from TV Week that he was \\"stunned\\" to get the role of Jett and later stated \\"When I got the part, Mum and Dad called me downstairs and Dad told me the role was mine. I was speechless. I thought this had to be a dream; I was so excited I could not stop jumping around.\\" Jett is McDonald's first television role and he revealed that his first day on the set was \\"so surreal\\" and nerve-wracking. McDonald explained that it was hard to keep up with his school work during the week, so he has to catch up at the weekends. McDonald made his debut screen appearance as Jett during Episode 5512, which was broadcast on 7 May 2012. Development Characterisation Jett was introduced to Home and Away as a rebellious 13-year-old boy. A Channel 5 writer described him as \\"a delinquent with a lack of respect for authority and a knack for causing trouble\\", adding that he would fit in with Summer Bay's reputation for being \\"a playground to wayward teens\\". McDonald said that Jett would get on some of the other character's bad sides, especially VJ Patterson's (Felix Dean), while he would also make an enemy of Gina Austin (Sonia Todd), the principal of Summer Bay High. A writer from the official Home and Away website called Jett \\"a smart kid with plenty of attitude\\". He learnt to fend for himself because his mother, Liz (Sophie Gregg), was a drug addict, who often moved from place to place when she suffered a relapse. With no father around, Jett stole food and money to help himself and his mother. The website writer added that Jett is \\"a good kid\\" at heart, who loves his mother and just needs someone to trust him. McDonald told Andrea Black, editor of the Home & Away Collector's Edition 2012 magazine, that Jett was a regular teenager, who just wanted to fit in. He has had a lot of independence in his life due to his mother's situation. When asked what the most challenging aspects of playing Jett were, McDonald said \\"I've led an opposite life to Jett - he had this horrible upbringing, so I've had to put myself in that place as to what I would do if I had to survive on my own and provide for a family.\\" Family After his mother died, Jett was fostered by Gina and her husband, John (Shane Withington). When Jett's biological father, Richard Bozic (Radek Jonak), turns up, Jett suddenly decides to move away with him, which leaves \\"a gaping hole\\" in Gina and John's life. Gina attempts to win Jett back, causing a strain on her marriage, but it pays off when Jett returns home. Todd stated that Jett's arrival in Gina and John's life came at the right time, calling him \\"a much-needed light\\" when their relationship began to suffer. The Palmers later announce their intention to adopt Jett and Todd said \\"John and Gina love Jett ‚Äì they feel they can give him the love and parenting that he deserves. Gina has a strong maternal streak.\\" When the adoption is approved, the family decide to go on holiday, but during the journey Gina collapses at the wheel of the car. Both John and Jett are scared by what has happened and are unsure about what to do. Jett is both shocked and confused by Gina's collapse, fearing that he is going to lose another mother. Gina dies from an aneurysm and McDonald said that her death would have a big impact on Jett. He explained \\"Jett's just had a horrible roller-coaster ride and things aren't getting better for him. There's more heartbreak ahead. It's going to get harder. I can say that although Gina's passing is a horrible experience, it does bring Jett and John closer.\\" He added that the two characters would form a strong father-son bond. Jett developed a crush on Indigo Walker played by Samara Weaving (pictured). Crush on Indi Walker On 3 February 2013, Susan Hill from Daily Star reported Jett would develop \\"a dangerous crush\\" on Indi Walker (Samara Weaving). Weaving explained that Jett tries to impress Indi, but the situation would get out of control when Indi's husband, Romeo (Luke Mitchell) is injured. The actress told a TV Week columnist that Indi is not aware of Jett's infatuation with her at first. She continued \\"He's trying to impress her by being a 'man', like Romeo. Indi's really nice to him ‚Äì she helps him with his studies since he doesn't have many friends in the Bay, and she enjoys his company. It's harmless ‚Äì until it goes a bit crazy.\\" Jett tricks John into taking Gina on a night out, so he can call Indi to babysit. However, his plan is almost derailed when John asks Romeo to visit Jett and talk to him about growing up. In order to spend time with Indi alone, Jett takes Romeo's wallet and throws it in a shed, before locking Romeo inside. Weaving believed that Jett was not thinking of the repercussions because of his young age. Jett's plan amounts to nothing when John and Gina insist that he spends the night at the Walker family's home instead. When Indi begins to worry about Romeo's whereabouts, Jett uses Romeo's phone to send her a text saying he is in the pub. Meanwhile, Romeo attempts to escape the shed, but falls and knocks himself unconscious. An All About Soap reporter noted that Indi soon realises what has been occurring and tells Jett that nothing can happen between them. Weaving quipped that Jett would not be able to lie his way out of what has happened. When Romeo is found, he, John and Gina turn up at the Walker's and Jett is forced to apologise for his actions. Boating accident In one storyline Jett nearly drowns in a boating accident. His predicament begins when Jett takes a trip on his boat which is not seaworthy. John and Marilyn (Emily Symons) decide to get married and they try to find Jett and get his blessing. But they are alarmed when they cannot find him. Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher) alerts John that Jett must have headed into the sea in the boat. The pair begin a frantic search to find Jett while Marilyn stays on land to keep a look-out. Jett's boat sinks and he is forced to try and swim back to the shore. Marilyn notices Jett having trouble swimming back and realises she cannot reach him in time. She alerts Darryl Braxton (Steve Peacocke) who decides to risk his life to save Jett and jumps in the water. Peacocke told Rebecca Lake of TV Week that it was a \\"being in the right place at the right time\\" scenario as Brax rushes to save Jett's life. But he warned that Brax begins to run out of energy the closer he gets to Jett and more drama ensues. He does manage to save Jett and Peacocke added that the scenes resembled US television series Baywatch. Departure and returns In May 2015, it was announced that McDonald would be leaving Home and Away. His character's exit aired on 1 July 2015. The storyline sees Jett leave the Bay to attend military school. Both John and Marilyn are unhappy that he is joining the armed forces, especially John, who feels that he is losing his best friend. Jett is disappointed when he realises that no one is making a fuss about his departure. When he learns that there will not be a party, he is \\"deflated\\". However, the Bay residents have secretly planned a farewell party at the Diner for him. McDonald later returned for guest appearances from 19 November 2015, and in May 2017. McDonald was pictured filming scenes on Palm Beach, alongside Symons and Withington in September 2018. A writer for Inside Soap confirmed that the character would make his on-screen return in early 2019. Jett returned in the episode broadcast on 12 March 2019. He turns up at the Diner to surprise John and Marilyn, and they soon wonder if there is more to his unexpected return than first thought. Storylines While at the beach, Jett steals a tourist's wallet. John Palmer tries to catch him, but Jett outruns him. Jett later steals VJ Patterson's shirt and hits him. When he starts attending Summer Bay High, principal Gina Austin punishes him for bullying. Jett asks Heath Braxton (Dan Ewing) for some drugs and steals money from Colleen Smart (Lyn Collingwood). Jett is questioned by the police and Gina tries to get him to open up to her. Jett steals Indigo Walker's wallet, but she decides not to press charges. Gina tries to visit Jett and his mother at home, but Jett refuses to let her in. When Marilyn Chambers is mugged, Gina's son Xavier (David Jones-Roberts), is convinced Jett did it. Jett later admits that Xavier is right. Gina tries to see Jett's mother, but he claims that she is in the hospital. Gina then invites him to stay with her family and makes him to apologise to Marilyn. Gina later takes Jett's house keys and discovers his mother has died. Jett had been keeping her death a secret and he is sent to live with a foster family. When he runs away, Gina takes him in. After his mother's funeral, Jett acts out and pushes Gina. He runs away, but returns to apologise. Jett is bullied by Jayden Post (Christian Antidormi) and during a fight with him, Jett drops a photo of his mother with a man, who he believes is his father. Xavier learns that the man is Richard Bozic and Gina goes to speak with him, only to learn that Richard does not want to meet Jett. Angered at Richard's rejection, Jett smashes Richard's garden up. Richard then meets with Jett. Gina and John decide to foster Jett on a permanent basis, but Richard decides that he wants his son to live with him. Jett leaves with Richard, but returns weeks later. Jett bonds with VJ and they train for the surf carnival. When he learns John kissed Marilyn, Jett calls Marilyn a marriage wrecker. When VJ and his mother suddenly leave town, Jamie Sharpe (Hugo Johnstone-Burt) questions Jett about where they have gone. Jamie steals Jett's phone and John advises Jett to stay away from him. Indi reassures Jett that VJ will return and Jett develops a crush on her. Indi babysits Jett, which delights him, until her husband, Romeo, turn up. Jett rubs lipstick on Romeo's shirt collar, hoping to cause trouble, but Romeo quickly realises what he has done. Jett tricks John and Gina into going out for the night and asks Indi to babysit. He then steals Romeo's wallet and locks him in a shed. Jett's plan to be alone with Indi is ruined when he has to go to the Walker's. Jett sends Indi a text from Romeo's phone, telling her that Romeo is in the pub, which makes her suspicious. Shortly afterwards, Gina, John and Romeo arrive to confront Jett. Realising that Romeo was injured, he apologises. Tilda Hogan (Gigi Perry) begins bullying Jett. She hits him and forces him to complete assignments for her. Jett gets his own back by writing an essay for her, in which she admits to bullying Jett because she has a crush on him. Gina and John decide to adopt Jett. Richard flies in and tells them that he does not want to give up on his son. This angers Jett and he accuses Richard of not wanting anyone else to have him. Richard relents and a court date is set to make the adoption official. To celebrate, they family decide to go on holiday afterwards. During the trip, Gina suddenly stops the car, falls unconscious and dies, leaving Jett and John devastated. Jett begins dating Nina Bailey (Emmy Dougall), a girl he met at the school disco. Jett is happy when VJ returns and they begin catching up. Jett introduces VJ to Nina, but they reveal that they hate each other as VJ believes Nina stole a Pok√©mon card he owned in primary school. When VJ asks Jett to choose between him and Nina, Jett chooses Nina. John and Marilyn get engaged and John asks Jett to be his bestman. John's daughter Shandi Ayres (Tess Haubrich) tries to break up John and Marilyn's relationship, and Jett tells her to stop. At the wedding, Jett asks John and Marilyn to adopt him and they agree. Jett calls John \\"Dad\\", but struggles to see Marilyn as his mother. Jett goes on a school trip to Canberra and joins the other students sleeping in a trench at an ANZAC experience. Jett finds Alf, who has become seriously ill. Jett visits Alf at the hospital and befriends Tom Knight (Vincent Ball). Jett attends an ANZAC Memorial and then tells John and Marilyn that he wants to join the army. He enrolls in a military school and the Summer Bay residents throw him a farewell party. Jett calls Marilyn \\"Mum\\" for the first time. A few months later, Jett returns to the Bay to see John, while Marilyn is away. Jett tells John that he and Nina broke up and he introduces John to his new girlfriend, Skye Peters (Marlo Kelly). Jett and Skye tell John that Skye has run away from her mother after her she was blamed her for the death of her sister. Jett returns to military school and has a long-distance relationship with Skye, but they eventually break up. A couple of years later, Jett surprises John at the Surf Club and explains that Alf rang him, so he decided to come and see what is going on with John and Marilyn, who have separated due to Marilyn's lack of trust in John. Jett encourages John to seek professional help. Discovering John has dissociative amnesia they visit John's childhood home, where they discover that John's father died the day after his 10th birthday and not of a heart attack as John believed. John begins counselling, as he is plagued by images of his former self carrying a Jerry can, and hypnotherapy is recommended. Jett discovers that Marilyn has begun learning hypnotherapy, but she struggles and he pushes her to try harder and practice on him. Despite many attempts Jett and Marilyn fail, however, John volunteers to try and he remembers that his father killed himself. John and his mother burned down the barn with his father's body inside, shocking Marilyn and Jett. John has no memory of what happened during the hypnotherapy session. Jett and Marilyn keep the details from John, but Jett struggles and presses Marilyn to inform John of the truth. Jett makes a surprise return to the Bay to see John and Marilyn. He bonds with John and Marilyn's foster daughter, Raffy Morrison (Olivia Deeble) as he helps her with her homework. John wonders why Jett has turned up unannounced, and Jett explains that he is being deployed to Afghanistan for six months. Marilyn is upset by the news and thinks he is too young to go. Jett seeks advice from Alf, and Marilyn later apologises for asking him not to go. Jett assures her that he has a good team and they will look out for each other. Jett says his goodbyes to Marilyn, John and Alf, telling them to take care of each other. Not long after, Marilyn and John learn there has been an explosion at Jett's base and they struggle to get in touch with him. An officer soon informs them that Jett has been critically injured and is being evacuated to a hospital in Germany. John and Marilyn fly out to be with him, and they soon return to Summer Bay together, where Jett is transferred to the Northern Districts hospital. Tori Morgan (Penny McNamee) informs them that Jett has suffered a serious injury to his spinal cord, resulting in complete loss of sensation and muscle function from the waist down, meaning Jett will not walk again. Jett initially has trouble accepting the diagnosis. He breaks down in front of nurse Jasmine Delaney (Sam Frost) and says that he has let his team, John and Marilyn down. Jett struggles to use a wheelchair for the first time and pushes everyone away, but after some encouragement from John, he tries again. Tori's brother, Mason Morgan (Orpheus Pledger) helps Jett to improve his muscle mass and upper body strength. He also bonds with Robbo (Jake Ryan) over their shared experiences, and Robbo encourages him to ask for help when he needs it. Jett then talks with the Army Chaplain about his survivors guilt. He applies for a home, as he feels ready to move out and be independent. However, he struggles to do things on his own, and realises that his mind has not caught up with his body. John also tries to do things for him, until Marilyn and Alf get him to back off. Marilyn also helps Jett to decides on a new career, after he admits he wants to help other veterans and soldiers. An apartment in the city becomes available and Jett accepts it. After a family breakfast, Jett visits Gina's bench and thanks John and Marilyn for all their help, before he moves to the city. Reception For his portrayal of Jett, McDonald received a nomination for the Most Popular New Male Talent Logie Award in 2013. Claire Crick from All About Soap wrote that Jett had \\"never been a loveable sort of character\\", until he met Richard and his softer side emerged. Crick continued \\"When he first arrived in town, Jett gave us very little reason to like him. He picked on poor VJ for a start, and also made a habit of mugging the locals. But since he's moved in with Gina and John, we've seen a different side to the student. Without his mum, he's clearly a confused soul who just wants to be loved.\\" References External links * Jett James at the Official AU Home and Away website * Jett James at the Official UK Home and Away website Category:Home and Away characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2012 Category:Fictional adoptees Category:Child characters in television Category:Fictional military lieutenants Category:Fictional characters with disability Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Jett James"},{"id":"39044782","text":"An Israeli breakfast with eggs, Israeli salad, bread and various accompaniments An Israeli breakfast is a distinctive style of breakfast that originated on the Israeli collective farm called a kibbutz, and is now served at most hotels in Israel and many restaurants. History During the early days of the state of Israel, residents of a kibbutz ate their meals in a communal dining hall. It was common for the residents to eat a light snack early in the morning, and then work in the fields for several hours. Then they returned to the dining hall for a hearty mid morning buffet meal, similar to a brunch. By the 1950s, Israeli hotels were promoting the \\"Israeli breakfast\\" in a style similar to the kibbutz meals. In 1979, members of the Jerusalem Hotel Association and the Israeli Hotel Owners Association decided to phase out the full Israeli breakfast as a part of their basic hotel room rate, substituting it with a more modest Continental breakfast instead, in order to reduce costs. The effort was not successful, and the tradition of a hearty breakfast buffet continued. Characteristics and typical dishes At hotels in Israel, the Israeli breakfast is commonly presented as a self-service buffet. In smaller restaurants, a more streamlined menu may be presented through sit down table service. The Israeli breakfast never includes meats such as ham and bacon, which are common on breakfast menus in many other countries. In accordance with the Jewish laws of Kashrut, meat and dairy ingredients are never served together in a meal and pork products are forbidden. The Israeli breakfast is a dairy meal, and a variety of cheeses are offered. Fish is considered pareve and so is permitted with a dairy meal, and herring is frequently served. Other smoked or pickled fish dishes are also common, including sprats, sardines and salmon. Egg dishes are almost universal, which may be pre-cooked or cooked to order. The Maghrebi egg dish shakshouka (shakshuka), brought to Israel by Tunisian Jews, is a common choice, comprising eggs poached in tomato sauce. Other Middle Eastern dishes may include Israeli salad, hummus, tehina, halloumi, ful medames, baba ghanoush and the strained yogurt known as labaneh. Fresh vegetables such as tomatoes, cucumbers, green peppers, radishes, onions and shredded carrots are common, as are olives. A variety of salads are available. Coffee, tea, juices, fresh fruits, bread and pastries complete the menu.

It comprises a region known as Regi√≥n Citr√≠cola (Citrus Region), for being a major producer of orange at local, national and even international level. Allende is located at the Sierra Madre Oriental range foothills in the central-southeastern part in the state of Nuevo Le√≥n. It has a territorial extension of 148.5 km¬≤, comprising around 0.22% of the whole extension of Nuevo Le√≥n. Given its geographic location, the region consists of valleys and hills ranging from 300 meters above sea level on the northeast, to 1,640 meters above sea level in the southwestern part of the municipality. According to the last census data in 2010, it has 32,581 inhabitants, of whom 16,436 are men and 16,145 are women. The main economic activities are agriculture, livestock, beekeeping (Allende is one of the largest producers of honey in Mexico), poultry and transportation, activities that generate many jobs in the region. A sister city of Allende is Conroe, Texas. Location The municipality is located around 46.7 km. (30 miles) on the highway to Linares, southwards Monterrey. It borders the municipality of Santiago to the north and northeast, going throughout the Sierra Madre Oriental and the stream of Cerro Las Cruces. It's also bounded on the north by the municipality of Cadereyta Jim√©nez, having as natural boundary streams of the Lazarillos and Los Nogales, where they converge with Ramos River. Allende also borders the municipality of Montemorelos to the northeast, east, southeast and south. History Prior the arrival of the first Spanish settlers to the New Kingdom of Le√≥n in the late sixteenth century, these lands were inhabited by a group of indigenous people of Chichimeca origin called Huachichiles, that prevented the penetration of settlers to the region called \\"Cuarisezapa\\" that stretched from the outskirts of Monterrey until Guajuco Valley in what today are the municipalities of Santiago and Allende, they were shortly expelled when the Spanish arrived.Alan√≠s (2006), p. 211. The Spanish promoted the colonization of the area and founded the Cuarisezapa Guajuco Valley, comprising an area to the Ramos river. Its first settler was Captain Diego Rodriguez de Montemayor, grandson of the founder of Monterrey Diego de Montemayor, who received a grant from Governor Martin de Zavala in 1646 and two years later expanded it by a purchase to Diego Fernandez de Montemayor.Alan√≠s (2006), p. 211. When he died, his widow Ines de la Garza with her children continued working on livestock, agriculture in the haciendas.Alan√≠s (2006), p. 211. General Luis Garcia de Pruneda owned large estates in the vicinity of these lands by the 1700s, when he died in 1739, he desired that a part of his properties were devoted to charitable works, so in 1749 was promoted the creation of two chaplaincies that included what today are the municipalities of Allende, Cadereyta Jimenez and Montemorelos. Tourism The Ramos River attracts many visitors for its landscapes, another tourist site is El paseo de la Loma de la Santa Cruz (Loma de la Santa Cruz's walk) which offers a panoramic view from the municipal seat. Other tourist sites are the Plaza Zaragoza, in front of town Hall and Plaza Mariano Escobedo. The Parroquia de San Pedro Ap√≥stol (Parish of St. Peter Apostle), which is a modern building on a smaller scale replica of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, the Museum of Anthropology, History and Culture House in the Old Temple, the shrine of Our Lady of Light at Rancho El Cerro, the Hacienda del provisor, the collection gallery of Bernardo Flores Salazar and the municipal palace.Alan√≠s (2006), p. 216.Alan√≠s (2006), p. 217. 200px 200px 200px 200px 200px Museums The ancient temple of San Pedro Apostol, is now a museum that houses the history and culture of the municipality, along with antiquities of items and depictions of life-style of the town.Alan√≠s (2006), p. 216.

Colonel Nicolas Jean Robert Conrad Auguste Sandherr (6 June 1846 ‚Äì 24 May 1897) was a French military officer involved in the Dreyfus Affair. Early life and career Sandherr was born in Mulhouse, in Alsace, then a part of France and also the hometown of the Dreyfus family. The son of a notary at the Mulhouse commercial court, Sandherr joined the French infantry via the military academy of Saint-Cyr. He was promoted successively to sub- lieutenant in the light infantry in 1866, lieutenant in 1870, and captain in 1873. His high potential gained him admission in the first class of students at the √âcole sup√©rieure de Guerre and he left the academy breveted as a major. Wounded in combat at the start of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, Sandherr was named a Knight of the Legion of Honor in September of that year. He served as captain of the 2nd Regiment of Algerian Tirailleurs (skirmishers) in Tunisia at the time that it was annexed as a protectorate. He was charged with classifying Tunisian tribes by their hostility to the French presence.  Head of the Statistical Section Named commandant in 1885, he joined the ‚ÄúStatistical Section‚Äù of the army general staff, the harmless name used to disguise the French military's counter-espionage service. In 1887, he took command of Section. Promoted to lieutenant-colonel in 1891, he was placed under the direct orders of General Gonse, at the start of the Dreyfus Affair.  Dreyfus Affair Sandherr was assisted by Commandant Henry, an officer who had the total confidence of General Gonse. In September 1894, the Statistical Section intercepted a handwritten note found in the wastepaper basket of the German ambassador in Paris, thanks to a household servant in the embassy. The document established that French military secrets had been handed over to the Germans, then considered a national enemy. Sandherr gathered a secret commission of inquiry that hastily decided on Captain Alfred Dreyfus as the perpetrator. Very quickly, Dreyfus was arrested and condemned. Promoted to colonel on April 14, 1895, Sandherr left his job at the Statistical Section on July 1 of that year to take command of the 20th Infantry Regiment at Montauban. His successor at the Statistical Section was lieutenant-colonel Georges Picquart, who would effectively agitate for and support Dreyfus‚Äô rehabilitation. The scandal escalated in 1898 when it became apparent that the prosecution's case had been fabricated and incriminating documents had been forged by Commandant Henry. Sandherr did not live to see the end of the Dreyfus Affair although he was one of its initiators. Struck by a general paralysis (a neurosyphilis-incited meningitis), he had to leave active service in December 1896 and succumbed to his sickness before the scandal came to light. He was made an officer of the Legion of Honor in 1888.  Popular Works  * 2013 Robert Harris, An Officer and a Spy, London: Hutchinson. 2013.

Bond (September 26, 1918 ‚Äì October 18, 1969) was the first graduate of what is today called North Carolina Central University School of Law (NCCU School of Law). He graduated in 1943, and was the only African American to successfully pass the North Carolina bar exam that same year. Early life Robert R. Bond was born on September 26, 1918 to John Bond, Sr. and Mary Bond, both school teachers. John Sr. also served as a principal of a Rosenwald School, and the John B. Bond High School was named after him. Robert Bond graduated from high school in 1935 and began attending North Carolina College for Negroes (today NCCU) in 1937, pursuing a degree in business administration. He originally planned to attend medical school after college, but was persuaded to instead pursue a career in law. Law school Bond registered to attend NCCU School of Law beginning in 1939, but because he was the only student to register at the new school, the school's opening was delayed until September 1940.

Canada, a 1938 U.S. Supreme Court decision, which held that states must provide blacks facilities for legal education that are \\"substantially equal\\" to those available to whites. The lack of resources at the new school made the experience difficult for Bond. The new law school only had a small amount of space in the North Carolina Central University administration building. It did not have the benefit of an established faculty so he often went to neighboring law schools such as the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) and Duke University and sat in the back of the class, even though he was not able to participate. Professors from UNC and Duke would sometimes go to NCCU School of Law's campus to test Bond and occasionally offer instruction, but Bond usually had to learn the material on his own. NCCU School of Law did not have its own library, so he was forced to use the libraries of other schools at night, since African Americans were not allowed to be there during the day. Despite these challenges, Bond became the first graduate of NCCU School of Law in 1943. Professional career Bond was the only African American to successfully pass the North Carolina bar exam in 1943. He then moved to Washington, D.C. where he worked for the Social Security Administration until 1947, when he moved to Wilmington, North Carolina to go into private practice. Bond was the only black attorney in Wilmington during his lifetime. He was a strong civil rights advocate, and because of this, often faced threats and harassment. He commonly found notes on his car saying \\"the KKK is watching you.\\" Bond married Margaret Farnsworth in 1953 and the couple had a daughter named Michele. He worked hard to desegregate the New Hanover County Schools by filing a lawsuit and convincing black families to send their children to their neighborhood schools, forcing desegregation. He also worked to free jailed demonstrators during the civil rights demonstrations in Wilmington. He worked on the first case of hospital discrimination to go to court. He, along with Conrad Pearson, another prominent black attorney, represented three African American plaintiffs in Eaton v. Board of Managers of the James Walker Memorial Hospital, a case brought by three African American physicians who argued that they could not be excluded from courtesy staff privileges at the hospital solely because of their race, as such discrimination was unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment. The court eventually dismissed the case, but it still encouraged other lawyers to support the abolition of racial discrimination in public places. Richard Bond was a member of various professional, social, and fraternal organizations. These included the North Carolina Lawyer's Association, the Wilmington, North Carolina Bar Association, the New Hanover County Democratic Party, and the Guardsmen. He was also a member of Omega Psi Phi fraternity and was a 33rd Degree Mason. A portrait of Robert Bond hangs in the NCCU School of Law today recognizing him as the first graduate of the school. Bond died on October 18, 1969.

It was intended to clear the way for an attack on the English Royal naval anchorage at Harwich. After repeated attempts the Dutch attack planned by Michiel de Ruyter was repelled and as a result the planned attack on Harwich was abandoned. It was one of the last battles of the war in Europe before the Treaty of Breda was signed. Background In the aftermath of the great Dutch victory on the Medway in June 1667 Michiel de Ruyter now had command of the Thames Estuary which allowed the Dutch to establish a naval blockade of London. Further attempts to operate in the Thames met with less success, and so at the start of July de Ruyter decided to attack Harwich, the next good safe anchorage up the coast from the Thames, and a naval base since 1657.Clowes pg 295 Before they could attack Harwich itself the Dutch needed to neutralize Landguard Fort, the port's outermost line of defense. Landguard Fort is situated on a spit of land that runs south from Felixstowe across the mouth of the River Stour and River Orwell estuaries, and was built to protect the anchorage at Harwich, on the opposite side of the estuary. The governor of Landguard Fort was Nathanial Darrell and was defended by 400 experienced musketeers of the Duke of York and Albany's Maritime Regiment. The Fort itself had forty cannon with approximately one-hundred men and officers for gun crews.Modern Day Commando Battle Dutch Attack on Harwich, July 1667, by Willem van de Velde the Elder De Ruyter split two of his squadrons in the attack with one squadron operating inside the estuary and one out to sea. As they moved forward they came across unexpectedly shallow water which meant that the attack from the estuary was totally abandoned, but seaward squadron could fire a few shots at long range. He had intended to support this attack with naval gunfire at relatively close range but De Ruyter still pressed ahead.Rickard, J The Dutch now sent the marines into boats and rowed to shore with some 1,500 marines and 500 sailors under the command of Colonel Thomas Dolman (a hardliner Parliamentarian turncoat), the English commander of the Dutch land forces. They landed on the coast to the north of the fort at Cobbold's Point. This put them out of range of the guns in the fort, but also meant that they had to split their forces. The Dutch left the smaller part of their force at the cliffs the vast majority of them sailors, and this left the marines to attack on their own. The marines marched south to attack the fort while they had the hard task of dragging their cannons across the shingle. The English were alerted to the Dutch and soon prepared for action, they had warnings of possible Dutch attack especially after the defeat at Medway. The Dutch made no hesitation in launching an attack; ladders were brought forward and in action lasting forty-five minutes the Dutch were repelled by concentrated English fire which had caused some loss. The Dutch, however, did not give up; they reorganized and launched a second attack. This time a small English galliot had joined in the action firing grapeshot at the Dutch soldiers on the shore near the Fort. The shingle on the beach, sprayed by the shot acted like shrapnel causing the Dutch many casualties. Dolman was killed in this attack which created confusion and less than fifteen minutes later the leaderless Dutch marines retreated, leaving their ladders and other equipment behind. The English captured a number of prisoners and the Dutch suffered many casualties. The Dutch seaward squadron was only able to fire a few ineffective shots at long range. While the Dutch marines had been attacking the fort, the sailors at their beachhead came under attack by the local trained militia, commanded by the Earl of Suffolk. Continuous English fire lasted until 10:00 pm at which point the sailors decided that with casualties rising and being unable to advance forward the decision to retreat was made. By now the Dutch were trapped onshore by low water until around 2:00 am on 3 July, giving 500 regular infantry under Major Legge time to arrive from Harwich. They too had been involved with some more skirmishing with the Dutch who had been retreating from the fort but no British cavalry arrived. Legge's men were soon badly outnumbered as the defeated Dutch marines soon joined forces with their men on the beachhead. No significant fighting took place and the Dutch were able to re-embark after 2:00 am, and by 6:00 am their fleet had sailed away from Harwich.Pepys, Samuel pg 429-430 pg. 177-78 The Diary of Samuel Pepys, Vol. 8: 1667 Aftermath Losses for the Dutch were moderate they had suffered less than 150 killed, wounded or captured. The English loss was no more than 10 men but included Darrel who was wounded in the shoulder by a musket ball. After the failure of this raid the Dutch settled down to blockade the Thames. De Ruyter sailed off to cruise up and down the English Channel, leaving Admiral Jan Jansse van Nes in charge of the blockade, which lasted until the end of July. Further hostilities were ended by the Peace of Breda, which was signed on 31 July 1667. Legacy The attack was perhaps most noteworthy for being an early battle honour for both the English and Dutch marines. The Dutch Regiment de Marine had been founded by Michiel de Ruyter in 1665, and had won its first battle honour at Chatham during the attack on the Medway earlier in the year and they would later become the Netherlands Marine Corps. The garrison of Landguard were provided by the Duke of York and Albany's Maritime Regiment, raised in 1664 and one of the earliest precursors of the Royal Marines. The defense of Landguard was their first battle honour and it is recorded as the site of the last opposed invasion or attack of England. The fort to this day is still in existence and is open to the public.

In 2004 he was awarded the title of ‚Äòdistinguished professor‚Äô by Brunel University in recognition of his contributions in the domain of computational optimization, risk analytics and modelling. He headed the Mathematics Department (1990-2001) and subsequently founded the Center for the Analysis of Risk and Optimization Modelling Application (CARISMA). He is an emeritus Professor of Brunel University and a Visiting Professor of University College London. He has published five books and over hundred and fifty research articles. Professor Mitra is the founder and the CEO of OptiRisk Systems where he directs research and actively pursues the development of the company in the domain of optimization and financial analytics. In OptiRisk he has developed and leads a research group in his areas of specialization with talented researchers from UK, India, Europe, USA, and Brazil. Professor Mitra is also the founder and chairman of the sister company UNICOM seminars. OptiRisk systems and UNICOM Seminars also have subsidiaries in India. In India and Southeast Asia both the companies are going through a period of organic growth.  Early life and education  School and early life Until the age of 14 Gautam was taught by his mother Meera Rani Mitra who had a thorough grounding in Mathematics and academic topics prior to her marriage at an early age. This foundational training had kindled Gautam‚Äôs interest in all aspects of Mathematics and its applications. Graduation After joining Presidency University, Kolkata in 1956 for intermediate science he made the choice of academic work and dropped competitive sports and hobby. This was the time in India when Engineering was seen to be the future pillar of the country. He had to make another choice between Science and Engineering, so he joined and graduated as an Electrical Engineer from Jadavpur University. The next choice for Post Graduate Studies was between Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Queen Mary University of London. As the tradition in the family was to travel to the UK rather than USA, in 1962 he joined Queen Mary University of London for an MPhil in Electrical Engineering. But attending a workshop in Mercury Auto (assembly) Code for numerical computation he was completely smitten by the new technology. To the disappointment of his QMC supervisor with whom he had written two papers and designed a measuring instrument he joined the newly formed Institute of Computer Science as a temporary programmer and then a research fellow gaining a PhD in 1968.  Career  After gaining his PhD Gautam worked under Martin Beale, renowned optimisation specialist and director of Scientific Control Systems, and became a key member of the team developing optimisation solvers. After four more years in industry he joined Brunel University London as a lecturer. Subsequently he rose to be the Head of Department of Mathematics. He founded CARISMA, a research centre in risk analysis and optimisation. Under his leadership the Mathematics department flourished, being rated second best research department in the London area;https://www.brunel.ac.uk/mathematics/research-and-phd- programmes/Departmental-research-groups/Centre-for-the-Analysis-of-Risk-and- Optimisation-Modelling-Applications he retired in 2009.  Personal and Professional Interests   Sports  During school days he was a junior Table Tennis (state) Champion and a star ‚ÄòAero Modeller‚Äô. In later life he is passionate about tennis: he plays and watches Tennis with equal interest.  Science and Engineering  Gautam believes in research and is excited by creating and exploiting knowledge. He sees the former as part of Science and the latter as part of Engineering; his role models are Thomas Edison, Jagadish Chandra Bose, Claude Shannon and Edward O. Thorp. He is very much inspired by their lives and achievements.  Entrepreneurial Activities  After his PhD Gautam had to make a choice between academia and industry. He started in industry but in 1974 switched to academia and Joined Brunel University London and retired in 2009. The retirement gave him the chance to fulfil his ambition as an entrepreneur. The two companies UNICOM, a knowledge dissemination company and OptiRisk, an analytics company are academic spinoffs. Having left the academia, Gautam and his wife Dhira have devoted their energies to develop and grow these two companies.  Beliefs  Gautam believes in honesty, transparency, respect as essential part of one‚Äôs value system. Gautam values questioning and criticism when this is constructive. On his part he does not hold back criticism of his friends, colleagues and peers when he considers this to be appropriate.

Legitimising gay marriage is like legalising child abuse.\\" Francis later deleted the tweet but stood by her comments. During April 2013, Francis lobbied against government subsidies for the abortion drug RU486 saying, \\"Women facing unsupported pregnancies should be offered real support - not a chemical which is harmful to both them and their unborn child.\\" Francis has argued for outdoor advertising to be ‚ÄòG-rated‚Äô. She organised ACL members to protest against bus shelter billboards - where as Francis said, \\"children are waiting for the school bus\\" - promoting safe sex, which featured a fully clothed, hugging, gay couple holding an unopened condom packet. Francis was criticised due to her campaign not mentioning any affiliation with the ACL, and for describing the image as an act of foreplay. A Queensland Parliament committee conducted a public hearing where Francis argued that all billboards should be ‚ÄòG-rated‚Äô. The committee subsequently recommended a tougher approach to sexually explicit outdoor advertising. In May 2013 after a billboard was erected in Kings Cross, New South Wales, Francis lobbied to have it removed. The billboard displayed a fictionalised UK prime minister having sex with a pig. Francis said children should not have to see an adult image like this. The billboard was subsequently taken down. In August 2013 a ruling was made against the owners of a billboard by the Advertising Standards Bureau (ASB). The ASB said it presented women, \\"in a manner that was subservient and degrading\\". The owners said they would comply with the ruling. With the billboard remaining in place in August 2015, Francis said that self-regulation is not working. Francis has campaigned against the offensive slogans painted on the sides of Wicked Camper vans. Francis has similarly campaigned against a series of ads for shoes which incorporate naked models. The promoters say their ads are a \\"celebration of sexual expression\\" and are designed to \\"target a younger audience\\". Francis received abuse over her support of changes in surrogacy laws to exclude same sex couples and single people. In July 2015, Francis lodged a petition with the Queensland parliament complaining about the Safe Schools program. The petition incorporated wording from a Safe Schools student resource, OMG I‚Äôm Queer, intended for children aged 11 and up. However the Clerk of the Parliament would not permit the wording on Queensland parliament‚Äôs website because of the \\"intemperate\\" language. The 10,891-signature, petition was subsequently tabled with the \\"intemperate\\" wording censored. While the Palaszczuk government has said that it does not have plans to introduce the Safe Schools program in Queensland, Francis is concerned that that could be reintroduced in some other form. Francis has said that she supported anti-bullying programs, but the Safe Schools Coalition goes \\"way beyond that\\". Francis has campaigned against the liberalisation of abortion laws in Queensland. In lobbying against 'gender selection', Francis has said that eliminating human life in its early stages for being the wrong sex, is sex discrimination. Francis has said that for Australian to use its foreign aid program to finance abortion in developing countries. which are culturally opposed to abortion, is a form of \\"colonialism\\". Francis also supports the 'Nordic' model of prostitution legalisation - which has been described as the world‚Äôs first human rights/women‚Äôs rights-based legal model of prostitution legislation. The Nordic Approach does not criminalise the prostitute, but rather it criminalises the buyer ‚Äî addressing the demand for prostitution, and importantly also provides women with exit strategies. Within four years of the law being implemented, the number of women involved in prostitution in Sweden halved. In response to children being taught that they can choose their gender, Francis has had two books published entitled, \\"What are little boys made of?\\" and \\"What are little girls made of?\\" describing how a child‚Äôs biological sex determines whether they are a boy or a girl, with each sex having specific X or Y chromosomes. Francis does not ignore the reality of children born with intersex conditions which, whilst rare, account for a number of genetic or developmental situations. Centre for Human Dignity Francis heads the 'Centre for Human Dignity', which was established in 2017 by ACL to advocate for rights and freedoms, particularly for vulnerable children and to stand against all forms of sexual exploitation.

There is also a division according to the smaller Ammonian Sections (in Mark 239 sections, the last section in Mark 16:20), whose numbers are given at the margin. There are no references to the Eusebian Canons. It contains lists of the (tables of contents) before each of the Gospels, lectionary markings at the margin (for liturgical use), and subscriptions at the end of each of the Gospels.  Text  The Greek text of the codex is a representative of the Byzantine. Hermann von Soden classified it to the textual family Kr. Kurt Aland placed it in Category V.

Biography A page from the Great Tang Records on the Western Regions, a text widely used for its accurate descriptions of 7th century India Early life ≈öƒ´labhadra was born in the Samata·π≠a kingdom(South-eastern Bangladesh), in the Brahmin caste, to the royal family there.Mookerji, Radhakumud. Ancient Indian Education: Brahmanical and Buddhist. 1989. p. 517 As a young man he went westward to NƒÅlandƒÅ, and was trained there by DharmapƒÅla of NƒÅlandƒÅ, who also ordained him as a Buddhist monk.Watters, Thomas. Smith, Vincent Arthur. Yuan Chwang's travels in India. 1905. pp. 109-110 According to Xuanzang's account, ≈öƒ´labhadra gradually became famous for his learning even in foreign countries. At 30 years old, after defeating a Brahmin from southern India in a religious debate, the king insisted on giving him the revenue of a city, which ≈öƒ´labhadra accepted with reluctance, and he built a monastery there and kept it funded it with the city's revenues. The name of this monastery was ≈öƒ´labhadra VihƒÅra. ≈öƒ´labhadra and Xuanzang At the age of 33, the Chinese Buddhist monk Xuanzang made a dangerous journey to India in order to study Buddhism there and to procure Buddhist texts for translation into Chinese.Liu, JeeLoo. An Introduction to Chinese Philosophy: From Ancient Philosophy to Chinese Buddhism. 2006. p. 220 Xuanzang spent over ten years in India traveling and studying under various Buddhist masters. These masters included ≈öƒ´labhadra, the abbot of NƒÅlandƒÅ monastery, who was then 106 years old.Wei Tat. Cheng Weishi Lun. 1973. p. li ≈öƒ´labhadra is described as being very old at this time and highly revered by the monks:Archaeological survey Reports, Volume 16. 1883. p. 47 Xuanzang records the number of teachers at NƒÅlandƒÅ as being around 1510.Mookerji, Radhakumud. Ancient Indian Education: Brahmanical and Buddhist. 1989. p. 565 Of these, approximately 1000 were able to explain 20 collections of s≈´tras and ≈õƒÅstras, 500 were able to explain 30 collections, and only 10 teachers were able to explain 50 collections. Xuanzang was among the few who were able to explain 50 collections or more. At this time, only the abbot ≈öƒ´labhadra had studied all the major collections of s≈´tras and ≈õƒÅstras at NƒÅlandƒÅ. Xuanzang was tutored in the YogƒÅcƒÅra teachings by ≈öƒ´labhadra for several years at NƒÅlandƒÅ. Upon his return from India, Xuanzang brought with him a wagon-load of Buddhist texts, including important YogƒÅcƒÅra works such as the YogƒÅcƒÅrabh≈´mi-≈õastra. In total, Xuanzang had procured 657 Buddhist texts from India. Upon his return to China, he was given government support and many assistants for the purpose of translating these texts into Chinese. Teachings According to the Indian translator DivƒÅkara, ≈öƒ´labhadra divided the Buddhist teachings into three turnings of the Dharma Wheel, following the divisions given in the Sa·πÉdhinirmocana S≈´tra:Gregory, Peter. Inquiry Into the Origin of Humanity: An Annotated Translation of Tsung-mi's Y√ºan Jen Lun with a Modern Commentary. 1995. pp. 168-170 # In the first turning, the Buddha taught the Four Noble Truths at VƒÅrƒÅ·πáasƒ´ for those in the ≈õravaka vehicle. It is described as marvelous and wonderful, but requiring interpretation and occasioning controversy.Keenan, John (2000). The Scripture on the Explication of the Underlying Meaning. Numata Center. : p. 49 The doctrines of the first turning are exemplified in the Dharmacakra Pravartana S≈´tra. This turning represents the earliest phase of the Buddhist teachings and the earliest period in the history of Buddhism. # In the second turning, the Buddha taught the MahƒÅyƒÅna teachings to the bodhisattvas, teaching that all phenomena have no-essence, no arising, no passing away, are originally quiescent, and essentially in cessation. This turning is also described as marvelous and wonderful, but requiring interpretation and occasioning controversy. Doctrine of the second turning is established in the Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ teachings, first put into writing around 100 BCE. In Indian philosophical schools, it is exemplified by the MƒÅdhyamaka school of NƒÅgƒÅrjuna. # In the third turning, the Buddha taught similar teachings to the second turning, but for everyone in the three vehicles, including all the ≈õravakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas. These were meant to be completely explicit teachings in their entire detail, for which interpretations would not be necessary, and controversy would not occur. These teachings were established by the Sa·πÉdhinirmocana S≈´tra as early as the 1st or 2nd century CE. In the Indian philosophical schools, the third turning is exemplified by the YogƒÅcƒÅra school of Asa·πÖga and Vasubandhu. ≈öƒ´labhadra considered the teachings from the third turning (YogƒÅcƒÅra) to be the highest form of Buddhism, because it fully explains the three natures, but the MƒÅdhyamaka teacher J√±ƒÅnaprabha notably opposed this idea. Instead, J√±ƒÅnaprabha regarded YogƒÅcƒÅra teachings to be below MƒÅdhyamaka, because they (purportedly) posit the real existence of a mind. ≈öƒ´labhadra composed the text Buddhabh≈´mivyƒÅkhyƒÅna, which is now extant only in the Tibetan language.

Early history In the year 1086, according to the 11th Earl De La Warr, Buckhurst formed part of an estate that was recorded in the Domesday Book as belonging to \\"Ralph de Dene (whose grandfather was cupbearer to King Edward the Confessor) that... passed to the Sackville family ‚Äì Lords Buckhurst, Earls and Dukes of Dorset, and Earls De La Warr ‚Äì through the marriage of Ralph's descendant, Ela de Dene to Jordan de Sackville in 1140.\\" The 7th Earl De La Warr, writing in 1857, recorded that a well-built dwelling house and garden had been mentioned in 1274, and that a deer park on the estate was mentioned in the 14th century, during the reign of Edward I. A land survey of the Barony of Buckhurst in 1597‚Äì1598 recorded that Lord Buckhurst's property was divided into two parks: the Great Park of Buckhurst and the Little Park of Buckhurst, which were also called Buckhurst Park and Stonelands Park. The original mansion stood in Buckhurst Park, on 1,150 acres of \\"land in meadow pasture and wood... [and] for the sustenance and maintenance of deere\\". Stonelands Park contained 520 wooded acres including Stonelands Lodge, a hunting lodge consisting of a house with a barn and a garden; a relation, Andrew Sackville, resided there as the keeper of the park. Buckhurst Place, the original manor house, was a grand, partly-moated courtyard house in Buckhurst Park. The beauties of the house and estate in 1579 were praised in a Latin poem by the Scottish academic Hercules Rollock.William Steven, The History of the High School of Edinburgh (Edinburgh, 1849), p.16: Hercules Rollock, 'Sylva VI: ad Generosissimum equitem, Torquatum Thomam Sacvillum', Bridging the Continental Divide, University of Glasgow Buckhurst was the home of the Sackville family until it was vacated in the early 1600s by Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset. Thomas Sackville was a cousin of Queen Elizabeth I through the family of her mother, Anne Boleyn. (identifying Thomas Sackville as the son of the Queen's great-aunt, who was the sister of the Queen's grandfather Thomas Boleyn) His court connections resulted in a considerable fortune, enabling him to keep a household staff of at least 220, and to draw up plans for a new and more elaborate mansion on the Buckhurst estate, even prior to his elevation to the titles of Lord Buckhurst and Earl of Dorset. The building was abandoned by about 1605, after Thomas Sackville removed his family and household from Buckhurst Place to Knole House in Kent, a large palace granted to him by Queen Elizabeth in 1566. Much of Buckhurst Place was pulled down early in the 17th century, and its materials were employed around 1616‚Äì1619 to build an almshouse called College for the Poor (now Sackville College) at East Grinstead, leaving the gateway tower as the only remnant standing. (\\"the solitary survivor of so much magnificence is the gateway tower\\") Stoneland and Buckhurst Park Stoneland Lodge, now Buckhurst House, in 1783 Buckhurst c.1900 After moving to Knole House, Sackville continued with plans to build a new house at Buckhurst. Construction of the new house, called \\"Stoneland,\\" was started in 1603, taking the site of Stoneland Lodge, the former hunting lodge in the smaller park. Upon Sackville's death in 1608, his son Robert Sackville, 2nd Earl of Dorset, reduced the scope of the original plans but continued construction of a substantial mansion, designed as a residence for the steward, with no formal garden. The residence received considerable additions in the mid-18th century by Lionel Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset, who used Stoneland as an occasional summer retreat. The present house is dated to that period; according to the Sussex Record Society, the \\"former Stoneland Lodge, now called Buckhurst House, [was] built in 1743\\". The Duke of Dorset's third son, George Germain, 1st Viscount Sackville, took the house as his summer residence until his death in 1785. The house has since been much remodelled, notably in the early 19th century by an Elizabethan-style renovation for Arabella, Duchess of Dorset and her second husband, Lord Whitworth, who occupied the house and improved both it and the grounds. The Duchess incorporated into the house's grounds a portion of the larger park which had belonged to Buckhurst Place, and discarded the name Stoneland, giving to the entire estate the name Buckhurst Park. Buckhurst Park was landscaped in 1830‚Äì1835 by Humphry Repton, whose landscape plans for the park were embodied in one of his \\"Red Books\\", (gives client as George Sackville-West, 5th Earl De La Warr) and the remodelling of the house was carried out to designs by his son, John Adey Repton. The Duchess of Dorset also commissioned a lakeside walk of shrubs and ornamental trees, along with a boathouse, from landscape designer Lewis Kennedy, noted for the Empress Josephine's formal gardens at Ch√¢teau de Malmaison. In the early decades of the 20th century, the estate was leased for over 25 years to Robert Henry Benson (1850‚Äì1929), a merchant banker and art collector, who continued to make improvements to the house. Finding the house and grounds very much as Repton had left them, in 1902 he called upon architect Edwin Lutyens to add an extensive wing. Lutyens later credited his decades-long appointment as architect of New Delhi, the grand central area of which is still known as Lutyens' Delhi, to a chance meeting at a country-house party at Buckhurst during Benson's tenure. (citing a statement made by Lutyens to Christopher Hussey, his biographer) The wing added by Lutyens has since been demolished, but a sunken basin opposite its former \\"New Room\\" survives, and surrounding gardens by Gertrude Jekyll adjoining it were later carefully recreated from Jekyll's planting plans, rediscovered in a drawer at Buckhurst. Lutyens' preferred Brunswick fig trees also survived the demolition. , Buckhurst Park is owned by the 11th Earl De La Warr, and is made available to the public for weddings, corporate events, and a variety of outdoor pursuits. Herds of cattle, sheep, and pigs are raised on the estate, and Lady De La Warr is the owner of South Park Stud, which breeds pedigreed Shetland ponies on the estate. The Hundred Acre Wood Within the Buckhurst Park estate is the \\"Hundred Acre Wood,\\" an area that was separated from Ashdown Forest by disafforestation in 1678, when Stoneland was in the possession of Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset. The writer A. A. Milne, who lived nearby at Cotchford Farm, Hartfield, made the Hundred Acre Wood famous as the setting of the Winnie-the-Pooh stories.

Steiner begins his study of algorithms on Wall Street in the 1980s but also provides examples from other industries. For example, he explains the history of Pandora Radio and the use of algorithms in music identification. He expresses concern that such use of algorithms may lead to the homogenization of music over time. Steiner also discusses the algorithms that eLoyalty (now owned by Mattersight Corporation following divestiture of the technology) was created by dissecting 2 million speech patterns and can now identify a caller's personality style and direct the caller with a compatible customer support representative. Steiner's book shares both the warning and the opportunity that algorithms bring to just about every industry in the world, and the pros and cons of the societal impact of automation (e.g. impact on employment).

Officially counted as the first two episodes of the season, it figures as the 66th and 67th overall episodes of the series. It was written by series creator and executive producer Matthew Weiner and directed by executive producer Scott Hornbacher. It originally aired on the AMC channel in the United States on April 7, 2013. The episode takes place in late December 1967 and on the early morning of January 1, 1968. It received strongly positive reviews from critics. Plot  Part I  The episode opens with a point of view shot of \\"Jonesy\\" (Ray Abruzzo), the Drapers' doorman, who is in the throes of a heart attack. Dr. Arnold Rosen, a cardiac surgeon who also lives in the building, attends to him with chest compressions. Don (Jon Hamm) is next shown lying on a beach reading Dante's Inferno, beside a sweating, bikini-clad Megan (Jessica Par√©), who has just ordered a second cocktail. The Drapers are mixing business and pleasure on a trip to the Royal Hawaiian Hotel on an expenses-paid trip from Sheraton, which owns the hotel and is an SCDP client. At a luau, Megan, now a recognizable actress on a TV soap opera, is approached by a middle-aged woman seeking an autograph. \\"She really knew me,\\" comments Megan. Don seems put off. That night, Don, unable to sleep, goes to the hotel bar, spots a young man completely drunk and scrunched up at the bar. Don encounters another slightly drunk man, who recognizes Don's lighter as an indication that he had served in the US military and identifies himself as Private Dinkins, a soldier on R&R; from a tour in Vietnam. Dinkins reveals that he has been in the midst of his own bachelor party and points to the drunken man as his best man. He invites Don to give away his bride at the ceremony. The next morning after waking up alone, Megan finds Don participating in the ceremony on the beach and snaps a photo. In New York, Betty (January Jones), Sally (Kiernan Shipka), Henry's mother Pauline, and Sandy (Kerris Dorsey) (a 15-year-old whose mother has died and who is staying with the Francises) attend The Nutcracker. On their way home, Betty gets pulled over for reckless driving. Back at home with Henry (Christopher Stanley), Bobby, and Gene, Sandy - who says she is going to Juilliard - shows off her skill at playing the violin, performing the popular Nocturne in E-flat Major, Op. 9, no.2 by Chopin. Later, while in bed, Betty teases Henry about his leering at Sandy while she played the violin, and shocks him by jokingly offering to help him gag and rape the girl. When Megan and Don return home from their Hawaii trip, Megan asks Jonesy how he's feeling. In a sudden flashback to an event earlier in the same location, Don and Megan watch Jonesy collapse from an apparent heart attack. Dr. Rosen begins applying chest compressions, as is shown in the opening shot of the episode, and at Rosen's direction, Don removes Jonesy's jacket, while Megan phones an ambulance. Flashing forward again to the present, Jonesy is apparently healthy and back at work, joking that his wife \\"couldn't wait to get [him] out of the house.\\" He hands Megan a script that a messenger had delivered. In the middle of the night, Betty gets up to make a snack and finds Sandy in the kitchen, smoking a cigarette and unable to sleep. Sandy reveals that Juilliard rejected her and that what she really wants is just to live in New York City. Betty urges Sandy to wait a few more years, and this sparks an argument between the two. Betty confides her unpleasant experience living in an overcrowded, low-rent Manhattan apartment when she was modelling, while Sandy expresses admiration for people living in a commune in the Village, and says she once visited such a group on St. Mark's Place. Peggy (Elisabeth Moss), now living with her boyfriend Abe, receives a late-night call from Bert Peterson from Cutler Gleason and Chaough. A comic appearing on The Tonight Show has made jokes about American soldiers in Vietnam cutting off Viet Cong soldiers' ears and wearing them around their necks like trophies, rendering CGC's planned Super Bowl commercial for Koss headphones (featuring the slogan \\"Lend Me Your Ears\\") potentially too controversial. Peterson wants Peggy to develop a new ad. Peggy tries unsuccessfully to reach Ted Chaough (Kevin Rahm) in Colorado by phone about the crisis. Don chats with Dr. Rosen in their building's elevator as they leave for work. Rosen expresses interest in the Leica cameras SCDP is promoting, and Don offers him one free if he'll stop by Don's office. Roger Sterling (John Slattery) is now seeing a psychiatrist, and during a session he discusses a new love interest as well as his feelings that his employees respect him but don't really know or care about him. Roger laments that neither he nor his life's direction seems to be changed by his experiences, and he seems anxious about aging toward death. While sharing an elevator, Bob Benson (James Wolk), who says he works in accounts on SCDP's second floor, tries his best to make an impression on Don, although Don struggles to remember who Benson is. At the office Don finds the copywriting team (now openly smoking marijuana) hoping for feedback about his trip to inspire a concept for the Royal Hawaiian pitch. Photographers are taking pictures of the partners, and Don finds his office rearranged for that purpose. Now alone in his office, Don stares out the window and hears the ocean. Don meets with a few of the new copywriters and criticizes their ideas for advertising a Dow oven cleaner; he's particularly concerned with the trivialization of the \\"love\\" construct. The receptionist shows Dr. Rosen into the room, but he halts her at the door so he can witness Don at work before he is noticed. Don then retrieves Dr. Rosen his promised Leica camera (M2 model) while Rosen leers at a passing secretary. The doctor lets Don in on the New Year's Eve plans their wives have been making, sharing that he'd instructed his wife, Sylvia, to \\"keep it in the building.\\" As Roger tries to arrange a date with his new girlfriend, his secretary, Caroline, walks into his office visibly upset. She informs Roger that his mother died that morning of a stroke. Although she bursts into tears upon delivering the news, Roger is relatively unfazed, saying \\"she was 91 years old, it's hardly a shock.\\" He then instructs Caroline to request Joan's (Christina Hendricks) help to make funeral arrangements. In Don's office, while the photographers are attempting to capture him in his element, he lights up a cigarette and realizes he's still holding onto PFC Dinkins' Zippo lighter, which bears the inscription: \\"IN LIFE WE OFTEN HAVE TO DO THINGS THAT JUST ARE NOT OUR BAG.\\" When the photographer finally gets the attention of a now-distracted Don, he tells Don, \\"I want you to be yourself.\\"  Part II  At home, Megan wakes Don to tell him she's been called in to work today, and for the rest of the week. This will cause her to miss Roger's mother's funeral, which she regrets. When Megan leaves, Don gets out of bed and, again finding Dinkins' lighter, throws it in the garbage. Before leaving for the funeral, he starts drinking while watching TV. Betty learns from Sally that Sandy has left for Manhattan, despite Betty's wishes. Sandy had told Sally she was going to Juilliard early, which Betty knows is not true. As Roger mingles with some of his mother's friends at her funeral gathering, his ex-wife Jane arrives and offers Roger his mother's ring back, so he can pass it on to his daughter, Margaret, or bury it with his mother. Roger insists that Jane keep it. Some catered food is delivered that Roger didn't order; it turns out to be from Bob Benson. Don arrives at the funeral drunk. As Roger starts addressing the guests, his first wife Mona (Margaret's mother) shows up along with her current husband, which irritates Roger. At the same time, one of Roger's mother's elderly friends cuts him off and demands to deliver the first eulogy, which Roger obliges. As the woman speaks about Roger's mother's devotion to him, Don vomits into an umbrella stand, so Ken Cosgrove (Aaron Staton), Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser), and Harry Crane (Rich Sommer) escort him out of the room. Before the eulogy can resume, Roger confronts Mona's husband for appearing uninvited, and quickly loses his temper, shouting: \\"This is my funeral!\\". Although he tries to then kick everybody out, no one moves, so Roger storms off to a bedroom. Mona goes to Roger, who is lying on his mother's bed, covering himself with the guests' fur coats. He tells her she shouldn't have brought her husband; she agrees. He says his mother is dead and he says he doesn't feel anything. Mona replies he seems emotional. Roger says he needs a drink, and Mona responds she knew he loved her, so there's nothing to drink about. She gently prods Roger to spend more time with his daughter Margaret. He sits up and makes a pass at Mona, who laughs him off. Pete and Ken bring Don home, and he drunkenly asks Jonesy what he saw when he died. Jonesy reports he saw a light and then says he doesn't like to think about it. Don wonders if the light was like hot tropical sunshine and if he heard the ocean. Betty goes to Greenwich Village looking for Sandy and finally finds the house where she stayed with a bunch of squatters. She is appalled at the condition of the rundown building. She finds Sandy's violin and asks two men in the kitchen about her. They say she was around but haven't seen her lately. The leader of the squatters arrives and says Sandy left for California, with no forwarding address. Betty tries to leave with the violin, but the leader says he bought it from Sandy, who needed bus money, for US$10 (). Betty takes the violin anyway, then changes her mind and leaves it in the front hall, perhaps symbolic of giving up on trying to save Sandy. Back at the Sterling house, Margaret chats with Roger. He gives her a jar of discolored water from the River Jordan that his mother kept and used to baptize all the family members. Margaret wonders if her grandmother left her anything else. It turns out her husband Brooks wants to make an investment in the refrigeration business. Roger tells her to have him sit down with him and present a written business proposal. She is thrilled, but leaves the water behind. Megan finds a hungover Don in bed, where she left him earlier, and reports that her character \\"pushed Derek's mother down the stairs\\" on the soap opera. They're making her character into a \\"lying, cheating whore\\", and she's clearly thrilled because it means her part will be bigger. Don assures Megan that being the antagonist on the show will likely make her even more popular. She asks if he will still love her if she's a \\"lying, cheating whore\\". He says he will but will walk behind her on the stairs. She also gives back the lighter, which the maid found in the garbage. It's late on New Year's Eve. Peggy is working, and her boyfriend brings her a choice of submarine sandwiches. She asks him to try the client's headphones and think of \\"some words\\" to describe them. Her staff comes in with new lines for the ad, to replace the original \\"lend me your ears\\" reference. They say they have three ideas and read her three lines. She asks for other ideas, pointing out that they gave her three versions of the same idea, and if they can't figure out which part is the idea and which part is the execution of the idea, then they are of no use to her. She notices her boyfriend enraptured by the music on the headphones and moving to the beat, and she gets an actual idea. Don arrives in the office for the presentation to Sheraton. He gives Dawn the lighter and asks her to find a way to get it back to PFC Dinkins. Roger is back in analysis, talking about his ex-wife and daughter. He talks about his mother and says she gave him his last new experience; now it's just a slow march to death. The therapist says Roger feels lost. Roger says he doesn't feel anything. Ken says hello to Bob, who is now loitering in the lobby. He shames him for sending food to Rogers mother's funeral, and for using a funeral as an opportunity to suck up to Roger and try to get himself noticed. He tells him to go back to his office and do some work, or otherwise people will think he has nothing to do. The Sheraton people show up for the first pass. Don shows them the ad, a drawing of shoes, a suit coat, and a tie with footprints next to it leading into the ocean. He says they're not selling a geographical location but an experience. He waxes poetic about the air and the water at the resort, and how the place put him in a state. The tagline is: \\"Hawaii. The jumping off point.\\" To the execs, it looks like the man in the ad committed suicide √† la A Star Is Born (1954). He is confused that they're reading it that way. They wonder where the hotel is in the ad and think the ad is a little morbid because it could make people think of suicide. Betty comes home on New Year's Eve as a dark brunette. Bobby and Sally mock her, while Henry bemusedly says: \\"Elizabeth Taylor, what have you done with my wife?\\" Caroline informs Roger that the man who shines his shoes has died. The man's family sent over his shoeshine kit because Roger was the only one who asked about him. Roger takes the kit into his office and opens it. When he takes out a brush he starts uncontrollably sobbing. New Year's Eve finds the Drapers entertaining the Rosens and another couple from their building. The other couple relays a story about a man from his office who got caught in a men's room stall at Bloomingdale's with another man, suggesting that it was not an isolated incident. Megan goads Don into showing slides from their Hawaiian trip. He lingers on the snap Megan took of the Dinkins' wedding. Later on New Year's Eve, Peggy chats with Stan over the phone as they both work. They gossip about Roger and Joan. Ted comes in to talk to Peggy. She explains she may have found a solution. She shows him outtakes of the ad with the actor in the toga clowning around while wearing the headphones. She says she envisions a voiceover: \\"Koss headphones: sound so sharp and clear you can actually see it.\\" He loves it and tells her she's good in a crisis and to let the workers go home. Stan, who had been listening over the phone, comments that he thinks Teddy likes her. Later in the night, the other couple has left the Drapers‚Äô. The Rosens and Drapers had such a good time they missed midnight. But then Dr. Rosen gets a call for emergency surgery. The snowstorm outside makes a cab unlikely, so Don and Arnold Rosen head down to the building's storage room to get Rosen's skis. Don asks what it's like to have a life in his hands. Arnold replies it's a privilege and an honor to have the responsibility. He says Don gets paid to think about things people don't want to think about, and he gets paid not to think about them. Rosen puts on his skis and heads off. Don heads back in, and promptly goes to bed with Arnold's wife, Sylvia (Linda Cardellini), who had given him Dante's Inferno to read while in Hawaii. She asks what he wants for the new year. He says: \\"I want to stop doing this.\\" She replies: \\"I know\\". Don goes home and picks up the newspaper. It is 1968. He gets into bed with Megan, who kisses him and wishes him: \\"Happy New Year.\\" Cultural references A Star Is Born Don's proposed ad reminds the client (and Roger) of the suicide in the film A Star Is Born (1954).  Dante's Inferno  Allusions to Dante's Inferno are abundant throughout the episode, including Don's reading the book while lying on Waikiki Beach, next to Megan. Writes Chicago Sun-Times critic Lori Rackl: \\"The episode is permeated with the first installment of the Italian poet's \\"Divine Comedy,\\" a three-part allegorical journey through the afterlife. Don is a '60s version of Dante, trapped in the depths of hell, searching for his Virgil to guide him along the virtuous path that leads to eternal paradise.\\" Rackl further observes, Don opens the scene by reading \\"a line from Dante's allegorical tale: 'Midway in our life's journey, I went astray from the straight road and woke to find myself alone in a dark wood,' he says.\\" She continues: \\"This opener dovetails with the season five finale, when a tempting female stranger in a dark bar asks Don that pivotal question: 'Are you alone?'\\" Some critics have noted the episode is structured around Don's sinful progression through the nine circles of hell. WSJ.coms Evangeline Morphos shares: \\"I‚Äôm afraid‚Äîand thrilled‚Äîthat this season will take us further into the rings of hell.\\" #Limbo - Don is on the beach. #Lust - Don has sex with Megan. #Gluttony - Don feasts and smokes marijuana. #Greed - Don wants to cut the maid's paycheck (hoard) and gives a free camera (squander). #Anger - Don angrily criticizes his copywriters' work (wrath) and gets drunk at the funeral (sullen). #Heresy - Don asks Jonesy about his after-death experience. #Violence - Don tries to advertise suicide. #Fraud - Don presents his perfect marriage to his neighbors. #Treachery - Don is in bed with Sylvia. Ears Because a comedian makes a tasteless joke on The Tonight Show about American servicemen's stringing Viet Cong soldiers' ears on necklaces, Peggy has to scrap her \\"Lend me your ears\\" headphones campaign. The soldiers he is referring to recall the Tiger Force, a task force of the United States Army, 1st Battalion (Airborne), 327th Infantry Regiment, 1st Brigade (Separate), 101st Airborne Division, which fought in the Vietnam War. The highly decorated unit, founded by Colonel David Hackworth in November 1965 to \\"outguerrilla the guerrillas\\", suffered heavy casualties. It was also investigated for allegedly committing numerous war crimes, including the one described by the comic, and were found guilty. Despite this, the Army decided not to pursue any prosecutions. The slogan borrows from the first line of Mark Antony's oft- quoted funeral oration from Act III, scene II of William Shakespeare's play, Julius Caesar. As WSJ.com editor Christopher John Farley notes: \\"Antony‚Äôs speech features lines that speak directly to some of the themes of 'Mad Men.'\\" Farley further observes: the phrase also pops up in The Beatles‚Äô 1967 song ‚ÄúWith a Little Help from My Friends\\". From Here to Eternity Roger alludes to From Here to Eternity (1953), which was set in Oahu, when he asks Don if, while in Hawaii, he was chased by Ernest Borgnine with a knife down an alley. In multiple episodes, including this one, Roger cites his own experience being stationed at Pearl Harbor before and during the 1941 attack. It's a Wonderful Life The soap opera in which Megan plays Corinne is set in Berkshire Falls. Karlan asks: \\"Is this a sly takeoff on the Bedford Falls of It's a Wonderful Life? Whose life, among our characters, is wonderful and who has abandoned wonder and hope?\\" Meditations in an Emergency WSJ.com editor Pamela S. Karlan is reminded of Don's reciting the following lines from Frank O'Hara's Meditations in an Emergency in Season 2: \\"Now I am quietly waiting for the catastrophe of my personality/to seem beautiful again,/and interesting, and modern‚Ä¶. It may be the coldest day of/the year, what does he think of that? I mean, what do I? And if I do,/perhaps I am myself again.\\" Super Bowl II In the episode, the headphone ad Peggy is working on is to air during the Super Bowl. Peggy comments that she thinks \\"it's gonna be Oakland or Houston against Green Bay.\\" Super Bowl II, played on January 14, 1968, was a match between the Oakland Raiders and the Green Bay Packers. Production \\"The Doorway\\"‚Äîa double-length episode which serves as the first two episodes of the season‚Äîwas written by series creator and showrunner Matthew Weiner and directed by executive producer Scott Hornbacher. Principal photography for the episode began in October 2012, with Jon Hamm and Jessica Par√© filming scenes in Hawaii. Weiner said of the premiere's structure: \\"it's really constructed like a film. It is its own story and hopefully it foreshadows the rest of the season.\\" Reception Critical response The episode was very well received by critics. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix called the premiere \\"thoughtful, moving and gorgeous in that 'Mad Men' way.\\" Lori Rackl of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote: \\"Packed with symbolism and cryptic, thought- provoking fodder, the sublime two-hour episode could be the subject of a college course. Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club graded the double episode \\"A-\\" and observed: \\"This is still one of TV‚Äôs best shows, still moving confidently and at the height of its powers, filled with great characters and terrific storytelling. It‚Äôs been on the air long enough now to have a rich, complicated history of its own, and watching it all spool out‚Äîboth as it happened and in the changed visages of the characters‚Äîcontinues to be one of TV‚Äôs chief pleasures. And always there are those objects and items, ghosts and totems of lives that once were. A cigarette lighter. A piece of office decoration that reminds one of sadly departed Lane. A copy of Dante‚Äôs Inferno. A set of skis. A seemingly non-descript Mason jar. Mad Men has always been about the relentless march of history, about the way that time waits for no man. Increasingly, though, it‚Äôs taking advantage of its own history, something that gives it a richness and depth most shows on TV barely even aspire to. And at its center are some of the greatest characters in TV history.\\" Critics also noted, however, the darkening nature of the show. For example, Michael Hogan of The Huffington Post observed early on in his episode review: \\"Man, that was one saddening episode of \\"Mad Men\\". He closed with: \\"Instead of alleviating our anxiety, 'Mad Men' dares to depict it, give it shape, rub our faces in it. We can't help loving Don and Roger, but look at what they do. Look at how they live. They're monsters. And they look an awful lot like us.\\" Ratings The original broadcast on April 7, 2013, was watched by an estimated 3.4 million viewers. The episode was down in viewership from the fifth-season premiere, which received 3.5 million viewers, but increased in viewership from the fifth-season finale, which attained 2.7 million viewers.

Constructed around 1534, the engenho was owned for most of its working life by the Schetz family. It is now a ruin, national monument and tourist destination.  Construction  The ruins of the factory, with a reconstructed roof Large-scale manufacturing of sugar in Brazil started with the 1532 expedition to S√£o Vicente, led by Martim Afonso de Sousa. The Engenho dos Erasmos sugar mill was probably constructed a few years later, around 1534 and was originally known as Engenho do Governador - the Governor's Mill. It was owned by Martim Afonso, Pero Lopes de Souza, Francisco Lobo, and Vicente Gon√ßalves, and was possibly the third such mill to be set up in Brazil, after Engenho da Madre de Deus in 1532 and Engenho de S√£o Jo√£o in 1533. It became the property of Erasmus II Schetz around 1540, via the commercial representatives Johan Van Hielst and Jo√£o Veniste. When Erasmus died in 1550 it passed to his son, Gaspard II Schetz and it was owned by successive generations of the Schetz family until the late 17th century, although they tried to sell it in 1593 and 1612. It produced sugar cane for export and domestic consumption, and operated until at least 1580, when there was increasing competition of sugar cane production from northeast Brazil and closed by the end of the 18th century. The site contained the factory, as well as administrative and accommodation buildings (including for the slaves). As well as the main building containing the factory, all under a single roof and powered by a water wheel, there was a blacksmith shop and two roofed houses. The site also had a chapel and a cemetery, and was dedicated to Saint George. Although often said to be built in Azorian style, it is based on the Madeiran mill style. The factory was attacked by Thomas Cavendish in 1591. In 1615, Joris van Spilbergen set fire to the factory, which destroyed most of its facilities.  Ruins  The ruins of the chapel The mill was abandoned in the 18th century and largely forgotten about until the 20th century. The site was owned by various families, including Braz Esteves, Pedrosa, G√≥is, Muniz Guimar√£es, Viana, Marques do Vale, Gra√ßa Martins and Toledo. In 1943 the land and the ruins were purchased by Ot√°vio Ribeiro de Ara√∫jo. He donated it to the Faculdade de Filosofia, Ci√™ncias e Letras in 1958 and it has been administered by the University of S√£o Paulo since then. While not much preservation work was carried out between 1958 and the end of the 1980s, this changed in the 1990s and 2000s, when archaeological excavations took place at the site. Over 2,000 fragments, including animal and human bones dating from the 16th century, were recovered during the excavations. The ruins are now a national monument, registered by IPHAN in 1963 and CONDEPHAAT in 1974.

A lifelong, dedicated communist, his career in the Austrian theater was first interrupted by the Second World War, and then strained by Cold War politics. In the 1950s he began working in East Germany, where he performed as an actor and directed plays and films. An actor trained in the school of Constantin Stanislavski, he is praised for the realism he brought to his performances especially in Johann Nestroy's plays and for his ability to organize large ensembles dynamically on the stage. He is remembered also for his work ethic and his fervent belief in the emancipatory power of the theater. Biography Paryla was born to working-class parents; his father was an instrument maker, and a lower officer and civil servant in the administration of Austria-Hungary. Born Catholic, he dropped his religious affiliation in 1922. He trained at the University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna, and began a career as an actor with the Raimund Theater in Vienna (some of his siblings, including Emil St√∂hr, also had theatrical careers) in 1924 and by 1926 was working in theaters in Germany, where he also became involved with communist workers' organizations. He was fired in Darmstadt in 1933 for political reasons and fled to Vienna, where he found work with the Theater in der Josefstadt. After the Anschluss he emigrated to Switzerland. During World War II In Zurich, he contributed to the reputation of the Schauspielhaus Z√ºrich as an anti-fascist exile theater, performing in original productions and stagings of classical plays, and he played a central part in the development of realistic drama based on the work of Constantin Stanislavski. He had over 90 roles at the Schauspielhaus, performing in classical tragedy (the titular character in Oedipus Rex) and comedy (Orgon in Tartuffe). He worked with Bertolt Brecht and played the role of Schweizerkas in the first performance of Brecht's Mother Courage and Her Children. After World War II ended he was one of the first actors to return to Vienna, in December 1945. After World War II With Wolfgang Heinz and Emil St√∂hr, Paryla was a founding member, from 1948 to 1956, of the \\"Neue Theater in der Scala\\", a \\"workers' theatre\\" financially supported by the Communist Party of Austria. The theater aimed to be a working man's group with a focus on the work of Austrian dramatist Johann Nestroy, on political drama, and on comedy, an unfavorable mix during the Cold War. While Vienna was still divided between the West and the Soviet Union, he also worked in cinema, at the Rosenh√ºgel Filmstudios. When the Soviets left Austria in 1955, he was blacklisted with many others who had worked for Rosenh√ºgel. In 1952 already he had been prevented by American pressure from participating in the Salzburg Festival, where he was an annual regular; Paryla was supposed to have performed in Jedermann. Like many blacklisted actors and directors, he went to work in East Germany and began making movies for DEFA; his first was Mich d√ºrstet, a film based on the Spanish Civil War. At the same time he continued to perform, in Berlin and Munich, with notable roles including Touchstone (As You Like It) and Mephistopheles (Faust), and above all as a Netroy actor. In 1966, he performed in Cologne in an adaptation of La Celestina. He died on 14 July 1996 in his native city, Vienna. Legacy Paryla was praised for his realism in acting, especially in Johann Nestroy's plays, and as a director for his dynamic mise-en-scene. Paryla is credited as one of the actors that made the Schauspielhaus Z√ºrich \\"the best theatre in Europe\\". He was one of the contributors to the \\"Nestroy Renaissance in Vienna\\"; under German occupation Nestroy was deemed \\"folkish\\" and German enough to be allowed on stage, and after the war Paryla was one of the actors/directors who reclaimed Nestroy‚Äîthis time, with a communist agenda (according to one critic), with Paryla stressing realism: \\"In our theater we play Nestroy in unadulterated form, that is forcefully; that also means that we do not permit false sentimentality or false compromise. We consider the production of each Nestroy comedy as the most honorable and most natural duty. And that is why we play Nestroy.\\" He is praised as lending a political realism to Nestrovian characters unparalleled in the 1950s. Paryla's relationship with Vienna was strained because of politics; official recognition from the city would not come until the 1980s and 90s. Personal life He was married to the German- born stage and film actress Hortense Raky from 1939 until his death.

The Abbasids were victorious, resulting in the capture and execution of the Qarmatian leadership. This weakened the Qarmatian presence in northern Syria, which was finally eradicated after the suppression of another revolt in 906. More importantly, it paved the way for the Abbasid attack on the autonomous Tulunid dynasty and the reincorporation of the Tulunid domains in southern Syria and Egypt into the Abbasid Caliphate. Background Map of Syria with its provinces and its major settlements in the 9th/10th centuries The Qarmatians were a radical Isma'ili Shi'ite sect founded in Kufa around 874 by a certain Hamdan Qarmat. They denounced mainstream Sunni Islam for practices they viewed as deviations from the true teachings of the religion, such as the hajj and the worship of the Kaaba, as well as the dwelling in cities and the marginalization of the Bedouin. Consequently, as they gained adherents, the Qarmatians began assaulting the neighbouring Muslim communities. Originally a sporadic and minor nuisance in the Sawad, their power grew swiftly to alarming proportions after 897, when they launched a series of uprisings against the Abbasid Caliphate. In this period, the Isma'ili movement was based at Salamiya on the western edge of the Syrian Desert, and its leadership was assumed by Sa'id ibn al-Husayn, the future founder of the Fatimid Caliphate. Sa'id's claims to be the awaited Mahdi caused a split in the movement in 899. The majority, including Hamdan Qarmat, rejected the Fatimid claims and left to continue their proselytization elsewhere. The missionary efforts of the Qarmatian movement were redirected beyond the Sawad and quickly bore fruit. Under the leadership of Abu Sa'id al-Jannabi, they seized Bahrayn in 899 and in the next year defeated a caliphal army under al-Abbas ibn Amr al-Ghanawi. Independently of al-Jannabi, another base was established in the area around Palmyra by the missionaries Yahya ibn Zikrawayh, known by the name Sahib al- Naqa (\\"Master of the She-camel\\") and al-Husayn, probably Yahya's brother, who took the name Sahib al-Shama (\\"Man with the Mole\\"). Both in Bahrayn and in Syria, the Qarmatians were able to convert many local Bedouin‚Äîthe Banu Kalb in Syria and the Banu Kilab and Banu Uqayl in Bahrayn‚Äîto their cause, thus acquiring a potent military force, albeit one with limitations: the Bedouin were more concerned with extracting booty from the settled communities, and were ill-suited to campaigns of conquering and holding territories. At this time, Sa'id and his followers soon left and travelled secretly to the Maghreb, where in 909 they would overthrow the ruling Aghlabids and establish the Fatimid state. From their base in the region around Palmyra, the Qarmatians began launching raids against the Abbasid and Tulunid provinces of Syria, with devastating effect. In 902, the Qarmatians defeated the Tulunids under Tughj ibn Juff near Raqqa, and laid siege to Damascus. The city was successfully held by Tughj and the Sahib al-Naqa was killed. Leadership passed to the Sahib al-Shama, who led the Qarmatians to ravage Homs, Hama, Ba'albek, Ma'arrat al- Numan, and even Salamiya, where they massacred the members of Sa'id's family that had remained there. The motivations of al-Husayn, Yahya, and their father, Zikrawayh ibn Mihrawayh, who remained in hiding in Iraq, have been variously interpreted by modern scholars. Traditionally this movement has been regarded as wholly Qarmatian in character, and Sa'id's flight from Salamiya a reaction to the threat they posed to him. In recent years, however, the argument of Heinz Halm has prevailed, according to which Zikrawayh and his sons remained loyal to Sa'id, and their actions aimed at securing possession of Syria and triggering a general rebellion against the Abbasids. Sa'id regarded the uprising as premature, and felt that it compromised his own safety. Not only did not join the brothers, despite their entreaties, but left Salamiya with his son and a few close supporters, first for Ramla in Palestine, and thence to Egypt and the Maghreb. It was only after this \\"betrayal\\" and the death of the Sahib al-Naqa that Salamiya was attacked by a grieving and enraged Sahib al-Shama; the movement then moved away from Fatimid loyalism and \\"acquired the characteristics of dissident Qarmatism\\". Battle In view of the apparent impotence of the Tulunid regime to stop the Qarmatian raids, the Syrians called upon the Abbasid government to intervene directly, and on 30 July 903, Caliph al-Muktafi commanded that a campaign be undertaken. The campaign was nominally headed by al-Muktafi in person, who left Baghdad on 9 August and went to Raqqa. In mid-August, the Qarmatians under a certain al- Mutawwaq surprised an Abbasid army some 10,000 strong near Aleppo, while it was resting and dispersed, with many troops seeking to escape the intense heat in a local river; the Abbasid troops were routed, and only about a thousand managed to reach the city, where, under the command of Abu al-Agharr, they repulsed the Qarmatian attacks. At about the same time, however, the general Badr al-Hammami inflicted a heavy defeat on the Sahib al-Shama and his men near Damascus. The Qarmatians fled to the desert, and Caliph al-Muktafi sent men under al-Husayn ibn Hamdan to pursue them. While al-Muktafi remained at Raqqa, command of the army in the field was given to the head of the department of the army (dƒ´wƒÅn al-jund), Muhammad ibn Sulayman al-Katib. On Tuesday, 29 November 903, the Abbasid army under Muhammad met the Qarmatians at a location some 24 km from Hama. The course of the battle is described in a victory dispatch sent by Muhammad to the caliph afterwards and included in the History of the Prophets and Kings of al-Tabari. According to the latter, on the morning of 29 November, the Abbasid army set out from al-Qarwanah towards al-Alyanah‚Äîboth unidentified locations‚Äîdeployed in full battle order. During the march, Muhammad ibn Sulayman received a report that a part of the Qarmatian army, comprising 3,000 horse and many foot under one of the chief missionaries (dƒÅ'ƒ´), al-Nu'man, had encamped at a locality some 12 Arabic miles (ca. 24 km) from Hama, and that the other detachments of the Qarmatian army had joined him there. Muhammad led his army towards the Qarmatian encampment, and found them deployed in battle array. According to the report of Muhammad, the Qarmatian left wing was led by Masrur al-Ulaymi and others, in charge of 1,500 horsemen. Behind the left wing was placed a reserve force of 400 cavalry. The Qarmatian centre was commanded by al-Nu'man al-Ullaysi and other officers, and comprised 1,400 cavalry and 3,000 infantry, while the right wing was commanded by Kulayb al-Ullaysi and others and numbered 1,400 horsemen, with a reserve force of 200 horsemen more. As the two armies advanced on each other, the Qarmatian left thrust forward against the Abbasid right, which was commanded by al-Husayn ibn Hamdan. The troops of Ibn Hamdan repulsed the first Qarmatian attack, and then the second, killing 600 horsemen. The Qarmatians on the left broke and fled; Ibn Hamdan and his men pursued them and in a series of engagements killed all but 200 of them. Ibn Hamdan's troops reportedly captured 500 horses and 400 silver necklaces as well. The Qarmatian right wing likewise attacked the Abbasid left, held by al- Qasim ibn Sima, Yumn al-Khadim, and the tribal allies of Banu Shayban and Banu Tamim. While the two wings were grappling with each other, an Abbasid detachment under Khalifah ibn al-Mubarak and Lu'lu' attacked the Qarmatians on their flank and broke their lines. Here too the Qarmatians fled pursued by the government forces, who took some 600 horses and 200 necklaces as booty. Muhammad himself confronted the Qarmatian centre along with several other officers: Khaqan, Nasr al-Qushuri, and Muhammad ibn Kumushjur led forces from the right flank, Wasf Mushgir, Muhammad ibn Ishaq ibn Kundajiq, Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh and his brother Ibrahim, al-Mubarak al-Qummi, Rabi'a ibn Muhammad, Muhajir ibn Tulayq, al-Muzaffar ibn Hajj, Abdallah ibn Hamdan (al-Husayn's brother), Jinni the Elder, Wasif al-Buktamir, Bishr al-Buktamiri, and Muhammad ibn Qaratughan. With the support of troops from the right wing, who after repelling the Qarmatian left flanked the Qarmatian centre, the Abbasids were victorious here as well. The Qarmatians broke and were pursued over several miles. Muhammad ibn Sulayman, fearful lest his army disperse itself during the pursuit, or leave the infantry and the baggage train‚Äîguarded by Isa ibn Muhammad al-Nushari‚Äîexposed to a Qarmatian attack, halted the pursuit of his own detachment after half a mile. He set up camp there for the night, and with the Caliph's spear as a rallying point, began regrouping the various squadrons. Despite the overwhelming victory, Muhammad and his officers remained on guard during the night, concerned of a possible Qarmatian attack. Several Qarmatian commanders, including the dƒÅ'ƒ´ al-Nu'man, were killed, while the Sahib al-Shama along with his cousin al-Muddathir, his associate al- Muttawaq and a Greek page fled through the desert, trying to reach Kufa. By the time they reached the locality of al-Daliyah on the Euphrates Road near al-Rahba, they had run out of supplies. When a servant was sent to buy provisions in the settlement, he aroused the suspicions of the villagers with his strange dress and manner, so that they notified a local official, Abu Khubzah. The latter rode out with an escort, and after interrogating the servant went to the Qarmatians' camp and took them prisoner. They captured the Sahib al-Shama and his companions were then escorted by Abu Khubzah and the local governor, Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Kushmard, to Caliph al-Muktafi in Raqqa, which they entered on 19 December. Aftermath Al-Muktafi returned to Baghdad with the senior captives, who were thrown into prison. Muhammad ibn Sulayman remained at Raqqa to scour the countryside and round up the remaining rebels. He too then returned to Baghdad, which he entered in triumph on 2 February 904. Eleven days later, on 13 February, Muhammad and the sahib al- shurta of the capital, Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Wathiqi, presided over the public execution of the Qarmatian leaders and Qarmatian sympathizers rounded up from Kufa and Baghdad. The Abbasid victory near Hama did not yet fully eradicate the Qarmatians from the area; in 906, the Banu Kalb, under the Qarmatian Abu Ghanim Nasr, rose up in rebellion, raided the Hawran and Tiberias, and launched a failed attack on Damascus. They then sacked Tiberias and plundered Hit on the Euphrates. Nasr was soon cornered by the caliphal army, however, and killed by the Banu Kalb themselves in exchange for pardon. As a result, the Qarmatian activities shifted east to the Euphrates, where Zikrawayh ibn Mihrawayh (the father of al-Husayn and Yahya) had also rebelled in 906 near Kufa. After leading an unsuccessful attack on Kufa and number of devastating raids on hajj caravans, he too was killed in early 907 by caliphal troops under Wasif ibn Sawartakin near al-Qadisiyya. With these defeats, the Qarmatian movement virtually ceased to exist in the Syrian Desert, although their counterparts in Bahrayn remained an active threat for several decades to come. More importantly, the defeat of the Qarmatians at Hama opened the way for the Abbasids to recover the provinces of southern Syria and Egypt, held by the Tulunids. The Tulunid regime had become enfeebled due to internal strife, rivalries and the defection of senior officers, and the recent failures against the Qarmatians. In 904, Muhammad ibn Sulayman led an army into Syria. The campaign met with little opposition; the Tulunid emir Harun ibn Khumarawayh was even assassinated by his uncles, whereupon several senior commanders switched sides. The Abbasids entered the Egyptian capital Fustat in January 905 without a fight, completing the reconquest of the province.

Joseph Sylvester O'Halloran, ca. 1875 Career in Australia O'Halloran was born at Adelaide, South Australia, was the son of Captain William Littlejohn O'Halloran and his wife Eliza Minton O'Halloran. He was educated at private schools, and entered the South Australian Civil Service, receiving his first appointment from Sir Richard Graves MacDonnell, the then Governor. After passing ten years in the Audit Office, and rising to the third position in that department, he was promoted to the clerkship of the Executive Council, being at the same time gazetted Clerk to the Court of Appeals. These offices he retained until 1871, and, in addition, acted for a while as private secretary to the Right Hon. Sir James Fergusson, 6th Baronet, Governor of the colony. In consequence of certain reductions in the estimates, which involved several departmental changes, O'Halloran retired from the Government service in 1871, with compensation for loss of office, the Governor in Council recording his testimony to the honourable manner in which he had discharged his duties. Soon after his retirement O'Halloran came to England, was elected a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and of the Royal Colonial Institute, and found occupation in the city of London, where he filled secretarial appointments for a period extending over seven years. In 1872 he acted‚Äîin conjunction with Dr. C. W. Eddy‚Äîas honorary secretary and a member of the committee for celebrating the opening of telegraphic communication with Australia. Later career In 1873 he proceeded to New Zealand, and travelled through both islands, collecting information in connection with some elaborate investigations which had been conducted in London with a view to the application of an improved process for the extraction of the fibre of the Phormium tenax. He visited the Cape of Good Hope in 1877, and in the succeeding year revisited Australia. In April 1881 he was appointed assistant-secretary and librarian of the Royal Colonial Institute, and in December 1883 was promoted to the position of secretary. In 1882 he proceeded to North-Western Canada, which was then attracting much attention, for the purpose of acquainting himself with its capabilities as a field for settlement. In 1884 he again visited Canada, attending the Montreal meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science as one of the secretaries to the Geographical Section, the president of which section publicly acknowledged his services. Before returning to England he made an extended tour through Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island. In 1885 he attended the Aberdeen meeting, again undertaking the secretaryship of Section E. Mr. O'Halloran was a member of the London committee of the Jubilee Exhibition held at Adelaide in 1887. He was married, at the parish church, Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England, on 17 August 1886, to Alice Mary, daughter of the Henry Simpson, of \\"Ridge Park\\", Glen Osmond, South Australia. On his retirement from the secretaryship of the Institute in 1909 Mr. O'Halloran was made an honorary Fellow, and continued to take a keen interest in the work of the Institute. O'Halloran was a contributor to the Dictionary of National Biography (as J. S. O'H). He died in Cheltenham, England. Edward White O'Halloran, Adelaide solicitor, was a brother.

Biography Abraham Aronow was born in Brooklyn, New York City and grew up in New Haven, Connecticut. He graduated from James Hillhouse High School, received his BS at MIT, and his MD at Harvard Medical School. He served as an intern at New York's Bellevue Hospital, and as a commissioned officer in the United States Public Health Service for two years. In 1969 he testified before the Senate Committee on the District of Columbia, recommending the establishment of Federal centers, similar to methadone clinics, to freely distribute narcotics, stating \\"Most addicts, if assured of a regular supply of drugs, would not be motivated to commit violent crimes.\\" That year he and his wife Alice moved to San Francisco, where they have lived ever since. He served as a Clinical Instructor and Assistant Clinical Professor at the UCSF School of Medicine in the 1970s. Aronow continued to work as a physician until his retirement in 2007. Photography Aronow's father was an amateur photographer and instructed him in the art at an early age. In 1981, while working at Ralph K. Davies Medical Center, one of his patients was the famous landscape photographer Ansel Adams. The two talked extensively, and Adams later invited Aronow to a filming session attended by the surviving members of Group f/64 and other photographers such as Beaumont Newhall. This was the start of a decades-long project in which Abe Aronow made portraits of prominent photographers and other figures. He initially took many of these using artificial lights and strobes, and transitioned to mostly natural lighting in the 2000s. His collection currently consists of over 1,200 such photographs, including portraits of Edmund Teske, Oliver Gagliani, Morley Baer, Ernst Haas, Aaron Siskind, Ruth Bernhard, Andr√© Kert√©sz, Roy DeCarava, Barbara Morgan, and Yousuf Karsh. In 2007, Aronow's photographs were featured in the documentary film Black White + Gray: A Portrait of Sam Wagstaff and Robert Mapplethorpe.

It is flattened and eyeless, resembling a flea or tick. It used to be placed in a separate family called Leptinidae, but is now placed in the family Leiodidae, in the subfamily Platypsyllinae. Description The beaver beetle has various modifications to suit its ectoparasitic mode of life. It resembles a flea or a louse in appearance and was originally placed in the flea family Platypsyllidae. It has no wings and no eyes, and its antennal clubs have the antennomeres numbered 3 to 11 shortened, compacted globularly, and partly enclosed in a scoop-shaped antennomere. The larvae are also ectoparasitic on beavers and have hooks on the three thoracic segments which enable it to cling to its host.  Distribution  The beetle exists only in the northern hemisphere (holarctic) and is restricted to areas in which beavers are found, North America and northern Europe and Asia. Behaviour Besides the North American beaver (Castor canadensis) and the Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber), the only other host on which this beetle has been found is the North American river otter (Lontra canadensis), and this was only on one occasion. It is hypothesized that the otter may have picked up the parasite when it entered a beaver lodge or perhaps killed a young beaver, a thing that otters are believed to do on occasion. Both adult beetles and larvae feed on epidermal tissue, and also perhaps on skin secretions and liquids oozing from wounds. It is possible that the larvae may also act as scavengers in the beaver lodge.

Yaakoub admitted to being a member of the Shi'a Islamic militant group Hezbollah, who had been tasked with surveilling the activities of Israeli tourists on the island. Israel condemned the incident as an attempted terrorist attack. Background In the months preceding the disruption of the terrorist plot in Cyprus, Hezbollah and Iran were implicated in terrorist attacks and plots against Israeli targets in Thailand, India, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Kenya. On July 18, eleven days after Yaakoub was arrested, five Israeli tourists and a Bulgarian citizen were killed in a suicide bombing in Burgas, Bulgaria. The Bulgarian government implicated Hezbollah in the attack. Arrest On July 7, 2012, Cypriot authorities arrested Hossam Yaakoub, a Lebanese-born Swedish citizen, in the port city of Limassol. After intensive questioning, Yaakoub admitted that he was a member of Hezbollah. Yaakoub had arrived in Cyrpus as a tourist on July 5. Prior to his arrest, he was tracking the movement of Israeli tourists on the island. On July 6, he surveilled the arrival of Israeli tourists on an Arkia Airlines flight from Tel Aviv to Larnaca International Airport. Hezbollah had tasked Yaakoub with monitoring charter flights from Israel to Cyprus since late 2011. He recorded flight information and wrote down the registration numbers of shuttle buses the passengers boarded. In between flights, he carried out surveillance of the resort hotels that Israelis frequented. His surveillance data noted the security presence at the hotels and their proximity to local emergency services. He also photographed hotel entrances and parking lots. In a sworn deposition, Yaakoub told police, \\"I was just collecting information about the Jews. This is what my organization is doing, everywhere in the world.\\" Information provided by Israeli intelligence to Cyprus that Yaakoub intended to carry out attacks led to his arrest. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the incident as an \\"attempted terrorist attack by Hezbollah against an Israeli target... conducted under Iran's auspices.\\" Trial On March 21, 2013, a three-judge panel in Cyprus convicted Yaakoub on five of eight charges, \\"including participation in a criminal organization, planning to commit a crime and money laundering.\\" On March 28, the court sentenced Yaakoub to four years in prison. During the sentencing, the judges stated, \\"There is no doubt these are serious crimes which could have potentially endangered Israeli citizens and targets in the republic.\\" The conviction of Yaakoub, in tandem with the Bulgarian government's declaration that Hezbollah was behind the July 2012 Burgas bus bombing, has increased the pressure on the European Union to designate Hezbollah a terrorist organization. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said that the conviction of the Hezbollah operative in Cyprus \\"underscores the need for our European allies ‚Äî and other governments around the world ‚Äî to crack down on this deadly group.\\" See also *2012 attacks on Israeli diplomats *2012 Burgas bus bombing References Category:Terrorist incidents in Asia in 2012 Category:Terrorist incidents in Europe in 2012 Category:2012 crimes in Cyprus Category:2013 in Cyprus Category:Hezbollah Category:Islamic terrorism in Europe Category:Terrorist incidents in Cyprus Category:Iran‚ÄìIsrael proxy conflict ","title":"2012 Cyprus terrorist plot"},{"id":"39046825","text":"The Environmental Trust is an independent statutory body in the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW) whose main activity is as a funding body for projects that aim to improve the environment of the state.

Overview The parish church of Dryfesdale, located in the centre of Lockerbie, was dedicated to St Cuthbert. In 1116 it belonged to the See of Galloway.Infos at canmore.rcahms.gov.uk The civil parish of Dryfesdale includes the town of Lockerbie which has apparently existed since at least the days of Viking influence in this part of Scotland in the period around AD 900. The name means Lockard's Farm in Old Norse. The presence of the remains of a Roman camp a mile to the west of the town suggests its origins may be even earlier. Lockerbie first entered recorded history, as Lokardebi, in 1306. Strong old towers were at Netherplace, Old Walls, Kirkton Mains, Myrehead and Daltonhook. Remains of eight camps, some square or Roman, others circular or Caledonian, occur in different places, chiefly on hilltops. Two of them, Roman and Caledonian, confront each other on hills to the north east of Bengall village.Parish of Dryfesdale Pan Am Flight 103 Dryfesdale Cemetery has the main UK memorial to the victims of the bombing Pan Am Flight 103, which occurred on 21 December 1988, over the town of Lockerbie.

His novels were adapted into several notable films of the 1950s, such as Rififi, Razzia sur la chnouf, Le rouge est mis and Le clan des siciliens. He wrote the dialogue for the noir film Bob le flambeur. Biography Auguste Le Breton was born in Finist√®re, Brittany. His childhood name was Auguste Monfort. Tragedy struck early in his life. Before his birth, his father had died in the First World War. His mother then disappeared. Being an orphan, Le Breton acquired the status of ward of the nation and so was housed in state institutions. Growing up in these institutions wasn't easy. He got into trouble regularly. He had to be put in remand homes frequently. When he lived in Paris, his haunts were disreputable places of the capital, bars and gambling dens. He even spent time with the gangs of Montmartre, acquainting himself with the crime world. He himself, however, was never involved in any serious crime. There can be no doubt that this semi-criminal life of his had a vast influence on his writings, enlivening them with the accuracy that only experience can bring. Rebel and writer For uncertain reasons, Le Breton joined the Resistance during the Second World War. It has been speculated that it was the Vichy's anti-gambling laws that made Le Breton turn against the regime. It is certain that he aided others involved in the Resistance to elude Vichy and the Germans. It was for such contributions that he was awarded the Croix de guerre and the Resistance medal. Involvement in the Resistance marked a metamorphosis in Le Breton's life. Perhaps spurred on by his selfless actions during the war, he began to write. A few years later he married, another pivotal point in his life. Le Breton stated that he would write books for children, if he had any. He planned to write a memoir of his life as an orphan, his rootless childhood, the life of penury and visiting disreputable places like bars and brothels. Autobiography When Le Breton's daughter Mary-Yvonne was born, he lived up to his words and wrote his autobiography. Entitled Les Hauts Murs, the book was successful. It was a poignant book, filled with anecdotal episodes from Le Breton's time in the orphanages, remand homes and prisons. Le Breton described in detail his friends and acquaintances from the bars, brothels and gangs of Paris. Style Le Breton's works are known for their directness of style and story. His other strength was his mastery of language, especially of French slang. This gave his works, most of which were about criminals, an authenticity and accuracy. Film adaptations Le Breton wrote 77 novels, many of which were adapted into films. His books were mostly about low life. Although his tales lack plot expertise, his characters and unique language made them hugely popular. They were made into successful films like Du rififi chez les hommes (Rififi means 'fisticuffs' or 'fight'). The film was directed by Jules Dassin and starred Jean Servais as Tony, the mastermind of a daring jewel heist.

during which time the per acre prices (in 2012 dollars) in the future Chicago Loop increased from $800 in 1830 to $327,000 in 1836, before falling to $38,000 per acre by 1841. The Bank of Illinois began foreclosing on large amounts of real estate in the aftermath of the bust before it declared bankruptcy in 1842.  Background  Until the widespread use of railroads, water access was critical to trade; it typically cost as much to move goods 30 miles over land as to ship them across the Atlantic Ocean.Will, George F., \\"National Transportation Debate in a Nutshell: Infrastructure Is Economic Destiny.\\" The Philadelphia Inquirer. Available at http://articles.philly.com/1990-03-12/news/25904448_1_infrastructure- population-growth-gnp. As a result, land near shipping routes and key ports was extremely valuable. The opening of the Erie Canal in 1825 caused economic booms throughout the Great Lakes region by opening eastern and European markets to Midwestern farm products, while also allowing for efficient transportation of finished goods and immigrants to the Great Lakes. Chicago, occupying the southwestern terminus of the area accessible by the Erie Canal and providing the easiest portage to the Mississippi River System, would benefit tremendously. Chicago would later name streets Canal and Clinton (for canal proponent DeWitt Clinton) in honor of the commercial importance of the canal to its economy. Chicago had been recognized since Louis Joliet in the 17th century as a strategic portage site at the junction of the Mississippi River System and the Great Lakes. In 1835, the State of Illinois committed to eliminate the need for portage and to dig the Illinois and Michigan Canal. With its completion, Chicago would become a major focal point of the United States' transportation network. At this time, the Illinois state government appears to have intended to further boost real estate through aggressive lending practices.Hoyt, Homer. 1933. One Hundred Years of Land Values in Chicago. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press. Because the Bank of Illinois was beholden to state policy, and because the state legislature forced the bank to support real estate, Homer Hoyt, land economist and real estate appraiser, believes that the Bank of Illinois may not have been charging appropriate interest rates given the probability of default. While furthering the speculative bubble, these low rates increased the risks at the Bank of Illinois, as well as other Illinois banks that followed the Bank of Illinois' lead.  Boom and Bust  As a result of these factors, prices for land in the Chicago Loop rose from essentially nothing in 1830 ($800 per acre in 2012 dollars) to New York levels by 1836 ($327,000 per acre in 2012 dollars), a 40,775% increase, with even higher prices around Dearborn Avenue and the Chicago River.Glaeser, Edward L., A Nation of Gamblers: Real Estate Speculation and American History (working paper). Retrieved April 7, 2013 from http://www.hks.harvard.edu/var/ezp_site/storage/fckeditor/file/pdfs/centers- programs/centers/taubman/working_papers/Glaeser_Ely.pdf. Furthermore, Illinois in general experienced a huge boom in real estate prices and town foundations. Walters estimates that the foundations of 1/3 of all towns ever created in central Illinois occurred between 1835 and 1837.Walters, William D. 2010. Selling Location: Illinois Town Advertisements, 1835‚Äì1837. Department of Geography-Geology, Illinois State University. Available at http://geo.illinoisstate.edu/downloads/walters_towns.pdf. In 1837, there was widespread panic due to credit tightening from England. On May 29, 1837, as depositors began to withdraw money en masse, Illinois banks suspended payments. As these banks fell into bankruptcy, Illinois' internal improvements, like the canals that were supposed to be financed by the banks, stopped. This led to considerable uncertainty as to Chicago's future, and combined with a general lack of credit, caused Chicago real estate prices to fall approximately 88% from their peak by 1841.  Aftermath  The Illinois and Michigan Canal was finally completed in 1848, connecting Chicago to the Mississippi River and fulfilling the expectations of the original investors. By 1856, even Chicago Loop property that had been purchased at the height of the bubble still yielded a 3.6% annualized return. Statewide, the results were worse, with 2/3 of all Illinois towns founded during the boom abandoned or never occupied, while town foundations came to an abrupt halt and did not begin again until the 1850s.  Analysis  Edward Glaeser, professor of economics at Harvard, notes that the Chicago property bubble was more a product of unpredictability than irrationality. Given the risk that Chicago might not become the transportation hub of the Midwest, values immediately after the crash appear justifiable. And even at the peak of the bubble, Chicago's prospects looked especially bright: land values in 1836 made sense given the defensible assumption that Chicago prices would rise to a quarter of those in New York City.Betting the House. 2013.

The museum is also responsible for archives, photographs, and objects related to the city's five historic sites: John Colpitts Ainsley House (a historic house museum), Campbell Union Grammar School (now part of the Heritage Village Offices), Campbell Union High School Historic District (now part of the Campbell Community Center), Galindo-Leigh House, and the Earl and Virginia Young House (now both private residencies).  Collection  The Campbell Historical Museum is a repository for over 10,000 items across three collections areas: the museum collection, an education collection, and a reference collection. The museum does accept item donations.  Exhibits  As of November 2019, the Campbell Historical Museum has four primary exhibits. There are three temporary exhibits and one permanent exhibit in the museum. The museum's current exhibits are: * Connecting a Nation - Mail: The First Social Network * Parades and Festivals: Connecting Communities * Key Ingredients * General Store (Permanent)  Education  The Campbell Historical Museum, in conjunction with the Ainsley House, host education programs for local elementary students throughout the school year. The Campbell Historical Museum's education program is called Hands On History. This program allows students to explore the history of Campbell and Santa Clara County through four interactive exhibit stations: Community, Home Life, Recreation, and Work.

The hypothesis is based on the observation that lactate is formed and utilized continuously in diverse cells under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions. Further, lactate produced at sites with high rates of glycolysis and glycogenolysis can be shuttled to adjacent or remote sites including heart or skeletal muscles where the lactate can be used as a gluconeogenic precursor or substrate for oxidation. In addition to its role as a fuel source predominantly in the muscles, heart, brain, and liver, the lactate shuttle hypothesis also relates the role of lactate in redox signalling, gene expression, and lipolytic control. These additional roles of lactate have given rise to the term ‚Äòlactormone‚Äô, pertaining to the role of lactate as a signalling hormone. Lactate and the Cori cycle Prior to the formation of the lactate shuttle hypothesis, lactate had long been considered a byproduct resulting from glucose breakdown through glycolysis in times of anaerobic metabolism. As a means of regenerating oxidized NAD+, lactate dehydrogenase catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to lactate in the cytosol, oxidizing NADH to NAD+, regenerating the necessary substrate needed to continue glycolysis. Lactate is then transported from the peripheral tissues to the liver by means of the Cori Cycle where it is reformed into pyruvate through the reverse reaction using lactate dehydrogenase. By this logic, lactate was traditionally considered a toxic metabolic byproduct that could give rise to fatigue and muscle pain during times of anaerobic respiration. Lactate was essentially payment for ‚Äòoxygen debt‚Äô defined by Hill and Lupton as the ‚Äòtotal amount of oxygen used, after cessation of exercise in recovery therefrom‚Äô. Cell-cell role of the lactate shuttle In addition to Cori Cycle, the lactate shuttle hypothesis proposes complementary functions of lactate in multiple tissues. Contrary to the long-held belief that lactate is formed as a result of oxygen- limited metabolism, substantial evidence exists that suggests lactate is formed under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, as a result of substrate supply and equilibrium dynamics. Tissue use (brain, heart, muscle) During physical exertion or moderate intensity exercise lactate released from working muscle and other tissue beds is the primary fuel source for the heart, exiting the muscles through monocarboxylate transport protein (MCT). This evidence is supported by an increased amount of MCT shuttle proteins in the heart and muscle in direct proportion to exertion as measured through muscular contraction. Furthermore, both neurons and astrocytes have been shown to express MCT proteins, suggesting that the lactate shuttle may be involved in brain metabolism. Astrocytes express MCT4, a low affinity transporter for lactate (Km = 35mM), suggesting its function is to export lactate produced by glycolysis. Conversely, neurons express MCT2, a high affinity transporter for lactate (Km = 0.7mM). Thus, it is hypothesized that the astrocytes produce lactate which is then taken up by the adjacent neurons and oxidized for fuel. Intracellular role of the lactate shuttle The lactate shuttle hypothesis also explains the balance of lactate production in the cytosol, via glycolysis or glycogenolysis, and lactate oxidation in the mitochondria (described below). Peroxisomes MCT2 transporters within the peroxisome function to transport pyruvate into the peroxisome where it is reduced by peroxisomal LDH (pLDH) to lactate. In turn, NADH is converted to NAD+, regenerating this necessary component for subsequent Œ≤-oxidation. Lactate is then shuttled out of the peroxisome via MCT2, where it is oxidized by cytoplasmic LDH (cLDH) to pyruvate, generating NADH for energy use and completing the cycle (see figure). Mitochondria While the cytosolic fermentation pathway of lactate is well established, a novel feature of the lactate shuttle hypothesis is the oxidation of lactate in the mitochondria. Baba and Sherma (1971) were the first to identify the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the mitochondrial inner membrane and matrix of rat skeletal and cardiac muscle. Subsequently, LDH was found in the rat liver, kidney, and heart mitochondria. It was also found that lactate could be oxidized as quickly as pyruvate in rat liver mitochondria. Because lactate can either be oxidized in the mitochondria (back to pyruvate for entry into the Krebs‚Äô cycle, generating NADH in the process), or serve as a gluconeogenic precursor, the intracellular lactate shuttle has been proposed to account for the majority of lactate turnover in the human body (as evidenced by the slight increases in arterial lactate concentration). Brooks et al. confirmed this in 1999, when they found that lactate oxidation exceeded that of pyruvate by 10-40% in rat liver, skeletal, and cardiac muscle. In 1990, Roth and Brooks found evidence for the facilitated transporter of lactate, monocarboxylate transport protein (MCT), in the sarcolemma vesicles of rat skeletal muscle. Later, MCT1 was the first of the MCT super family to be identified. The first four MCT isoforms are responsible for pyruvate/lactate transport. MCT1 was found to be the predominant isoform in many tissues including skeletal muscle, neurons, erthrocytes, and sperm. In skeletal muscle, MCT1 is found in the membranes of the sarcolemma, peroxisome, and mitochondria. Because of the mitochondrial localization of MCT (to transport lactate into the mitochondria), LDH (to oxidize the lactate back to pyruvate), and COX (cytochrome c oxidase, the terminal element of the electron transport chain), Brooks et al. proposed the possibility of a mitochondrial lactate oxidation complex in 2006. This is supported by the observation that the ability of muscle cells to oxidize lactate was related to the density of mitochondria. Furthermore, it was shown that training increases MCT1 protein levels in skeletal muscle mitochondria, and that corresponded with an increase in the ability of muscle to clear lactate from the body during exercise. The affinity of MCT for pyruvate is greater than lactate, however two reactions will ensure that lactate will be present in concentrations that are orders of magnitude greater than pyruvate: first, the equilibrium constant of LDH(3.6 x 104) greatly favors the formation of lactate. Secondly, the immediate removal of pyruvate from the mitochondria (either via the Krebs‚Äô cycle or gluconeogenesis) ensures that pyruvate is not present in great concentrations within the cell. LDH isoenzyme expression is tissue-dependent. It was found that in rats, LDH-1 was the predominant form in the mitochondria of myocardium, but LDH-5 was predominant in the liver mitochondria. It is suspected that this difference in isoenzyme is due to the predominant pathway the lactate will take - in liver it is more likely to be gluconeogenesis, whereas in the myocardium it is more likely to be oxidation. Despite these differences, it is thought that the redox state of the mitochondria dictates the ability of the tissues to oxidize lactate, not the particular LDH isoform. Lactate as a signaling molecule: ‚Äòlactormone‚Äô Redox signaling As illustrated by the peroxisomal intracellular lactate shuttle described above, the interconversion of lactate and pyruvate between cellular compartments plays a key role in the oxidative state of the cell. Specifically, the interconversion of NAD+ and NADH between compartments has been hypothesized to occur in the mitochondria. However, the evidence for this is lacking, as both lactate and pyruvate are quickly metabolized inside the mitochondria. However, the existence of the peroxisomal lactate shuttle suggests that this redox shuttle could exist for other organelles. Gene expression Increased intracellular levels of lactate can act as a signalling hormone, inducing changes in gene expression that will upregulate genes involved in lactate removal. These genes include MCT1, cytochrome c oxidase (COX), and other enzymes involved in the lactate oxidation complex. Additionally, lactate will increase levels of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1-Œ±), suggesting that lactate stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis. Control of lipolysis In addition to the role of the lactate shuttle in supplying NAD+ substrate for Œ≤-oxidation in the peroxisomes, the shuttle also regulates FFA mobilization by controlling plasma lactate levels. Research has demonstrated that lactate functions to inhibit lipolysis in fat cells through activation of an orphan G-protein couple receptor (GPR81) that acts as a lactate sensor, inhibiting lipolysis in response to lactate . Role of lactate during exercise As found by Brooks, et al., while lactate is disposed of mainly through oxidation and only a minor fraction supports gluconeogenesis, lactate is the main gluconeogenic precursor during sustained exercise. Brooks demonstrated in his earlier studies that little difference in lactate production rates were seen in trained and untrained subjects at equivalent power outputs. What was seen, however, was more efficient clearance rates of lactate in the trained subjects suggesting an upregulation of MCT protein. Local lactate use depends on exercise exertion. During rest, approximately 50% of lactate disposal take place through lactate oxidation whereas in time of strenuous exercise (50-75% VO2 max) approximately 75-80% of lactate is used by the active cell, indicating lactate‚Äôs role as a major contributor to energy conversion during increased exercise exertion. Clinical significance Highly malignant tumors rely heavily on anaerobic glycolysis (metabolism of glucose to lactic acid even under ample tissue oxygen; Warburg effect) and thus need to efflux lactic acid via MCTs to the tumor micro-environment to maintain a robust glycolytic flux and to prevent the tumor from being \\"pickled to death\\". The MCTs have been successfully targeted in pre-clinical studies using RNAi and a small-molecule inhibitor alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (ACCA; CHC) to show that inhibiting lactic acid efflux is a very effective therapeutic strategy against highly glycolytic malignant tumors.Colen, CB, PhD Thesis (2005) http://elibrary.wayne.edu/record=b3043899~S47 In some tumor types, growth and metabolism relies on the exchange of lactate between glycolytic and rapidly respiring cells. This is of particular importance during tumor cell development when cells often undergo anaerobic metabolism, as described by the Warburg effect. Other cells in the same tumor may have access to or recruit sources of oxygen (via angiogenesis), allowing it to undergo aerobic oxidation. The lactate shuttle could occur as the hypoxic cells anaerobically metabolize glucose and shuttle the lactate via MCT to the adjacent cells capable of using the lactate as a substrate for oxidation. Investigation into how MCT-mediated lactate exchange in targeted tumor cells can be inhibited, therefore depriving cells of key energy sources, could lead to promising new chemotherapeutics. Additionally, lactate has been shown to be a key factor in tumor angiogenesis. Lactate promotes angiogenesis by upregulating HIF-1 in endothelial cells. Thus a promising target of cancer therapy is the inhibition of lactate export, through MCT-1 blockers, depriving developing tumors of an oxygen source.

Along with a Bronze Star and Silver Star, Shay was also awarded the Legion d'Honneur, making him the first Native American in Maine with the distinction of French chevalier. He was instrumental in the re-publishing of a book by his own grandfather, Joseph Nicolar: The Life and Traditions of the Red Man, originally published in 1893. He has recently written an autobiography, Project Omaha Beach: The Life and Military Service of a Penobscot Indian Elder that details his time abroad in the military. Shay is also a direct descendant of Jean-Vincent d'Abbadie de Saint-Castin. World War II Shay was drafted into the military in 1943 at the age of 19. He was selected for training as a medical technician and learned basic surgery skills. Shay joined the Medical Detachment of the First Division's (the \\"Big Red One\\") 16th Infantry Regiment and was attached as a platoon medic to Fox Company. As a combat medic, Shay treated as many of his wounded comrades as possible ‚Äì bandaging wounds, applying tourniquets, applying makeshift splints, administering morphine] or otherwise trying to make the wounded soldiers as comfortable as possible. Shay pulled several struggling soldiers from the rising tide, saving many immobilized wounded from drowningShay (2012), pp. 13‚Äì14 during the first wave of the landing of Omaha Beach on D-Day. Prins and McBride (2019) He was also present helping the fallen at the Battles of Aachen, Huertgen Forest, and the Ardennes (Battle of the Bulge). Shay was later attached to a reconnaissance squadron moving into the small farming village of Auel near the Sieg River in Germany. The squadron encountered about 20 German soldiers accompanied by a tank with an 88mm weapon, and were forced to surrender. The squadron was then marched 50‚Äì60 miles, moving only by night, to the POW camp Stalag VI-G. The column of prisoners grew along the way as the German unit accumulated more and more American soldiers. Shay was interrogated at the camp and held there until April 12, 1945 when American troops encircled the camp, trapping 350,000 enemy soldiers and liberating the camp. Shay was sent home soon after. Post-World War II and Korea After making it home safely, Shay was unable to find work, like many other veterans after the war. He re-enlisted and was stationed in Vienna, Austria, serving as a medic with a Military Police Battalion. While stationed there he met a woman named Lilli [Rosa] Bollarth, and they married on March 21, 1950.Shay (2012), p. 84 When the Korean War broke out later that year, Shay joined the 3rd Division's 7th Infantry Regiment as a medic and was shipped to Japan. A few months later, his regiment went into battle in Korea and he served again as a combat medic. Shay was promoted to master sergeant and awarded the Bronze Star with two oak leaf clusters. Retirement Charles and his wife Lilli lived together in Vienna, visiting Shay's original hometown on Indian Island in Maine in the summers. Charles and Lilli officially relocated to Indian Island in 2003, but unfortunately Lilli fell ill almost immediately. She died shortly after. Shay has also renovated the two-story wooden \\"Teepee\\" on Native Island that his aunt Lucy Nicolar Poolaw and her Kiowa Indian husband Chief Bruce Poolaw built as a novelty shop and to sell Lucy's handmade baskets. Shay has restored the site as a small Family Museum. Charles Norman Shay is an elder member of the Penobscot tribe of Maine. Also known as the Penawahpskewi, the people of the Penobscot Nation are federally recognized. The tribe is part of the Wabanaki group, located in Maine, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. Shay lives in the community of the Native Americans reservation where he spent his childhood on Penobscot Island, opposite Old Town, Maine. In his retirement, Shay played a big role in the installment of National Native American Veterans Day. Project Omaha Beach In spring of 2007, Shay along with Harald E. L. Prins and his wife Bunny McBride, both of Kansas State University, planned a trip back to Europe so that Shay could visit past battle sites and comment on his experiences.

Origins Social institutions similar to serfdom occurred in the ancient world. The status of the helots in the ancient Greek city-state of Sparta resembled that of medieval serfs. By the 3rd century AD, the Roman Empire faced a labour shortage. Large Roman landowners increasingly relied on Roman freemen, acting as tenant farmers, (instead of on slaves) to provide labour. The status of these tenant farmers, eventually known as coloni, steadily eroded. Because the tax system implemented by Diocletian (reigned 284-305) assessed taxes based both on land and on the inhabitants of that land, it became administratively inconvenient for peasants to leave the land where the census counted them. In 332 AD Emperor Constantine issued legislation that greatly restricted the rights of the coloni and tied them to the land. Some see these laws as the beginning of medieval serfdom in Europe. However, medieval serfdom really began with the breakup of the Carolingian Empire around the 10th century. The demise of this empire, which had ruled much of western Europe for more than 200 years, ushered in a long period during which no strong central government existed in most of Europe. During this period, powerful feudal lords encouraged the establishment of serfdom as a source of agricultural labor. Serfdom, indeed, was an institution that reflected a fairly common practice whereby great landlords ensured that others worked to feed them and were held down, legally and economically, while doing so.  Heyday  Serfdom as a system provided most of the agricultural labour throughout the Middle Ages. Slavery persisted right through the Middle Ages,Ways of ending slavery but it was rare, diminishing and largely confined to the use of household slaves. Parts of Europe, including much of Scandinavia, never adopted serfdom. In the later Middle Ages serfdom began to disappear west of the Rhine even as it spread through much of the rest of Europe. This was one important cause for the deep differences between the societies and economies of eastern and western Europe. In Western Europe, the rise of powerful monarchs, towns, and an improving economy weakened the manorial system through the 13th and 14th centuries; serfdom had become rare by 1400. Serfdom in Western Europe came largely to an end in the 15th and 16th centuries, because of changes in the economy, population, and laws governing lord-tenant relations in Western European nations. The enclosure of manor fields for livestock grazing and for larger arable plots made the economy of serfs' small strips of land in open fields less attractive to landowners. Furthermore, the increasing use of money made tenant farming by serfs less profitable; for much less than it cost to support a serf, a lord could now hire workers who were more skilled and pay them in cash. Paid labour was also more flexible, since workers could be hired only when they were needed. At the same time, increasing unrest and uprisings by serfs and peasants, like Tyler‚Äôs Rebellion in England in 1381, put pressure on the nobility and the clergy to reform the system. As a result, the gradual establishment of new forms of land leases and increased personal liberties accommodated serf and peasant demands to some extent. An important factor in the decline of serfdom was industrial development‚Äîespecially the Industrial Revolution. With the growing profitability of industry, farmers wanted to move to towns to receive higher wages than those they could earn working in the fields, while landowners also invested in the more profitable industry. This also led to the growing process of urbanization. Serfdom reached Eastern Europe centuries later than Western Europe‚Äîit became dominant around the 15th century. Before that time, Eastern Europe had been much more sparsely populated than Western Europe, and the lords of Eastern Europe created a peasantry-friendly environment to encourage migration east. Serfdom developed in Eastern Europe after the Black Death epidemics of the mid-14th century, which stopped the eastward migration. The resulting high land-to-labour ratio - combined with Eastern Europe's vast, sparsely populated areas - gave the lords an incentive to bind the remaining peasantry to their land. With increased demand for agricultural produce in Western Europe during the later era when Western Europe limited and eventually abolished serfdom, serfdom remained in force throughout Eastern Europe during the 17th century so that nobility-owned estates could produce more agricultural products (especially grain) for the profitable export market. This pattern applied in Central and Eastern European countries, including Prussia (Prussian Ordinances of 1525), Austria, Hungary (laws of the late 15th and early 16th centuries), the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (szlachta privileges of the early 16th century) and the Russian Empire (laws of the late 16th and first half of the 17th century). This also led to the slower industrial development and urbanisation of those regions. Generally, this process, referred to as \\"second serfdom\\" or \\"export-led serfdom\\", persisted until the mid-19th century and became very repressive and substantially limited serfs' rights. Before the 1861 abolition of serfdom in Russia, a landowner's estate was often measured by the number of \\"souls\\" he owned, a practice made famous by Gogol's 1842 novel Dead Souls. Many of these countries abolished serfdom during the Napoleonic invasions of the early 19th century. Serfdom remained in force in most of Russia until the Emancipation reform of 1861, enacted on February 19, 1861, though in the Russian-controlled Baltic provinces it had been abolished at the beginning of the 19th century. According to the Russian census of 1857, Russia had 23.1 million private serfs. Russia by Donald Mackenzie Wallace Russian serfdom was perhaps the most notable Eastern European institution, as it was never influenced by German law and migrations, and serfdom and the manorial system were enforced by the crown (Tsar), not by the nobility. Decline In Western Europe serfdom became progressively less common through the Middle Ages, particularly after the Black Death reduced the rural population and increased the bargaining power of workers. Furthermore, the lords of many manors were willing (for payment) to manumit (\\"release\\") their serfs. In Normandy, serfdom had disappeared by 1100.Sept essais sur des Aspects de la soci√©t√© et de l'√©conomie dans la Normandie m√©di√©vale (Xe-XIIIe si√®cles) Lucien Musset, Jean- Michel Bouvris, V√©ronique Gazea, Cahier des Annales de Normandie 1988, Volume 22, Issue 22, pp. 3‚Äì140 Two possible causes of the disappearance of serfdom in Normandy have been proposed: (1) it might have been implemented to attract peasants to a Normandy depopulated by the Viking invasions or (2) it might be a result of the peasants' revolt of 996 in Normandy. In England, the end of serfdom began with the Peasants' Revolt in 1381. It had largely died out in England by 1500 as a personal status and was fully ended when Elizabeth I freed the last remaining serfs in 1574. Land held by serf tenure (unless enfranchised) continued to be held by what was thenceforth known as a copyhold tenancy, which was not completely abolished until 1925 (although it was whittled away during the 19th and early 20th centuries). There were Scottish born serfs until 1799, when coal miners who were kept in serfdom gained emancipation. However, most Scottish serfs had already been freed. Serfdom was de facto ended in France by Philip IV, Louis X (1315), and Philip V (1318).1902encyclopedia.comMaurice Druon, Le Roi de fer, Chapter 3 With the exception of a few isolated cases, serfdom had ceased to exist in France by the 15th century. In Early Modern France, French nobles nevertheless maintained a great number of seigneurial privileges over the free peasants that worked lands under their control. Serfdom was formally abolished in France in 1789. In other parts of Europe, there had been peasant revolts in Castille, Germany, northern France, Portugal, and Sweden. Although they were often successful, it usually took a long time before legal systems were changed. Era of the French Revolution The era of the French Revolution (1790s to 1820s) saw serfdom abolished in most of Western Europe, while its practice remained common in Eastern Europe until the middle of the 19th century (1861 in Russia). In France, serfdom had been in decline for at least three centuries by the start of the Revolution, replaced by various forms of freehold tenancy. The last vestiges of serfdom were officially ended on August 4, 1789 with a decree abolishing the feudal rights of the nobility. It removed the authority of the manorial courts, eliminated tithes and manorial dues, and freed those who still remained bound to the land. However, the decree was mostly symbolic, as widespread peasant revolts had effectively ended the feudal system beforehand; and ownership of the land still remained in the hands of the landlords, who could continue collecting rents and enforcing tenant contracts. End of serfdom: a German ‚ÄûFreilassungsbrief‚Äú (Letter for the End of a serfdom) from 1762. In German history the emancipation of the serfs came between 1770‚Äì1830, with the nobility in Schleswig being the first to agree to do so in 1797, followed by the signing of the royal and political leaders of Denmark and Germany in 1804. Prussia abolished serfdom with the \\"October Edict\\" of 1807, which upgraded the personal legal status of the peasantry and gave them ownership of half or two-thirds of the lands they were working. The edict applied to all peasants whose holdings were above a certain size, and included both Crown lands and noble estates. The peasants were freed from the obligation of personal services to the lord and annual dues; in return landowners were given ownership of 1/3 to 1/2 of the land. The peasant owned and rented the lands that were deeded to the old owners. The other German states imitated Prussia after 1815.Ewa Sagarra, A social history of Germany, pp 341-45 In sharp contrast to the violence that characterized land reform in the French Revolution, Germany handled it peacefully. In Schleswig the peasants, who had been influenced by the Enlightenment, played an active role; elsewhere they were largely passive. Indeed, for most peasants, customs and traditions continued largely unchanged, including the old habits of deference to the nobles whose legal authority remained quite strong over the villagers. The old paternalistic relationship in East Prussia lasted into the 20th century. What was new was that the peasant could now sell his land, enabling him to move to the city, or buy up the land of his neighbors. The land reforms in northwestern Germany were driven by progressive governments and local elites. They abolished feudal obligations and divided collectively owned common land into private parcels and thus created a more efficient market-oriented rural economy. It produced increased productivity and population growth. It strengthened the traditional social order because wealthy peasants obtained most of the former common land, while the rural proletariat was left without land; many left for the cities or America. Meanwhile, the division of the common land served as a buffer preserving social peace between nobles and peasants. East of the Elbe River, the Junker class maintained large estates and monopolized political power. In the Hapsburg monarchy, Jozef II issued the Serfdom Patent that abolished serfdom in the German speaking areas in 1781. In the Kingdom of Hungary, Jozef II issued a similar decree in 1785 after the Revolt of Horea in Transylvania. These patents converted the legal standings of all serfs into those of free- holders. All feudal restrictions were abolished in 1848 when all the land property were converted to non-feudal, transferable properties, and feudalism was legally abolished. The eradication of the feudal system marks the beginning of an era of rapid change in Europe. The change in status following the enclosure movements beginning in the later 18th century, in which various lords abandoned the open field farming of previous centuries and, essentially, took all the best land for themselves in exchange for \\"freeing\\" their serfs, may well have made serfdom seem more desirable to many peasant families. In his book Das Kapital, in Chapter 26 entitled \\"The Secret of Primitive Accumulation\\" and Chapter 27, \\"Expropriation of the Agricultural Population from the Land\\", Marx claimed that the feudal relationships of serfdom were violently transformed into private property and free labour: free of possession and free to sell their labour force on the market. Being liberated from serfdom meant being able to sell one's land and work wherever one desired. \\"The so-called primitive accumulation, therefore, is nothing else than the historical process of divorcing the producer from the means of production. It appears as primitive, because it forms the pre-historic stage of capital and of the mode of production corresponding with it.\\" In a case history of England, Marx described how the serfs became free peasant proprietors and small farmers, who were, over time, forcibly expropriated and driven off the land, forming a property-less proletariat. He also claimed that more and more legislation was enacted by the state to control and regiment this new class of wage workers. In the meantime, the remaining farmers became capitalist farmers operating more and more on a commercial basis; and gradually, legal monopolies preventing trade and investment by entrepreneurs were broken up. Taxes levied by the state took the place of labour dues levied by the lord. Although serfdom began its decline in Europe in the Middle Ages, it took many hundreds of years to disappear completely. In addition, the struggles of the working class during the Industrial Revolution can often be compared with the struggles of the serfs during the Middle Ages. In parts of the world today, forced labour is still used. \\"Galician slaughter\\" 1846, by Jan Lewicki (1795‚Äì1871); \\"directed against manorial property (for example, the manorial prisons) and rising against serfdom;Robert Bideleux and Ian Jeffries, A History of Eastern Europe: Crisis and Change, Routledge, 1998. . p. 295 ‚Äì 296. Galician, mainly Polish, peasants killed over 1000 noblemen and destroyed 500 manors in 1846.\\" Russia Serfdom became the dominant form of relation between Russian peasants and nobility in the 17th century. Serfdom only existed in central and southern areas of the Russian Empire. It was never established in the North, in the Urals, nor in Siberia. Historian David Moon argues that serfdom was a response to military and economic factors in Russia. It was socially stable and adaptable to changing demographic and economic conditions; revolts were uncommon. Moon says it was not the cause of Russia's backwardness; instead, backwardness blocked alternative methods that were developed in Western Europe. Moon identifies some benefits for serfs, such as assurances of land and some assistance after bad harvests. Moon argues that Russia's defeat in the Crimean War was a catalyst leading to the abolition of serfdom.David Moon, \\"Reassessing Russian serfdom,\\" European History Quarterly (1996) 26#4 pp 483-526David Moon, The Russian peasantry 1600‚Äì1930: the world the peasants made (Routledge, 2014). Finally, serfdom was abolished by a decree issued by Tsar Alexander II in 1861. Scholars have proposed multiple overlapping reasons to account for the abolition, including fear of a large- scale revolt by the serfs, the financial needs of the government, evolving cultural sensibilities, the military need for soldiers, and, among Marxists, the unprofitability of serfdom.Evsey D. Domar, and Mark J.

(1998) is a Postmodern novel in English, Spanish, and Spanglish by Puerto Rican author Giannina Braschi.Castillo, Debra A. \\"Language Games: Hinojosa-Smith, Prida, Braschi,: Redreaming America: Toward a Bilingual American Culture (pp. 172-186), State University of New York, 2005 The cross- genre work is a structural hybrid of poetry, political philosophy, musical, manifesto, treatise, bastinado, memoir, and drama. The work addresses tensions between Anglo-American and Hispanic-American cultures in the United States. Giannina Braschi Giannina Braschi, a National Endowment for the Arts fellow, is considered an influential and \\"revolutionary voice\\" in contemporary Latin American literature. Braschi's Empire of Dreams is a postmodern poetry classic, first published in Spain in 1988. Her most recent work is the postcolonial dramatic novel United States of Banana (2011). Braschi's collective work explores the politics of empire and independence, while capturing the trials and tribulations of the Latin American immigrant in the United States. With the republication of United States of Banana and her other works in 2011, CARAS Magazine ranked Braschi in 2012 as one of the most influential Puerto Ricans of the year. Description Yo-Yo Boing! has many examples of the linguistic phenomena of code-switching between English and Spanish, as spoken by millions of Latinos and Hispanic-Americans in the United States and in Puerto Rico.Martiza G. Stanchich, Insular interventions: diasporic Puerto Rican literature bilanguaging toward a greater Puerto Rico, University of California, Santa Cruz, 2003. It is the first full-length novel to use Spanglish as a high art form. The translingualism in this Latino narrative anticipated multicultural readers who could readily decode both languages in order to co-construct the storyworld.Gonz√°lez, Christopher. Permissible Narratives: The Promise of Latino/a Literature. Ohio State University Press, 2017. Through dramatic dialogues and conversations among a nameless chorus of voices, the work treats subjects as diverse as racial, ethnic, and sexual prejudice, discrimination, colonialism, Puerto Rican independence, revolution, domestic violence, and writer's block. In the book, intellectuals and artists debate English-only laws, ethnic cleansing campaigns, and the corporate censorship.Doris Sommer & Alexandra Vega-Merino, \\"Either Or\\", Introduction to Yo-Yo Boing!, Latin American Literary Review Press, Pittsburgh, 1998Marta S. Rivera Monclova, Discrimination, Evasion, and Liability in Four New York Puerto Rican Narratives, Tufts University, 2010. The dialogue also refers to popular culture, Latin American boom, films, sex, poetry, and Puerto Rican artistic expression in New York. Artists and celebrities such as Woody Allen, Almodovar, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Pavarotti, Martin Scorsese, Fellini, Pee-Wee Herman, and Nabokov are celebrated and derided. Reception Marc Zimmerman qualified the reception of Yo-Yo Boing! by Latin American scholars as \\"a work heralded by such gurus as Jean Franco, Doris Sommer, and Diamela Eltit and seen as the most complex and experimental of US Puerto Rican fiction yet to be written.\\" Frederick Luis Aldama stated, \\"Braschi is recognized as one of today‚Äôs foremost experimental Latinx authors. Braschi‚Äôs vibrant, bilingually shaped creative expressions and innovation spring from her Latinidad, her Puerto Rican-ness. (In this work) we discover as much about US/Puerto Rico sociopolitical histories as we encounter the metaphysical and existential explorations of a Cervantes, Rabelais, Diderot, Artaud, Joyce, Beckett, Stein, Borges, Cort√°zar, and Rosario Castellanos.\\" In \\"Yo-Yo Boing! and Its Critical Reception,\\" Christopher Gonzalez noted the early reviews published in English by monolingual reviewers were \\"at once laudatory and hesitant.\\" [Publishers Weekly called it \\"a literary liberation and a frustrating challenge\\" and Kirkus Reviews called it \\"a fractious comic novel by Braschi, a highly praised Puerto Rican poet... This in-your-face assertion of the vitality of Latino culture has many agreeable moments, but‚Äîlet‚Äôs face it‚Äîhow much of its potential readership will be able to understand more than half of it?\\"?] Gonzalez posits that \\"because Braschi owns every aspect of her story-world blueprint due to her equal mastery and fluency in Spanish and English,\\" non- Spanish speaking reviewers considered the work \\"an affront.\\" Whereas, he notes that bilingual reviewers, such as David William Foster in Review of Contemporary Fiction praised Yo-Yo Boing! for its \\"superb exploration for the lived experiences of Hispanics.\\" Debra A. Castillo qualified the work's artistry in this way, ‚ÄúWhile the author may write big books in terms of the traditional expectations about the poetic genre, she is as concerned about the microlevel of her work as the most highly elaborated lyricist. Braschi‚Äôs attention to tone and rhythm, to the music of her text, is extreme.‚Äù Harold Augenbraum, Ilan Stavans, Doris Sommer, Adriana Estill, Christopher Gonzalez, and other critics have used the phrase \\"a tour de force\\" to describe Yo-Yo Boing! Ilan Stavans stated in Spanglish, \\"I have always visto a Giannina Braschi como mi hero√≠na. And I‚Äôm an adicto... There is something m√°gico in her juego de palabras, her exploration of tenses, her anxious, uncompromising biling√ºismo que ni es de aqu√≠ ni es de aqu√≠ ni es de all√°, ni tiene age ni porvenir, y ser feliz es su color, su identity. Braschi crea una lexicography that is and isn‚Äôt atrapada en el presente.‚Äù Stavans was among the first professors to teach Yo-Yo Boing! (Amherst 2002) and dedicate a conference to Spanglish literature (Amherst 2004). Nearly 20 years later, in 2020, Yo-Yo Boing! is now on the course syllabus for classes in Spanglish, Bilingualism, Linguistics, Latino/a Literature, Puerto Rican Studies, Nuyorican Poetry, Latin American fiction, Experimental Literature, and Avant-garde Theater and Performance.

In 955 those areas north of the Carpathian Mountains constituted an autonomous part of the Duchy of Bohemia and remained so until around 972, when the first Polish (western Polans) territorial claims began to emerge. This area was mentioned in 981 (by Nestor), when Vladimir the Great of Kievan Rus' claimed the area on his westward way. In the 11th century the area belonged to Poland (1018‚Äì1031 and 1069‚Äì1080), then reverted to Kievan Rus'. However, at the end of the 12th century the Hungarian claims to the principality turned up. Finally Casimir III of Poland annexed it in 1340‚Äì1349. Low Germans from Prussia and Middle Germany settled parts of northern and western Galicia from the 13th to 18th centuries, although the vast majority of the historic province remained independent from German and Austrian rule. The territory was settled by the East Slavs in the early middle ages and, in the 12th century, a Rurikid Principality of Halych (Halicz, Halics, Galich, Galic) formed there, merged in the end of the century with the neighboring Volhynia into the Principality of Halych Volhynia that existed for a century and a half. By 1352, when the principality was partitioned between the Polish Kingdom and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, most of Galicia belonged to the Polish Crown, where it still remained after the 1569 union between Poland and Lithuania. Upon the partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1772 the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, or simply Galicia, became the largest, most populous, and northernmost province of the Austrian Empire, where it remained until the dissolution of Austria-Hungary at the end of World War I in 1918. Tribal area Stater coin, of Alexander the Great (336-323 BC) from Trepcza/ n. Sanok The region has a turbulent history. In Roman times the region was populated by various tribes of Celto-Germanic admixture, including Celtic-based tribes ‚Äì like the Galice or \\"Gaulics\\" and Bolihinii or \\"Volhynians\\" ‚Äì the Lugians and Cotini of Celtic, Vandals and Goths of Germanic origins (the Przeworsk and P√∫chov cultures). Beginning with the Wandering of the nations, the great migration coincident with the fall of the Roman Empire, various groups of nomadic people invaded the area: * 3rd century BC - 2nd century AD: Anartes (west part), * 2nd ‚Äì 5th centuries: Vandals (Przeworsk culture, =Hasdingi, Lacringi);Bastarnaes; Goths and Gepids (Wielbark culture) * 2nd ‚Äì 5th centuries (east part): Scythians, Sarmatians * 4th ‚Äì 5th centuries: Huns * 5th century: Avars * 6th ‚Äì 8th centuries: Slavs * 6th ‚Äì 9th centuries (east part): Bulgars (later Slavicized), Hungarians, Pechenegs * 10th ‚Äì 13th centuries (east part): Cumans, Karaites * 13th ‚Äì 14th centuries (east part): Tatars and other Turco-Mongol peoples from Central Asia Overall, Slavs (both West and East Slavs, including Lendians as well as Rusyns) came to dominate the Celtic-German population.  Red Ruthenia  In 891‚Äì892, the territories of the White and Red Croats came under the control of Great Moravia, a Slavic state. The region of what later became known as Galicia appears to have been incorporated, in large part, into the Empire of Great Moravia. It is first attested in the Primary Chronicle in A.D. 981, when Vladimir the Great of Kievan Rus' took over the Red Ruthenian strongholds in his military campaign on the border with the land of the Lendians, incorporated into the Duchy of Polans, and the land of the White Croats, ruled by the Duchy of Bohemia. In the following century, the area shifted briefly to Poland (1018‚Äì1031 and 1069‚Äì1080) and then back to Kievan Rus'. As one of many successors to Kievan Rus', the Principality of Halych existed from 1087 to 1199, when Roman the Great finally managed to unite it with Volhynia in the state of Halych-Volhynia, the Kingdom of Rus' or Kingdom of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia. However, the Hungarian claims to the Ruthenian principality (Regnum Galici√¶ et Lodomeri√¶) turned up in 1188. Despite the anti-Mongol campaigns of Danylo of Halych, who was crowned the king of Halych-Volhynia, his state occasionally paid tribute to the Golden Horde. Danylo moved his capital from Halych to Kholm, and his son Lev moved it to Lviv. Danylo's dynasty also attempted to gain papal and broader support in Europe for an alliance against the Mongols, but proved incapable of competing with the rising powers of Great Duchy of Lithuania and Poland. At the start of the 13th century, the Galician-Volhynian prince Roman Mstislavich became the main military ally of the Byzantine Empire led by Alexios III, who referred to him as ‚Äúigemon of Galicia‚Äù. Roman also married Alexio's niece, the elder daughter of the overthrown emperor Isaak II. The relation with Byzantium helped to stabilize Galicia's relations with the Russian population of the Lower Dniester and the Lower Danube.Alexander V.

Publication Year 2015  14th-Century wars  A succession wars were fought in the years 1340‚Äì1392 concerning succession to the rule of the Principality of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia. After Boleslaw-Yuri II was poisoned by local nobles in 1340, both the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland advanced claims over the principality. After a prolonged conflict, Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia was divided between Poland (Galicia) and Lithuania (Volhynia) and the principality ceased to exist as an independent state. Poland acquired a territory of approximately with 200,000 inhabitants.  Galicia under the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth  After 1346, the region comprised a Polish possession divided into a number of voivodeships. This began an era of Polish settlement among the Ruthenian population. Armenian and Jewish immigration to the region also occurred in large numbers. Numerous castles were built during this time and some new cities were founded: Stanis≈Çaw√≥w (Stanyslaviv in Ukrainian, now Ivano-Frankivsk) and Krystynopol (now Chervonohrad). Galicia was many times subjected to incursions by Tartars and Ottoman Turkey in the 16th and 17th centuries, devastated during the Khmelnytsky Uprising (1648‚Äì54) and the Russo-Polish War (1654‚Äì67), disrupted by Swedish invasions during The Deluge (1655‚Äì60) and Great Northern War of the early 18th century.

All annexed territories were organized as the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, in order to underline traditional Hungarian claims to the region. However, a large portion of non-galician and ethnically Polish lands to the west was also incorporated by the same annexation, and added to the province, which changed the geographical reference of the term Galicia, expanding it much to the west. Lviv (Lemberg, Lw√≥w) served as capital of Austrian Galicia, which was dominated by the Polish aristocracy, despite the fact that the population of the eastern half of the province was mostly Ukrainian (or Ruthenian, as they were known at the time). In addition to the Polish aristocracy and gentry who inhabited almost all parts of Galicia, and the Ruthenians in the east, there existed a large Jewish population, also more heavily concentrated in the eastern parts of the province. The newly arrived Austrians were shocked by the relationships between nobles and peasants in the former Polish territory. The peasants were seen, by the Austrians, as being treated as slaves over whom the nobles had limitless power, and examples of the nobles' alleged barbarism and \\"wildness\\", described with \\"artistic liberty\\", were distributed in the Austrian press and pamphlets in order to legitimize Habsburg regime in Galicia. The new Habsburg rulers and their supporters thus portrayed themselves as civilizing those whom they described as the savage Polish nobility.Larry Wolff. (2010). The Idea of Galicia: History and Fantasy in Habsburg Political Culture. Palo Alto: Stanford University Press. pp.22-23. Kratter's work, denouncing the Polish nobility, served the political purpose of Habsburg vindication.(...) In the age of Joseph, in the 1780s, it was possible to articulate a more modern claim to legitimacy before the public, emphasizing the displacement of barbaric cruelty by enlightened government. In one alleged incident described by the Austrian writer, a nobleman sent a peasant into a tree to clear an owl's nest, and then for his own amusement shot the peasant out of the tree. Blaming the Polish nobility for Galicia's economic backwardness, the Austrian rulers brought in Austrian Germans and Germanized Czechs to reform the province; until 1849 no native Galician was appointed vice-governor.Chris Hann, Paul R. Magocsi.(2005). Galicia: Multicultured Land. Toronto: Universityof toronto Press, pg. 193 In 1786, Polish laws were abolished and Austrian code introduced instead; all levels of administration were staffed by German speakers, while major urban centers (Lviv, Cracow, Przemy≈õl) were filled with Austrian soldiers.Alison Fleign Frank. (2005). Oil Empire: Visions of Prosperity in Austrian Galicia. Harvard University Press. p. 33. During these first decades of Austrian rule, while Galicia was firmly governed from Vienna, many significant reforms were carried out by a bureaucracy. The aristocracy was guaranteed its rights, but these rights were considerably circumscribed. The former serfs were no longer mere chattel, but became subjects of law and were granted certain personal freedoms, such as the right to marry without the lord's permission. Their labour obligations were defined and limited, and they could bypass the lords and appeal to the imperial courts for justice. The Eastern Rite \\"Uniate\\" Church, which primarily served the Ruthenians, was renamed the Greek Catholic Church to bring it onto a par with the Roman Catholic Church; it was given seminaries, and eventually, a Metropolitan. Although unpopular with the aristocracy, among the common folk, Polish and Ukrainian/Ruthenian alike, these reforms created a reservoir of good will toward the emperor which lasted almost to the end of Austrian rule. At the same time, however, Austria extracted from Galicia considerable wealth and conscripted large numbers of the peasant population into its armed services. In 1795, after the Third Partition of Poland, newly annexed polish territory was named \\"West Galicia\\" in order to legitimize the annexation. That area was lost in 1809, by the Treaty of Sch√∂nbrunn.  1815 to 1860  Coat-of-arms of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria in the 19th century. In 1815, as a result of decisions of the Congress of Vienna, the Lublin area and surrounding regions were ceded by Austria to the Congress Kingdom of Poland which was ruled by the Tsar, and the Ternopil Region, including the historical region of Southern Podolia (Podillya), was returned to Austria from Russia, which had held it since 1809. The 1820s and 1830s were a period of absolutist rule from Vienna, the local Galician bureaucracy still being filled by Germans and Germanized Czechs, although some of their children were already becoming Polonized. After the failure of the November insurrection in Russian Poland in 1830‚Äì31, in which a few thousand Galician volunteers participated, many Polish refugees arrived in Galicia. The latter 1830s were rife with Polish conspiratorial organizations, whose work culminated in the unsuccessful Galician insurrection of 1846, easily put down by the Austrians with the help of the Galician peasantry, which remained loyal to the emperor. This insurrection only occurred in the western, Polish-populated, part of Galicia, and the conflict was between patriotic, noble, rebels, and unsympathetic Polish peasants. In 1846, as one of the results of this unsuccessful revolt, the former Polish capital city of Krak√≥w, which had been a free city and a republic, became a part of Galicia, administered from Lviv (Lemberg). In the 1830s, in the eastern part of Galicia, the beginnings of a national awakening occurred among the Ruthenians. A circle of activists, primarily Greek Catholic seminarians, affected by the romantic movement in Europe and the example of fellow Slavs elsewhere, especially in eastern Ukraine under the Russians, began to turn their attention to the common folk and their language. In 1837, the so-called Ruthenian Triad (Markiyan Shashkevych, Yakiv Holovatsky, and Ivan Vahylevych) published \\"–†—É—Å–∞–ª–∫–∞ –î–Ω—£—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–∞—è\\", Rusalka dnistrova (\\"The Mermaid of the Dnister\\"), a collection of folksongs and other materials in the common Ruthenian tongue. Alarmed by such democratism, the Austrian authorities and the Greek Catholic Metropolitan banned the book. Flag of Galicia (1849) Flag of Galicia (1890‚Äî1918) In 1848, revolutions occurred in Vienna and other parts of the Austrian Empire. When an uprising inspired by Polish revolutionists took place in Krak√≥w, Galician peasants rebelled against the landowners, thus becoming allies of the Austrian government. In the \\"Galician slaughter\\" more than 2,000 Polish landowners and members of their families were killed. In some districts, for example in Tarnow, almost 90 percent of the estates were looted and burned. The Habsburg government was trying to prevent Galicia's turning into a \\"Polish Piedmont\\", from where the restoration of an independent Polish state could begin; using national and social controversies in Galicia, it started to encourage the Rusyn movement, which was later called ‚ÄúUkrainian Piedmont‚Äù. In his work Ukraine: the history, Ukrainian-Canadian historian Orest Subtelnyi argues that Galician governor Franz Stadion ‚Äúactively attracted and supported...the timid elite of Western Ukraine, hoping to use it as a counterbalance against more aggressive Poles‚Äù. Under his guidance, the Main Rusyn Rada was created, and in Lviv a newspaper ‚ÄúThe Dawn of Galicia‚Äù was founded. On May 15, 1848, this newspaper published an address of Main Rusyn Rada containing demands for administrative autonomy and free development of national culture and language for Galician Rusyns, ‚Äúa part of the great Rusyn people which speaks a single language and amounts to 15 million people‚Äù. It was the first document to express the idea of unity between the population of Habsburg monarchy and Ruthenia, a part of the Russian Empire. But leaders of Main Rusyn Rada actively pointed out that Galicia was inhabited by the Rusyn ‚Äì ‚ÄúRuthenen‚Äù ‚Äì a people different from the Russians ‚Äì ‚ÄúRussen‚Äù ‚Äì as well as from Poles; and that it were the Rusyns who were the backbone of Austria-Hungary in the province. A decade of renewed absolutism followed, but to placate the Poles, Count Agenor Goluchowski, a conservative representative of the eastern Galician aristocracy, the so-called Podolians, was appointed Viceroy. He began to Polonize the local administration and managed to have Ruthenian ideas of partitioning the province shelved. He was unsuccessful, however, in forcing the Greek Catholic Church to shift to the use of the western or Gregorian calendar, or among Ruthenians generally, to replace Cyrillic script with the Latin alphabet.  Constitutional experiments  In 1859, following Austrian military defeat in Italy, the Empire entered a period of constitutional experiments. In 1860, the Vienna Government, influenced by Agenor Goluchowski, issued its October Diploma, which envisioned a conservative federalization of the empire, but a negative reaction in the German-speaking lands led to changes in government and the issuing of the February Patent which watered down this de- centralization. Nevertheless, by 1861, Galicia was granted a Legislative Assembly or Galicia Diet. Although at first pro-Habsburg Ruthenian and Polish peasant representation was considerable in this body (about half the assembly), and the pressing social and Ruthenian questions were discussed, administrative pressures limited the effectiveness of both peasant and Ruthenian representatives and the Diet became dominated by the Polish aristocracy and gentry, who favoured further autonomy. This same year, disturbances broke out in Russian Poland and to some extent spilled over into Galicia. The Diet ceased to sit. By 1863, open revolt broke out in Russian Poland and, from 1864 to 1865, the Austrian government declared a State of Siege in Galicia, temporarily suspending civil liberties. 1865 brought a return to federal ideas along the lines suggested by Agenor Goluchowski and negotiations on autonomy between the Polish aristocracy and Vienna began once again. Meanwhile, the Ruthenians felt more and more abandoned by Vienna and among the \\"Old Ruthenians\\" grouped around the Greek Catholic Cathedral of Saint George, there occurred a turn towards Russia. The more extreme supporters of this orientation came to be known as \\"Russophiles\\". At the same time, influenced by the Ukrainian language poetry of the eastern Ukrainian writer, Taras Shevchenko, a Ukrainophile movement led by Anatole Vakhnianyn and the Prosvita society arose which published literature in the Ukrainian/Ruthenian vernacular and eventually established a network of reading halls. Supporters of this orientation came to be known as \\"Populists\\", and later, simply as \\"Ukrainians\\". Almost all Ruthenians, however, still hoped for national equality and for an administrative division of Galicia along ethnic lines.  Galician autonomy  Galician Sejm (parliament) in Lviv. In 1866, following the Battle of Sadova and the Austrian defeat in the Austro-Prussian War, the Austrian empire began to experience increased internal problems. In an effort to shore up support for the monarchy, Emperor Franz Joseph began negotiations for a compromise with the Hungarian nobility to ensure their support. Some members of the government, such as Austrian prime minister Count Belcredi, advised the Emperor to make a more comprehensive constitutional deal with all of the nationalities that would have created a federal structure. Belcredi worried that an accommodation with the Hungarian interests would alienate the other nationalities. However, Franz Joseph was unable to ignore the power of the Hungarian nobility, and they would not accept anything less than dualism between themselves and the traditional Austrian √©lites. Finally, after the so-called Ausgleich of February 1867, the Austrian Empire was reformed into a dualist Austria-Hungary. Although the Polish and Czech plans for their parts of the monarchy to be included in the federal structure failed, a slow yet steady process of liberalisation of Austrian rule in Galicia started. Representatives of the Polish aristocracy and intelligentsia addressed the Emperor asking for greater autonomy for Galicia. Their demands were not accepted outright, but over the course of the next several years a number of significant concessions were made toward the establishment of Galician autonomy. Galicia in 1897 From 1873, Galicia was de facto an autonomous province of Austria-Hungary with Polish and, to a much lesser degree, Ukrainian or Ruthenian, as official languages. The Germanisation had been halted and the censorship lifted as well. Galicia was subject to the Austrian part of the Dual Monarchy, but the Galicia Diet and provincial administration had extensive privileges and prerogatives, especially in education, culture, and local affairs. These changes were supported by many Polish intellectuals. In 1869, a group of young conservative publicists in Krak√≥w, including J√≥zef Szujski, Stanis≈Çaw Tarnowski, Stanis≈Çaw Ko≈∫mian and Ludwik Wodzicki, published a series of satirical pamphlets entitled Teka Sta≈Ñczyka (Sta≈Ñczyk's Portfolio). Only five years after the tragic end of the January Uprising, the pamphlets ridiculed the idea of armed national uprisings and suggested compromise with Poland's enemies, especially the Austrian Empire, concentration on economic growth, and acceptance of the political concessions offered by Vienna. This political grouping came to be known as the Stanczyks or Krak√≥w Conservatives. Together with the eastern Galician conservative Polish landowners and aristocracy called the \\"Podolians\\", they gained a political ascendency in Galicia which lasted to 1914. This shift in power from Vienna to the Polish landowning class was not welcomed by the Ruthenians, who became more sharply divided into Russophiles, who looked to Russia for salvation, and Ukrainians who stressed their connections to the common people. Both Vienna and the Poles saw treason among the Russophiles and a series of political trials eventually discredited them. Meanwhile, by 1890, an agreement was worked out between the Poles and the \\"Populist\\" Ruthenians or Ukrainians which saw the partial Ukrainianization of the school system in eastern Galicia and other concessions to Ukrainian culture. Thereafter, the Ukrainian national movement spread rapidly among the Ruthenian peasantry and, despite repeated setbacks, by the early years of the 20th century this movement had almost completely replaced other Ruthenian groups as the main rival for power with the Poles. Throughout this period, the Ukrainians never gave up the traditional Ruthenian demands for national equality and for partition of the province into a western, Polish half and an eastern, Ukrainian half. Economic emigration Economic immigrants from Galicia in the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy 1890, modern Prnjavor (today part of Bosnia and Herzegovina). Beginning in the 1880s, a mass emigration of the Galician peasantry occurred. The emigration started as a seasonal one to Imperial Germany (newly unified and economically dynamic) and to Bosnia and then later became a Trans-Atlantic one with large-scale emigration to the United States, Brazil, and Canada. Caused by the backward economic condition of Galicia where rural poverty was widespread, the emigration began in the western, Polish populated part of Galicia and quickly shifted east to the Ukrainian inhabited parts. Poles, Ukrainians, Jews, and Germans all participated in this mass movement of countryfolk and villagers. Poles migrated principally to New England and the midwestern states of the United States, but also to Brazil and elsewhere; Ukrainians migrated to Brazil, Canada, and the United States, with a very intense emigration from Southern Podolia to Western Canada; and Jews emigrated both directly to the New World and also indirectly via other parts of Austria-Hungary. A total of several hundred thousand people were involved in this Great Economic Emigration which grew steadily more intense until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. The war put a temporary halt to the emigration which never again reached the same proportions. The Great Economic Emigration, especially the emigration to Brazil ‚Äì the \\"Brazilian Fever\\" as it was called at the time ‚Äì was described in contemporary literary works by the Polish poet Maria Konopnicka, the Ukrainian writer Ivan Franko, and many others. Writer Osyp Oleskiv was instrumental in redirecting Ukrainian migration away from Brazil towards Canada, although the first arrival, Ivan Pylypiv, had been a few years earlier. Kingdom of Galicia 1846‚Äì1918  First World War and Polish-Ukrainian conflict  During the First World War, Galicia saw heavy fighting between the forces of Russia and the Central Powers. The fighting began in 1914 when the Russian Army advanced into the Austro- Hungarian province of Galicia and German East Prussia. The initial attack on East Prussia quickly turned into a defeat following the Battle of Tannenberg in August 1914 but the second incursion was completely successful. Under the command of generals Nikolai Ivanov and Aleksei Brusilov, the Russians won the Battle of Galicia in September and began the Siege of Przemy≈õl, the next fortress on the road towards Krak√≥w. By the end December 1914, the Russians controlled almost all of Galicia. However the victory was short-lived, the Russians were pushed out of Galicia in the spring and summer of 1915 by a combined German, Austro-Hungarian and Turkish offensive. In 1918, Western Galicia became a part of the restored Republic of Poland, while the local Ukrainian population briefly declared the independence of Eastern Galicia as the West Ukrainian People's Republic. These competing claims led to the Polish-Ukrainian War. Upon reclaiming its former territories and seeing a much greater threat from a Communist Russia, Poland made common cause with Ukrainian administration in Kiev, the Ukrainian People's Republic against Bolshevist Russia. During the Polish-Soviet War a short-lived Galician SSR in Ternopil was established. Eventually, the whole of the province was recaptured by Poles and divided into four voivodeships, with capitals in Krak√≥w, Lviv (Lw√≥w), Ternopil (Tarnopol) and Stanyslaviv (Stanis≈Çaw√≥w). The Ukrainians of the former eastern Galicia and the neighbouring province of Volhynia, made up about 15% of the Second Polish Republic's population, and were its numerically largest minority. Poland's annexation of Eastern Galicia, never accepted as legitimate by most Ukrainians, was internationally recognized in 1923. This attitude, among other local problems, contributed to growing tensions between the Polish government and the Ukrainian population, eventually giving the rise to the militant underground Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists. In the western part of Galicia, Rusyn Lemkos formed the Lemko-Rusyn Republic in 1918, initially attempting to unite with Russia, instead of Ukraine. As this was impossible, they later attempted to unite with Rusyns from the area south of the Carpathians, in an attempt to join Czechoslovakia as a third ethnic entity. This effort was suppressed by the Polish government in 1920, and the area was incorporated into Poland. The leaders of the republic were subsequently tried by the Polish government; they were later acquitted.  Second World War and Distrikt Galizien  14th SS-Volunteer Division \\"Galicia\\". In 1939 the Supreme Command of the Wehrmacht approved a plan (Fall Weiss) with details of future attack on Poland. In the plan, military brigades from Galicia played the role of a Fifth column, to attack and demoralize the Polish Army in the rear, if resistance from Polish troops were stronger than expected.Sergei Berets. Ukrainian Legion ‚Äì allies of Nazis, rivals of Bendera.. BBC Russian Service, 02/09/2009. In early summer of 1939, Germans (Wilhelm Canaris, Erwin von Lahousen), with the support of activists from OUN (Richard Yary), created a Ukrainian Legion under command of Roman Sushko, that had training camps in Germany, Austria (, Kirchhoff) and Slovakia. With the help of the Ukrainian Legion, German intelligence Abwehr planned, after the defeat of Poland, to create a pro-German Ukrainian state in Galicia and Volhynia. From intelligence reports, the USSR was aware of these plans and actively tried to counteract them in diplomatic negotiations. Finally, in the immediate diplomatic prelude to the Second World War, the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact was signed, which divided Poland roughly along the Curzon line. According to its terms, Germany had to scrap its original plan for the Ukrainian Legion. After September 17, 1939, all territory east of the San, Bug and Neman rivers, approximating the former territory of East Galicia, was occupied and annexed by the USSR. This territory was divided into four administrative districts (oblasts): Lviv, Stanislav, Drohobych and Ternopil (the latter including parts of Volhynia) of the Soviet Republic of Ukraine. Jews who did not adopt Soviet citizenship were deported to Siberia and northeastern European Russia.Jan Tomasz Gross, Irena Grudzi≈Ñska-Gross, W czterdziestym nas matko na Sybir zes≈Çali ..., Publisher: London: Aneks, 1983. In 1940‚Äì1941, the Soviet authorities conducted four mass deportations from the eastern part of the Second Polish Republic, inhabited by Ukrainians, Belarusians, Jews, Lithuanians, Russians, Germans, Czechs, and Armenians, along with Poles. Approximately 335,000 Polish citizens were deported to Siberia, Kazakhstan, and the north-east of European Russia, by the NKVD. According to general Vasily Khristoforov, the director of the FSB archives in Moscow, exactly 297,280 Polish citizens were deported in 1940. The total number of deportees from Western Ukraine was 198,536 people ‚Äì it should be treated as the minimum of documented casualties: * February 1940 ‚Äì 89,062 people (approximately 84.8% Poles, 13.8% Ukrainians, 1.4% Jews and others) deported to the north-east of European Russia, Siberia, and Kazakhstan; * April 1940 ‚Äì 31,332 people (approximately 70.6% Poles, 25.0% Ukrainians, 3.0% Jews, 1.4% Russians, Germans, others) deported to Kazakhstan; * June‚ÄìJuly 1940 ‚Äì 67,049 people (approximately 84.6% Jews, 11.0% Poles, 3.3% Ukrainians, 0.4% Germans, 0.7% others) deported to Siberia and the north-east of European Russia; * May/June 1941 ‚Äì 11,093 people (mostly Ukrainians, also Poles and others) deported to Siberia and Kazakhstan. After June 22, 1941, the period of Sovietisation came to an end when Germany took East Galicia during Operation Barbarossa. This was a period of massacres. Evacuating Soviets decided to summarily kill the mass of people waiting in the prisons for deportation to the Gulag even if their fault was petty crimes or no fault at all. When Wehrmacht forces arrived in the area, they discovered evidence of the mass murders committed by the NKVD and NKGB, including mass killing of Poles and Ukrainians. After the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, in June 1941, thousands of prisoners have been murdered in mass executions in prisons (among others in Lviv) and during the evacuation (so-called death marches). On June 30, 1941, Yaroslav Stetsko declared the \\"Act of Proclamation of Ukrainian Statehood\\" in Lviv, and became the Prime Minister in the Ukrainian government.–Ü.–ö. –ü–∞—Ç—Ä–∏–ª—è–∫. –í—ñ–π—Å—å–∫–æ–≤–∞ –¥—ñ—è–ª—å–Ω—ñ—Å—Ç—å –û–£–ù(–ë) —É 1940‚Äî1942 —Ä–æ–∫–∞—Ö. ‚Äî –£–Ω—ñ–≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏—Ç–µ—Ç —ñ–º–µ–Ω—ñ –®–µ–≤—á–µ–Ω–∫–æ \\\\–Ü–Ω-—Ç —ñ—Å—Ç–æ—Ä—ñ—ó –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏ –ù–ê–ù –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏ –ö–∏—ó–≤, 2004 (No ISBN) The act was accepted by Andrey Sheptytsky, the Metropolitan Archbishop of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, on July 1, 1941.Ryszard Torzecki, Polacy i Ukrai≈Ñcy. Sprawa ukrai≈Ñska w czasie II wojny ≈õwiatowej na terenie II Rzeczypospolitej, s. 159, Wydawnictwo Naukowe PWN, Warszawa 1993, This was done without approval of the Germans, so they arrested many OUN-B activists, between 6 and 11 July 1941. Finally, Stepan Bandera, Yaroslav Stetsko, Roman Ilnytsky and Volodymyr Stakhiv were sent to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, and Galicia was subsequently incorporated into the General Government as Distrikt Galizien. As Germany viewed Galicia as already partially aryanized and civilized, more non-Jewish Galicians escaped the full extent of German intentions than many other Ukrainians who lived more eastward. Despite the more lenient extent of German control for some of the Galician population, many Galicians, especially Jewish Galicians, were deported to concentration camps, much like elsewhere in Ukraine. Most of the 500 000 Jews (around 12% of the population) were shot on the edge of common graves or killed in Belzec. Conflicts in Galicia and Volhynia between Poles and Ukrainians also intensified during this time, with skirmishes between the Polish Home Army (AK), Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), German Wehrmacht, and Soviet partisans. These conflicts included the massacres of Poles in Volhynia, and within Galicia, revenge attacks on Ukrainians and Operation Vistula. Despite these warring factions, and despite Ukrainian Galicians joining the UPA and supporting its anti-Soviet, anti-Polish, and anti-German policies, some also joined Germany in its fight against the USSR, forming the 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Galizien (1st Ukrainian). The Division SS \\"Galizien\\" was commanded by German and Austrian officers (Walter Schimana, Fritz Freitag) who were delegated to the division.  Post-war  The new Poland/USSR border, with majority Polish-speaking areas to the west, and Ukrainians (Ruthenes) to the east was recognized by the western Allies as part of the Yalta Conference with the Soviet Union. There were however large minority populations on either side of the new frontier and the end of the Second World War saw the forcible population transfer of over 500,000 people by the Communist authorities, Ukrainians moving to the east and Poles to the west during Operation Vistula.

It superficially resembles a tadpole and is surrounded by a transparent mucus net known as a \\"house\\". Description The trunk of Oikopleura cophocerca is oval and slightly arched and a few millimetres in length. A mouth at one end opens into a funnel-shaped pharynx and the anus is half way along the ventral surface. The endostyle is small and equidistant between the mouth and the anus. The branched ovary lies between the two testes. The tail is long, broad and muscular and contains remnants of the notochord as small, globular cells.Zoppy, Evelyn. 1971: Apendicularias de la Regi√≥n Oriental de Venezuela. Studies on the Fauna of Cura√ßao and other Caribbean Islands, 132:76-109. Lam I ‚Äì VI. The tail is attached just behind the anus and is bent forward to pass near the mouth. The tail has ventral and dorsal fins running along its length. However, because it is twisted through a right angle, it appears to have fins on its left and right sides and it undulates up and down rather than from side to side. The exoskeleton of this class of tunicates consists of a mucus net which is known as a \\"house\\" and surrounds the animal's body like a bubble. Distribution Oikopleura cophocerca has a cosmopolitan distribution and is found, mainly in the surface layers, in temperate and tropical parts of the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf Of Mexico, the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. In the Gulf of Mexico it is found on the Tabasco‚ÄìCampeche shelf where its maximum abundance is associated with the up- welling of water caused by the Yucat√°n Current. Biology Oikopleura cophocerca, like other appendicularians, secretes a mucus net known as a \\"house\\" (Greek Oikos, house) inside which it lives. Periodically this gelatinous house is rolled up and abandoned, a new house being secreted within about a minute. This structure is inflated with sea water by undulations of the tail and further tail movements maintain a flow of water through it. The house has two inflow entrances and one outflow, between which are various passageways and two fine filters to catch food particles. The mucus net is a very efficient means of concentrating the minute planktonic particles on which this animal feeds and the appendicularian is in effect, swimming in a concentrated planktonic broth. At 20 ¬∞C, Oikopleura cophocerca builds and discards two houses each day. Appendicularians are hermaphrodites and sexual reproduction is the only means of reproduction in this species. The testes ripen first and sperm is shed into the sea. When the ovary ripens, the body wall of the animal ruptures to release the eggs and the animal dies in the process. The development of the zygote is rapid and direct and the embryo starts to feed and secrete a mucus net within twenty four hours.

IRS-1B carries three cameras, LISS-1, LISS-2A and LISS-2B with resolutions of and respectively with a swath width of about during each pass over the country. It was a part- operational, part-experimental mission to develop Indian expertise in satellite imagery. It was a successor to the remote sensing mission IRS-1A, both undertaken by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). History IRS-1B was the second remote sensing mission to provide imagery for various land-based applications, such as agriculture, forestry, geology, and hydrology. Spacecraft Improved features compared to its predecessor (IRS-1A): gyro referencing for better orientation sensing, time tagged commanding facility for more flexibility in camera operation and line count information for better data product generation. The spacecraft was a box- shaped 1.6 x 1.56 x 1.1-metre bus with two Sun-tracking solar arrays of 8.5 square metres each. Two nickel-cadmium batteries provided power during eclipses. The three-axis stabilised sun-synchronous satellite had a 0.4¬∞ pitch/roll and 0.5¬∞ yaw pointing accuracy provided by a zero-momentum reaction wheel system utilising Earth/Sun/star sensors and gyros. Payloads IRS-1B carried three solid state push broom scanner Linear Imaging Self-Scanner (LISS) cameras: * LISS-1 ( each band ground resolution) * LlSS-2A and 2B ( each band ground resolution) The satellite carried three LISS push broom CCD sensors operating in four spectral bands compatible with Landsat Thematic Mapper and Spot HRV data. The bands were 0.45-0.52, 0.52-0.59, 0.62-0.68, and 0.77-0.86 microns. The LISS 1 sensor had four 2048-element CCD imagers with a focal length of generating a resolution of and a swath width. The LISS 2A/B sensors had eight 2048-element CCD imagers with a focal length of generating a ground resolution of and a swath width. The two LISS 2 imagers bracketed the LISS 1 imager providing a overlap. Data from the LISS 1 were downlinked on S-band at 5.2 Mbps and from the LISS 2 A/B at 10.4 Mbps to the ground station at Shadnagar, India. The satellite was controlled from Bangalore, India. Mission IRS-1B was operated in a Sun-synchronous orbit. On 29 August 1991, it had a perigee of , an apogee of , an inclination of 99.2¬∞, and an orbital period of 102.7 minutes.

History Starting in 1942, and becoming more common as the Finnish-Soviet Continuation War progressed, both PPS-42 and PPS-43 began showing up among Soviet units, and many were captured by the Finnish Army. The simple construction of these weapons immediately caught the interest of the Finnish arms industry. It was decided that they would try to copy the sheet-steel stamped construction process, but redesigned to use the 9√ó19mm Parabellum round instead of the original Soviet 7.62√ó25mm Tokarev and to use the magazine of the Suomi KP/-31 submachine gun, the standard SMG in Finnish service at that time. The new submachine gun was a much cheaper design than the Suomi submachine gun and could be manufactured much faster. All parts were made out of stamped steel (excluding the barrel, bolt and some wooden plates on the handle). The weight of the gun was almost halved compared to the Suomi (2.95 kg vs. 5 kg). The Finnish Defence Forces ordered 20 000 m/44 submachine guns from Tikkakoski in August 1944. The end of the war saw the order reduced to 10 000 units and the guns were produced during 1945. It is unlikely the m/44 actually saw action during WWII but the gun was used by the Finnish Defence Forces as a training weapon until the 1970s. The Finnish Border Guard and United Nations troops also used the weapon, the latter particularly during the Suez Crisis. Willi Daugs, Tikkakoski Oy's principal shareholder, took the blueprints with him to Spain after World War II. The gun was produced there at the Oviedo arms factory, who re-designated it DUX-53. In 1953, the West German border guards (Bundesgrenzschutz) adopted the Spanish-made DUX-53 and DUX-59 submachine guns, copied from the PPS-43 by way of the Finnish M/44.

On January 27 House Speaker Beth Harwell said she agreed with Ramsey that Durham should be expelled from the state legislature. Durham has said that he did not remember sending the texts. He told the Republican Caucus that he would seek \\"help\\", then clarified to the Williamson Herald, a newspaper in his district, that he meant he would speak to his doctor about finding ways to manage stress. On April 1, 2016 Durham filed papers and announced his intention to run for re-election. On April 7, 2016, Speaker Harwell directed that Durham's office be moved out of the Tennessee State House into a nearby building and restrictions were placed on his access to state facilities. The Tennessee Attorney General had recommended that some action be taken as his preliminary investigation indicated Durham might pose a risk to \\"unsuspecting women.\\" On July 13, 2016, the Attorney General's special investigation found that Durham had sexually harassed at least 22 women. On July 14, 2016 Durham announced he was suspending his re-election campaign. Since the AG report, both House Democrats and Republicans called for Durham's expulsion. While he had already lost the primary for reelection and would not be in office for the next legislative session, an expulsion would preclude him from drawing a state pension. Governor Bill Haslam called an extraordinary session of the General Assembly to convene in September 2016. This session was to address DUI laws that would cost the state $60 million in federal funding if the state was not in compliance by October 1. The expulsion of Durham was not included in the proclamation as Haslam said it was not the role of the administration to decide. Speaker Beth Harwell commented that she would push for an expulsion motion during the session. Durham's attorney raised concerns over the constitutionality of an expulsion motion in an extraordinary session as it was outside the scope of the Governor's call. However, the Speaker and the House Clerk's office stated that an expulsion motion is procedural instead of legislative and that there is also precedent for the House passing Resolutions during an extraordinary session. Republican Caucus Chairman Glen Casada pointed to the 1866 extraordinary session where the General Assembly expelled six members following the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment. The expelled Members in 1866 were intentionally absent from the session in an attempt to stop the ratification through the lack of quorum. On the second day of the extraordinary session, Representative Susan Lynn made the motion to expel Durham during the unfinished business portion of the agenda. Durham spoke from the well defending himself and criticized the lack of due process during the procedures. He also answered some questions from other Representatives during the debate before eventually leaving the Capitol abruptly. A motion was made to force Durham to return to the Chambers to continue answering questions; however that motion failed. Durham was then expelled from the Tennessee House of Representatives on September 13, 2016 with a vote of 70-2-16. Most of the sixteen abstaining voters sided with Durham's criticism over the lack of due process. Personal life Durham works as a small business attorney in Franklin, Tennessee. He is married to Dr. Jessica Durham, an optometrist. They reside in Franklin, Tennessee.

Musicologists now agree that Handel had no initial knowledge of the publishing. Instead, Walsh, seeking to take advantage of the commercial success of Corelli's Opus 6 Concerti Grossi, simply combined several of Handel's already existing works and grouped them into six \\"concertos\\". Musical structure The structure of Op. 3 is somewhat unusual. The six concertos have anything between two and five movements, but only one of them contains the usual four movements. Only occasionally are the instrumental forces set in the traditional concerto grosso manner: a tutti group and a contrasting, soloistic concertino group. However, the concertos are filled with virtuoso solo passages for both the strings and the woodwinds, thus maintaining the form of the concerto grosso despite the lack of traditional contrasting forces. Concerto Grosso in B major, Op. 3, No. 1 ‚Äì HWV 312 The first and probably earliest concerto of the set is scored for two recorders, two oboes, two bassoons, strings (with divided viola), and continuo. It is unusual in that only its first movement is in the tonic key of B major‚Äîthe other two are in the relative minor, G minor. Concerto Grosso in B major, Op. 3, No. 2 ‚Äì HWV 313 The second concerto contains four movements in B major and one (the second) in G minor. The opening movement of the five-movement concerto bears a close relationship to Handel's Brockes Passion of 1716. Unusually, two dance movements, a minuet, and a gavotte complete the concerto. The final gavotte bears a close resemblance to \\"The King Shall Rejoice\\" from Handel's Coronation Anthems. The concerto is scored for two oboes, one bassoon, strings, and continuo. Concerto Grosso in G major, Op. 3, No. 3 ‚Äì HWV 314 The third concerto is again in three movements (the opening Largo is too brief to be classified as a movement). There is little doubt that this concerto was compiled by Walsh from a number of pieces by Handel. The concerto is scored for one oboe (can also be replaced by flute), one bassoon, strings, and continuo. Concerto Grosso in F major, Op. 3, No. 4 ‚Äì HWV 315 The fourth concerto is the only piece in the opus that follow a four movement framework. Although the layout of this work does not reflect the typical concerto grosso as the music was pulled straight from the 1716 overture to the 1715 opera Amadigi di Gaula, the piece uniquely displays many aspects of Handel's concerto grosso style. The piece is scored for two oboes, one bassoon, strings, and continuo. Walsh also published a 'No. 4b' concerto erroneously under the name of Handel but it was withdrawn a few months later, possibly at Handel's request. Concerto Grosso in D minor, Op. 3, No. 5 ‚Äì HWV 316 Despite lack of division into tutti and concertino and the addition of an extra allegro movement at the very end, the fifth concerto follows the traditional Italian model most closely of all the Op. 3 works. Walsh at first only published the first two movements, but because the work had already been known in its entirety, it is probable that Handel requested it be published in full. The piece is scored for two oboes (originally one), one bassoon, strings, and continuo. Concerto Grosso in D major, Op. 3 No. 6 ‚Äì HWV 317 The sixth and final concerto has just two movements, the Vivace, whose music is extracted from the 1723 opera Ottone, and the Allegro, which is also Handel's first published piece for organ and orchestra, and is taken from the overture to the 1712 opera Il pastor fido. The piece is scored for two oboes, one bassoon, strings, and continuo. The Allegro of the concerto was publisher Walsh's 'commercial' announcement of the forthcoming edition of Handel's opus 4: a set of organ (or cembalo) concertos.

The designs and samples on pictorial carpets are completely different from those on common floor rugs. Pictorial carpets are generally made of silk but they have also been made from wool. Pictorial carpets are usually framed to sell and use.  Description  The very concept and expectations of Persian rugs slowly started to change over the past 25 years. The original tableau rug, also known as pictorial carpet is not known when it was weaved together but some of the old rugs back in 19th & 20th century show that the similar type design were used such as hunting scene in Isfahan or Qum carpet as well as floral design in Isfahan and Tabriz carpet. Also picturesque scenes from ancient Persia showing the king and his wife is another example. After the 1979 revolution in Iran, the whole industry started to change and many of the original patterns which were famous in Iran were exported to many countries which they have started producing similar products with much lower quality such as China, Turkish, Afghanistan, India etc. and unfortunately selling them in the global market known as Persian design carpets. This have hurt the industry significantly which the export of the Persian rugs has been reducing year by year after the revolution. At the same time a new trend slowly started to take shape as part of the Persian rug culture and Iranian came to a conclusion since they are best known carpet weaver and the oldest known carpet maker in the world & modern society, why not to re-produce some of the most famous, well known and rare art works from across the globe in the new product known as ‚Äútableau rug‚Äù. What is known is that now this is a new trend in the ancient world of Persian rug. Pictorial carpets are being woven exactly the same way as the Persian rug has been made over the past 2500 years so there is no different in quality. The main different is that in pictorial carpet, there is not the ancient design and it always has a picture or scenery that are much more colorful with many different scenes. They can be framed the same way as an art work or painting and they are designed to be hung on the wall.

Introduction and Promalactis species list of the world. Zootaxa, 4059 (3): 446-470. Taxonomic history The genus was established by Edward Meyrick in 1908. It currently comprises 179 valid species worldwide, distributed mainly in the Palaearctic and Oriental regions. China has the greatest diversity, with 101 recorded species. Identification Promalactis is represented by the combination of the following characters: the smooth head with metallic lustre, the lanceolate forewings with various dark or white markings against yellow to deep ochreous-brown ground colour; the variously shaped symmetrical or asymmetrical valvae and a narrow to very broad sacculus in the male genitalia; and a developed to ill-defined lamella postvaginalis and an elongate thin ductus bursae in the female genitalia. Biology Little is known about the biology of this genus. Meyrick reported that larvae fed on rotten wood or bark of Pinaceae and other trees.Genus Promalactis Meyrick (Lepidoptera, Oecophoridae) from China: Descriptions of twelve new species Species References * , & , 2011: Taxonomic study of the genus Promalactis Meyrick (Lepidoptera: Oecophoridae) from Hainan Province, China.

The reasons included little interest in reform from the major landholders and the Austrian government, population growth resulting in small peasant plots, lack of education, primitive agricultural techniques, and a vicious circle of chronic malnutrition; famine; and disease, reducing productivity. Poverty in the province was so widespread that the term \\"Galician misery\\" (nƒôdza galicyjska) or \\"Galician poverty\\" (bieda galicyjska) has become proverbial, and the poverty and regular famines in the region were often compared to the situation in British Ireland. Causes and contributing factors Food distribution to poor people in Galicia, by Jan Gniewosz (Sanok, 1847) Austria-Hungary failed to create transportation networks necessary for the development of industries and markets throughout the empire. Unlike imperial Germany, the Habsburgs were hostile toward the idea of building railway systems in the provinces, and remained fixated on their own metropolis. The whole of Austrian Bohemia was served by only one line throughout the 1860s. Emperor Francis opposed further construction \\"lest revolution might come into the country.\\" Railways were owned privately in Austria-Hungary before 1881, and only gradually acquired by the state interest until the outbreak of World War One. Viennese banks ‚Äì wrote Clive Trebilcock of Cambridge ‚Äì were tapping the eastern grain-plains [of Galicia] in fully colonial style. The new state borders had cut Galicia off from many of its traditional trade routes and markets of the Polish sphere, resulting in stagnation of economic life and decline of Galician towns. Lviv lost its status as a significant trade center. After a short period of limited investments, the Austrian government started the fiscal exploitation of Galicia and drained the region of manpower through conscription to imperial army. The Austrians decided that Galicia should not develop industrially but remain an agricultural area that would serve as a supplier of food products and raw materials to other Habsburg provinces. New taxes were instituted, investments were discouraged, and cities and towns were neglected.P. R. Magocsi. (1983). Galicia: A Historical Survey and Bibliographic Guide.

Cornell University Press. p. 24 Education Education lagged behind, with only 15% or so of the peasants attending any kind of school, meaning that few peasants had the skills to pursue other careers. Even if they did, no major Galician city (Krak√≥w or Lviv) was a center of significant industry, which gave peasants little alternatives to their profession. The Austrian imperial government showed absolutely no interest in schooling and subsequent reform such as industrialization, which would upset the system in which Galicia was a cheap provider of agricultural products for the Empire, and a market for inferior industrial goods, a situation profitable for both the governments and the landowners. The Austrian government treated Galicia as a colony that could be treated to another country, and overtaxed it rather than invested in it. In what little industry Galicia had, one of the largest local branches (about a third of the total) was alcohol brewing, further exploiting and impoverishing the peasantry. Alcoholism was a major social problem. Agricultural productivity of Galician peasants was one of the lowest in Europe, due to the use of primitive agricultural techniques, many little different from those used in the Middle Ages. The situation in Northern (Polish) Galicia was compounded by the lack of good land and growing population, resulting in the steadily diminishing size of an individual peasant's plot. Over 70% of Galicia population lived off the land. In the second half of the 19th century, with only a marginal increase of arable land (about 7%), the population of peasants doubled. In 1899, 80% of the plots had less than , and many were not able to grow enough food on their plots to support their families. Overpopulation in Galicia has been so severe that it has been described as the most overpopulated place in Europe, and compared to India and China. Emancipation of serfs in 1848 did not improve their situation significantly, as they were given poorly paid jobs by the local major landowners (who owned 43% of the arable land in 1848), doing little to improve the peasants welfare from the previous feudal relations. Due to other changes in the law, peasants also lost access to many forests and pastures, which the large landowners tried to secure for themselves. Results As a result of Galician poverty, Galician peasants were too malnourished to work properly, and had little immunity to diseases such as cholera, typhus, smallpox and syphilis. Stauter-Halsted describes a vicious circle in which Galician peasants worked \\"lethargically because [they were] inadequately nourished and [not living] better because [they] work too little.\\" Frank quotes Szepanowski: \\"every resident of Galicia does one-quarter of a man's work and eats one-half of a man's food.\\" The near constant famines in Galicia, resulting in 50,000 deaths a year, have been described as endemic. Many peasants were heavily in debt, and had lost their land to the money-lenders. Most of those were Jewish; which led to resentment and growing anti-Semitism. The misery of Galician peasants was highlighted by a number of activists such as Ivan Franko, and in several publications, such as Scarcity and Famine in Galicia by Roger ≈Åubie≈Ñski (1880). Stanis≈Çaw Szczepanowski in 1888 published the still widely cited Galician Misery in Numbers and his phrase Galician misery or Galician poverty (nƒôdza galicyjska or bieda galicyjska) became a proverbial description of Galicia, characterizing the depressed economy of the region. In response to the poverty and lack of reform, many peasants chose to emigrate. This process began in the 1870s with few thousand, then over 80,000 emigrated in the 1880s, about 340,000 in the 1890s, and an even greater number in the 1900s. Davies notes that from mid-1890s to 1914 (the start of World War I), at least two million people left Galicia, with at least 400,000 in 1913 alone. Harzig gives an estimate of 3 million. The years 1911‚Äì1914 might have seen the emigration of 25% of Galician population. Some emigration was local, to richer parts of Galicia and nearby Bukovina; others moved to Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia, or other provinces of Austria, Prussia and Russia (including Russian Poland). An increasing number emigrated to the United States (Herzig notes perhaps as many as 800,000 out of her 3 million estimate). Comparisons Norman Davies noted that the situation in Galicia was likely more desperate than in Ireland, and that Galicia was likely \\"the poorest province in Europe\\". Galicia was indeed the poorest of the Austrian provinces and markedly poorer than western Europe. In 1890 the per capita product, in 2010 dollars, for Galicia was $1,947. In contrast, the per capita product in Austria was $3,005 and in Bohemia was $2,513. Galicia was not as poor as eastern Hungary, whose per capita product was $1,824 and Croatia-Slavonia, whose per capita product in 2010 dollars was $1,897. Galicia's per capita product was almost identical to that of Transylvania, which was $1,956 in 2010 dollars. Galicia's annual growth rate from 1870 to 1910 was 1.21 percent, slightly lower than the imperial average of 1.5%. In comparison to other countries, Galicia's 1890 per capita product of $1,947 in 2010 dollars was three times lower than that of the United Kingdom ($6,228) and lower than that of every country in northwestern Europe. However, it was higher than that of Portugal ($1,789), Bulgaria ($1,670), Greece ($1,550), Russia ($1,550), and Serbia ($1,295). Notes a Although as shown by the analysis of late 1840s deaths in Zadoks, many death estimates sum those from hunger and disease. For example, Bodnar attributes the deaths to \\"typhus following the potato famine\\".

The term \\"post-growth\\" acknowledges that economic growth can generate beneficial effects up to a point, but beyond that point (cited as $25,000 GDP/capita by Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett in their book The Spirit Level) it is necessary to look for other indicators and techniques to increase human wellbeing. Post-growth can be distinguished from similar concepts and movements (such as degrowth and steady-state economy) in that it seeks to identify and build on what is already working, rather than focusing on what is not. Post-growth advocates try to encourage, connect and further develop already existing ideas, concepts, technologies, systems, initiatives, and actions. In this way, \\"post-growth\\" does not specify the answer to the limits-to-growth challenge, as \\"steady state economics\\" and \\"degrowth\\" attempt to do, but rather, seeks to understand and address this challenge from an evolving complex systems perspective. With this perspective, post-growth deals with all aspects of self and society (such as psychology, human nature, human evolution, cultures, social systems and economies) and the interrelation of all of these aspects. Accordingly, the post-growth concept also advocates solutions that are appropriate with regards to place, time, resource and cultural factors. Therefore, post-growth initiatives take shape in very different ways under different circumstances. Post-growth can be considered an asset-based approach to community development ‚Äî applied not only to community development but across a wide range of categories ‚Äî in response to limits-to-growth challenges, as it seeks to identify and build on cultural and technological assets to facilitate the emergence of post-growth futures. In his landmark work Prosperity Without Growth (Routledge, 2017), the economist Tim Jackson demonstrates that building a ‚Äòpost-growth‚Äô economy is indeed a \\"precise, definable and meaningful task\\". Starting from clear first principles, he sets out the dimensions of that task: the nature of enterprise; the quality of our working lives; the structure of investment; and the role of the money supply.  Foundational points  The foundational points that connect \\"post-growth\\" perspectives are: * Acknowledging limits to economic and population growth. * Recognising that, due to these limits, it is necessary to embrace shifting beyond economic growth as a goal. * Shifting focus from current metrics of success such as GDP to new ones such as Gross national happiness (GNH), the Happy Planet Index, and/or other well-being indices. * Using wisdom gained in the growth-based economic era (and before it) in order to transcend to sustainable futures. * Thinking and acting according to values of cooperation, sharing, social justice and ecological stewardship, on local as well as global levels.  Post-growth initiatives  A main concept present in the post-growth movement is that there is not one post-growth future, but a diverse range of post-growth futures that can unfold simultaneously. There is an increasing number of post-growth-oriented initiatives that are emerging in order to create prosperity in locally resilient, self-sufficient ways. Often these initiatives have come about as a response to sustainability issues. One example of a post-growth initiative is the Transition Movement, which seeks to create local resiliency in the context of peak oil and climate change (Transition Network). Voluntary simplicity (also known as simple living) and downshifting are also growing trends that can be considered post-growth. Tiny homes, ecovillages, and Quakers are good examples of how voluntary simplicity can be put into practice (see the Testimony of Simplicity). Post-growth ideas and actions are gaining international attention in the mainstream media, as The Guardian and Treehugger both featured articles about the post-growth movement in 2012. Free Money Day is an annual, global post-growth event, in which people give away money to strangers as a way of sparking dialogues and critical thinking about money, peoples' relationships with money, and the value of economics based on sharing. In 2012, the Post Growth Institute released the (En)Rich List, a parody of the Forbes List of Billionaires that aimed to highlight influential post-growth thinkers ‚Äúwhose collective contributions enrich paths to sustainable futures‚Äù.  Related organizations  There are many organizations worldwide that are dealing explicitly with ideas about how to move beyond the growth-centered paradigm. These include: the Post Growth Institute; the Center for the Advancement of the Steady State Economy; the Center for a New American Dream; Centre for the Understanding of Sustainable Prosperity (CUSP), the Danish Degrowth Network; Degrowth Vancouver; the Donella Meadows Institute; Feasta: The Foundation for the Economics of Sustainability, Growthbusters; Gund Institute for Ecological Economics; the Institute for Studies in Happiness, Economy and Society; the International Society for Ecological Economics; Mouvement Quebecois pour une Decroissance Conviviale; New Economics Foundation; New Economics Institute; the Population Institute; Population Media Center; the Post Carbon Institute; Research and Degrowth; the Simplicity Institute; the Transition Culture (Transition Towns); The Zeitgeist Movement; and Via Campesina.

He held the title of a Count of Lebenau (1254‚Äì1279) and was nominal Duke of Carinthia. With his death the senior line of the House of Sponheim came to an end. Life Philipp was the younger son of Duke Bernhard of Carinthia (died 1256) and his wife Judith, daughter of the P≈ôemyslid king Ottokar I of Bohemia. Raised at the court of his maternal uncle King Wenceslaus I, he prepared for an ecclesiastical career as provost of the Vy≈°ehrad collegiate church and Bohemian chancellor. However, when in 1247 the Salzburg chapter elected him archbishop, he renounced his consecration in order to reserve the succession of his elder brother Ulrich III for himself. Instead je joined his father on military campaigns to Styria and into the Lungau region; in 1252 they defeated the united troops of Count Meinhard III of Gorizia and his father-in-law Count Albert IV of Tyrol near Greifenburg and conquered large estates in Upper Carinthia. In 1254 Philip tried to regain former Spanheim comital rights around Lebenau Castle (near Laufen), which had been purchased by the Salzburg archbishops. In turn, he was finally overthrown and banned by the Salzburg chapter in 1257, he could however prevail against his successor Ulrich of Seckau with the military support by his brother Ulrich III. Philip continued his belligerence and in 1260 fought with his P≈ôemyslid cousin King Ottokar II of Bohemia in the Battle of Kressenbrunn against the forces of King B√©la IV of Hungary. After in 1265 his maternal cousin Ladislaus of Silesia was elected Salzburg archbishop with papal consent, Philip finally was forced to resign. In 1269 he was elected Archbishop of Aquileia, though his election was never acknowledged by the Pope and in 1273 Pope Gregory X appointed Raimondo della Torre instead. Moreover, in October 1269 his brother Duke Ulrich III died, and he had secretly bequested the Carinthian duchy to King Ottokar II, who immediately expelled Philip from his acquisitions. He again attempted to install himself as a Count of Lebenau and even reached the enfeoffment with Carinthia by the new King Rudolf I of Germany, though to no avail. Ottokar had no intentions to relinquish his claims until he was finally defeated by King Rudolf in the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld. Philip however had to stay in Rudolf's Duchy of Austria without ever returning to Carinthia. One year later he died in Krems an der Donau, where his epitaph is preserved in the Dominican Church.

Jaime promises that Tywin will reward Locke if Jaime is returned; Locke feigns acceptance but is actually offended, and severs Jaime's sword hand. Production \\"Walk of Punishment\\" was written and directed by producers D.B. Weiss and David Benioff. Writing \\"Walk of Punishment\\" was written by the show creators and executive producers David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, based on material from George R. R. Martin's novel A Storm of Swords. The episode adapts parts of chapters 15, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 28, 32, 34 and 36 of the book (Catelyn II, Jon II, Arya III, Tyrion III, Jaime III, Daenerys II, Daenerys III, Jaime IV, Samwell II and Catelyn IV). The writers also included original storylines including Theon's flight, Tyrion bringing Podrick to a brothel, and Melisandre departing Dragonstone. In the scene at the brothel, Tyrion claims that the last prostitute he introduces is one of the few women in the world able to perform \\"the Meereenese Knot\\". This is an inside joke referring to the name that Martin gave (after the legendary Gordian Knot) to a complicated structural problem that he had to face while writing the fifth book of the series, A Dance with Dragons. This book had to synchronize the arrival of several characters in the city of Meereen while keeping the chronology and causations in line and informing the reader of events happening in places where no point-of-view character was present. Martin worked on solving \\"the Meereenese Knot\\" from 2005 to 2011, and it was one of the main causes behind the late delivery of the book. Directing The episode was directed by the writing team itself, although to comply with the rules of the Directors Guild of America only Benioff is credited for directing. For both Benioff and Weiss, it was their first direction experience though the former had previously directed an experimental short film \\"When the Nines Roll Over\\". Casting \\"Walk of Punishment\\" introduces the Tully family at Riverrun, marking the first appearances of Lady Catelyn's uncle Brynden Tully, played by Clive Russell, and her brother Edmure, played by Tobias Menzies. Edmure Tully is depicted in the show more harshly than in the books. Talking about his character, Menzies described him as \\"as comic as Game of Thrones gets ... He's a little flawed, really.\\" Dean-Charles Chapman first appears in the role of Martyn Lannister in this episode. In Season 4, however, Chapman returns portraying a different character: Tommen Baratheon, who was played by Callum Wharry in previous seasons. Filming locations The river Quoile was used to depict the surroundings of the Riverrun castle The interiors of the episode were filmed at the Paint Hall Studios in Belfast, the show's base of operations. For the exterior shots the production used many other locations across Northern Ireland: the Redhall State (County Antrim) for the Inn at the Crossroads, the Clandeboye Estate (County Down) for Craster's Keep, Downhill Strand (County Londonderry) as the coast of Dragonstone, and the River Quoile (County Down) as the setting of Lord Hoster Tully's funeral. The storylines led by Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen continued to be filmed in Iceland and in the Moroccan city of Essaouira respectively. Music The band of Locke's men sing \\"The Bear and the Maiden Fair\\", heard for the first time in the series with music composed by Ramin Djawadi. The song, a very popular song in Westeros both among the commoners and the nobility, appears often in the original novels. Singing at the head of the group is Snow Patrol's frontman Gary Lightbody, in a cameo appearance. The closing credits reprise the song in a new version recorded specifically for the series by the indie band The Hold Steady. The group, one of Benioff and Weiss's favourite bands, was chosen because they wanted the rendition \\"to be bawdy and a little sloppy ‚Äì drunken musicians getting up on the table and jamming while the rowdy party continues around them\\". The decision to place the song at the end of the episode, right after the amputation of Jaime's hand, was made to reinforce the surprise of the viewers: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs such a shocking ending and when we read the scene in the books it was so shocking to us. To really hammer home the shock of that moment you need something unexpected. There‚Äôs no version of a traditional score that would keep you as off balance as we wanted that scene to leaving you feeling.‚Äù Reception Ratings \\"Walk of Punishment\\"'s first airing was seen by 4.7 million viewers, setting a new viewership record for the show. Taking into account the viewers of the later repeat the figures rose to 5.8 million. In the United Kingdom, the episode was seen by 1.173 million viewers on Sky Atlantic, being the channel's highest-rated broadcast that week. Critical reception The episode was praised by critics; review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes surveyed 21 reviews of the episode and judged 95% of them to be positive with an average score of 8.3 out of 10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"A bit of well-placed levity perfectly complements the shocking final scenes of 'Walk of Punishment', adding up to hands down the most thrilling episode of the season so far‚Äîminus one hand.\\" Matt Fowler, writing for IGN, rated the episode 8.8/10, writing \\"A shocking chop and a rollicking rock song led us out of a strong Thrones episode.\\" Writing for the A.V. Club, David Sims rated the episode an A-. Also at The A.V. Club Emily VanDerWerff gave the episode another A-, praising its quickening of narrative pace. Time magazine reviewer James Poniewozik praised the episode, writing \\"...one thing I love about it ‚Äì as a fan of fantasy fiction since I was a kid ‚Äì is that it has a level of ugly realism missing from much of the genre.\\"  References   External links  * \\"Walk of Punishment\\" at HBO.com * * Category:2013 American television episodes Category:Game of Thrones (season 3) episodes Category:Television episodes written by David Benioff and D.B.

The story line of the game is similar to a fairy tale. In the absence of the king, a kingdom was captured by some evil enemies. As warrior for the King, players band together and fight enemies in order to free the princess. The game has 3D-style graphics that use Flash Player. When you have finished the main quest of the game, you will unlock dungeon mode. In dungeon mode, you face short levels and can get powerful set items. Also, every 2 weeks there's an event, and to participate in the bronze grade (first grade of the 4 grades) you need a power level of 1100 points. In events, you can get some of the most powerful items in the whole game.  Gameplay  Like similar role-playing games, KingsRoad deals with different character classes of brave warriors, 3 to be exact, the archer, knight and the wizard. Players fight monsters in a traditional RPG setting. While playing different maps the players level up and gain different abilities. Players choose different ability levels, which relate to the ease of completing the game. There are different scoreboards in the KingsRoad world. You can talk to friends. You can friend people. You can join, and create guilds and parties. There are also arenas. Friends may be invited, for a maximum of 3 for regular co-op, and 4 for Battle Coliseum fights. There are (daily) Achievements for which you can earn rewards.  Development  Greg Richardson and Mark Spenner, two former Electronic Arts employees, were involved in the creation of the game. They created with the idea of a city called Alderstone.  Characters  In Kings road there are 3 classes: The Archer, Knight, and Wizard. Each of these classes are known for their defining abilities in battle. The archer is skilled at range, while the knight specializes in melee combat and brute force. The Wizard casts magical spells. There are other characters in the hub area, which is known as Longford Square. They have certain abilities, such as socketing jewels, bring the player to the Dragon Village, or store items in bank form.

Education Born in Aswan on April 6, 1930, Kaiser received his primary and secondary schooling in Egypt. He took his undergraduate education at Cairo University, completing a Bachelor of Science degree in Agriculture in 1949. In 1962, he earned a Master of Science degree at Ain Shams University, with his thesis on hosts and ecological relationships of Egyptian Hyalomma ticks. He completed his Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1965 at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, with his research conducted at the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). His dissertation resulted in the publication of five scientific papers describing a new subgenus and species of Argas, a rearing method for argasids, vector relationships and transmission of Quaranfil and Nyamanini viruses, and the inability of the fowl argasid Argas persicus (which also parasitizes wild birds) to transmit St. Louis encephalitis virus.Biological and Virological Studies of a New Species, Argas arboreus (Ixodoidea, Argasidae) a Parasite of Wild Birds, with Special Reference to A. persicus (Oken, 1818), by Makram Nasri Kaiser, B.Sc., University of Cairo, 1949, M.Sc., University of Ain Shams, 1962; Adviser: C. G. Goodchild. A Thesis submitted to the Faculty of the Graduate School of Emory University in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, 1965, https://archive.org/details/BiologicalAndVirologicalStudiesOfANewSpeciesArgasArboreusAParasite The last finding resolved an important epidemiological question concerning tick involvement in the American viral encephalitides. Career After completing his undergraduate education at Cairo University, Kaiser joined US Naval Medical Research Unit No. 3 (NAMRU-3), in Cairo, Egypt as a technical assistant, rising first to research associate and then to Deputy Head of the Department of Medical Zoology in 1965. In addition to his scientific labors, he provided administrative and management expertise to the department and intramural and extramural projects crucial to the unit's operations. He organized field teams and supervised on-site collecting in Egypt, guided visiting scientists into the Sahara and Eastern deserts and conducted zoological and serological expeditions in Turkey, Lebanon, Kuwait, Yemen, Sudan, Ethiopia, Afghanistan and southern Europe. In collaboration with the National Institute of Health's Rocky Mountain Laboratory, the University of Maryland-Kuala Lumpur Institute for Medical Research, Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), University of Sri Lanka, and the East African Veterinary Research Organization, he provided expertise on ticks and tick-associated problems in Ethiopia, Malaysia, Thailand, Australia, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda. He also performed research in Cairo elucidating the epidemiology and public health impact of ticks parasitizing birds migrating to and from Europe, Asia and Africa through Egypt. After completing his doctorate, Kaiser returned to NAMRU-3 and worked on a number of public health projects during the following decade. In 1975, he retired from NAMRU-3 and took a position as Expert Consultant with the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, accepting a 4-year tour in Uganda investigating the ecology of cattle ticks and quantifying tick burdens on Zebu cattle. A follow-on assignment took him to Burundi for a 7-year tour continuing his studies of the ecology, population dynamics and control of ticks on Zebu cattle. Later postings with the FAO took him to St. Lucia and Ethiopia, where he consulted at tick-control project sites. In 1990 he retired from active service and returned to his home in Heliopolis, where he died on June 9, 1996. Hyalomma species ticks occur in the Mediterranean basin and Africa eastward to India. Due to their extreme infraspecific variability, they are particularly difficult to identify. Kaiser was considered by his peers to be the only taxonomist ever to have mastered the genus. Noted authorities in the fields of ticks and tickborne diseases with whom Kaiser published over 80 scientific papers during his career include Jane Brotherton Walker, Robert W. Sutherst, Robert E. Shope, Richard A. Ormsbee, Harry Hoogstraal, Glen M. Kohls, Carleton M. Clifford, and Jordi Casals. Honors Kaiser's contributions to tick taxonomy were honored by his peers with the naming of the species Ixodes kaiseri Arthur, 1957 and the Haemaphysalis subgenus Kaiseriana Santos Dias, 1963. The scientific name of the bushy-tailed jird subspecies found in the Eastern Desert of Egypt, Sekeetamys calurus makrami (Setzer, 1961), honors his collecting activities.

In October 1998 Roccon left Liga Veneta‚ÄìLega Nord and was a founding member of Liga Veneta Repubblica (LVR), along with Fabrizio Comencini and other four regional councillors. In the 2000 regional election LVR failed to field a list in the province of Belluno and, thus, Roccon was not re-elected. In May 2003 Roccon was elected mayor of Castellavazzo (Belluno) with 51.4% of the vote. In April 2008 he was re-elected by a landslide with 62.7% of the vote. Having joined The People of Freedom, he served as president of the provincial public utility until November 2011. During his tenure as president of BIM‚ÄìGPS he was often criticized by his former colleagues of the League, especially by Gianpaolo Bottacin, president of the Province.

The first Festival took place on 30 December 2012, in the Cattle Depot Artist Village (). It was founded on 6 August 2012, and organized by \\"Original Sound\\", which aims to provide platforms for youngsters whose skills or psychological qualities may not be able to meet the international levels to share their music.  Organizer  \\"Original Sound\\" is a non-profit organization which aims to encourage the interactivity and creativity of sound and multimedia art. They also contribute to the promotion of community culture and enhance citizens' engagement in developing local art culture.  Location  Since the Festival is hosted by a non-profit organization, the Cattle Depot Artist Village was chosen as the venue of the event without any renting cost. Cattle Depot Artist Village is a piece of institutional land for art performers to develop their art career. For instance, artists can rent the land for studio usage or art performance.  Purposes of promoting local Jazz music  Music education has become more popular due to the development of information and communication technology. With this favorable condition, the number of teens playing jazz music has grown substantially. However, local jazz is hard to be widespread as Hong Kong audiences are more interested in reputed western music instead of indigenous one. Thus, young jazz musicians lack a platform to perform. In view of that, the Festival acts as an intermediate to allow these enthusiastic adolescents to perform music and promote the innovation of the new generation of jazz musicians, who are intended to spread the culture of jazz music to teenagers.  Hong Kong Green Jazz Festival 2012  The first Hong Kong Green Festival was held on Sunday, 30 December 2012, at Cattle Depot Artist Village without charging any entrance fee. In view of that, it attracts teenagers to join especially for students who cannot afford the charge of music performance or concerts. At the end of the day, there were around 400 live audiences for five bands formed by youth performers and two guest performer-bands.

Life He was younger son of John Leigh (died 31 March 1576) and of Joan, daughter and heir of Sir John Oliph of Foxgrave, Kent, an alderman of London. His eldest brother was Sir Oliph Leigh (1560-1612). Canada voyage Charles Leigh fitted out, in partnership with Abraham van Harwick, two ships, the Hopewell of 120 and the Chancewell of 70 tons burden, for a voyage to St. Lawrence River; and sailed from Gravesend on 8 April 1597. Leigh and Stephen van Harwick, brother of Abraham, went as chief commanders. The purpose of the voyage was partly fishing and trade, but partly also to plunder Spanish ships. They left Falmouth on 28 April, and after touching at Cape Race, and sighting Cape Breton, on 11 June the Hopewell anchored off the island of Menego‚Äìapparently St. Paul's‚Äìto the north of Cape Breton. They had lost sight of the Chancewell off the bay of Placentia. On the 14th they came to the Bird Rocks and on the 16th to Brian's Island. On the 18th they came to Ramea. There in a harbour called Halabolina they found four ships, two French from St. Halo, the others from St. Jean de Luz. Leigh insisted that these must be Spaniards, and seized their powder as a measure of security. But next day the French gathered in force, to the number of 200, from other ships and residents in different parts of the island, retook the powder, claimed Leigh's largest boat, and drove the English out of the harbour. Coming again to Menego and Cape Breton on the 27th they met a boat with eight of the Chancewell's men, from whom they learnt that the Chancewell had been wrecked on the coast of Cape Breton. After rescuing all the Chancewell's men, they crossed over to Newfoundland. On 25 July they took, after a sharp action in the harbour of St. Mary, a large Breton ship. Leigh moved to this ship, dividing the men between her and the Hopewell, and put to sea on 2 August. They left the coast of Newfoundland on 3 August to make directly for England. The Hopewell parted company shortly afterwards, on an independent cruise off the Azores; but Leigh landed on the Isle of Wight on 5 September. A few days later his ship arrived in the River Thames, where she was made a prize. South America voyage After this, Leigh made other voyages, not well documented, with a view to establishing a colony to look for gold in Guiana. Leigh sailed from Woolwich on 21 March 1604 in the Olive Plant, a barque of 50 tons, with a crew of 46. Master was Martin Prinx, identified as Martin Pring. He later led a mutiny against Leigh's settlement plans. Touching at Mogador, sighting the Cape Verde Islands and some of the West Indies, they arrived on 11 May in the fresh water of the Amazon River. After some trading they left the Amazon; and on 22 May arrived in a river which Leigh calls the Wiapogo (Oyapoc). The local Amerindians, who were oppressed by the Carib people, were anxious that the English should settle there; they gave them huts and clearings, supplied them with food, and expressed a desire to learn the Christian religion. One of them had been in England, and could speak a little English. Leigh went on an exploring expedition ninety miles up the river Aracawa, trading and making vain inquiries for gold. When he returned almost every one in the little colony was sick. On 2 July 1604 Leigh wrote to his brother giving an account of his proceedings, and desiring him to send out further supplies (letter dated from Principium or Mount Howard). At the same time he wrote to the council, asking for the king's protection for emigrants to the colony, and that preachers might be sent. Supplies sent out by Sir Oliph Leigh arrived in January; they found everybody ill. Leigh himself was very weak and much changed. He resolved to go home, promising the men that he would come back to them as soon as possible. He was ready to go, but fell ill and died aboard his ship. He was buried on shore 20 March 1605.

Biography  Clotilde began studying flute and singing at the conservatoire at the age of five. Clotilde went on to complete her studies in jazz and improvised music at the IACP and EDIM schools. She also explored world music vocal techniques and developed an original approach to the voice as a multifaceted and narrative instrument. In 2007, Clotilde released the Live au 7 L√©zards album, on which she was accompanied by guitarist Hugo Lippi. This self-produced album was acclaimed by Jazzman, Jazzmag and Jazzhot magazines. In 2008, Clotilde started a new and ambitious project, In Extremis, with Olivier Hutman (piano), Dano Haider (seven-string guitar) and Antoine Paganotti (drums). Her concept was a bass-less quartet, inspired by various musical cultures including improvisation, pop and world music, mainly from Africa and South Africa. Released in 2011, this album was ranked No. 5 on The Sunday Times list of the Top Ten Jazz Albums of the Year, and received great reviews particularly from T√âL√âRAMA and France Musique. Since 2010, Clotilde has developed a fruitful collaboration with bandon√©onist and composer Tristan Mac√©. Their first project was Le Diable √† froid (2010), a trio with horn-player Albin Leboss√©, revolving around the musical and literary styles of surrealism, Dadaism and tango. Next came Tristan Mac√©‚Äôs jazz opera Etrangement Bleu (2011). Their most recent project is Fleurs Invincibles ‚Äì Invincible Flowers (2012), also involving Emmanuel Bex (piano/organ), Yann Cl√©ry (flutes), Laurent Salzard (bass) and Gautier Garrigue (drums). This bilingual project is based on original compositions by Tristan Mac√©, and inspired by texts from American poets of the Beat Generation, and black French poets of the 40s and 50s.  Style  Clotilde Rullaud‚Äôs artistic approach stands at the crossroad of various musical influences. She blends together Latin music (genre), African, pop and jazz sounds, attesting to the wonderful melting pot that is jazz. Poetry and the inner music of words also hold a key place in her artistic world. Clotilde aims above all to challenge what can be done with song and with the voice in order to reach her full expression, escaping from standard configurations to express her love for freedom.

It is located in the Woodward Corridor, a densely populated region along Woodward Avenue that stretches from Downtown Detroit to the suburb of Pontiac.\\"Testing Ground for a New Detroit: Mayor Mike Duggan‚Äôs Pledges Echo in Detroit‚Äôs North End\\" blog by John Eligon in The New York Times July 6, 2014 The North End has been home to several development initiatives, seen by many as an area for future development extending from Downtown and Midtown. The North End is approximately bound by East Grand Boulevard to the south, Woodward Avenue to the west, bordering New Center; the Chrysler Freeway (I-75) to the east; and Woodland street to the north, bordering Tennyson street in Highland Park.  History  The North End was originally part of Hamtramck Township but was annexed by the City of Detroit in 1891. It received its name due to it being the \\"north end\\" of Paradise Valley. Along with the rest of Detroit, it experienced a cultural and economic boom in the 1920s and 1930s due to the success of the automotive industry, and the district continued to experience growth. Many Motown musicians came from the North End, including Smokey Robinson, Diana Ross, the Four Tops, and Aretha Franklin. The neighborhood began to see an economic downturn in the 1950s. I-75 was built in 1959, dividing the North End from the city center and also destroying the African American neighborhoods of Paradise Valley and Black Bottom. Marygrove College professor Frank D. Rashid has noted that Detroit's vibrant entertainment district Paradise Valley had eventually stretched as far as the North End.  Demographics and education  According to 2000 census data, the North End was home to some 17,500 residents, a 16% decrease in population since 1990. Approximately 94% of this population was African American, 4% white, and some 1% multiracial. The average household income rate for the North End in 2000 was $33,360, below the Detroit average of $40,837. The North End is in the Detroit Public Schools district. 2000 census data showed that over 32% of the population did not have a high school diploma, slightly above the Detroit average.  Development initiatives  In 1994, the Vanguard Community Development Corporation was founded to improve the North End's prospects. The area has since become the site of increasing development. In 2006, the North End was chosen as one of six target areas for $100m funding from The Skillman Foundation, a grantmaking charitable body that focuses on improving the lives of Detroit's children. Its ten-year Good Neighborhoods program provides funding to an area defined as Northend Central, which includes the adjoining New Center area within the targeted neighborhood. In 2011, the North End Neighborhood Investment Strategy was launched as a three-year partnership between Vanguard and the Woodward Corridor Initiative. This public-private partnership has attracted widespread support, including from the City of Detroit, Wayne State University, The Kresge Foundation, and the Skillman Foundation, and aims to create investment within the community, improve education and employment choices, create affordable housing and remove barriers to economic development within the neighborhood. Other organizations contributing to development of the North End include the North End Youth Improvement Council (NEYIC, founded by community activist Delores Bennett), North End Woodward Community Coalition (NEWCC), and the Central Detroit Christian Community Development Corporation (CDC). On March 14, 2016, the Michigan Humane Society opened its new and expanded $15.5 million animal care campus on five acres, including a 35,000 square foot, state-of-the-art veterinary facility, located just east of New Center at 7887 Chrysler Drive near Clay Street. The society said the larger facility will enable it to expand its teaching and training opportunities with Michigan State University‚Äôs College of Veterinary Medicine. On November 11, 2016, the Michigan Urban Farming Initiative (MUFI) announced its plans to implement the first sustainable urban \\"agrihood\\" in the United States. This plan is an extension of the community development work the nonprofit has been doing in the lower North End since 2011 in which MUFI's existing agricultural campus is positioned as the centerpiece of a larger mixed-use development (with a focus on residential). The first of its kind in the country, MUFI's sustainable urban agrihood is a model for its mission to use urban agriculture as a platform to promote education, sustainability and community in an effort to uplift and empower urban neighborhoods, solve social problems, and develop a broader model for redevelopment.

It held that strike action amounted to an unlawful and criminal conspiracy. This attitude prevailed through the 19th century, until trade unions were made lawful by Parliament in the Trade Union Act 1871 and the Conspiracy, and Protection of Property Act 1875. The Trade Disputes Act 1906 confirmed unions' legality at common law once more, and now the position is reflected in international law, particularly the ILO Convention No 87 and 98. Facts A group of workers had founded the London Journeymen Tailors‚Äô Union and held a strike the following year. In response the Journeymen Tailors, London Act 1720 was passed. A case was brought that the union constituted an unlawful conspiracy. Judgment The court heard that the agreement would be contrary to the Journeymen Tailors, London Act 1720. It found, however, that it was unnecessary to rely on the Act, because the union's actions were unlawful at common law.

It is situated close to the Damsterdiep - a channel connecting the city of Groningen to Delfzijl - on two artificial dwelling hills, known locally as 'Wierden'. As of 2013, Wirdum had a population of 300. Church Like almost every small village in Groningen, Wirdum, too, has a historical church around which the village is centered. The church was originally built in the 13th century, although it has gone through some changes such as the removal of the church tower in favor of a Fl√®che in 1878. Damsterdiep The Damsterdiep is a channel connecting the city of Groningen to the coastal town of Delfzijl, allowing access to the Dutch most eastern part of the Wadden Sea, the Eems. Historically the channel can be divided into two parts at the village of Ten Post, approximately 5 km southwest of Wirdum. The oldest northeastern part was constructed before the year 1000 and was directly connected to the sea up until the 14th century. Because of this the course of the channel was affected by tidal changes resulting in a somewhat meandering layout. The southwestern part of the channel, having been constructed much later, was not exposed to such influences allowing it to maintain its original straight course. Until the construction of the far wider and deeper Eemskanaal in the 19th century, the Damsterdiep was an important trade route. Rusthoven and Ekenstein Between Appingedam and Wirdum lie the bordering estates of Rusthoven and Ekenstein, the latter of which currently belongs to the municipality of Appingedam. Both of the estates are characterised by a manor- like building known as a Borg (castle), built in 1648 (Ekenstein) and 1686 (Rusthoven). The estates, lying next to the Damsterdiep, offered easy trade access and a large brickyard was built in the early 19th century, the ruins of which - including an iconic 30-metre chimney - still stand. Although the 'Borgen' are privately owned, the interconnected estate is open to the public as a park.

It is proposed to be one of the Institutes of National Importance (INIs). It was first proposed in 1967, but is unlikely to become operational in the foreseeable future, despite periodic optimism.Cabinet approves setting up of bus bay near Indian Defence University Land in Gurugram, Haryana, business-standard.com, 20 Feb 2018. As of January 2020, only the perimeter road and boundary walls have been constructed, the construction of the main building and teaching infrastructure could not commence until the \\"Indian National Defence University (INDU) Act, 2015\\" is passed, which is still awaiting approval from the Union Cabinet and the Parliament of India in the form of a draft bill. It is located on the eastern flank of Delhi‚ÄìJaipur Expressway (NH 48), just 5 km southwest of Pachgaon Chowk on Western Peripheral Expressway, nearly 11 km southwest of National Security Guard base, 10 km northwest of Heritage Transport Museum, 26 km southwest of Gurugram CBD, and 43 km southwest of IGI International Airport. NHAI has established a bus bay for the university at NH48.  History  The idea for this autonomous institution was initially conceived in 1967, strongly recommended by \\"Sethna Committee\\" in 1980 and the 1999 Kargil War Review Committee, as well as the \\"Group Minister's report on reforming national security system\\" in 2001 recommended its establishment to then Home Minister L. K. Advani, and also by K. Subrahmanyam, the proposal was approved by the Union Cabinet in 2010, Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh laid the foundation stone of the Indian National Defence University (INDU) at Binola in Gurgaon on 23 May 2013. Draft bill was put online in August 2016 for the public consultation, but no progress has been made since then as the bill is still awaiting approval from the Union Cabinet and the Parliament of India. As of September 2019, there is no evidence that the university will ever open, despite earlier optimism. \\"The country certainly needs a ‚Äòworld-class‚Äô INDU to inject some much-needed strategic culture in governance as well as encourage robust cross-linkages between the executive and academia. Almost all major countries, from the US to China, have national defence [uni]varsities (sic) to develop national security leaders as well as undertake long-term strategic studies and threat assessments.\\"  The university  Objectives  The INDU aims to undertake the following: * Promote research-oriented national defence policy. * High level leadership development of officers for military duties and policy formulation responsibilities * Develop and propagate higher education in defence studies like defence management and defence science and technology. * University think tanks for providing policy formulations inputs. The much needed pending three reforms for the national security and military readiness are the integrated tri services operational commands under the Chief of Defence Staff, the make in India indigenous defence manufacturing, and the reform in military education in India. While some progress has been made towards the first two, but the reforms in military education in India are still lacking. The current military training in India trains officers with \\"narrow professional skills to command companies, battalions and brigades, or perform staff duties at various levels, there is practically no attempt to give the officers a sense of the larger contexts ‚Äì strategic, political and international ‚Äì in which the armed forces function. It is only at the highest training establishment, the National Defence College, that senior one-star officers get exposed to some of these issues. This is too little and too late. This outmoded approach to training impacts the quality of human capital at all levels in the services. Yet, no government has paid serious attention to this. The fate of the long-heralded Indian National Defence University is symptomatic of the political leadership‚Äôs neglect of this crucial area.\\"Defence University to Defence Chief ‚Äì Modi govt now has political capital for the big reforms, ThePrint, 2019.  Administration  This autonomous University will be instituted by the Act of the Parliament of India, and President of India will be a Visitor, and the Defence Minister will be the Chancellor. INDU will be governed as per its own norms and will be responsible to promote coordination and interaction between Institutions of Armed Forces or establishments of the country. Defence training institutions will be affiliated to award degrees. The institute will be headed by a President, who will be a three-star serving General or equivalent officer with C-in-C status on appointment, and a Vice-President, who will be a civilian. The university formed on the lines of Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) and Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) will have the teaching faculty composed of military personnel and civilians in the ratio of 1:1. Constituent units  The university will have the following constituent units: * The Centre for Distance and Open learning * The School of Defence Management * The School of Defence Technology * The School of National Security Studies Affiliated institutes of Indian armed forces  Following existing institutes will be affiliated to the university: * College of Defence Management (CDM, Secunderabad, Telangana), * Defence Services Staff College (DSSC, Wellington, Tamil Nadu), * National Defence Academy (NDA, Khadakwasla, Maharashtra) , * National Defence College (NDC, New Delhi).

Ch. 1: Marchesi d'EsteAccording to C. Frison: Folco. In: Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani he possibly still lived in 1134 was the ancestor of the Italian line of the House of Este.  Life  Fulco was a son of Albert Azzo II, Margrave of Milan and Garsende of Maine, the daughter of Herbert I, Count of Maine. After his father's death in 1097, Fulco inherited the family's Italian possessions, which lay mainly in Veneto, around Mantua, Padua, Treviso and Verona, while his older half brother Welf inherited the lands north of the Alps. However, Welf did not accept this division, and unsuccessfully attempted to take these lands from Fulco after their father's death in 1097. The powerful Bavarian line of the family, the Guelphs, did not renounce these lands until the time of Henry the Lion in 1154. In 1070 Fulco's brother Hugh was invited to become Count of Maine, taking over the lands of their maternal grandfather, which had been under Norman or Angevin control since 1051, but had broken free. Fulco's family took their name from the town of Este in Veneto. Fulco made the family's first connections to the nobility of Ferrara, which the Este came to rule a century later.  Family  Fulco had six children: * Azzo IV d'Este (died before 1145) * Bonifacio I d‚ÄôEste (died 1163) * Fulco II d'Este (died before 1172) * Alberto (died after 1184) * Obizzo I d‚ÄôEste (died December 25 1193), grandfather of Azzo VI of Este * Beatrice (1075-1110) (possibly married in 1108 Alfonso VI of Le√≥n and Castile).

It is composed of three short films with different themes, united by a common motif of the 3 A.M. hour, considered as the time when supernatural things tend to occur.‡πÑ‡∏ü‡∏ß‡πå‡∏™‡∏ï‡∏≤‡∏£‡πå ‡πÄ‡∏õ‡∏¥‡∏î‡∏ï‡∏±‡∏ß‡∏†‡∏≤‡∏û‡∏¢‡∏ô‡∏ï‡∏£‡πå 3 ‡∏°‡∏¥‡∏ï‡∏¥‡πÄ‡∏£‡∏∑‡πà‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏•‡πà‡∏≤‡∏™‡∏∏‡∏î ‚Äú‡∏ï‡∏µ‡∏™‡∏≤‡∏°‚Äù 3D Synopsis 3AM is divided into three stories: The Wig, Corpse Bride, and O.T. None of the stories intersect; however, they do have a common motif of having supernatural things occur around 3 A.M. The Wig Sisters May (Focus Jirakul) and Mint (Apinya Sakuljaroensuk) are left to run their family business, a wig shop, while their parents are on a vacation in China. A customer offers to sell May some human hair of great quality, without knowledge that the hair was illegally salvaged from a female corpse, and that the salvager seemingly committed suicide. May works overtime weaving the new wig, but a female apparition haunts her, presumably the owner of the hair. Mint then returns with three friends to continue partying at home, and May is infuriated as one of the friends carelessly toys with a wig. After the sisters argue, Mint orders her friend to return the wig to its rightful place, but finds him decapitated in the stock room as he fails to return. The ghost now torments the remaining party of four, then killing Mint's remaining two friends. The sisters then seek refuge in the kiln dry room, and the female ghost traps May inside the kiln dryer. Mint attempts to pry open the door in vain, and the machine overheats and explodes. The impact slams Mint towards the wall, but May is nowhere to be seen. Awaken to the sound of her parents' return, Mint tries to explain last night's ordeal, but is disturbed by a distraught May, and the fact that everyone ignores her. Mint realizes that she has died from the explosion, being impaled by a glass shard, and that the ghost now inhabits May's body. Corpse Bride Junior mortician Tod (Tony Rakkaen) is assigned to be stationed at the bridal home of Mike (Peter Knight) and Cherry (Karnklao ‚ÄúGrace‚Äù Duaysianklao), an engaged couple who died a week before their wedding. While performing rituals and maintenance, Tod opens Cherry's coffin in an attempt to oust an intruding lizard, but is infatuated with Cherry's beauty. After seeing a dream of Cherry crying for help and uncovering some clues suggesting Mike was jealous and abusive, Tod separates the couple and gets intimate with Cherry's corpse, hoping to at least save Cherry from Mike even after death. As Tod sleeps with Cherry's corpse one night, Tod goes into the hallway to check on some noise, only to be frightened by Mike's ghost. After retreating back into the bedroom, Cherry drags Tod under the bed and stabs his ankle. A frightened Tod then bumps into Mike's corpse, only to be struck by a revelation: Mike bounded Cherry not over jealousy, but to prevent her from committing suicide. After Mike unties Cherry out of guilt and sympathy, Cherry overpowers Mike and breaks a glass figurine. Mike struggles to get the glass shard from Cherry's hand, only to have Cherry slash his jugular veins. Cherry then proceeds to slit her own throat and dies. Cherry then asks whether Tod no longer loves her in the same manner she did Mike. Revealing her now rotten face, she kisses Tod, causing him to faint out of fright. Tod awakens and panics as he is trapped inside a coffin, with Cherry sitting on top, claiming her new lover. O.T. Executives Karan (Chakrit Yamnam) and Tee (Ray MacDonald) take pleasure in playing ghostly pranks on their employees on a daily basis. After scaring off Bump (Prachakorn Piyasakulkaew) and Ging (Kanyarin Nithinaparath) with a floating head, they proceed to spook a transsexual employee. Rejoicing their success in pulling off such pranks, Bump and Ging make a failed attempt to spook them, and then claim that they returned to prepare documents for tomorrow's meeting. After the four pull off one gruesome prank over another on each other, they decide to return home. However, while in the elevator, both Karan and Tee each receive a phone call, saying that Bump and Ging were found dead under the stairs. It turns out that Bump and Ging fell off the stairs and plummeted into the first floor after being frightened from Karan and Tee's floating head prank. Realizing the two employees behind them are already dead, Karan reaches for the buttons to get off, but is hindered by Bump. The short ends showing the elevator descending into the darkness.

Kissinger and his State Department believed that solving the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict would win the good will of the Arabs and thwart Moscow's regional ambitions. * Kissinger and State Department were doubtful of Margaret Thatcher's prospects of becoming the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom because of her \\"immaculate grooming\\" and \\"imperious manner\\", and \\"None of this goes down well with the working class of England\\". * The Vatican dismissed reports of massacres committed by Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet as \\"propaganda\\". After realising the full extent of the human rights violations being carried out, the Vatican still refused to criticise Pinochet's regime openly and continued with normal diplomatic relations. * George Fernandes, chairman of the Socialist Party of India, who had faced prosecution for conspiracy against the government of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, sought to obtain funding from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the French government in order to organize underground sabotage activities. After an initial request to seek funding from the French government was turned down, U.S. diplomatic cables showed that he was \\"prepared to accept money from the CIA\\".

It was first published in book form in MacNeice's poetry collection The Earth Compels (1938). The poem begins with memories of idyllic summer days in the countryside - \\"the unenduring / Joys of a season\\" - before returning to the present and \\"impending thunder\\". June Thunder is written in a loose form of the sapphic stanza, with three lines set in falling rhythm followed by a shorter fourth line. The poem was anthologised in A New Anthology of Modern Verse 1920-1940 (1941), edited by Cecil Day-Lewis and L.A.G. Strong, and Penguin New Writing No. 2 (January 1941). Themes Jon Stallworthy, in his biography of Louis MacNeice, links June Thunder to The Sunlight on the Garden, the poem that immediately follows June Thunder in MacNeice's 1938 poetry collection The Earth Compels.Jon Stallworthy: Louis MacNeice, p. 201-2. The two poems show MacNeice thinking along much the same lines and using the same imagery, with \\"birds\\", \\"sky\\", \\"garden\\", \\"thunder\\" and \\"rain\\" as shared words. June Thunder begins with memories of earlier, idyllic summer days. The opening stanza, which describes \\"driving through tiny / Roads, the mudguards brushing the cowparsley\\", is similar in tone to section viii of Autumn Journal (1939), in which MacNeice recalls how he \\"drove around Shropshire in a bijou car\\" together with his first wife Mary Ezra.Louis MacNeice: Autumn Journal (1939), section viii. The second stanza, describing chalkland in summer, with beech trees and gorse, suggests the countryside close to Marlborough College, where MacNeice was a pupil. (As a schoolboy, MacNeice had indulged in \\"long bicycle rides into the Wiltshire countryside\\" with his close friend Graham Shepard.)Jon Stallworthy: Louis MacNeice, p. 81. In the third stanza the tone changes as the poem returns to the present and \\"impending thunder\\". Rain \\"comes / Down like a dropscene\\", and is followed by thunder - \\"clouds like falling masonry\\" - and lightning. The final stanza sees the poet alone and yearning for his lover's presence: \\"If only you would come...\\" Structure June Thunder is a poem of seven stanzas, each of four lines. The poem does not make use of a rhyme scheme. The poem is written in a loose form of the sapphic stanza, and is included by Grace Schulman in a list of English poems that are \\"sapphics-inspired\\".Grace Schulman, Sapphics, in An Exaltation of Forms: Contemporary Poets Celebrate the Diversity of Their Art, edited by Annie Finch and Kathrine Varnes. University of Michigan Press, 2002. The short fourth line of each stanza is an Adonic, as in a sapphic stanza: \\"Joys of a season\\". However, the long lines vary from ten to fourteen syllables, and \\"make no pretence at exact adherence to the paradigm.\\"Harvey Gross and Robert McDowell: Sound and Form in Modern Poetry, p. 249. According to Harvey Gross and Robert McDowell, \\"MacNeice infuses his sapphics with those qualities of yearning and wonder that characterize the great examples of the form.\\"Harvey Gross and Robert McDowell: Sound and Form in Modern Poetry, p. 249.

When the massacre started Haukland was on vacation, which had been postponed several times to deal with events in the United Nations Safe Areas that he was responsible for.

He is the founder of MBF Healthcare Partners, a private equity firm founded in 2005 in Coral Gables, Florida. Fernandez is a major Republican donor. Early life and education Fernandez was born in Manzanillo, Cuba, the elder of two children of Lieba Fernandez and Mario Antonio Fernandez. Fernandez has a younger sister, Pilar Giorgini (Pilar de los Angeles Fernandez). On Christmas Day, 1964, Fernandez and his family were escorted by the Cuban military out of their own house and told to leave Cuba. The Fernandez family landed in Mexico City, and lived in a convent temporarily and then with other Mexican families. After six months of living in Mexico, the Fernandez family received their U.S. visas and made their way to New York City. Fernandez received a scholarship to attend Xavier High School, an all-boys Jesuit high school in the heart of Manhattan. A proud man, Mario told his son \\"we do not take charity nor are you disabled. Get a job and we will split the tuition\\". On weeknights, Fernandez worked at the New York State Psychiatric Institute, part of Presbyterian Hospital, cleaning cages of animals that were used in experiments. On weekends, Fernandez worked at the American Museum of Natural History at the kiosk stand selling souvenirs. Fernandez attended the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque and subsequently enlisted in the Army. Career In 1975, after serving in the United States Army, Fernandez began his career in the insurance field. After seeing an opportunity in packaging health insurance with life insurance policies, Fernandez began selling health insurance to existing clients. In 1981 Fernandez started Group Tech System, the first national database on health insurance quoting programs. Group tech became Comprehensive Benefit Administrators Inc. (CBAI) which was sold to Ramsay HMO. Ramsay HMO was the second-largest publicly held HMO in Florida during the early 1990s. Ramsay HMO was sold to United Healthcare in 1993, and at the time Fernandez was the second largest shareholder. In 1993, Fernandez started Physician's Healthcare Plans (PHP) based in Tampa FL. The company was sold to AmeriGroup in 2002. From 2002 to 2005 Fernandez started CarePlus Health. In 2005, he sold CarePlus Health Plans, a company he founded, to Humana, and founded MBF Healthcare Partners, a private equity firm in Coral Gables. His latest sale included Simply Healthcare Plans which was sold to Anthem in 2015. He has been the Founder and/or majority shareholder of 25 healthcare related companies. Most of these companies have been acquired by publicly traded companies. Among these enterprises are Physicians Healthcare Plans, CAC Medical Centers, Prescribit Rx, CarePlus Health Plans, Navarro Pharmacies, Medical Specialties Distributors, Hospitalists of America, NutriForce and Simply Healthcare Plans. After every sale, Fernandez distributes a significant portion to the company's employees. He has done this over two dozen times. In addition, he has been an active investor in other healthcare companies. Charity  At a very young age, Fernandez learned the value of \\"to take care of those who come after you\\". He completed a 508-mile walk from France and Spain multiple times, in order to raise funds for a variety of children's causes. Over the past 20 years, he has contributed in excess of $100 million to charitable causes.  Politics  Political contributions Fernandez is a Republican donor. In 2016, the New York Times wrote that Fernandez was \\"one of the most prolific donors in a key swing state\\" (Florida), contributing more than $4 million to Republicans in recent elections.Alexander Burns & Jonathan Martin, These Wealthy People Refuse to Give Donald Trump Money. Here‚Äôs Why, New York Times (May 21, 2016). The Miami Herald has described Fernandez as \\"one of Florida's biggest conservative Republican moneymen.\\"Patricia Mazzei, Top Jeb Bush political donor in Miami: I'll vote for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump, Miami Herald (December 4, 2015). Fernandez was a major supporter of Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign. Fernandez donated $1 million to Restore Our Future, a pro-Romney super PAC. In 2013, Fernandez donated $1 million to Florida Governor Rick Scott in his re-election campaign. Fernandez was the chair of the finance committee for Scott's campaign. During the 2016 election cycle, Fernandez was a major supporter of Jeb Bush, who unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination. Fernandez donated $3.2 million to Bush and his \\"Right to Rise\\" super PAC, making him Bush's largest donor and (as of February 2016) the 16th largest donor of the 2016 presidential election. He was ranked one of Newsmaxs \\"50 Most Influential Latino Republicans\\" in 2016.John Blosser, Newsmax's 50 Most Influential Latino Republicans, Newsmax (February 24, 2016). Although a Republican, Fernandez is an opponent of Donald Trump, the 2016 Republican nominee. During the Republican primaries, Fernandez funded newspaper ads comparing Trump to Hitler, Mussolini, and Per√≥n. Fernandez endorsed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the presidential election, saying that she is \\"a superior choice to Donald Trump.\\"Aaron Blake, There are now dozens of big-name Republicans supporting Hillary Clinton for president, Washington Post (August 19, 2016). Political views and Cuba-U.S. relations Fernandez has praised the Massachusetts health care reform enacted under Mitt Romney, but opposes the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Although a Republican and opponent of President Obama, Fernandez (who was born in Cuba), supported Obama's decision to normalize relations with Cuba and lift the U.S. embargo against Cuba, a decision that Fernandez called \\"fifty years overdue.\\"Marc A. Caputo, From penniless Cuban exile to billionaire GOP moneyman, Mike Fernandez says Obama's Cuba action 'long overdue', Miami Herald (December 18, 2014).

Fernandez wrote an op-ed published in the Miami Herald about his shift.Mike Fernandez, I choose to help rebuild my old Cuba, Miami Herald (September 26, 2015). Fernandez was part of the historical visit by President Obama to Cuba in 2016; he was part of a group of U.S. business executives, including many Cuban Americans, who met with Cuban businesspeople.Mimi Whitefield, President Obama talks business with Cuban entrepreneurs, Miami Herald (March 21, 2016). Fernandez is active with the Cuba Study Group.

Education  Alain de Weck grew up in Crans-Montana, attended the Coll√®ge Calvin in Geneva and later completed his Baccalaur√©at in classical studies at the Coll√®ge Saint-Michel in Fribourg in 1947. He obtained his M.D. degree from the University of Geneva in November 1953 after medical studies in Fribourg, Lausanne and Geneva. He did his residency in Paris at various hospitals including the H√¥pital Bichat, and the Piti√©-Salp√™tri√®re Hospital. During this time he was an early resident at the Pavillon Suisse designed by the architect Le Corbusier at the Cit√© Internationale Universitaire de Paris. Starting in 1954, he came under the tutelage of Professor Werner Jadassohn, then the head of the Department of Dermatology in Geneva, the son of dermatologist, Joseph Jadassohn. There he started investigating the occurrence and root causes of inflammation as well as contact dermatitis due to lymphocytes using the guinea pig nipple as a model for the human skin. This led to the first histopathological demonstration that contact dermatitis is due to sensitized lymphocytes. He then stayed - as the first U.S. Public Health Service funded foreign research fellow from Switzerland - at Barnes Hospital at Washington University in St. Louis from 1958 to 1960 under the guidance of Prof. Herman Eisen. During this time, Alain de Weck made initial contributions to what later became one of his signature research areas: penicillin allergy. In particular he developed penicilloyl-polylysine (PPL) as a test reagent for detecting penicillin allergy.  Scientific contributions  Starting in 1961, after his return to Switzerland, he established himself as an independent researcher and eventually full professor (Ordinarius) at the University of Bern with initial support from the Swiss National Science Foundation. From 1961 to 1971 he ran a successful clinical immunology and allergy program under Prof. Hans Kuske in the Department of Dermatology at the Inselspital Bern, the university hospital. During this time he investigated a growing variety of topics such as hapten-antibody interactions, contact dermatitis, immunological tolerance to simple chemicals, delayed (type IV) hypersensitivity and lymphocyte proliferation, among others. On October 1, 1971, he became the founding chairman of the Institute of Clinical Immunology and Allergy at the University of Bern, a position he held until his retirement in 1993.Dinosaurier der Immunologie tritt zur√ºck, Newspaper Article, Der Bund, September 10, 1993 One of the noteworthy contributions was the first description of the now well- known Cheese Washer‚Äôs Disease (in German: \\"Kaesewascherkrankheit\\"), a special form of farmer's lung syndrome. Prof. Alain de Weck was a specialist at translating immunological theory into new medical applications for both diagnosis and treatment. His main contributions range from the characterization of the molecular causes of penicillin allergy, the suppression of allergic reactions using hapten inhibition, the international standardization of allergens to the study of Immunoglobulin E (IgE) synthesis and associated receptors, and the development of new diagnostics techniques such as in-vitro cellular assays as well as flow cytometric tests. He elucidated the mechanism of action of lactobacillus vaccines used in recurrent nonspecific gynaecological infections. Clinical activities included services such as allergy diagnostics using allergen-specific IgE antibodies (RAST test) and mediator analyses, leukocyte histocompatibility antigen (HLA group) typing for organ transplant (mainly kidney and liver), as well as cellular immunology testing particularly for the diagnosis of drug allergy and some autoimmune disorders such as HIV. The Institute offered a full curriculum in Immunology and Allergy at the University and also collaborated on textbooks of this rapidly evolving field.Centner, Jacques et al.

Hogrefe & Huber Publishing, 3rd Edition, 1995 The Institute hosted a large number of foreign researchers and visitors starting in the 1970s.25 Jahre Allergie und klinische Immunologie: 1967-1971, Abteilung f√ºr Allergologie und klinische Immunologie, Klinik f√ºr Dermatologie : 1971-1992, Institut f√ºr klinische Immunologie, Inselspital, Universit√§t Bern : ein Bericht, self published, Bern, Switzerland  Entrepreneurship  In his entrepreneurial activities Alain de Weck focused initially on the immunological aspects of aging and was co-founder of an unsuccessful clinic called CLIMARLY (1978-1982). His second more successful venture resulted from research on cellular assays for low cost in-vitro allergy testing using the Immunodot technology for IgE-based detection of allergies and other diseases such as HIV using low-cost cellulose strips and optical density measurements. He subsequently founded the Centre Medical des Grand-Places (CMG) company with a number of investors, including the Japanese pharmaceutical firm Nippon Zoki. One of Alain de Weck‚Äôs main collaborators during this time was Dr. Michael Derer. CMG successfully developed, manufactured and sold a series of diagnostic allergy screening tests under the name ‚ÄúTOP SCREEN‚Äù to test for the presence of specific IgEs to a variety of about 40 of the most common allergens. In 1994-1995 CMG added diagnostic tests for dog allergy and was subsequently acquired by Heska of Fort Collins, Colorado, in 1997.  International scientific organizations and awards  Alain de Weck was well known for was his leadership in and of international scientific organizations. He served as president of IUIS, the International Union of Immunological Societies from 1983-1986 as well as the International Association of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (IAACI), now World Allergy Organization (WAO) from 1985-1988. Other societies like the Collegium Internationale Allergologicum (CIA), the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI), the Swiss Society, the German Society and the World Health Organization (WHO) also benefitted from his leadership. One of his accomplishments in science diplomacy was to bring new countries and scientists into these organizations, including those from the former Soviet Union and Taiwan. One of the highlights of these activities was his chairmanship of the XIIIth IAACI Congress in Montreux in 1988 with 5,600 participantsBeda M. Stadler et al.

It is one of the few estates in the area which is preserved as a whole, and thereby also an important testament of the development of agricultural production in the region. It is listed as a Baudenkmal in the municipality of Fahrenwalde. The name can be somewhat misleading: Schloss Br√∂llin is not really a castle, but an old manor house.Geisel, S. 2003. ‚ÄúEin Kunsthof im Niemandsland‚Äù In Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung, 26. August 2003. The tower of the manor house inspired the villagers to start using the name ‚ÄúSchloss‚Äù in the 1970s, and it has stuck to the place ever since. Location Br√∂llin is situated in the German-Polish border area 6 km south of Pasewalk and 40 km west of Szczecin, in the borough of Fahrenwalde. Architecture German- Polish Centre in the building of the former bull staple The estate covers about 50.000 m2 of land. The old farm buildings form an enclosed quadrangle with the granary in the centre. Next to it is the old distillery, which was built after Stoewahs purchased the estate in 1854. The manor house is the oldest building on the estate, situated on the eastern edge. The first part of the building was built at the start of the 18th century, whereas the southern part with the tower was added in 1890. A cobblestone church from 1888 also belongs to the estate,Krauss, Neidhard and Egon Fischer. \\"Schl√∂sser, Gutsh√§user und Parks in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.

Today, the manor houses the permanent residents and volunteers, as well as the administration, offices, the common room and a small library. Behind the manor house, the estate garden looks to the east, and nearby is both the ice cellar and an old beehive. The former sheep stable stretches 100 m along the northern edge, and is mainly used as a storage space. On the western end is a workshop and the former riding hall with concrete floor and high ceiling. To the south, the former bull stable is now the German-Polish Centre, which was fully renovated in 2005-2006 to become a multifunctional centre with facilities for rehearsal, workshops, and conferences. Another former bull stable holds three studio spaces with dance floors, used for rehearsals and productions. History Early history The first historical references to Br√∂llin can be traced back to 1233, when it went under the name of Bralin after the signatories at the time.Historisches Lexikon Nr. 4778 Landesarchiv Vorpommern Greifswald, ‚ÄûDie Uckermark‚Äú Nr. 13040 w.o. The same family was registered as owners in the land register in 1375, then under the name Brellyn. The land covered 50 'hooves',One 'hoof' is a piece of land that can be farmed using one horse. which corresponds to the current area of Br√∂llin. Between 1375 and 1738 the estate belonged to the von Lindstedt family, who took up residence there from 1400.Kuna, Edwin and Hannelore. \\"Zwischen Ueker und Randow. Historische Ortsportr√§ts\\". Buchhandlung Evelyn Maass, Pasewalk 2002, p.37. After the young B.H. von Lindstedt deserted from the army, Frederick William I of Prussia gave the estate a von G√∂rne, who sold it onwards to the Pr√ºwer family. The Pr√ºwers expanded the agricultural activities of Br√∂llin, and also built the nearby village Friedrichshof, where they settled workers and sheep farmers who paid taxes to Br√∂llin. It remained under Br√∂llin until 1931, when it was bought through a communal land settlement society. In 1854, the land was bought by the Stoewahs family. This was a period of booming agriculture in Germany, and the latest technological developments were used to develop and restructure the estate and the buildings. During this time, it was amongst the most modern agricultural estates in the entire region. Most of the farm buildings, as well as the distillery, stem from this period. GDR/LPG After the Second World War, land reforms restructured the German countryside, and former properties were distributed to different groups and individuals for farming purposes The Schloss Br√∂llin estate was run by various production cooperatives (LPGs), with 2500 animals and 300 employees. After the upheavals in 1990, the LPGs were out-phased, and the estate became the responsibility of the Treuhandsanstalt. Today In 1992, the newly founded non-profit schloss br√∂llin association rented the estate from the Treuhand and began renovation work to transform the place into a production centre for performing arts. It aims to participate in regional and international networks, to carry out youth work and workshops, and to be a place for artistic production and research. Since 1993, the estate has been a protected heritage site, which was bought by the schloss br√∂llin association in 2000. The association also works to maintain the buildings and surrounding lands. Today, the estate goes by the name of Schloss Br√∂llin: international art research location. It is owned and maintained by the schloss br√∂llin association, and is run by a combination of employees and volunteers. Many of the volunteers come through the European Voluntary Service programme and regional initiatives. The association is supported by the German Federal Cultural Foundation the Ministry of Education, Science and Culture of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the District Vorpommern-Greifswald, LAG Soziokulturl MV e.V., the Foundation for German-Polish cooperation and the Centre for Political Education and collaborates with a number of regional networks and initiatives. During the summer months, Br√∂llin hosts a number of artists and groups as part of their residential programme. Workshops, artistic projects, youth groups, conferences and other events are regularly hosted, and more than 500 works of dance, theatre and performance have been produced fully or partly in Schloss Br√∂llin. Residential artists From 1992 to 1996, the RA.M.M. Theater led by Arthur Kuggeleyn was based in Br√∂llin and played an important part in the early development of the estate as a place for arts and culture. Other groups and individuals including POPE, Ziguri Ego Zoo (Anna Tot√≥ Company since 2001), tatoeba-theatre danse grotesque, Daniel Weissrot, Delta Rai, Martin Mengdehl, Yumiko Yosho√≠oka, Joaxhim Manger and Jens Femerling have left their mark in the years that followed.

The main suggestion of the theory is that the acquisition of a second language is directly linked to the acculturation process, and learners‚Äô success is determined by the extent to which they can orient themselves to the target language culture. Background The acculturation model came into light with Schumann‚Äôs study of six non-English learners where one learner named Alberto, unlike the other five, had little progress in the acquisition process of English. Description The process of acculturation was defined by Brown as \\"the process of being adapted to a new culture\\" which involves a new orientation of thinking and feeling on the part of an L2 learner. According to Brown, as culture is an integral part of a human being, the process of acculturation takes a deeper turn when the issue of language is brought on the scene. Schumann based his Acculturation Model on two sets of factors: social and psychological. Schumann asserts that the degree to which the second- language learners acculturate themselves towards the culture of target- language (TL) group generally depends on social and psychological factors; and these two sorts of factors will determine respectively the level of social distance and psychological distance an L2 learner is having in course of his learning the target-language. Social distance, as Ellis notes, concerns the extent to which individual learners can identify themselves with members of TL group and, thereby, can achieve contact with them. Psychological distance is the extent to which individual learners are at ease with their target-language learning task.Ellis (1994), p. 231 Schumann identifies eight factors that influence social distance: social dominance, integration pattern, enclosure, cohesiveness, size factor, cultural congruence, attitude factor, and intended length of residence. He also identifies three factors that influence psychological distance: motivation, attitude, and culture shock. Schumann later sought to extend the acculturation model by assessing contemporary cognitive models for second language acquisition, including McLaughlin‚Äôs cognitive theory, Hatch and Hawkins‚Äô experiential approach, Bialystok and Ryan‚Äôs model of knowledge and control dimensions, Anderson‚Äôs active control of thought framework, and Gasser's connectionist lexical memory framework.

He is Editor in chief Netra News, who previously worked for The Daily Star and was a stringer for CNN and a consultant for Human Rights Watch. During the 2006‚Äì2008 Bangladesh emergency, he was detained on 11 May 2007 and tortured while in the custody of Bangladesh's intelligence service. Khalil currently lives in √ñrebro, Sweden, where he is publisher and editor of Independent World Report, a world news magazine focused on human rights issues.  Early history  Tasneem Khalil was born around 1981 in Bangladesh. While in Dhaka, Khalil studied English Linguistics at North South University. After his confinement in Bangladesh, he went into hiding for one month, and then on 6 June 2007 was able to escape via a major Bangladeshi airport. From there he went into exile with his family and sought refuge in Sweden, a country he chose for its record on freedom of speech. Sweden granted him exile in June 2007. He studied human rights at Malm√∂ University in Malm√∂ and started his own magazine while in Sweden. Khalil is married to Sharmin Afsana Suchi and the couple has one son Tiyash.  Journalism career  Tasneem Khalil was an editorial assistant with The Daily Star from 2000‚Äì2007. During this time he also wrote for Forum, which is a monthly magazine. He later became a stringer from Bangladesh for CNN and a consultant for Human Rights Watch in 2006. Khalil was active in his reporting and \\"prolific' in his blogging about human rights issues and violations, something his wife said would get him in trouble eventually. After his confinement in Bangladesh and fleeing to Sweden, Khalil is the publisher and editor of Independent World Report, where he focuses on human rights topics in this subscription-based magazine. At Independent World Report, Khalil is providing dissidents with a means to communicate with the outside world: > The moment an individual signs up as a dissident journalist in China or a > human-rights activist in Uzbekistan or a democracy activist in Burma he or > she crosses a certain line, very much knowing what lies ahead. None of them > have asked us to provide them with anonymity. They also want a global > platform of human-rights journalism, and that is what we are trying to > build.  Arrest and torture  Tasneem Khalil was taken into custody by four Bangladeshi army security officers, who were wearing plain clothing, from his home in Dhanmondi Thana, Dhaka, just after midnight 11 May 2007. His wife said officers came to their home and took her husband without an arrest warrant but on account of a state of emergency. While the security force was at his home, they made a thorough search and confiscated his passport, computer and telephone equipment, and paper and electronic files used in his journalism work. Human Rights Watch believed he was detained for his human rights reporting and speaking out against the interim government in Bangladesh, and an editor at The Daily Star said the government had told him Khalil's detention was on account of his blogging at tasneemkhalil.com. Khalil was not taken to the Dhanmondi Police Station in his area of the city but to the Sangsad Bhavan army camp and held there by the anti-corruption taskforce. During this arrest he was blindfolded most of the time and beaten with 3 batons. He was questioned about his blogging on tasneemkhalil.com. He was also beaten because of an article he had written in Forum magazine. He was told to confess his crimes of being anti-interim government and working with CNN and Human Rights Watch in other countries as a spy. Khalil was released in front of the Hotel Sonogran within 22 hours of captivity, which is the shortest time anyone has been released from the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence, and a result of the pressure for his release from media outlets, press freedom organisations, and human rights organisations that mobilised on his behalf. According to Brad Adams at Human Rights Watch, \\"Tasneem Khalil's prominence as a critical journalist may have prompted his arrest, but it also may have saved his life. Ordinary Bangladeshis held by the security forces under the emergency rules have no such protections.\\"  Context  Tasneem Khalil was arrested under a state of emergency that the Bangladesh interim government had ordered in 2007 to quell violence and to last between the time period that the Bangladesh Nationalist Party had surrendered control of the government until elections, in which the Bangladesh Awami League won at the end of 2008. Amnesty International quoted reports in Bangladesh that indicated around 100,000 people had been detained since the interim government took control. Khalil was told he had been arrested for his personal blogs he had written which Bangladeshi security had deemed anti-Bangladeshi. Other journalists were also detained and tortured during this time period. These were journalists such as Noor Ahmed and Jahangir Alam Akash.  Reactions  After Tasneem Khalil detention, his wife contacted a list of people she had been told to call and notify in case of emergency. The organisations he worked for then provided assistance by publicising with the help of a blogger's network his captivity and urging governments to make inquiries into Khalil's situation. Brad Adams, Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said, \\"We are extremely concerned about Tasneem Khalil's safety. He has been a prominent voice in Bangladesh for human rights and the rule of law, and has been threatened because of that. The Bangladeshi military should be on notice that its actions are being closely watched by the outside world.\\" The South Asia Media Commission's coordinator Husain Naqi condemned the detention of Tasneem Khalil: \\"The Bangladeshi military should desist from such arbitrary actions which are being closely watched by the outside world. Any harm to Khalil will seriously chip away at the army‚Äôs claims to legitimacy and upholding the rule of law. The authorities should apologize for and call a halt to the pestering, which is an indication of the fragile state of press freedom in Bangladesh.\\" Joel Simon, executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said, \\"The apparent military arrest of such a prominent and well-respected journalist as Tasneem Khalil without any stated cause is an indication of the fragile state of press freedom in Bangladesh.\\" After his release in Bangladesh and fleeing the country, Khalil documented his experience in a Human Rights Watch report.

While the suctioned fat cells are permanently gone, after a few months overall body fat generally returned to the same level as before treatment. This is despite maintaining the previous diet and exercise regimen. While the fat returned somewhat to the treated area, most of the increased fat occurred in the abdominal area. Visceral fat - the fat surrounding the internal organs - increased, and this condition has been linked to life-shortening diseases such as diabetes, stroke, and heart attack. Technique The tumescent technique for liposuction provides for local anesthesia via lidocaine, eliminating the need for the administration of sedatives or narcotics during surgery. Wednesday, 21 August 2019  Risks  A review published in 2011 stated tumescent liposuction was safe. During the first decade of the treatments use, deaths were reported with the treatment as the cause of death, dating back to 1999. By 2002, 23 deaths in five years had been reported in the European literature. Tierney et al (2011) said, \\"The most frequent complications were bacterial infections such as necrotizing fasciitis, gas gangrene, and different forms of sepsis. Further causes of lethal outcome were hemorrhages, perforation of abdominal viscera, and pulmonary embolism.\\" In many U.S. states, physicians are not required to have training to perform this cosmetic surgery procedure.  History  Jeffrey Klein and Patrick Lillis, dermatologic surgeons, invented the tumescent technique. The technique was developed in the 1980s, before it came to market in the 1990s. The technique was introduced to Australia in the early 1990s, with Daniel Lanzer named as one of the first to use the procedure in the country.

The techniques rely heavily on user interaction and the human visual system, and exist in the intersection between visual analytics and big data. It is a branch of data visualization. IVA is a suitable technique for analyzing high-dimensional data that has a large number of data points, where simple graphing and non-interactive techniques give an insufficient understanding of the information.Interactive Visual Analysis of Scientific Data. Steffen Oeltze, Helmut Doleisch, Helwig Hauser, Gunther Weber. Presentation at IEEE VisWeek 2012, Seattle (WA), USA These techniques involve looking at datasets through different, correlated views and iteratively selecting and examining features the user finds interesting. The objective of IVA is to gain knowledge which is not readily apparent from a dataset, typically in tabular form. This can involve generating, testing or verifying hypotheses, or simply exploring the dataset to look for correlations between different variables.

PhD dissertation, Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Norway, 2011. and Zoltan Konyha in 2013. ComVis, which is used in the visualization community, appeared in 2008.  Basics  The objective of Interactive Visual Analysis is to discover information in data which is not readily apparent. The goal is to move from the data itself to the information contained in the data, ultimately uncovering knowledge which was not apparent from looking at the raw numbers. The most basic form of IVA is to use coordinated multiple views Roberts, Jonathan C. \\"State of the art: Coordinated & multiple views in exploratory visualization.\\" Coordinated and Multiple Views in Exploratory Visualization, 2007. CMV'07. Fifth International Conference on. IEEE, 2007. displaying different columns of our dataset. At least two views are required for IVA. The views are usually among the common tools of information visualization, such as histograms, scatterplots or parallel coordinates, but using volume rendered views is also possible if this is appropriate for the data. Typically, one view will display the independent variables of the dataset (e.g. time or spatial location), while the others display the dependent variables (e.g. temperature, pressure or population density) in relation to each other. If the views are linked, the user can select data points in one view and have the corresponding data points automatically highlighted in the other views. This technique, which intuitively allows exploration of higher-dimensional properties of the data, is known as linking and brushing.Martin, Allen R., and Matthew O. Ward. \\"High dimensional brushing for interactive exploration of multivariate data.\\" Proceedings of the 6th Conference on Visualization'95. IEEE Computer Society, 1995.Keim, Daniel A. \\"Information visualization and visual data mining.\\" Visualization and Computer Graphics, IEEE Transactions on 8.1 (2002): 1-8. The selection made in one of the views doesn't have to be binary. Software packages for IVA can allow for a gradual ‚Äúdegree of interest‚Äù Doleisch, Helmut, and Helwig Hauser. \\"Smooth brushing for focus+ context visualization of simulation data in 3D.\\" Journal of WSCG 10.1 (2002): 147-154. in the selection, where data points are gradually highlighted as we move from low to high interest. This allows for an inherent ‚Äúfocus+context‚Äù Lamping, John, Ramana Rao, and Peter Pirolli. \\"A focus+ context technique based on hyperbolic geometry for visualizing large hierarchies.\\" Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human factors in computing systems. ACM Press/Addison- Wesley Publishing Co., 1995. aspect to the search for information. For instance, when examining a tumor in a Magnetic resonance imaging dataset, the tissue surrounding the tumor might also be of some interest to the operator. The IVA loop Interactive Visual Analysis is an iterative process. Discoveries made after brushing of the data and looking at the linked views can be used as a starting point for repeating the process, leading to a form of information drill-down. As an example, consider the analysis of data from a simulation of a combustion engine. The user brushes a histogram of temperature distribution, and discovers that one specific part of one cylinder has dangerously high temperatures. This information can be used to formulate the hypothesis that all cylinders have a problem with heat dissipation. This could be verified by brushing the same region in all other cylinders and seeing in the temperature histogram that these cylinders also have higher temperatures than expected.  Data model  The data source for IVA is usually tabular data where the data is represented in columns and rows. The data variables can be divided into two different categories: independent and dependent variables. The independent variables represent the domain of the observed values, such as for instance time and space. The dependent variables represent the data being observed, for instance temperature, pressure or height.Konyha, Zoltan, et al. \\"Interactive visual analysis of families of function graphs.\\" Visualization and Computer Graphics, IEEE Transactions on 12.6 (2006): 1373-1385. IVA can help the user uncover information and knowledge about data sources that have fewer dimensions as well as datasets that have a very large number of dimensions.  Levels of IVA  The IVA tools can be divided into several different levels of complexity. These levels provides the user with different interaction tools to analyze the data. For most uses, the first level will be sufficient and this is also the level that provides the user with the fastest response from the interaction. The higher levels make it possible to uncover more subtle relationships in the data. However, this requires more knowledge about the tools and the interaction process has a longer response time. Base level The most simple form of IVA is the base level which consists of brushing and linking. Here the user can set up several views with different dataset variables and mark an interesting area in one of the views. The data points corresponding to the selection is marked automatically in the other views. A lot of information can be derived from this level of IVA. For datasets where the relationships between the variables are reasonably simple, this technique is usually sufficient for the user to achieve the required level of understanding.Konyha, Zolt√°n, et al. \\"Interactive visual analysis of families of curves using data aggregation and derivation.\\" Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Knowledge Management and Knowledge Technologies. ACM, 2012. Second level Brushing and linking with logical combination of brushes is a more advanced form of IVA. This makes it possible for the user to mark several areas in one or several views and combine these areas with the logical operators: and, or, not. This makes it is possible to explore deeper into the dataset and see more hidden information. A simple example would be the analysis of weather data: The analyst might want to discover regions that both have warm temperatures and low precipitation. Third level The logical combination of selections might not be sufficient to uncover meaningful information from the data set. There are multiple techniques available that make hidden relationships in the data more apparent. One of these is attribute derivation. This allows the user to derive additional attributes from the data, such as derivatives, clustering information or other statistic properties. In principle, the operator can perform any set of calculations on the raw data. The derived attributes can then be linked and brushed like any other attribute. The second tool in level three of IVA is advanced brushing techniques, such as angular brushing, similarity brushing or percentile brushing. These brushing tools select data points in a more advanced fashion than plain \\"point and click\\" selection. Advanced brushing generates a faster response than attribute derivation, but has a higher learning curve and require a deeper understanding of the dataset. Fourth level The fourth level of IVA is specific to each dataset and varies dependent on the dataset and the purpose of the analysis. Any calculated attribute which is specific to the data under consideration, belongs to this category. An example from the analysis of flow data would be the detection and categorization of vortexes or other structures present in the flow data. This means that fourth-level IVA techniques must be individually tailored to the specific application. After detection of higher- order features, the calculated attributes would be connected to the original data set and subjected to the normal technique of linking and brushing.  Patterns of IVA  The \\"linking and brushing\\" (selection) concept of IVA can be used between different types of variables in the dataset. Which pattern we should use depends on which aspect of the correlations in the dataset are of interest.Oeltze, Steffen, et al. \\"Interactive visual analysis of perfusion data.\\" Visualization and Computer Graphics, IEEE Transactions on 13.6 (2007): 1392-1399. Feature localization Brushing data points from the set of dependent variables (e.g. temperature) and seeing where among the independent variables (e.g. space or time) these data points show up, is called \\"feature localization\\". With feature localization, the user can easily identify the location of features in the dataset. Examples from a meteorological dataset would be which regions have a warm climate or which times of the year have a lot of precipitation. Local investigation If independent variables are brushed and we look for the corresponding connection to a dependent view, this is termed \\"local investigation\\". This makes it possible to investigate the characteristics of for example a specific region or specific time. In the case of meteorological data, we could for instance discover the temperature distribution during the winter months. Multivariate analysis Brushing dependent variables and watching the connection to other dependent variables is called multivariate analysis. This could for example be used to find out if high temperatures are correlated with pressure by brushing high temperatures and watching a linked view of pressure distributions. Since each of the linked views usually has two or more dimensions, multivariate analysis can implicitly uncover higher-dimensional features of the data which would not be readily apparent from e.g. a simple scatterplot.  Applications  Concepts from Interactive Visual Analysis have been implemented in multiple software packages, both for researchers and commercial purposes. ComVis is often used by visualization researchers in academia, while SimVis is optimized for analyzing simulation data.Matkovic, Kre≈°imir, et al. \\"ComVis: A coordinated multiple views system for prototyping new visualization technology.\\" Information Visualisation, 2008.

It is a potential space in the face over the angle of the jaw, and is paired on each side. It is located between the lateral aspect of the mandible and the medial aspect of the masseter muscle and its investing fascia. The term is derived from sub- meaning \\"under\\" in Latin and masseteric which refers to the masseter muscle. The submasseteric space is one of the four compartments of the masticator space. Sometimes the submasseteric space is described as a series of spaces, created because the masseter muscle has multiple insertions that cover most of the lateral surface of the ramus of the mandible. Structure Anatomic boundaries The boundaries of each submasseteric space are: * the anterior margin of the masseter muscle anteriorly, * the parotid gland posteriorly, * the zygomatic arch superiorly, * the inferior border of the mandible inferiorly, * the lateral surface of the mandibular ramus medially (the submasseteric space is superficial to the mandible), * the masseter muscle laterally (the submasseteric space is deep to masseter). Communications The communications of each submasseteric space are: * to the buccal space anteriorly, * to the pterygomandibular space (around the posterior margin of the mandibular ramus to its medial surface) and the parotid space posteriorly, * to the superficial temporal space superiorly. Contents In health, the space contains: * the masseteric artery and vein. Clinical significance Submasseteric abscesses are relatively rare, and may be confused with a parotid abscess or parotitis. They tend to be chronic. The submasseteric space may be involved by infections that spread from the buccal space. Sometimes mandibular fractures in the region of the angle of the mandible may cause an infection of the submasseteric space. The signs and symptoms of a submasseteric abscess may include marked trismus (i.e. difficulty opening the mouth, since the masseter elevates the mandible and it becomes restricted) and swelling in the region of the masseter muscle. The treatment of a submasseteric space infection is usually by surgical incision and drainage, and the incision is placed intra-orally (inside the mouth) or both intra and extra-orally if other parts of the masticator space are involved. Odontogenic infections The submasseteric space is sometimes involved by the spread of odontogenic infections, such as a pericoronal abscess associated with an impacted mandibular third molar (lower wisdom tooth) when the apices of the tooth lie very close to or within the space.

They are generally made of walnut, pine or ginko wood, often sourced from the carpenter's local area. Carvings and murals showing images of soban have been found in tombs dating back to the time of the Goguryeo kingdom. As well as being used for dining, soban were also used for general carrying tasks, as writing desks and as small altars for prayers or for burning incense. Soban are generally fairly small, due to the historical custom of family members and guests each having their own individual table. The standard dimensions are around 30 cm by 50 cm, with the legs standing about 30 cm high. The table is placed on the floor, and used from a seated position. The art of making soban, called sobanjang, is designated one of Korea's Important Intangible Cultural Properties, and was sufficiently important in the past for it to have been a state-sponsored profession. Soban are generally classified in various ways. Commonly they are referred to by their region of origin. Another standard system classifies them by the shape and number of the legs, the most popular of which is hojokban (\\"tiger leg\\").

Born in Wolverhampton he made 86 appearances in the Football League for Sheffield United and Lincoln City, as well as having spells with Wolverhampton Wanderers, Everton and Gainsborough Trinity. Career Playing career White began his career as an amateur with Wolverhampton Wanderers but failed to make an appearance fir them in league football. Despite this, after a glowing scouting report White was asked for a trial with fellow First Division club Everton, for whom he duly signed in May 1935. Once again White failed to make a league appearance for Everton's first and moved on to Sheffield United in May 1937 together with winger Charlie Leyfield. When White joined United, incumbent keeper Jack Smith was midway through a sequence of over 200 consecutive league appearances for the club so White was forced to bide his time in the reserves. White was not to make a first team appearance until December 1939 during a wartime match against Sheffield Wednesday. White played regularly for the Blades during the war along with guest appearances for Wrexham, Rotherham United, Grimsby Town, Mansfield Town, Sheffield Wednesday and Nottingham Forest. White finally made his Football League debut for Sheffield United in 1947, ten years after he signed for the club, briefly establishing himself as first-choice goalkeeper, making 44 appearances for the Blades in the First and Second divisions. White lost his place in the first half of the 1949‚Äì50 season, and was transfer- listed at his own request in February 1950, moving to Lincoln City for ¬£200 in June 1950. He spent the 1950‚Äì51 season with Lincoln playing in the Third Division North, missing only four first-team matches. In August 1951 White moved into non-league football with Gainsborough Trinity, where he remained for a season before being forced to retire through injury. Later career Following his retirement from playing, White returned to Sheffield United to work part-time as a coach and later a coach between 1955 and 1970.

X. Sillerman. The company was formed in June 2012 as SFX Entertainment‚Äîthe new incarnation of Sillerman's previous company of the same name, which was sold to Clear Channel Communications and later spun-off in 2005 as Live Nation. The company focuses primarily on live events and other properties relating to electronic music and its associated culture. Its holdings include ownership of various major electronic music promoters and festival brands, such as Tomorrowland, and Electric Zoo, among others. The company also owns Beatport, an online electronic music store, and Paylogic, a provider of online ticketing services. Growing primarily through the acquisitions of various electronic dance music properties, SFX went public on the NASDAQ on October 9, 2013. However, in 2015, the company began to experience financial issues; in August 2015, the company's stock value fell as low as 91 cents. After a failed bid by Sillerman to buy out or sell the company, and a breached preferred investment, SFX filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February 2016, and Sillerman stepped down as CEO. In December 2016, the company emerged from bankruptcy as a private company, renamed LiveStyle, and with former AEG Live executive Randy Phillips as a new CEO and Charles Ciongoli, formerly of the Universal Music Group as Executive VP & CFO. History Early history SFX Entertainment was formed by Robert F. X. Sillerman in the 1990s. Its business model surrounded the acquisition and consolidation of regional concert promoters into a single national entity. In 2000, Sillerman sold the company to the radio broadcasting company Clear Channel Communications for $4.4 billion USD. Clear Channel Entertainment was spun off in 2005 to form Live Nation, and merged with Ticketmaster in 2009 to form Live Nation Entertainment. As of 2012, Live Nation is the largest concert promoter in the world. 2012‚Äì2013 Former logo, used until 2016. In June 2012, Sillerman publicized his intent to focus on the growing electronic dance music market by reviving the SFX brand to form a new conglomerate in the electronic music industry. Similarly to the past incarnation of SFX, the company's business model focuses on the consolidation and acquisition of independent EDM promoters, along with an additional focus on providing digital platforms for fans to connect. Sillerman expected to spend close to $1 billion on acquisitions within the first year of operations alone; at the time of the company's launch, SFX was in negotiations with around 50 different promoters for possible acquisitions. SFX's first acquisitions included \\"Disco\\" Donnie Estopinal's Disco Productions, Miami nightclub owners Opium Group and Miami Marketing Group, and the tour Life in Color (then known as Dayglow). However, the Opium Group deal fell through during the due diligence phase. As one of Sillerman's first deals, Estopinal assisted him in locating other potential acquisition targets. By contrast to the previous SFX, Sillerman intended the new company to be more focused on building relationships and experiences for fans. In response to critics who believed that SFX may \\"commercialize\\" the largely underground electronic music industry, Sillerman stated that \\"if you buy great and successful businesses, you try to empower them to do what they do. And in this case, what they do is provide great entertainment. If you or anyone can ever find an example of someone from SFX telling them how much to charge for a bottle of Cristal at LIV, I'll give you my shares of SFX.\\" Sillerman has emphasized his belief that the live events industry can not be operated in a centralized manner, noting that SFX is \\"decentralized with full power invested in the entrepreneurs who have made these businesses.\\" In January 2013, SFX named Chris Stephenson as its chief marketing officerhe had previously been the CMO of Interscope Records, and is the CEO of fellow Sillerman venture Viggle. SFX also announced a joint venture with the Dutch promoter ID&T; with an intent to organize North American eventsID&T; previously partnered with Live Nation to hold the first ever American edition of its Sensation tour at Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Sillerman also stated in a Billboard interview that SFX had acquired New Orleans' Voodoo Experience festival, although it was later discovered that this had not actually occurred (in October 2013, a 51% majority was sold to Live Nation). In February 2013, SFX acquired Beatport, an online music store specializing in electronic music. In particular, Sillerman felt that the website provided a \\"massive\\" platform for both artists and fans to interact; being consistent with his goals for the company. The following month during the Winter Music Conference in Miami, SFX announced that it would acquire a 75% stake in ID&T;, and that it would organize a spin-off of its flagship festival Tomorrowland known as TomorrowWorld in the Atlanta area in September 2013. The company also received a $10 million investment from the communications services and marketing company WPP.  2013‚Äì2015 In June 2013, SFX announced an IPO and began trading on the NASDAQ on October 9, 2013. Sillerman was joined by the Dutch producer Afrojack at the NASDAQ MarketSite that morning to ring the opening bell. Following its IPO, SFX also reached deals to acquire companies focused on digital properties; the fan monetization platform Tunezy, and the web development companies Arc90 and Fame House. It also acquired Totem OneLove, an Australian promoter who organizes the Stereosonic festival among others. In November 2013, SFX acquired Made Event, the organizers of New York City's Electric Zoo festival. Sillerman considered the purchase to be a strategic move, as the company would now have a stronger presence in the New York market. It also acquired the German promoter i-Motion, organizers of the Nature One festival among others, for $21 million, and reached a deal with Roberto Midina, organizer of the Rock in Rio festival series, to acquire a 50% stake in a new entity that will own the rock music festival. Sillerman also disclosed plans to bring the festival to the United States for the first time ever. In December 2013, SFX acquired a 75% stake in Paylogic, a European online ticketing company. Paylogic's services are prominently used by ID&T;, and were to be phased in across SFX's other event brands over time as deals with other providers (such as Eventbrite and Disco Donnie) expire. Sillerman singled out Paylogic for its ability to handle large \\"surges\\" of ticket sales, as had been demonstrated at TomorrowWorld, the first U.S. event to use the system. On January 6, 2014, iHeartMedia, Inc. (formerly Clear Channel Media and Entertainment; the company which, coincidentally, Sillerman sold the original SFX to in 2000) announced a marketing partnership with SFX, which will see the two firms collaborate on EDM-related content for its digital and terrestrial radio outlets, including a Beatport top 20 countdown show (which will air on some of Clear Channel's major-market contemporary hit radio stations), a national talent search, and an \\"original live music series\\" in the style of its Jingle Ball concerts. The partnership expanded upon iHeartMedia's existing EDM-oriented outlets, such as Evolution, which encompasses a digital radio station on iHeartRadio, and terrestrial outlets in Boston and Miami. iHeartMedia staff, including John Sykes, believed that the deal (particularly the Beatport countdown show) would help provide a higher level of national exposure to current and upcoming EDM artists‚Äîits syndication division also produces the American Top 40.\\"Clear Channel and SFX Strike Electronic Dance Music Marketing Deal\\" The Wall Street Journal (January 6, 2014) In February 2014, SFX acquired React Presents‚Äîorganizers of Chicago's Spring Awakening, along with Clubtix and West Loop Management. In April 2014, SFX announced a partnership with Simon Cowell's Syco Entertainment and T-Mobile to produce a new EDM-focused television reality series, Ultimate DJ. In September 2014, SFX acquired Brazilian promoter Plus Talent, who organize XXXperience and Tomorrowland Brazil. On October 10, 2014, SFX acquired Listn, a Montreal-based startup that developed a mobile app which allowed users to browse their friends' music collections. Listn's employees were reassigned to Beatport, and the service was phased out. In November 2014, despite a total revenue of $143.5 million in the third quarter of 2014‚Äîa number boosted by the large number of SFX-managed festivals that occurred during the quarter, Sillerman reported that SFX was undergoing a significant restructuring and consolidation process that would involve \\"a not insignificant shift in assignments and reduction in workforce, all of which will go to improve efficiency and, of course, to improve our EBITDA.\\" Later in the month, SFX acquired a 50% stake in ALDA Events, a Dutch promoter who produces the concert tours of Armin van Buuren and Hardwell, along with the Amsterdam Music Festival. Alda will remain independently operated, but its founder Allan Hardenberg also joined SFX as the managing director of its Global Touring division. On January 26, 2015, SFX announced restructuring at the executive level: Greg Consiglio was named president and chief operating officer of SFX Entertainment, while Kevin Arrix was named chief revenue officer and executive vice president. Both Consiglio and Arrix hold the same positions at Viggle. ID&T;'s Ritty van Straalen became CEO of live entertainment. Additionally, it was announced that SFX would, under a three-year pact, assume the operation of Viggle's sales staff, who will work for both SFX and Viggle; Sillerman explained that \\"the Viggle Revenue team brings an immediate new dimension, while combining the SFX inventory provides Viggle with more scale attractive to a broader base of advertisers.\\" = Decline, bankruptcy = On February 25, 2015, Sillerman announced a proposal to buy out SFX's public stock at $4.75 per-share to take the company private, and support exploring a potential sale. He felt that the offer would provide \\"substantial value and flexibility to all shareholders\\", and was a \\"substantial premium\\" to its current value. By August 2015, the value of SFX stock had decreased considerably, going as low as 91 cents per-share. On August 14, 2015, the company failed a takeover bid, initiated by Sillerman, valued at $5.75 a share. According to the Los Angeles Times, SFX Entertainment is looking into \\"strategic alternatives\\" until October 2015 to determine the sale of the company. The company extended its takeover bid deadline in October 2015. In November 2015, Sillerman breached a preferred investment of $30 million into SFX Entertainment. Also in November, Sebastian Solano, founder of SFX's Life in Color brand, was named CEO of ID&T; North America and Made Event. On January 13, 2016, the company announced that it had defaulted on a $10.8 million loan after missing a January 3, 2016 interest payment of $3 million. On January 15, 2016, SFX announced that it had received $20 million in new funding. On February 1, 2016, SFX Entertainment filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company planned to restructure as a private entity, and engage in a debt-for-equity swap with its bondholders. Sillerman also stepped down as CEO effective immediately; he remained chairman and retained his 40% stock interest in the company. Of the situation, he stated that \\"this expression of confidence from our lenders is testimonial to the vibrancy and potential of our business\\", and that with the restructuring, \\"we have the opportunity to achieve all that SFX can and will be.\\" The bankruptcy and transition did not affect any of SFX's festivals, although the fate of the U.S. TomorrowWorld festival (whose 2015 edition was marred by infrastructural problems due to bad weather) was uncertain. The Belgian and Brazilian Tomorrowland festivals are managed directly by ID&T; or local partners, and are not affected. On March 1, 2016, SFX announced an intent to sell Beatport and Fame House at auction. In May 2016, the auction of Beatport was suspended, and the site cut its original content and streaming businesses. Later that month, Fame House was sold to Universal Music Group for $1 million and the assumption of $400,000 in debt. Flavorus was sold to Vivendi for $4 million. In an interview with Billboard, Sillerman admitted that there were \\"no easy answers\\" surrounding why the company collapsed, but added that he didn't \\"begrudge the disappointment and anger\\" of his staff because he was just as disappointed over the company's performance. Former employees also interviewed by Billboard felt that the company did not do enough to leverage its scale, and that the company did not engage in centralization, leading to a lack of coordination between its collection of subsidiaries.  Emergence, re-branding  In December 2016, SFX emerged from bankruptcy, reducing its debt by $400 million. Randy Phillips, formerly of AEG Live, was named the company's new CEO. The company was also renamed LiveStyle, with its headquarters re-located to Los Angeles. Phillips felt that SFX as a brand had garnered a negative reputation, and that the company had originally collapsed because it focused too much on growing quickly, performing an IPO, and Sillerman \\"[selling] a story about sponsorship\\", which \\"has to be the icing on the cake ‚Äì not the cake itself.\\" Phillips also began to describe the company as being oriented towards electronic music in general rather than EDM, and stated that some of their events (such as Mysteryland) will broaden their scope (similarly to the Coachella Festival, which is owned by his former employer), but other events will remain predominantly oriented towards electronic music. In May 2018, stakes in Rock in Rio, including the stakes held by SFX's creditor committee, were sold to Live Nation Entertainment.

It also briefly hosted speedway and greyhound racing.  Location and History It is located 4 miles south east of Northampton between Brafield-on-the-Green and Horton on the Brafield/Horton Road, Northamptonshire, England. It hosts BriSCA F1 and F2 Stock Car Racing from March through to November. The Tarmac Oval and Figure of 8 track is in length and surrounded by a steel plate fence. Brafield was originally built in 1949 by Dave Hughes who promoted Skirrow Midget Racing. The track was purchased by John La Trobe in 1955 and the first Stock Car event was held on 15 August 1955. The track was concrete surfaced in 1959. The track was sold to Tom Blissett in 1989, who also owned the Lydden Hill Race Circuit . The track was then sold on to John Heynes in the winter of 1996/97. He got sick of all the politics involved in the sport and leased the track to Incarace.BriSCA Formula One - The first 50 years 1954-2004 Keith Barber p 170-171 During the 2018 season, following the closure of the shale Midlands track Coventry, Deane Wood, owner of Incarace, took advice from fellow ORCi shale promoters to convert Northampton International Raceway to a shale track. After an initial period of mixed results (resulting from the extended dry spell and drought, followed by weeks of torrential rain), the track is now fully converted to shale. Following the conversion, the track is now known as the Northampton Shaleway, and continues to host World Qualifying rounds for BriSCA F1, BriSCA F2, National Saloon Stock Cars and National Bangers, along with the European championship and Masters championship for the BriSCA F1 Stock Cars.  Stock car racing  The BriSCA Formula 1 Stock Cars World Championship has been held here twice, in 2005 the first time it was held it was won by Frankie Jnr Wainman, and in 2011 by Paul Harrison. Since 1994 the European Championships have been held at Northampton, usually over a weekend in July, and includes a large influx of Drivers and fans from the Netherlands. The BriSCA F2 World Championship Race has been held at Northampton 7 times. First held in 1966 - Steve Bateman, 1969 - Ron Innocent, 1971 - Dave Brown, 1981 - Bill Batten, 1996 - Rob Speak, 2001 - Daz Kitson, and 2005 - H24 - Willie Peters (the Netherlands). The F2 European has been held here over the same weekend as the F1's since 1997.  Speedway  Brafield first staged Speedway in 1954. The Brafield Flying-Foxes, lined up in the Southern Area League. This league was essentially the equivalent of today's Conference League. The Flying-Foxes also appeared in that league the following season and finished in 3rd position, collecting twelve of the available twenty-four points. And that was it at Brafield until the circuit reopened in 1966. This time the circuit was granted an open licence and concentrated on providing opportunities for youngsters and older riders that couldn't quite hold down British League places. The team was renamed the Brafield Badgers and interspersed individual meetings with matches against reserve sides from British League tracks. The Speedway closed for good at the end of the 1967 season.  Greyhound racing  A greyhound racing track, was opened on 8 April 1950. The racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club) known as a flapping track, which was the nickname given to independent tracks. The greyhound racing was promoted by H Beaumont who had switched his operation from the Yardley Hastings track. The date of closure is not known.

The theatre is based in the Russian capital's centre, at Tverskoy Boulevard, 23. Background The history of the Pushkin Drama Theatre goes back to 1914 when still relatively unknown Alexander Tairov was looking for a site for his new theatre. As the actress Alisa Koonen suggested a large house on Tverskoy, Tairov initially found it unsuitable before coming up with the idea of reconstruction, which was soon implemented into a project by the architect N.Morozov. The Chamber Theatre opened on December 12, 1914, with the production of traditional Sanskrit play Shakuntala. Problems emerged when the Russian Orthodox Church authorities expressed disapproval of the theatre's closeness to the Ioann Bogoslov Cathedral; the conflict proved to be lasting one, but did get resolved. In the 1930s the building was reconstructed (according to architects Konstantin Melnikov and the Stenberg brothers) although not as radically as Tairov wanted. The facade was simplified and became very modest looking. In 1949 the Chamber Theatre was closed, for \\"aestheticism and formalism\\", according to the official statement, as a result of the Zhdanov doctrine being put into practice. History In 1950, based on the former Kamerny Theatre, the Pushkin Drama Theatre emerged with a Soviet actor Vasily Vanin at the helm. Vanin, the Stalin Prize three times laureate, declared his allegiance to the Russian classics and contemporary Soviet drama and started out by staging \\"From a Spark\\", Shalva Dadiani's 1937 play about the youth of Stalin. It was followed by Stolen Happiness (Ukradennoye stchastye), by Ivan Franko. Highly popular was Vanin's version of Krechinsky's Wedding by Aleksandr Sukhovo-Kobylin in which he played Pasplyuev. This role happened to be Vanin's last: in 1952 he died. He was succeeded by Boris Babochkin (1952-1953), whose most popular production was Shadows after Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin's play. Then came Iosif Tumanov (1953-1960); his best remembered production was Anton Checkov's Ivanov, starring Boris Ivanov. In 1960 Boris Ravenskikh arrived, formulating his directorial credo as \\"trying to wake up a poet in every man.\\" Comedy and romanticism became the order of the day: his bright, emotional productions used music to the full effect and is now seen as a reflection of the social optimism brought about by the Sixties Thaw.

Life Preedy was born in Offenham near Evesham in Worcestershire and died at his son's home in Croydon. During his early life his family moved from Offenham to nearby Fladbury. Following his death a memorial was erected to him in the church of St John the Baptist, Fladbury, Worcestershire. This also remembers his wife Mary (1831 - 1889), and daughter Alice Mary (1860 - 1899). He was buried at Foxham in Wiltshire. Career He trained as an architect in Worcester with Harvey Eginton.The Buildings of England, Worcestershire. Nikolaus Pevsner Following the early death of Eginton in 1849 he set up his own architectural practice in Worcester. In 1860 he moved his business to London. For his early churches he commissioned stained glass windows from George Rogers in Worcester, but after around 1853 began to make his own glass. He is thought to be the only architect of his time who also both designed and made his stained glass windows.[2] His legacy includes windows in Worcester Cathedral, Gloucester Cathedral, Lincoln Cathedral and Ely Cathedral, and numerous parish churches, particularly in Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Norfolk.The Stained Glass of Frederick Preedy (1820-1898): A Catalogue of Designs.

The mall has of space and includes tenants such as Sport Chek, Cineplex Entertainment, Winners and Shoppers Drug Mart. History Seaway Mall opened on April 23, 1975 with anchor stores Woolco, Kmart, Miracle Food Mart, a movie theater and 60 other stores. An expansion in the late 1980s added a Sears store, which opened in 1989. Around this time, the Miracle Food Mart was sold to A&P; Canada, and the Seaway Mall store was shuttered. This space was eventually converted into a new mall wing, which features a Bulk Barn, and Dollarama, formerly (now defunct) discount store Bi Way. In the late 1990s, both of the mall's discount department stores changed their names. Woolco was converted into a Walmart, and Kmart was converted into a Zellers after Kmart exited the Canadian retail market. In the 2000s, chain stores such as Claire‚Äôs began to leave the mall for more upscale malls such as The Pen Centre. Walmart relocated to a larger building east of Seaway Mall in 2006. Zellers relocated into the former Walmart space, while the former Kmart/Zellers store was reconfigured into several smaller stores, such as Winners and Shoppers Drug Mart. Target bought the lease to the mall's Zellers store, along with many other Zellers stores across the country during its expansion into Canada. Target opened its doors in the summer of 2013. With the opening of Target, this made Seaway Mall one of the few Canadian malls to have featured three very large discount department stores from the United States: Walmart, Target and Kmart, operating in the same mall at different points in time. In October 2012, a large Sport Chek opened up in the mall near Sears, which shuttered many smaller stores. In January 2015, Target announced it had filed for bankruptcy, and would discontinue all Canadian operations. Target closed its doors on April 1, 2015, leaving a vacancy in the mall's largest department store space. This was followed by the closure of the mall's Sears on September 30, 2015. The former Sears is now split in half; half is occupied by a Staples, while the other half is operated by the Canadian discount store Hart. In 2016, fashion chain Nyg√•rd International joined Seaway Mall with their store Alia N' Tanjay. In 2018, clothing brand Nyg√•rd announced the launch of a new concept store ‚Äì Nyg√•rd Plus ‚Äì located at Seaway Mall. This is the first Nyg√•rd Plus store in Canada, carrying plus-sized clothing from Nyg√•rd‚Äôs brands Alia, TanJay & Nyg√•rd Slims. In 2017 casual dining restaurant chain Mr. Mikes opened its first location in Ontario on the Seaway Mall grounds. The Welland Public Library moved into Seaway Mall with a full-service public library which opened on June 27, 2017, in former mall space. A Booster Juice in the former Garage and a sushi restaurant in the former Ardene are some new tenants which were completed by the end of 2017. In 2016, the jewellery store Envi Boutique and Modern Vision Family Fitness Facility, which used to be located in a small space (a former billiards lounge) above the movie theatre.

Description The Mogoltau Massif is an isolated massif some 40 km long and 15‚Äì25 km wide, with an area of 350 km2, reaching an altitude of about 1600 m above sea level. The central high point is Muzbek peak with a height of 1624 m. The massif comprises a broad plateau of rubble, boulders, pebbles, gravel and loess-like loam. It is incised by mainly dry riverbeds formed by ephemeral streams which flow during the spring rains. The area contains several small settlements and is surrounded, by cultivated land. As an ecological island it has a distinct avifauna which is different from the nearby Turkestan and Kuraminskiy Ranges. Birds The site was classified as an IBA because it supports significant numbers of the populations of various bird species, either as residents, or as breeding or passage migrants. These include saker falcons, cinereous vultures, European rollers, Upcher's warblers, plain leaf-warblers, white-throated robins, Finsch's wheatears, variable wheatears, chestnut-breasted buntings and grey-necked buntings.

The Bangui magnetic anomaly is a local variation in the Earth's magnetic field centered at Bangui, the capital of Central African Republic. The magnetic anomaly is roughly elliptical, about , and covers most of the country, making it one of the \\"largest and most intense crustal magnetic anomalies on the African continent\\". The anomaly was discovered in the late 1950s, explored in the 1970s, and named in 1982. Its origin remains unclear. History In 1962, Raymond Godivier and Lucien Le Donche reported on a magnetic anomaly in Central African Republic, which they identified by analyzing their surface magnetic activity data of 1956. These results were confirmed and built upon by the high-altitude aeromagnetic surveys carried out by the US Naval Oceanographic Office, as well as by the satellite measurements conducted in 1964 with Cosmos 49 and in the 1970s with the Orbiting Geophysical Observatory at altitudes. This data was combined in 1973 and yielded a spatial map of Earth's magnetic field, which was then updated after the launch of the Magsat satellite with an accuracy of 15 nT at an altitude of . In 1982, Robert D. Regan and Bruce D. Marsh named the anomaly after the city located at its center. The anomaly is sometimes called the Bangui negative anomaly, owing to its negative peak-to-trough difference, and is compared with the positive anomalies observed at the Benue Trough and Congo Basin where Lower Cambrian geological formations are exposed. Salient features The Bangui anomaly is bounded to the south by the Walvis Ridge, the north by the Cameroon‚ÄìSt. Helena volcanic line, and to the west by the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. It is shaped approximately as an ellipse in size. It has three sections, and the magnetic equator runs through its center. It has a short axis diameter of about , and its amplitude varies between ‚Äì1000 nT at ground level and ‚Äì20 nT at satellite altitude, about . Its features include a Bouguer gravity anomaly of ‚àí120 mGal, a topographical surface feature shaped as a ring of diameter, rock features of Late Archean and Proterozoic periods in the central part of the anomaly, granulites, and charnockites rock formations supplemented by granites at the lower crust level, and greenstone belts, and metamorphosed basalts seen as rock exposures. A zone of thinner crust bounds the anomaly to the north and a zone of relatively thicker crust is on the southern edge. Parts of South America and Africa around 545 Ma. See also Pannotia. Origin Two theories have been suggested for the origin of the Bangui anomaly, neither being conclusive. One theory points to a large igneous intrusion and the other to a meteorite impact in the Precambrian (before 540 Ma).Girdler, R.; Taylor, P.; Frawley, J. (1992).A possible impact origin for the Bangui magnetic anomaly (Central Africa). Tectonophysics, Volume 212, Issue 1, p. 45-58L. Antoine, W. Reimold, and A. Tessema (1999) The Bangui Magnetic Anomaly Revisited 62nd Annual Meteoritical Society Meeting To support the latter theory, a connection was drawn with a meteorite impact that may have occurred in Brazil in Bahia state causing formation of carbonados (black diamond aggregates) which are only found in the Central African Republic and Brazil.

As part of NASA's Explorers program, NICER enabled rotation-resolved spectroscopy of the thermal and non- thermal emissions of neutron stars in the soft (0.2‚Äì12 keV) X-ray band with unprecedented sensitivity, probing interior structure, the origins of dynamic phenomena, and the mechanisms that underlie the most powerful cosmic particle accelerators known. NICER achieved these goals by deploying, following the launch, and activation of X-ray timing and spectroscopy instruments. NICER was selected by NASA to proceed to formulation phase in April 2013. NICER-SEXTANT uses the same instrument to test X-ray timing for positioning and navigation, and MXS is a test of X-ray timing communication. In January 2018, X-ray navigation was demonstrated using NICER on ISS. Launch By May 2015, NICER was on track for a 2016 launch, having passed its critical design review and resolved an issue with the power being supplied by the ISS. Following the CRS-7 loss in June 2015, which delayed future missions by several months, NICER was finally launched on 3 June 2017, with the SpaceX CRS-11 ISS resupply mission aboard a Falcon 9 v1.2 rocket. Science instrument NICER primary science instrument, called the X-ray Timing Instrument (XTI), is an array of 56 X-ray photon detectors. These detectors record the energies of the collected photons as well as with their time of arrival. A GPS receiver enables accurate timing and positioning measurements. X-ray photons can be time-tagged with a precision of less than 300 nsec. During each ISS orbit, NICER will observe two to four targets. Gimbaling and a star tracker allow NICER to track specific targets while collecting science data. In order to achieve its science objectives, NICER will take over 15 million seconds of exposures over an 18-month period. X-ray navigation and communication experiments An enhancement to the NICER mission, the Station Explorer for X-ray Timing and Navigation Technology (SEXTANT), will act as a technology demonstrator for X-ray pulsar-based navigation (XNAV) techniques that may one day be used for deep-space navigation. XCOM As part of NICER testing, a rapid-modulation X-ray device was developed called Modulated X-ray Source (MXS), which is being used to create an X-ray communication system (XCOM) demonstration. If approved and installed on the ISS, XCOM will transmit data encoded into X-ray bursts to the NICER platform, which may lead to the development of technologies that allow for gigabit bandwidth communication throughout the Solar System. the XCOM test is scheduled for spring 2019.NASA set to demonstrate X-ray communications in space Feb 2019 XCOM (inc MXS) was delivered to the ISS in May 2019.X-ray communications experiment delivered to space station May 2019 Selected results In May 2018, NICER discovered an X-ray pulsar in the fastest stellar orbit yet discovered. The pulsar and its companion star were found to orbit each other every 38 minutes. On 21 August 2019 (UTC; 20 August in the US), NICER spotted the brightest X-ray burst so far observed.NICER Telescope Spots Brightest X-Ray Burst Ever Observed It came from the neutron star SAX J1808.4‚àí3658 about 11,000 light-years from Earth in the constellation Sagittarius.

Description Namophila urotepala grows from an underground bulb, which has a dark brown papery tunic. The bulb produces only two somewhat succulent leaves which spread out on the ground on either side. The flowers are produced in a several-flowered raceme borne on a very short stem so that the inflorescence is at ground level. At the top of the inflorescence is a tuft of bracts. Individual flowers are more-or-less upright, bell-shaped with fused greenish-white tepals which end in a thin \\"tail\\". The stamens are also more-or-less upright, with their filaments joined to the mouth of the tubular part of the tepals. The fruiting capsule remains enclosed in the tepals. The black seeds are somewhat globular. N. urotepala is found only in the mountains of southern Namibia, in arid areas with winter rainfall. Systematics The genus and species were named by Ute M√ºller- Doblies and Dietrich M√ºller-Doblies in 1997.
