Life Hochbaum was born in New York City, and received her BA from Brandeis University in Fine Arts. Upon graduation, she was awarded a Thomas J. Watson Foundation Fellowship to study printmaking at Atelier 17 in Paris. She later received a MFA in painting from Queens College in NYC in 1981. She worked as a painter in Newton, Massachusetts for 20 years. In 1991, during a four-month stay in Italy, an old interest in photography that had begun during her time in Paris re-emerged. In 1996, she and her family moved to North Carolina, where she currently lives. Process Hochbaum has always been interested in making work about the passage of time. Her recent work consists of composite photo collages, in black and white and color. She begins with a grid of between 25 and 50 photos set up in columns and rows and works digitally to blend the individual panels to make a whole, a single picture plane. She always leaves a hint of fog at the border between the modules, never making a seamless image, to remind the viewer that this is no window one is looking through, this is the act of seeing itself, over time. Previous to this portfolio, Hochbaum created shaped images, made up of individual panels printed into aluminum. She has used three distinct shapes - the symmetrical cross, the lintel or doorway and the Bi square, the empty square, or the squaring off of the Bi disc shape. She has also produced a series on the Silver Screen. In this series, Hochbaum takes screenshots of classic movies broadcast on TV, warping images of famous Hollywood starlets (Audrey Hepburn, Greta Garbo and Lillian Gish among them) before printing the image on aluminum panels. She has published a book with Daylight Books of the same name, SILVER SCREEN. Along with these series, she has created a number of slide shows to music; each contain hundreds of her images. Two of these pieces were commissioned by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. One, Graffito, a collaboration with her husband the composer Allen Anderson, was screened in Memorial Hall in February 2011 as part of the North Carolina Digital Arts Festival. Another, return:radius, was screened at the FedEx Global Education Center as part of the Water of Life Festival in the Spring of 2013.

The family was founded by Quitoni Martinez, Jos√© \\"Coquito\\" L√≥pez Rosario whom later split from the Family to form his own which became a family within the Puerto Rican mafia, Henry Vega, Iv√°n Vega, and Luis Albertos Rodr√≠guez. They had strong connections with The Cali Cartel and small connections with Los Pepes, Paulino Organization, Gulf Cartel and the Puerto Rican street gang √ëetas.Justicia Doll, Sara M. (August 10, 2006). \\"Tambalea reino de L√≥pez Rosario\\". Primera Hora (in Spanish). Foundation The Mart√≠nez Familia has been called the Puerto Rican mafia and a cartel. Quitoni and Julio Garc√≠a, who were very good friends, started the Puerto Rican mafia to reportedly bring their family out of poverty. They started making money selling marijuana and cocaine, making $250,000 every week from their sells. They used the money earned from their drug sales to start their mafia. In the early 1980s, the mafia started recruiting members offering $1,000 for joining. By 1984 they had more than 30 members in their family. By 1986 they started building their empire by buying $20 million worth of coke from the Colombian cartel known as Cali Cartel. This helped them forge connections with other cartels and mafia around the Caribbean and even Europe. The Puerto Rican Mafia started buying boats near the Port of San Juan. They began shipping coke overseas and into the United States. They even started transporting weapons to Spain. They had over 100 members in their family and grew larger through the years. The Family started loan sharking and extorting. They invested in small business and threatened business, as well as blackmailed other gangs into paying them lump sums of money. This counted for only 23% of their net worth. Organization The Family became very organized, establishing different ranks within the Family. These ranks determined how much money a member was earning and what was expected out of them. The ranks consisted of 6 parts: El Gran: Quitoni held this rank as the Don of the mafia. He resolved all issues between capos and castas within the family, and he ultimately developed and approved large business deals. In some cases, he decided whether someone was to be killed or not. The El Gran received a cut of every operation taken on by each member of his family. Quitoni was the mafia's most prized possession and his safety was always a priority. The only people that could meet with him were El Copas or El Castas as well as the Contador. Quitoni controlled the whole Family and anything he ordered said was to be carried out or the dissenter was killed. Typically, the El Gran put layers of insulation between himself and any acts. Whenever he gave orders, he gave them in private to one of his Copas who would in turn pass them down the line. El Copa: The most successful Copa of the Puerto Rican mafia was Quitoni's son Carlos who earn a grand total of $20 million for the family in one business deal. He went from a soldier to a Copa quickly because of how much he made for the family after he became a made man. El Copas were second in command in the Puerto Rican mafia; they organized business deal with other countries and gangs and presented them to El Gran. They examined everything the El Gran said to make sure that there are no holes in any of his plans. They made sure that whoever was sentenced to death was dead, and they had command over the castas and soldiers. They were in training to be El Gran one day. They were known as small bosses who commanded their portion of the mafia in different parts of the island and even in the United States. If there were any problems they were taken to them before they were taken to El Gran. They were able to send out hits and could really do almost anything except kill a fellow boss. Carlos Martinez the greatest Copa of the mafia had 4 soldados killed and would kill anyone he felt that he could not trust; this ensured that the mafia would not be infiltrated. √âl Contador: Also known as counters, there was one Contador for each Copa; they were responsible for counting the family's money. They made receipts after drug deals and made sure that the family was not being cheated and that no one within the family was stealing money from El Gran. They consulted The Copas or Quitoni whenever something didn't seem right. They were sometimes called by members of the families \\"chotas\\", a Spanish word meaning whistle blower (also known in America as a snitch).Grillo, Ioan (2011). El Narco: Inside Mexico's Criminal Insurgency. Bloomsbury Publishing. El Casta: Castas were simply made men, or leaders of the Soldados. There were only allowed to be 2-4 castas and they had to be of full Puerto Rican descent with no White American ancestry. These men were able to work their way up to be a Copa. These men were appointed by El Copas and were usually made body guards and money collectors. They kept 40 % of the money they made from their operations. 60% was given to the El Gran and deposited into a bank account which only the El Gran and Copa had access to. Soldados: Soldados were the ones responsible for killing, robbing, collecting, driving, and making small sales on the streets. They operated the boats and made shipments to other countries and parts of the island. They had to find ways to make money for the Family and could become a made man in the Puerto Rican mafia. Soldiers could be of any nationality, but ultimately only full blooded Puerto Ricans could be made men. Being a made man did not always mean they were becoming a casta. It could simply mean they were officially a Sangero, a member of the family with certain rights and a chance to make more and get better jobs. The lowest rank were Hombrecitos: These were the men who took the fall for most of the crimes and would also help hide coke and other illegal drugs and stolen merchandise. They were referred to as Zanganos and didn't make much money. These men usually consisted of whites and blacks whom the mafia felt were not good enough to become made men or soldiers. They were often paid as little as $800 for their services. The mafia promised them protection and money. These were sometimes business owners that the mafia would blackmail. The members were also paid through a process called \\"Sueldo\\". In the early 1990s, the Family started grossing a reported $754 million from investments and drug sales. These numbers got picked up by the police in Puerto Rico and soon the Mafia was being watched by the FBI. El Gran called a meeting in 1994 which called all Copas and Castas. They met at one of his houses located in Spain. He stated that they were being watched by police and FBI and that no more recruiting was to be done by the family and that all drug dealing was to be stopped except for small street deals. This would help keep them under the radar for a little while. In 1996, Manny Garcia had been reportedly murdered by the Mafia and hidden. His body was never found by police and no evidence pointed to the mafia except rumors that stated that Manny was seen reportedly talking a cop. One of the Soldados passed the message to the Copa known as Garland Rodriguez who told Quitoni. Quitoni had placed a contract hit on Manny worth $50,000. Manny's tongue was cut out of his mouth and was replaced by a rose. This was a sign that El Gran called the hit. Manny helped make money for the mafia and was very close to Quitoni, making Quitoni the godfather of his children. Accusations were made about (El Copa) Carlos Martinez: he supposedly hired 5 spies and 3 men to infiltrate the police district and 2 men to infiltrate the FBI. The mafia had reportedly had their files destroyed from police records and were soon being called \\"Los Silencios\\" because of them being able to get away with most of their crimes. This helped keep them under the radar and out of police view. Quitoni fled the island and moved to Spain where he would stay until the birth of his first grandson Rolando Martinez Williams in March 1997. In June 2012, 36 people were arrested in Puerto Rico and the U.S. mainland for smuggling 61,000 pounds of cocaine into the U.S through Puerto Rico's Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n International Airport aboard flights operated by American Airlines. The smuggling had been taking place since 1999. This was linked to the Martinez Familia.\\"Organizaci√≥n de Coquito gan√≥ $65 millones en un solo punto\\". El Nuevo D√≠a (in Spanish). Growth and death of El Gran The Martinez Familia, who started off selling marijuana and cocaine, started shipping drugs around Latin America, North America and Europe as early as 1985, with the help of Cali Cartel. They would use the Port of San Juan and buy ships to transport their merchandise to Caribbean islands and other countries. They supplied drug dealers such as Frank Lucas, √ëetas, Latin Kings, Ismael Zambada Garcia, and Zoe Pound as well as many others. They started becoming a supplier when Cali Cartel cut their ties with them in the 1990s. The mafia then hired a chemist from Spain to start making coke for them. They reportedly started making $750 million - $1.billion from international drug deals, extortion and loan sharking. They soon began having issues with the Mexican cartel known as Gulf Cartel who asked for $35 million for their help in making deals in Mexico. The Gulf Cartel soon started blackmailing the Puerto Rican mafia, which resulted in the kidnapping and killing of several members of the Gulf Cartel. According to reports and testimonies from supposed ex-members of the Sangeros, the family owned several homes and apartments within Puerto Rico, the United States and Spain. They had grossed a total of $500 million from a deal made with the Gulf Cartel.\\"DEA - Publications - Major Traffickers and Their Organizations\\". DEA (republished).\\"Gulf Cartel\\". Insight: Organized Crime in the Americas. Archived from the original on 2012-07-02. Retrieved 19 September 2011. The Puerto Rican mafia made a reported total of $10 million from loan sharking, extortion and renting properties. The mafia would extort small businesses, street gangs and judges. They promised these people protection and would have them pay the mafia a sueldo as high as $10,000-$4.9 million. They would blackmail businesses and ask owners to pay them for protection every week. They gave out loans to people around the island and New York, to lawyers, business owners and ordinary people. Carlos Martinez gave a loan of $48,627 to an illegal Colombian immigrant by the name of Javier Alveraz, living in Florida. Alveraz refused to pay back the loan with interest and returned only $13,000 back to the mafia. Carlos (El Copa) had him kidnapped. brought to Puerto Rico and buried alive somewhere on the island. Carlos was responsible for earning more than $385 million for the Family through international deals and investments. He was responsible for several kidnappings and the murder of the Qui√±ones family in 2007, in which he was sentenced to 5 years in prison due to his close ties with the judge. Upon his release in 2011, he was stabbed in the Rio Piedras Penitentiary (also known in Puerto Rico as \\"Oso Blanco\\"). Carlos was rushed to the Hospital San Francisco where he died four hours later. Quitoni had a Venganza placed for $1 million for whomever killed the man responsible; the inmate was murdered a week after Carlos's death. In 2003, the mafia was grossing $956 million in revenue from the United States and Japan alone and they invested in U.S stocks. They made $500 million through the pharmaceutical business that they also invested in; the family even donated $5 million to charities in Africa and Latin American countries to help fight AIDS and provide education. Quitoni Quitoni \\"El Gran\\", leader of one of the crime families, he made over $956 million for the mafia from extortion, money laundering, loan sharking, and drug trafficking. Coming from a poor background, he built a drug empire that brought in millions. He killed more than 50 people to reach his goal, including some of the members of his mafia. Quitoni had several children who were not affiliated with the mafia, except his son Carlos who became the most successful Copa. Carlos raked in millions for the family until his death in 2011. Quitoni's 3rd eldest grandson Rolando Martinez is believed to have been made El Copa and Quitoni's brother is believed to be El Gran now. Since Rolando was made El Copa before his grandfather's death in 2013, this would mean he has inherited over $130 million worth of money, property and deals. This rumor has been discovered as false. The rumored Copa was seen at his grandfather's funeral which was held privately and was also seen leaving the funeral with two men who are believed to be Soldados. After the funeral he was seen boarding a private plane heading to the United States. Over 100 people attended the funeral of Quitoni who died of lung cancer. There were several cases linked to the family in the 1990s; the most creditable was the case where several men were arrested in the Port of San Juan for supposed drug trafficking. Quitoni had several grandchildren. Quitoni lost his grandson Luis in a 2011 car accident, a year before his own death. After the death of Quitoni's family would inherit a total of $24.6 million which would be split evenly between blood relatives. This is hard to believe because some sources say that the family was going broke around the time of Quitoni's death because of excessive spending and health issues within the family, some sources say the family only has $8 million to split between the blood relatives. The crime family is still around and living although not as strong as they were in the early days they are still running the streets thanks to El Gran Mateo who has taken Quitoni's place as Don of the family. , Quitoni's grandchildren's have a networth of $4 Million dollars while Quitoni had a networth of about $320 million before his decline in 2000. The mafia leader was said to have been going broke and had 10 million dollars left in his accounts, this was eventually said to be split between the mafia as well as the children and grandchildren of the mafia leader. Rolando Martinez as well Rosalita Martinez had been spotted in 2012 attending school in Puerto Rico. In April 2014 the Rosalita, Quitoni's eldest Granddaughter was murder along with an uncle in their home located in Arecibo Puerto Rico. No one was charged. In 2015 Don Gonzalez head of the Vega family was taken to trial and is in the process of being sentenced.

Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers LLC and DOES 1-20 is a lawsuit filed in 2012 in San Francisco County Superior Court under the law of California by executive Ellen Pao for gender discrimination against her employer, the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins. Overlapping with a number of condemning studies on the representation of women in venture capital, the case was followed closely by reporters, advocacy groups and Silicon Valley executives. Given the tendency for similar cases to reach settlements out of court, coverage of Pao v. Kleiner Perkins described it as a landmark trial once it began in February 2015. On March 27, 2015 the jury found in favor of Kleiner Perkins on all counts. Background Ellen Pao Ellen Pao, the plaintiff, in 2015 Ellen Pao is a Chinese American woman from New Jersey. She has a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from Princeton University, a juris doctor from Harvard Law School and an MBA from Harvard Business School. From 1994 to 1996, Pao worked as a corporate attorney at Cravath, Swaine & Moore. In 1998, Pao worked at WebTV. Pao worked at several companies in Silicon Valley including BEA Systems as Senior Director, Corporate Business Development from 2001 until 2005. In 2005 Pao joined Kleiner Perkins as technical chief of staff for John Doerr, a senior partner, a job that required degrees in engineering, law, and business, and experience in enterprise software. In 2007 she became a junior investing partner with Ted Schlein as her boss but was eventually passed over for a senior partner position. According to Pao, she had the job title of junior partner from her date of hiring7th allegation, page 4 Complaint of Pao and was promised an opportunity to move into an investing role.\\"Ellen Pao: ‚ÄòI Wanted to Make Sure My Story Was Told‚Äô\\" March 10, 2015 Re/code accessed March 12, 2015 Doerr, who has expressed awareness of the gender gap at venture capital firms, mentored Pao, liberally providing feedback, but, in the end, agreed with the other senior partners who had made negative evaluations of her work at the firm. It was Pao's contention that men with similar profiles were, nevertheless, promoted. On May 10, 2012, Pao filed a gender discrimination lawsuit against her employer alleging workplace retaliation by a married junior partner, Ajit Nazre, with whom she had an affair. She planned to continue working at the firm but left on October 1 claiming that she was terminated.Complaint of Ellen Pao Her lawyer said she was fired in retaliation for her lawsuit and the complaint was amended to add that cause of action. Pao joined Reddit in 2013 and became interim CEO in November 2014 after Yishan Wong resigned. Kleiner Perkins Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers is a venture capital firm located in Menlo Park in Silicon Valley. The Wall Street Journal and other media have called it one of the \\"largest and most established\\" venture capital firms and it has been called \\"one of Silicon Valley's top venture capital providers\\" by \\"Dealbook\\". The firm specializes in investments in incubation and early stage companies. Since its founding in 1972, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers has backed entrepreneurs in more than 500 ventures including AOL, Amazon.com, Navigenics, Citrix, Compaq, Electronic Arts, Genentech, Genomic Health, Geron Corporation, Google, Intuit, Juniper Networks, Nebula, Netscape, Sun Microsystems, Symantec, Verisign, WebMD and Zynga. KPCB focuses its global investments in three practice areas ‚Äì digital, green tech and life sciences. Although there are fewer women than men in both junior and senior positions employed by Kleiner Perkins, its gender gap is smaller than that of most other venture capital firms and its most prominent female partner, Mary Meeker, has called it \\"the best place to be for a woman in the business.\\" Representatives for Kleiner Perkins stated that they had offered Pao a five-month transition, with pay, to an operating role, and only fired her effective October 31, 2012 when she rejected the offer.Section D page 6 Trial brief Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers They claimed that the decision to reassign her was made for performance reasons unrelated to the lawsuit. Causes of action The original case was filed under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act and contained three causes of action: *Employment discrimination based on gender: *Workplace retaliation: *Failure to take reasonable steps to prevent gender discrimination: Following her termination the complaint was amended and a second count of retaliation, termination, was added. The actual damages demanded by the suit totalled $16 million. This is approximately the amount that Pao floated in a conversation with COO Eric Keller when asked what it would take to change her mind about staying at the company. Pao explained that she \\"wanted my payment to be enough so it was a meaningful amount to Kleiner Perkins, so they saw it would be painful to not fix problems.\\" The plaintiff also made a plea for punitive damages.\\"Judge Says Pao Needs to Do Better to Prove Case for Punitive Damages\\" Liz Gannes Re/code March 17, 2015, accessed March 18, 2015 Although Judge Harold Kahn initially leaned toward denying this motion, he approved it on March 21, 2015. Trial The matter went to trial in late February 2015 with jury selection on Monday, February 23, and opening statements on Tuesday, February 24. The trial, lasting 24 days, resulted in a verdict for Kleiner Perkins. It was covered by the national media and elicited broad comment regarding the issues raised. The case was live blogged and tweeted, to the point that the constant coverage provided both humorous and serious feedback to lawyers and witnesses. The trial was heard before a jury of 6 women and 6 men drawn from diverse employment and ethnic backgrounds and Judge Harold E. Kahn at San Francisco Superior Court. Kleiner Perkins was principally represented by Lynne Hermle of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe. It was also supported by Jessica Perry of the same firm and by its own counsel Paul Vronsky. Pao was represented by Alan Exelrod of Rudy Exelrod Zieff & Lowe and by Therese Lawless of Lawless & Lawless. It was a trial to a jury of 12 who, under the rules of the court, were permitted to submit written questions to witnesses. The judge was also permitted to question witnesses. Witnesses were disclosed and deposed prior to the trial and transcripts of their depositions were available to counsel for the opposing sides and could be compared to the testimony of the witness in the courtroom. There were hundreds of exhibits consisting of documents and emails which the court had audio- visual equipment to display to the witness, jury, and audience. Plaintiff's case The plaintiff presented her case first, arguing that men were promoted ahead of women, that ideas coming from women were more quickly dismissed and that women who experienced sexual harassment received little support. Pao claimed that Ajit Nazre, the partner who initiated a sexual relationship with her, was responsible for much of this harassment. Pao said that he began excluding her from important meetings and emails after she ended the relationship. To characterize the company's response, her case explained that $22,000 was deducted from his paycheck once and that there was no strong desire to reprimand him until an outside investigation was able to link him to multiple instances of harassment. Additionally Pao said that she felt the need to move from green tech to the digital division to avoid him. Pao was asked if she objected to having Nazre's office moved to the same corridor as her own. However, she claimed that when she said \\"yes\\", the company responded by trying to move her office rather than cancelling the move of Nazre's. It was explained that Pao sourced an investment in RPX Corporation, a company designed to fight patent trolls, which led to an IPO. While arguing that this was adequate reason for a promotion, her side disputed KPCB's rationale for keeping her off the board of directors. They argued that the policies for how many investments and how many board seats could involve junior partners were unevenly applied between women and men. Performance reviews were raised to show contradictory evaluations such as \\"too bold\\" and \\"too quiet\\". As further evidence that Pao's work for the company was not appreciated, they pointed to potential investments in Twitter and The Climate Corporation which were turned down after Pao proposed them, both of which were seen to be profitable later on. A number of incidents were described in the plaintiff's case including a Valentine's day gift that she considered inappropriate, a conversation in a company jet that she felt objectified women, a dinner in Al Gore's apartment to which no women were invited and a ski trip which invited one woman on a technicality. Pao stated that she did not speak out about these when they occurred because she did not want a \\"reputation as a complainer\\". Issues with her last year at Kleiner Perkins concerned a memorandum she sent on January 4, 2012 and an alleged absence of training and policies to prevent discrimination. The plaintiff argued that the defendant took several steps to cover up aspects that reflected poorly on its record of gender equality. Defendant's case The defendant's case placed emphasis on its large ratio of women compared to other venture capital firms. An example statistic was that it had 11 female partners and a 20% female staff compared to the average of 7-11% based on studies in 2011 and 2013. A 2014 study found that this number dropped to 4% when only senior partners were considered. The defense also argued that Pao was paid more than most of her male colleagues. While salaries had previously been redacted from legal documents, the trial revealed that Pao's salary after bonuses eventually reached a peak of $560,000. They also pointed to several opportunities that were afforded to Pao including a speech coach, mentorship from John Doerr and a longer career than that of many other junior partners. To argue that Pao's firing was justified, they presented several negative performance reviews that she received and frequently described her as \\"entitled\\" and \\"not a team player\\". Kleiner Perkins contended that Pao's job description had been mostly managerial and that limiting her involvement in investing was not a sign of discrimination. They also said that promotions to the senior partner position were rare with 20 of the 25 people previously in Pao's position also being passed over. The defense brought in emails to show that Pao expected to be fired and suggested that some of them provided evidence that she was plotting a lawsuit. They also argued over whether her acceptance of severance pay constituted a tacit approval that the company was within its rights to fire her. The package was potentially valued at $400,000 but Pao did not receive the full amount on account of finding a job within less than a year. There are also reports that she turned it down entirely. Stating that many of the plaintiff's claims were stale, KPCB's side offered some explanations for the incidents she described and alleged that she saw discrimination where none existed. They claimed that this provided further evidence that she was an unpleasant coworker. The defendant tried to introduce another line of argument based on Pao having a financial motive for filing the lawsuit. They stated in a sidebar that she may have done this to help alleviate the financial troubles of her husband Buddy Fletcher, a hedge fund manager who filed for bankruptcy in 2012. However, Judge Harold Kahn ruled out this defence stating that it would place undue scrutiny on the plaintiff's personal life. Additionally, Pao maintained that their money had always been separate due to a prenuptial agreement. At the time, Fletcher was reading news about the trial and not making courtroom appearances, on the advice of Pao and her lawyers. Witnesses While most of the witnesses had some affiliation with Kleiner Perkins, many of them had left the firm by the time the trial took place. Some witnesses, such as John Doerr, were called by both the plaintiff and defense lawyers. Exelrod began by showing pictures of three male witnesses, Amol Deshpande, Chi-Hua Chien and Wen Hsieh, saying that they were promoted ahead of Pao despite joining the firm later and not investing in any companies that went public. Hermle countered that other men not shown were not promoted and that those three were seen as assets because they had started businesses before being hired. The first witness called was Tracy \\"Trae\\" Vassallo who agreed to testify despite remembering a conversation in which Pao called her \\"untrustworthy\\". Her appearance was described as a surprise. Having received a promotion to senior partner after Pao's termination, Vassallo testified that she still enjoyed working for KPCB but had problems with Chien and Nazre. About Nazre, she said he accosted her while in a bath robe and propositioned her at a dinner after lying that it would involve other contacts of theirs. She testified that her boss Ray Lane told her that she \\"should be flattered\\" by his advances and asked her to \\"talk to her husband\\" before deciding what to do. Lane denied making the former comment. Along with explaining that she confided in Pao and filed the complaint which eventually led to Nazre's termination, Vassallo mentioned the seating plan of a meeting in which she and Pao were told to sit in the back. Her description was \\"it sounds petty, but people were arranged in the room around how much input they'd have in the discussion.\\" The second witness was Chi-Hua Chien who confirmed that he organized the ski trip and the Al Gore dinner, both of which had only male guests. For the ski trip, he said this was done to ease the logistics of condo sharing and that if the trip were repeated in another year, it would have involved more women to make up for this. He denied the plaintiff's claim that he said \\"women kill the buzz.\\" Regarding the dinner, a deposition video was brought up in which Aileen Lee testified that she and John Doerr complained about the lack of women. Pao said she felt humiliated because she lived in the building where the event was being held and had to explain to the guests passing by that she was not one of them. Pao's side presented emails that showed Chien complaining about her in a vulgar way. Chien stated that he was collegial at first and only developed problems with Pao later on. The defense also argued that Chien would not have been named as a trustee of Lee's firm Cowboy Ventures if his respect for women had been doubted.  Kleiner Perkins' testimony  Kleiner Perkins CFO Susan Biglieri testified that Mary Meeker and Beth Seidenberg were the first two women in the firm's history to reach its highest rank of \\"managing member\\". Pao's legal team argued that these promotions in 2011 and 2012 were made to save face in the wake of Pao's discrimination complaints. Biglieri also testified that the firm's anti-discrimination policy, though distributed internally, was not posted on the website until after Ellen Pao filed her lawsuit. The plaintiff also showed that an Equal Opportunity Employment policy had to be written in 2012 after COO Eric Keller failed to find one. Rejecting claims that she was hired into an operating role, Pao explained that she initially turned down the job offer from Kleiner Perkins but arranged with John Doerr to make it \\"more senior\\". Some of Pao's duties included reviewing 1,800 iFund applications, writing part of Mary Meeker's USA Inc report and ghostwriting many of Doerr's speeches including a TED Talk. Doerr testified that he praised Pao's writing skills from her date of hiring but only learned that she resented this work much later. Doerr also recalled that before convincing her to stay, Pao wanted to leave in 2007 due to frustration with Ajit Nazre. Another of Pao's attempts to leave was protested by Ted Schlein, her boss after Doerr. Although Schlein testified that he \\"reluctantly\\" hired Pao, he also said that he convinced her to stay at the firm when she was being considered for one of the original jobs in Google Ventures. Schlein's testimony covered reviews that were frequently critical of Pao, using \\"entitled\\", \\"passive\\" and \\"territorial\\" to describe her. He was criticized for a comment that venture capital skills were \\"not part of Ellen's genetic makeup.\\" Doerr claimed that he frequently defended Pao and advocated for the reviews to be rewritten until eventually supporting her termination. He said \\"the junior partner is an up-or-out role. We have no lifetime junior partners.\\" When Hermle presented a list of female partners to Doerr, he described playing a role in all of their careers. However, Exelrod argued that Doerr was responsible for some sexism as well by playing a video where he stated that \\"white male nerds\\" were a safe investment. Although Pao spoke positively of Doerr, she commented that he often raised issues of pregnancy and suggested that her three-month maternity leave was the real reason she did not receive a board seat at RPX. Doerr stated that having junior partners sit on only one board was a guideline, not a rule. Pao contended that Chien had \\"five or six\\" board seats as a junior but the defense replied that he may have shortened \\"board observer seat\\" to \\"board seat\\" as a form of bragging and stated that Matt Murphy took five years to join a board.  Pao's testimony  Testimony of the plaintiff occupied most of the second week. She described mentoring Wen Hsieh and recalled hearing about three administrative assistants who were harassed by Nazre. When questioned about this, Pao knew only that one of their first names was Tina, inviting theories that the women had settled with Kleiner Perkins and signed non-disclosure agreements. On cross- examination, Hermle found an inconsistency with Pao's deposition video on the question of whether she asked to see an Equal Opportunity Employment policy. She also sought to show evidence of plotting in 2011 and 2012 by bringing up emails in which Pao discussed her options with friend and Google engineer Lori Park. These revealed that Pao had applied for jobs at YouTube and Menlo Ventures and was considering starting her own firm. Some issues with how Pao responded to termination were also raised. Pao said that it made sense for her to break the news to the CEOs of the three companies in her immediate network but revealed that Ted Schlein chastised her for doing so. On the stand, Pao objected to the way Employment Law Alliance investigator Stephen Hirschfeld responded to the discrimination complaints by Trae Vassallo and herself. She alleged that the reports used biased language, softened the airplane incident by changing the name of a pornographic show to Entourage and focused on eliminating KPCB's liability rather than addressing the concerns of employees. When Hirschfeld was questioned by Lawless, he revealed that his reports did not include a matrix which Vassallo used to tabulate discrepancies between male and female partners. This criticism was repeated by Allison West of Employment Practices Specialists who testified that the firm's investigation of gender issues was insufficient. She also commented that it was circular for the defendant to rely heavily on performance reviews to discredit Pao's allegations against the people writing them.  Kleiner Perkins' witnesses testify  Contrasting Pao's statement that she discussed gender bias with Aileen Lee and Trae Vassallo, the defendant named three female witnesses who stated that they never felt discriminated against: Mary Meeker, Beth Seidenberg and Juliet de Baubigny. Private human resources consultant Rhoma Young defended the attention to detail in KPCB's review process and Harvard Business School professor Paul Gompers spoke favorably of its commitment to diversity. Another professor testifying for Kleiner Perkins, David Lewin of UCLA, alleged that Pao's claim to $16 million was invalid because she could have secured a lucrative salary with a more thorough job search. When Mary Meeker testified, she described Pao as \\"insecure\\" and \\"quiet\\" and recalled being invited to a second Al Gore dinner. Beth Seidenberg compared venture capital to her background in the medical field and said she was optimistic that it would see an influx of female talent as well. Juliet de Baubigny testified more directly about Ellen Pao and condemned her habit of making complaints against coworkers. She also denied using the word \\"sex addict\\" to describe Ajit Nazre, something that the plaintiff cited as evidence that his hostility was common knowledge.  Final week testimony  Testifying in the final week was an investor witness from outside Kleiner Perkins named Andrew Jody Gessow, a passenger of the private flight that Pao described as offensive. He claimed that there was no discussion of pornography but Lawless pressed that his memory may have lapsed due to medication he was taking. Senior partner Randy Komisar also testified that week about why he received the board seat at RPX despite his investment in it being a joint effort with Ellen Pao. He stated that Pao described her respect for John Doerr's decision in an email and interpreted that as meaning she agreed with it. Komisar said that his friendship with Pao deteriorated over the word \\"hate\\" when she wrote in a later email that the board of RPX \\"hated him\\". He also testified that a book described as making Pao feel uneasy was a Valentine's day gift from him. Specifically it was the Book of Longing by Leonard Cohen with whom Pao claimed to be unfamiliar. One of the last people to testify was senior partner Matt Murphy who described Pao as \\"pushy\\" and \\"aggressive\\". He also recalled being embarrassed when Pao fell asleep at a board meeting. Although admitting that he began taking detailed notes about Pao four days after her suit was filed, he maintained that he had wanted to fire her for years and that only resistance from Doerr stood in the way. Discussing a negative performance review, Exelrod asked Murphy to explain why Pao was able to receive high praise from Mike McCue. Murphy's response was that McCue was known for saying overly positive things. Jury instructions The jury was reminded of the plaintiff's claims in which number 1 had to be proven before number 3 could be considered: #Kleiner Perkins discriminated against Ellen Pao because of her gender. #Kleiner Perkins retaliated against her because of conversations in December 2011 and her memorandum in January 2012. #Kleiner Perkins failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent discrimination against her. #Kleiner Perkins retaliated by firing her after her conversations and memorandum. There were no sexual harassment claims. The standard of proof was preponderance of the evidence, met if a proposition is more likely to be true than not. Despite the title of \\"junior partner,\\" Ellen Pao was an at-will employee who could be fired without warning at any time for any reason or for no reason but not for the wrong reasons such as a statutory exception where \\"actions or inactions were substantially motivated by gender discrimination and/or retaliation\\". \\"Substantial motivating reasons and factors are more than remote or trivial motivating reasons and factors.\\" It was explained that compensatory damages are an estimate of the plaintiff's past and future lost earnings. Other, more complicated and technical, compensatory damages were reserved for future determination in the event of a favorable verdict for plaintiff. If the jury felt the defendant's actions involved malice, fraud and oppression they could have considered punitive damages after the initial verdict was returned. There was a 7-page verdict form. Closing arguments Alan Exelrod made the closing argument for plaintiff, saying that the defendant's leaders \\"ran Kleiner Perkins like a boys' club.\\" Lynne Hermle made the closing statement for defendant, focusing on the issues of the numbers of women employed and the allegedly discriminatory events. According to her, the plaintiff was fired because, while she is an excellent executive, she was not able to perform in venture capital at a senior level. Therese Lawless presented the rebuttal on behalf of the plaintiff, saying \\"women will be judged in one way and men in another. That's not how it works in this country.\\" She also thanked an anonymous member of the jury whose question revealed that an evaluation, deemed to be negative based on its long comments from Matt Murphy and Ted Schlein, actually received input from 7 people, 5 of whom reviewed Pao positively. Submission and verdict The case was submitted to the jury about noon on March 25, 2015. A unanimous verdict was not required, only support of 9 of the 12 jurors, 75%. It was reported that when deliberations began, impressions of the jurors were 8 siding with Kleiner Perkins, 2 siding with Ellen Pao and 2 undecided with all groups split evenly by gender. The initial verdict was announced shortly after 2 p.m. on Friday, March 27. The jury found 10-2 in favor of Kleiner Perkins on the first 3 claims. The jury, which found 8 to 4 in favor of Kleiner Perkins on the fourth claim of retaliation by termination, was directed to continue to deliberate as the finding did not meet the required threshold of 75%. The jury deliberated for about two hours then returned a final verdict in favor of Kleiner Perkins on all claims as one juror changed his vote from yes to no on the 4th claim. According to the three jurors who talked to the media the jury focused on Pao's performance reviews in arriving at their verdict. On the same day, jurors Steve Sammut and Marshallette Ramsey revealed what their votes had been. Ramsey supported the plaintiff and said that she encouraged other women in Pao's situation to stand up for themselves. Her reason was that it \\"seemed that the men, with the same character flaws that Ellen was cited with, were able to propel and continue.\\" Although Sammut was not convinced that what Pao experienced was gender discrimination, he expressed a hope that Kleiner Perkins would still be punished for how it treated employees in general. Costs and appeal The defendant requested costs of $972,814, 90% of which was for expert witness fees. Kleiner Perkins stated that the fee would be waived if the plaintiff chose not to appeal. On June 18, 2015 the court awarded $275,966 to Kleiner Perkins, stating that the disparity in economic resources between the parties was too great to justify the original amount. Pao's side claimed that this was an unfair response to a loss in a discrimination case and filed a notice of appeal on June 1, 2015, 7 days before the deadline. The appeal, which would have been held in the First District Court of Appeal, was to focus on the verdict since most procedural rulings by the judge were made in favor of the plaintiff. On September 10, 2015, sources reported that Pao was dropping her appeal, citing an inability to afford further litigation. In a Re/code post on the topic, Pao wrote about the importance of discussing gender bias publicly and stated that she was rejecting requests from KPCB to sign a non-disparagement agreement. She stated that this would make her responsible for court costs after the appeal was dropped. However, on September 17, Kleiner Perkins accepted the dropping of Pao's appeal without the $276,000 cost reimbursement. Significance Following the case, a number of other people filed discrimination suits against high-profile companies, as with Chia Hong v. Facebook and Tina Huang v. Twitter. A number of publications credited Pao and her case with focusing attention on the issue of gender discrimination and workplace sexism, especially in the venture capital and technology industries, and for inspiring others to act. The impact of Pao and the case became known as \\"the Pao effect\\". Afterwards, Pao v. Kleiner Perkins was again credited with inspiring a discrimination case when security researcher Katie Moussouris filed a suit against Microsoft.

He is best known as the founder of the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War. Early life Davis was born in Gardiner, Maine and was the son of Anthony and Mary Davis. His father was of Welsh extraction. He had ancestors who served in the American Revolution and the War of 1812. At the age of 14 Davis left home and travelled to San Francisco as part of the 1849 California Gold Rush. His dreams of finding a fortune did not come to pass and he returned his career as a sailor in 1850. He worked on various ships over the next five years. He enlisted in the Royal Navy for four years during the Crimean War. He was discharged from the Royal Navy in 1860 and returned to his family in Maine later that year. Civil War service Shortly after the attack on Fort Sumter in April 1861, Davis volunteered to serve in the 11th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment and was elected as captain of Company F on May 11, 1861. Shortly afterwards, the 11th Maine was sent south to serve with the Army of the James. In April 1862 Davis was detached from the 11th Maine and detailed as Provost Marshal of the division commanded by Major General Silas Casey. He was wounded in action at the Battle of Fair Oaks and spent several weeks recovering in the hospital. On March 7, 1863, Davis resigned from the Army and returned to Maine. The resignation was accompanied by a surgeon's certificate dated the same day and signed by Dr. D. W. Hand, Surgeon and Medical Director of General Peck's Division. In reference to Davis, Dr. Hand wrote, ...he has tubercular deposits in the right lung, with pleuritic adhesions on that side. In consequence, I believe the exposure incident to field service will very soon assuredly break down his health. Soon after Davis' arrival in Maine, on April 24, 1863, he was appointed as Provost Marshal for the 3rd District of Maine and re-commissioned as captain. He held this position until he was honorably discharged on August 15, 1865.Register of the Pennsylvania Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. 1865-1902. pg. 113. On June 22, 1867 Davis received a brevet (i.e. honorary promotion) to the rank of major to date from March 15, 1865. Veteran organizations After the war, Davis joined Alexander Hays Post 3 of the Grand Army of the Republic in Pittsburgh. On January 14, 1880, he was elected as a Veteran Companion of the First Class of the Pennsylvania Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (MOLLUS). He was assigned MOLLUS insignia number 1981. Post- war life In 1866, Davis married Mary Ann Gilpatrick. They had one son, Herbert Anthony Davis, born on January 27, 1868. Mary Ann died suddenly on March 11, 1872. Three months later, Davis married Lizzie E. Parks. Shortly after his second marriage, Davis moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on the advice of his doctor to live in a drier climate. In Pittsburgh, Davis pursued a career as an insurance executive. Davis' second son, Charles K. Davis, was born in Pittsburgh shortly after his arrival. Davis and his wife divorced in 1876. That same year, Davis' disability pension was denied since he had a respiratory condition since childhood. Davis' pension was eventually restored in 1886. Sons of Union Veterans On November 12, 1881, Davis organized the first camp (i.e. local chapter) of the Sons of Veterans of the United States of America (SV) which would later be renamed as the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War (SUVCW). In Davis' original conception, the SV was to be a military training program for young men aged 14 and above. In addition to instilling discipline and patriotism, the SV was also intended to be a military reserve force which could be called on in time of war. Although Davis was ineligible for membership in the SV, in August 1884 Davis was declared by the SV's Commander-in-Chief to be a Past Commander-in-Chief and a Past Grand Division Commander and was given the privilege of joining the camp of the SV of his own choosing. In the first two decades since its founding, the SV grew to have departments (state organizations) in most states other than those which were part of the Confederacy. Its membership peaked in 1904 when it had about 200,000 members. Although the SV was never officially affiliated with the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR), the ties between the two organizations were strong. On February 13, 1954, Albert Woolson, the last surviving member of the GAR, signed a deed of conveyance giving all remaining GAR property to the SUVCW. Later life Davis died in Pittsburgh in 1899. He was buried at Allegheny Cemetery in Pittsburgh.

Stellweg began her career in 1965 working as an assistant curator to Fernando Gamboa, the renowned museum builder who organized a plethora of international exhibitions on Mexico, its art and culture around the world. Stellweg is an art historian, curator, and writer with a specialization on Latin American and Latino-US art and artists. She served as Deputy Director of the Rufino Tamayo Museum at its opening and prior to the Tamayo Museum, she co-founded, edited and directed the first bilingual (Spanish-English) arts magazine in Latin America from 1973-1981.  Early life and education  Carla Margareta Stellweg was born in Bandung, Indonesia, and moved with her parents to Mexico in 1958. She earned a Bachelor of Arts from Grotius College of The Hague and was a Candidate for Master of Fine Arts in art history at the University of the Americas in Mexico City.  Career  In 1973, Stellweg and Fernando Gamboa, director of the Museo de Arte Moderno (MAM) in Mexico City co-founded Artes Visuales, the first contemporary avant-garde visual arts magazine publication in Spanish and English in Latin America. MAM was a publicly funded organization, which through Artes Visuales pushed a political cultural project sponsored by Luis Echeverria from 1970-1976 to counter the unrest caused by the Mexico 68 killings. As early as 1975, Stellweg was organizing feminist seminars to address feminist expression in Mexican art. In 1976, Stellweg devoted an issue of Artes Visuales covering the participation of women in the arts. Mexican-based artists and critics did not accept the concept of a feminist based movement, fearing that adoption of a feminist strategy would have negative repercussions. In 1979 Stellweg became the deputy director of the newly built Rufino Tamayo Museum, but within a short time, moved to New York City. From 1983-1985, she was the co-owner and director of the Stellweg-Seguy Gallery, located in Soho, New York City. She became the chief curator of the Museum of Contemporary Hispanic Art (MOCHA) in 1986, and left in 1989 to found her own gallery. The Carla Stellweg Gallery operated from 1989-1997 and was located in New York City and focused on emerging as well as mid-career Latin American and Latino artists of various media. From 1997 to 2001 she was the director and chief curator of Blue Star Contemporary Art Center in San Antonio, Texas, and during her tenure the city‚Äôs Contemporary Art Month became a registered event. Prior to Blue Star, Stellweg was awarded with a Rockefeller Fellowship in the Humanities at the UT Austin, Texas, where she conducted research leading to, If Money Talks Who Does the Exhibition Talking?: 1980s Latin American and Latino Art. Stellweg has acted as an independent consultant, including a project entitled Hispanic Art in the United States: Thirty Contemporary Painters and Sculptors and The Latin American Spirit: Art and Artists in the US, 1920-1970, as a history professor at the School of Visual Arts, and has authored numerous publications.

Built in 1896, the building originally served as a transfer point for Decatur's electric streetcar system. Architect William W. Boyington's design for the building was influenced by a number of Victorian styles, particularly the Richardsonian Romanesque. The building was ultimately moved to Central Park and is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History The Transfer House was built on Lincoln Square (Intersection of N/S Main Street and E/W Main Street) in 1896 to serve as Decatur's main transfer point for City Electric Railway streetcars and Illinois Traction System interurban trains. As Lincoln Square was facing competition from other Decatur business districts, local business leaders felt the square needed a grander replacement for its old transfer building. When the Transfer House opened, the businessmen hired an orchestra and offered free souvenirs and train rides to draw visitors to the new building; the opening ceremonies drew large crowds, exceeding the businessmen's expectations. The building soon became a focal point of Decatur, as nearly every streetcar traveler in the city needed to stop there to transfer. The open-air bandstand on the building's roof and its central location made it a convenient place for community events and public gatherings; many prominent speakers, including three U.S. presidents, gave speeches from the building. After the streetcar and interurban systems ceased operations in the 1950s, the Transfer House was reduced to a bus terminal and lost most of its passenger volume. The Illinois Department of Transportation recommended that the city move the building, as it interfered with traffic on highway US 51; the city complied in 1962, moving the building to Central Park. The city rehabilitated the building in the 1970s, and it continues to serve as a civic symbol and meeting place. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 3, 2002. Architecture William W. Boyington, a Chicago architect most famous for designing the Chicago Water Tower, designed the Transfer House. His design includes elements of several Victorian architectural styles, the Richardsonian Romanesque style the most prominent among them. The two-story building has an octagonal plan, a design which gave it more interior space without jutting too far into the surrounding streets. Thick limestone arches, a distinct Romanesque feature. form the first-floor windows and entrances of the building. A bell-shaped roof with a wide canopy provided outdoor shelter for passengers. The second floor of the building consists entirely of the open-air bandstand and is covered by a cupola.

Chadwick had discovered the neutron the year before while working at Cavendish Laboratory. The discovery of the neutron and its properties was central to the extraordinary developments in atomic physics in the first half of the 20th century. Early in the century, Ernest Rutherford developed a crude model of the atom, based on the gold foil experiment of Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden. In this model, atoms had their mass and positive electric charge concentrated in a very small nucleus. By 1920 chemical isotopes had been discovered, the atomic masses had been determined to be (approximately) integer multiples of the mass of the hydrogen atom, and the atomic number had been identified as the charge on the nucleus.Byrne, J. Neutrons, Nuclei, and Matter, Dover Publications, Mineola, New York, 2011, Throughout the 1920s, the nucleus was viewed as composed of combinations of protons and electrons, the two elementary particles known at the time, but that model presented several experimental and theoretical contradictions. The essential nature of the atomic nucleus was established with the discovery of the neutron by James Chadwick in 1932 and the determination that it was a new elementary particle, distinct from the proton. The uncharged neutron was immediately exploited as a new means to probe nuclear structure, leading to such discoveries as the creation of new radioactive elements by neutron irradiation (1934) and the fission of uranium atoms by neutrons (1938). The discovery of fission led to the creation of both nuclear power and weapons by the end of World War II. Both the proton and the neutron were presumed to be elementary particles until the 1960s, when they were determined to be composite particles built from quarks. Discovery of radioactivity At the start of the 20th century, the vigorous debate as to the existence of atoms had not yet been resolved. Philosophers such as Ernst Mach and Wilhelm Ostwald denied that atoms were real, viewing them as a convenient mathematical construct, while scientists such as Arnold Sommerfeld and Ludwig Boltzmann saw that physical theories required the existence of atoms. Radioactivity was discovered in 1896 by the French scientist Henri Becquerel, while working with phosphorescent materials. In 1898, Ernest Rutherford at Cavendish Laboratory distinguished two types of radioactivity, alpha rays and beta rays, which differed in their ability to penetrate, or travel into, ordinary objects or gases. Two years later, Paul Villard discovered gamma rays, which possessed even more penetrating power. These radiations were soon identified with known particles: beta rays were shown to be electrons by Walter Kaufmann in 1902; alpha rays were shown to be helium ions by Rutherford and Thomas Royds in 1907; and gamma rays were shown to be electromagnetic radiation, that is, a form of light, by Rutherford and Edward Andrade in 1914. These radiations had also been identified as emanating from atoms, hence they provided clues to processes occurring within atoms. Conversely, the radiations were also recognized as tools that could be exploited in scattering experiments to probe the interior of atoms. The gold foil experiment and the discovery of the atomic nucleus A schematic of the nucleus of an atom indicating radiation, the emission of a fast electron from the nucleus (the accompanying antineutrino is omitted). In the Rutherford model for the nucleus, red spheres were protons with positive charge and blue spheres were protons tightly bound to an electron with no net charge. The inset shows beta decay of a free neutron as it is understood today; an electron and antineutrino are created in this process. At the University of Manchester between 1908 and 1913, Rutherford directed Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden in a series of experiments to determine what happens when alpha particles scatter from metal foil. Now called the Rutherford gold foil experiment, or the Geiger‚ÄìMarsden experiment, these measurements made the extraordinary discovery that alpha particles would occasionally scatter to a high angle when passing through a thin gold foil. The scattering indicated that the alpha particles were deflected by a small, but dense, component of atoms. Based on these measurements, by 1911 it was apparent to Rutherford that the atom consisted of a small massive nucleus with positive charge surrounded by a much larger cloud of negatively charged electrons. The concentrated atomic mass was required to provide the observed deflection of the alpha particles, and Rutherford developed a mathematical model that accounted for the scattering. The Rutherford model was very influential, motivating the Bohr model for electrons orbiting the nucleus in 1913 and eventually leading to quantum mechanics by the mid-1920s. Discovery of isotopes Concurrent with the work of Rutherford, Geiger, and Marsden, the radiochemist Frederick Soddy at the University of Glasgow was studying chemistry related problems on radioactive materials. Soddy had worked with Rutherford on radioactivity at McGill University. By 1910, about 40 different radioactive elements, referred to as radioelements, had been identified between uranium and lead, although the periodic table only allowed for 11 elements. Soddy and Kazimierz Fajans independently found in 1913 that an element undergoing alpha decay will produce an element two places to the left in the periodic system and an element undergoing beta decay will produce an element one place to the right in the periodic system. Also, those radioelements that reside in the same places in the periodic system are chemically identical. Soddy called these chemically identical elements isotopes.Others had also suggested the possibility of isotopes; for example: * Str√∂mholm, D. and Svedberg, T. (1909) \\"Untersuchungen √ºber die Chemie der radioactiven Grundstoffe II.\\" (Investigations into the chemistry of the radioactive elements, part 2), Zeitschrift f√ºr anorganischen Chemie, 63: 197‚Äì206; see especially page 206. * Cameron, Alexander Thomas (1910). Radiochemistry. London, England: J. M. Dent & Sons, p. 141. (Cameron also anticipated the displacement law.) For his study of radioactivity and the discovery of isotopes, Soddy was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Replica of Aston's third mass spectrometer Building from work by J. J. Thomson on the deflection of positively charged atoms by electric and magnetic fields, Francis Aston built the first mass spectrograph at the Cavendish Laboratory in 1919. His aim, which he easily achieved, was to separate the two isotopes of neon, and . Aston discovered that the masses of all the particles are whole numbers (the whole number rule): that is, the masses of all the isotopes are whole number multiples of the mass of the hydrogen atom. In these measurements, Aston arbitrarily computed his masses relative to oxygen-16, which he took to have a mass of exactly 16. (Today the atomic mass unit (amu) is relative to carbon-12.) Ironically, the one exception to this rule was hydrogen itself, which had a mass value of 1.008. The excess mass was small, but well outside the limits of experimental uncertainty. Aston and others quickly realized that the discrepancy is due to the binding energy of atoms, that is, the mass of a number of hydrogen atoms bound into a single atom must be less than the sum of the masses of the separate hydrogen atoms. Aston's work on isotopes won him the 1922 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of isotopes in a large number of non- radioactive elements, and for his enunciation of the whole number rule. Noting Aston's recent discovery of nuclear binding energy, in 1920 Arthur Eddington suggested that stars may obtain their energy by fusing hydrogen (protons) into helium and that the heavier elements may form in stars. Atomic number and Moseley's law Rutherford and others had noted the disparity between the mass of an atom, computed in atomic mass units, and the approximate charge required on the nucleus for the Rutherford model to work. The required charge of the atomic nucleus was usually about half its atomic mass. Antonius van den Broek boldly hypothesized that the required charge, denoted by Z, was not half of the atomic weight for elements, but instead was exactly equal to the element's ordinal position in the periodic table. At that time, the positions of the elements in the periodic table were not known to have any physical significance. If the elements were ordered based on increasing atomic mass, however, periodicity in chemical properties was exhibited. Exceptions to this periodicity were apparent, however, such as cobalt and nickel. At the University of Manchester in 1913 Henry Moseley discussed the new Bohr model of the atom with the visiting Bohr. The model accounted for the electromagnetic emission spectrum from the hydrogen atom, and Moseley and Bohr wondered if the electromagnetic emission spectra of heavier elements such as cobalt and nickel would follow their ordering by weight, or by their position in the periodic table. In 1913-1914 Moseley tested the question experimentally by using X-ray diffraction techniques. He found that the most intense short-wavelength line in the X-ray spectrum of a particular element, known as the K-alpha line, was related to the element's position in the periodic table, that is, its atomic number, Z. Indeed, Moseley introduced this nomenclature. Moseley found that the frequencies of the radiation were related in a simple way to the atomic number of the elements for a large number of elements. Within a year it was noted that the equation for the relation, now called Moseley's law, could be explained in terms of the 1913 Bohr model, with reasonable extra assumptions about atomic structure in other elements. Moseley's result, by Bohr's later account, not only established atomic number as a measurable experimental quantity, but gave it a physical meaning as the positive charge on the atomic nucleus. The elements could be ordered in the periodic system in order of atomic number, rather than atomic weight. The result tied together the organization of the periodic table, the Bohr model for the atom, and Rutherford's model for alpha scattering from nuclei. It was cited by Rutherford, Bohr, and others as a critical advance in understanding the nature of the atomic nucleus. Further research in atomic physics was interrupted by the outbreak of World War I. Moseley was killed in 1915 at the Battle of Gallipoli, while Rutherford's student James Chadwick was interned in Germany for the duration of the war, 1914-1918. In Berlin, Lise Meitner's and Otto Hahn's research work on determining the radioactive decay chains of radium and uranium by precise chemical separation was interrupted. Meitner spent much of the war working as a radiologist and medical X-ray technician near the Austrian front, while Hahn, a chemist, worked on research in poison gas warfare. Rutherford atom Ernest Rutherford In 1920 Rutherford gave a Bakerian lecture at the Royal Society entitled the \\"Nuclear Constitution of Atoms\\", a summary of recent experiments on atomic nuclei and conclusions as to the structure of atomic nuclei. By 1920, the existence of electrons within the atomic nucleus was widely assumed. It was assumed the nucleus consisted of hydrogen nuclei in number equal to the atomic mass. But since each hydrogen nucleus had charge +1, the nucleus required a smaller number of \\"internal electrons\\" each of charge -1 to give the nucleus its correct total charge. The mass of protons is about 1800 times greater than that of electrons, so the mass of the electrons is incidental in this computation. Such a model was consistent with the scattering of alpha particles from heavy nuclei, as well as the charge and mass of the many isotopes that had been identified. There were other motivations for the proton‚Äìelectron model. As noted by Rutherford at the time, \\"We have strong reason for believing that the nuclei of atoms contain electrons as well as positively charged bodies...\\", namely, it was known that beta radiation was electrons emitted from the nucleus. In that lecture, Rutherford conjectured the existence of new particles. The alpha particle was known to be very stable, and it was assumed to retain its identity within the nucleus. The alpha particle was presumed to consist of four protons and two closely bound electrons to give it +2 charge and mass 4. In a 1919 paper, Rutherford had reported the apparent discovery of a new doubly charged particle of mass 3, denoted the X++, interpreted to consist of three protons and a closely bound electron. This result suggested to Rutherford the likely existence of two new particles: one of two protons with a closely bound electron, and another of one proton and a closely bound electron. The X++ particle was later determined to have mass 4 and to be just a low-energy alpha particle. Nevertheless, Rutherford had conjectured the existence of the deuteron, a +1 charge particle of mass 2, and the neutron, a neutral particle of mass 1. The former is the nucleus of deuterium, discovered in 1931 by Harold Urey. The mass of the hypothetical neutral particle would be little different from that of the proton. Rutherford determined that such a zero- charge particle would be difficult to detect by available techniques. By 1921 Rutherford and William Harkins had independently named the uncharged particle the neutron, while about that same time the word proton was adopted for the hydrogen nucleus.Rutherford reported acceptance by the British Association of the word proton for the hydrogen nucleus in a footnote to Neutron was apparently constructed from the Latin root for neutral and the Greek ending -on (by imitation of electron and proton). References to the word neutron in connection with the atom can be found in the literature as early as 1899, however. Rutherford and Chadwick immediately began an experimental program at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge to search for the neutron. The experiments continued throughout the 1920s without success. Rutherford's conjecture was not widely accepted. In his 1931 monograph on the Constitution of Atomic Nuclei and Radioactivity, George Gamow, then at the Institute for Theoretical Physics in Copenhagen, did not mention the neutron.Gamow G. (1931) Constitution of Atomic Nuclei and Radiation, Oxford: Clarendon Press At the time of their 1932 measurements in Paris that would lead to the discovery of the neutron, Ir√®ne Joliot-Curie and Fr√©d√©ric Joliot were unaware of the conjecture. Problems of the nuclear electrons hypothesis Throughout the 1920s, physicists assumed that the atomic nucleus was composed of protons and \\"nuclear electrons\\". Under this hypothesis, the nitrogen-14 (14N) nucleus would be composed of 14 protons and 7 electrons, so that it would have a net charge of +7 elementary charge units and a mass of 14 atomic mass units. This nucleus would also be orbited by another 7 electrons, termed \\"external electrons\\" by Rutherford, to complete the 14N atom. However problems with the hypothesis soon became apparent. Ralph Kronig pointed out in 1926 that the observed hyperfine structure of atomic spectra was inconsistent with the proton‚Äìelectron hypothesis. This structure is caused by the influence of the nucleus on the dynamics of orbiting electrons. The magnetic moments of supposed \\"nuclear electrons\\" should produce hyperfine spectral line splittings similar to the Zeeman effect, but no such effects were observed. It seemed that the magnetic moment of the electron vanished when it was within the nucleus. While on a visit to Utrecht University in 1928, Kronig learned of a surprising aspect of the rotational spectrum of N2+. The precision measurement made by Leonard Ornstein, the director of Utrecht's Physical Laboratory, showed that the spin of nitrogen nucleus must be equal to one. However, if the nitrogen-14 (14N) nucleus was composed of 14 protons and 7 electrons, an odd number of spin-1/2 particles, then the resultant nuclear spin should be half- integer. Kronig therefore suggested that perhaps \\"protons and electrons do not retain their identity to the extent they do outside the nucleus\\". Observations of the rotational energy levels of diatomic molecules using Raman spectroscopy by Franco Rasetti in 1929 were inconsistent with the statistics expected from the proton‚Äìelectron hypothesis. Rasetti obtained band spectra for H2 and N2 molecules. While the lines for both diatomic molecules showed alternation in intensity between light and dark, the pattern of alternation for H2 is opposite to that of the N2. After carefully analyzing these experimental results, German physicists Walter Heitler and Gerhard Herzberg showed that the hydrogen nuclei obeys Fermi statistics and the nitrogen nuclei obeys Bose statistics. However, a then unpublished result of Eugene Wigner showed that a composite system with an odd number of spin-1/2 particles must obey Fermi statistics; a system with an even number of spin-1/2 particle obeys Bose statistics. If the nitrogen nucleus had 21 particles, it should obey Fermi statistics, contrary to fact. Thus, Heitler and Herzberg concluded: \\"the electron in the nucleus ... loses its ability to determine the statistics of the nucleus.\\" The Klein paradox, discovered by Oskar Klein in 1928, presented further quantum mechanical objections to the notion of an electron confined within a nucleus. Derived from the Dirac equation, this clear and precise paradox suggested that an electron approaching a high potential barrier has a high probability of passing through the barrier by a pair creation process. Apparently, an electron could not be confined within a nucleus by any potential well. The meaning of this paradox was intensely debated at the time. By about 1930 it was generally recognized that it was difficult to reconcile the proton‚Äìelectron model for nuclei with the Heisenberg uncertainty relation of quantum mechanics. This relation, , implies that an electron confined to a region the size of an atomic nucleus typically has a kinetic energy not less than 40 MeV, which is larger than the observed energy of beta particles emitted from the nucleus. Such energy is also much larger than the binding energy of nucleons, which Aston and others had shown to be less than 9 MeV per nucleon. In 1927, Charles Ellis and W. Wooster at the Cavendish Laboratory measured the energies of Œ≤-decay electrons. They found that the distribution of energies from any particular radioactive nuclei was broad and continuous, a result that contrasted notably with the distinct energy values observed in alpha and gamma decay. Further, the continuous energy distribution seemed to indicate that energy was not conserved by this \\"nuclear electrons\\" process. Indeed, in 1929 Bohr proposed to modify the law of energy conservation to account for the continuous energy distribution. The proposal earned the support of Werner Heisenberg. Such considerations were apparently reasonable, inasmuch as the laws of quantum mechanics had so recently overturned the laws of classical mechanics. While all these considerations did not \\"prove\\" an electron could not exist in the nucleus, they were confusing and challenging for physicists to interpret. Many theories were invented to explain how the above arguments could be wrong. In his 1931 monograph, Gamow summarized all these contradictions, marking the statements regarding electrons in the nucleus with warning symbols. Discovery of the neutron In 1930, Walther Bothe and Herbert Becker in Giessen, Germany found that if the energetic alpha particles emitted from polonium fell on certain light elements, specifically beryllium (), boron (), or lithium (), an unusually penetrating radiation was produced. Beryllium produced the most intense radiation. Polonium is highly radioactive, producing energetic alpha radiation, and it was commonly used for scattering experiments at the time. Alpha radiation can be influenced by an electric field, because it is composed of charged particles. The observed penetrating radiation was not influenced by an electric field, however, so it was thought to be gamma radiation. The radiation was more penetrating than any gamma rays known, and the details of experimental results were difficult to interpret. A schematic diagram of the experiment used to discover the neutron in 1932. At left, a polonium source was used to irradiate beryllium with alpha particles, which induced an uncharged radiation. When this radiation struck paraffin wax, protons were ejected. The protons were observed using a small ionization chamber. Adapted from Chadwick (1932). Two years later Ir√®ne Joliot-Curie and Fr√©d√©ric Joliot in Paris showed that if this unknown radiation fell on paraffin wax, or any other hydrogen-containing compound, it ejected protons of very high energy (5 MeV). This observation was not in itself inconsistent with the assumed gamma ray nature of the new radiation, but that interpretation (Compton scattering) had a logical problem. From energy and momentum considerations, a gamma ray would have to have impossibly high energy (50 MeV) to scatter a massive proton. In Rome, the young physicist Ettore Majorana declared that the manner in which the new radiation interacted with protons required a new neutral particle.Zichichi, A., Ettore Majorana: genius and mystery, CERN Courier, 25 July 2006, Access date: 16 November 2017. On hearing of the Paris results, neither Rutherford nor James Chadwick at the Cavendish Laboratory believed the gamma ray hypothesis. Assisted by Norman Feather, Chadwick quickly performed a series of experiments showing that the gamma ray hypothesis was untenable. The previous year, Chadwick, J.E.R. Constable, and E.C. Pollard had already conducted experiments on disintegrating light elements using alpha radiation from polonium. They had also developed more accurate and efficient methods for detecting, counting, and recording the ejected protons. Chadwick repeated the creation of the radiation using beryllium to absorb the alpha particles: 9Be + 4He (Œ±) ‚Üí 12C + 1n. Following the Paris experiment, he aimed the radiation at paraffin wax, a hydrocarbon high in hydrogen content, hence offering a target dense with protons. As in the Paris experiment, the radiation energetically scattered some of the protons. Chadwick measured the range of these protons, and also measured how the new radiation impacted the atoms of various gases. He found that the new radiation consisted of not gamma rays, but uncharged particles with about the same mass as the proton. These particles were neutrons. Chadwick won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1935 for this discovery. The year 1932 was later referred to as the \\"annus mirabilis\\" for nuclear physics in the Cavendish Laboratory, with discoveries of the neutron, artificial nuclear disintegration by the Cockcroft‚ÄìWalton particle accelerator, and the positron. Proton‚Äìneutron model of the nucleus Models depicting the nucleus and electron energy levels in hydrogen, helium, lithium, and neon atoms. In reality, the diameter of the nucleus is about 100,000 times smaller than the diameter of the atom. Given the problems of the proton‚Äìelectron model,Friedlander, G.; Kennedy, J.W.; Miller, J.M. (1964) Nuclear and Radiochemistry (2nd edition), Wiley, pp. 22‚Äì23 and 38‚Äì39 it was quickly accepted that the atomic nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons, although the precise nature of the neutron was initially unclear. Within months after the discovery of the neutron, Werner Heisenberg and Dmitri IvanenkoIwanenko, D.D., The neutron hypothesis, Nature 129 (1932) 798. had proposed proton‚Äìneutron models for the nucleus.Miller A. I. Early Quantum Electrodynamics: A Sourcebook, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1995, , pp. 84‚Äì88. Heisenberg's landmark papers approached the description of protons and neutrons in the nucleus through quantum mechanics. While Heisenberg's theory for protons and neutrons in the nucleus was a \\"major step toward understanding the nucleus as a quantum mechanical system,\\" he still assumed the presence of nuclear electrons. In particular, Heisenberg assumed the neutron was a proton‚Äìelectron composite, for which there is no quantum mechanical explanation. Heisenberg had no explanation for how lightweight electrons could be bound within the nucleus. Heisenberg introduced the first theory of nuclear exchange forces that bind the nucleons. He considered protons and neutrons to be different quantum states of the same particle, i.e., nucleons distinguished by the value of their nuclear isospin quantum numbers. The proton‚Äìneutron model explained the puzzle of dinitrogen. When 14N was proposed to consist of 3 pairs each of protons and neutrons, with an additional unpaired neutron and proton each contributing a spin of ƒß in the same direction for a total spin of 1 ƒß, the model became viable. Soon, neutrons were used to naturally explain spin differences in many different nuclides in the same way. If the proton‚Äìneutron model for the nucleus resolved many issues, it highlighted the problem of explaining the origins of beta radiation. No existing theory could account for how electrons, or positrons, could emanate from the nucleus. In 1934, Enrico Fermi published his classic paper describing the process of beta decay, in which the neutron decays to a proton by creating an electron and a (as yet undiscovered) neutrino. The paper employed the analogy that photons, or electromagnetic radiation, were similarly created and destroyed in atomic processes. Ivanenko had suggested a similar analogy in 1932. Fermi's theory requires the neutron to be a spin- particle. The theory preserved the principle of conservation of energy, which had been thrown into question by the continuous energy distribution of beta particles. The basic theory for beta decay proposed by Fermi was the first to show how particles could be created and destroyed. It established a general, basic theory for the interaction of particles by weak or strong forces. While this influential paper has stood the test of time, the ideas within it were so new that when it was first submitted to the journal Nature in 1933 it was rejected as being too speculative. The nature of the neutron Seventh Solvay Conference, 1933. The question of whether the neutron was a composite particle of a proton and an electron persisted for a few years after its discovery. In 1932 Harrie Massey explored a model for a composite neutron to account for its great penetrating power through matter and its electrical neutrality, for example. The issue was a legacy of the prevailing view from the 1920s that the only elementary particles were the proton and electron. The nature of the neutron was a primary topic of discussion at the 7th Solvay Conference held in October 1933, attended by Heisenberg, Niels Bohr, Lise Meitner, Ernest Lawrence, Fermi, Chadwick, and others. As posed by Chadwick in his Bakerian Lecture in 1933, the primary question was the mass of the neutron relative to the proton. If the neutron's mass was less than the combined masses of a proton and an electron (), then the neutron could be a proton- electron composite because of the mass defect from the nuclear binding energy. If greater than the combined masses, then the neutron was elementary like the proton. The question was challenging to answer because the electron's mass is only 0.05% of the proton's, hence exceptionally precise measurements were required. The difficulty of making the measurement is illustrated by the wide- ranging values for the mass of the neutron obtained from 1932‚Äì1934. The accepted value today is . In Chadwick's 1932 paper reporting on the discovery, he estimated the mass of the neutron to be between and . By bombarding boron with alpha particles, Fr√©d√©ric and Ir√®ne Joliot-Curie obtained a high value of , while Ernest Lawrence's team at the University of California measured the small value using their new cyclotron. In 1935 Chadwick and his doctoral student Maurice Goldhaber resolved the issue by reporting the first accurate measurement of the mass of the neutron. They used the 2.6 MeV gamma rays of Thallium-208 (208Tl) (then known as thorium C\\") to photodisintegrate the deuteron :{ border=\\"0\\" - style=\\"height:2em;\\" + ‚Üí + } In this reaction, the resulting proton and neutron have about equal kinetic energy, since their masses are about equal. The kinetic energy of the resulting proton could be measured (0.24 MeV), and therefore the deuteron's binding energy could be determined (2.6 MeV ‚àí 2(0.24 MeV) = 2.1 MeV, or ). The neutron's mass could then be determined by the simple mass balance :{ border=\\"0\\" - style=\\"height:2em;\\" md + b.e. = mp + mn } where md,p,n refer to the deuteron, proton, or neutron mass, and \\"b.e.\\" is the binding energy. The masses of the deuteron and proton were known; Chadwick and Goldhaber used values 2.0142 u and 1.0081 u, respectively. They found that the neutron's mass was slightly greater than the mass of the proton or , depending on the precise value used for the deuteron mass. The mass of the neutron was too large to be a proton-electron composite, and the neutron was therefore identified as an elementary particle. Chadwick and Goldhaber predicted that a free neutron would be able to decay into a proton, electron, and neutrino (beta decay). Neutron physics in the 1930s Soon after the discovery of the neutron, indirect evidence suggested the neutron had an unexpected non-zero value for its magnetic moment. Attempts to measure the neutron's magnetic moment originated with the discovery by Otto Stern in 1933 in Hamburg that the proton had an anomalously large magnetic moment. By 1934 groups led by Stern, now in Pittsburgh, and I. I. Rabi in New York had independently deduced that the magnetic moment of the neutron was negative and unexpectedly large by measuring the magnetic moments of the proton and deuteron. Values for the magnetic moment of the neutron were also determined by Robert Bacher (1933) at Ann Arbor and I.Y. Tamm and S.A. Altshuler (1934) in the Soviet Union from studies of the hyperfine structure of atomic spectra. By the late 1930s accurate values for the magnetic moment of the neutron had been deduced by the Rabi group using measurements employing newly developed nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. The large value for the proton's magnetic moment and the inferred negative value for the neutron's magnetic moment were unexpected and raised many questions. Fermi and his students (the Via Panisperna boys) in the courtyard of Rome University's Physics Institute in Via Panisperna, about 1934. From Left to right: Oscar D'Agostino, Emilio Segr√®, Edoardo Amaldi, Franco Rasetti and Fermi The discovery of the neutron immediately gave scientists a new tool for probing the properties of atomic nuclei. Alpha particles had been used over the previous decades in scattering experiments, but such particles, which are helium nuclei, have +2 charge. This charge makes it difficult for alpha particles to overcome the Coulomb repulsive force and interact directly with the nuclei of atoms. Since neutrons have no electric charge, they do not have to overcome this force to interact with nuclei. Almost coincident with its discovery, neutrons were used by Norman Feather, Chadwick's colleague and protege, in scattering experiments with nitrogen. Feather was able to show that neutrons interacting with nitrogen nuclei scattered to protons or induced nitrogen to disintegrate to form boron with the emission of an alpha particle. Feather was therefore the first to show that neutrons produce nuclear disintegrations. In Rome, Enrico Fermi bombarded heavier elements with neutrons and found the products to be radioactive. By 1934 Fermi had used neutrons to induce radioactivity in 22 different elements, many of these elements of high atomic number. Noticing that other experiments with neutrons at his laboratory seemed to work better on a wooden table than a marble table, Fermi suspected that the protons of the wood were slowing the neutrons and so increasing the chance for the neutron to interact with nuclei. Fermi therefore passed neutrons through paraffin wax to slow them and found that the radioactivity of bombarded elements increased by a hundredfold. The cross section for interaction with nuclei is much larger for slow neutrons than for fast neutrons. In 1938 Fermi received the Nobel Prize in Physics \\"for his demonstrations of the existence of new radioactive elements produced by neutron irradiation, and for his related discovery of nuclear reactions brought about by slow neutrons\\". Lise Meitner and Otto Hahn in their laboratory in 1913. Nuclear fission caused by absorption of a neutron by uranium-235. The heavy nuclide fragments into lighter components and additional neutrons. In Berlin, the collaboration of Lise Meitner and Otto Hahn, together with their assistant Fritz Strassmann, furthered the research begun by Fermi and his team when they bombarded uranium with neutrons. Between 1934 and 1938, Hahn, Meitner, and Strassmann found a great number of radioactive transmutation products from these experiments, all of which they regarded as transuranic. Transuranic nuclides are those that have an atomic number greater than uranium (92), formed by neutron absorption; such nuclides are not naturally occurring. In July 1938, Meitner was forced to escape antisemitic persecution in Nazi Germany after the Anschluss, and she was able to secure a new position in Sweden. The decisive experiment on 16‚Äì17 December 1938 (using a chemical process called \\"radium‚Äìbarium‚Äìmesothorium fractionation\\") produced puzzling results: what they had understood to be three isotopes of radium were instead consistently behaving as barium. Radium (atomic number 88) and barium (atomic number 56) are in the same chemical group. By January 1939 Hahn had concluded that what they had thought were transuranic nuclides were instead much lighter nuclides, such as barium, lanthanum, cerium and light platinoids. Meitner and her nephew Otto Frisch immediately and correctly interpreted these observations as resulting from nuclear fission, a term coined by Frisch. Hahn and his collaborators had detected the splitting of uranium nuclei, made unstable by neutron absorption, into lighter elements. Meitner and Frisch also showed that the fission of each uranium atom would release about 200 MeV of energy. The discovery of fission electrified the global community of atomic physicists and the public. In their second publication on nuclear fission, Hahn and Strassmann predicted the existence and liberation of additional neutrons during the fission process. Fr√©d√©ric Joliot and his team proved this phenomenon to be a chain reaction in March 1939. In 1945 Hahn received the 1944 Nobel Prize in Chemistry \\"for his discovery of the fission of heavy atomic nuclei.\\" After 1939 Trinity test of the Manhattan Project in 1945 was the first atomic bomb. The discovery of nuclear fission at the end of 1938 marked a shift in the centers of nuclear research from Europe to the United States. Large numbers of scientists were migrating to the United States to escape the troubles and antisemitism in Europe and the looming war (See Jewish scientists and the Manhattan Project). The new centers of nuclear research were the universities in the United States, particularly Columbia University in New York and the University of Chicago where Enrico Fermi had relocated, and a secret research facility at Los Alamos, New Mexico, established in 1942, the new home of the Manhattan project. This wartime project was focussed on the construction of nuclear weapons, exploiting the enormous energy released by the fission of uranium or plutonium through neutron-based chain reactions. The discoveries of the neutron and positron in 1932 were the start of the discoveries of many new particles. Muons were discovered in 1936. Pions and kaons were discovered in 1947, while lambda particles were discovered in 1950. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, a large number of particles called hadrons were discovered. A classification scheme for organizing all these particles, proposed independently by Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig in 1964, became known as the quark model. By this model, particles such as the proton and neutron were not elementary, but composed of various configurations of a small number of other truly elementary particles called partons or quarks. The quark model received experimental verification beginning in the late 1960s and finally provided an explanation for the neutron's anomalous magnetic moment.

Other than Little Red Riding Hood, mother goat and her children, the three little pigs, the old farm dog, Sultan, and his son, Rex, live there. Everybody in the village professes to have had bad experiences with the wolves. The wolves live in the forest, which fascinates Little Red Riding Hood in spite of the stories.

The kingdom‚Äôs warriors are overpowered and the invaders take away the sacred emblem, thereby bringing a curse on the land. Decades later, the current Oba‚Äôs only son is ill and at the point of death. As revealed by the witch doctor, the sickness is as a result of the missing antique. Therefore, to bring the circles of deaths and famine in the land to end, an innocent girl named Uki (Oge Indiana) is chosen to risk her life by journeying to the land where mortals are forbidden, on a quest to find and return the antique. Three special warriors, who will stop at nothing until they achieve their purpose, accompany Uki. The journey proves to be a mission almost impossible as they encounter sinister immortal forces, which try to stop them from reaching their goal. The witch doctor with a seductress named Isoken has a hidden agenda as anxiety back in the village unveils series of dynamics in the running of the kingdom.

Her father was Jared Leigh, an amateur artist. She worked as an artist's model for a number of years. She married the painter Francis Wheatley, probably in the 1780s, and they had four children. Leigh began by painting miniatures, and by 1796 she was exhibiting at the Royal Academy. Her husband died in 1801, and Leigh struggled to support her family. An accomplished botanical artist by this stage, her work was noticed for its beauty and accuracy by Samuel Curtis, the publisher of the Botanical Magazine. She created notable full-sized illustrations for Curtis's Botanical Magazine as well as for his other works, Monograph on the Genus Camellia (1819) and The Beauties of Flora . She was supported in her work by the architect Sir John Soane, who commissioned the watercolour The Flowers of Shakespeare (1835), which depicts a bust of the bard in Soane's collection surrounded by all the flowers mentioned in Shakespeare's works. In 1807, Leigh married the actor and painter Alexander Pope, becoming his third wife. She taught painting, and her students included Princess Sophia of Gloucester and other members of the British aristocracy. Pope died in London in 1838.

Previously a community school administered by Lancashire County Council, Priory Sports and Technology College converted to academy status on 1 November 2012 and was renamed Penwortham Priory Academy. However the school continues to coordinate with Lancashire County Council for admissions. Penwortham Priory Academy offers GCSEs as programmes of study for pupils. The school also offers some vocational courses in conjunction with Myerscough College and Runshaw College. History Priory was first a Benedictine Priory dedicated to St. Mary until its lands were sold to the Fleetwood family at a price of ¬£3,088. The Fleetwood family then built a mansion in its place which became known as Penwortham Priory and lived there until 1749. The Rawstorne family lived at the Priory from 1783 until it was demolished in 1925. The school was opened as a secondary modern in 1953, built to serve the children and families of Penwortham's local community. In 1977 the school had transitioned to a reorganised comprehensive school. It was this reorganisation that prompted work to start on the building of the science labs but also the Sports Hall and Squash courts, as part of a dual use agreement between the school and the local borough council. Later, this agreement saw the building of the swimming pool and the Astroturf facilities. In 2000 Priory was awarded Specialist Technology College status, and became Priory Technology College. Two purpose built, innovative ICT rooms were developed to integrate the new media age in school. Following this, in 2003, the science facilities were increased to include three new purpose built laboratories and one room devoted to the use of ICT in science. Priory gained further credit in 2005 by becoming the first school in Lancashire to gain a second specialism in sport. In recognition of this, the school changed its name to Priory Sports and Technology College in order to reflect the dual specialist status. From this development came the linking of the school Sports Hall to a new PE and School Sport Independent Study Centre, to allow students, as part of their lessons, to make the connection between the practical and theoretical aspects of sport more easily. 2008 saw the next step in the development of the facilities at Priory. A brand new multimillion-pound Technology block was created, alongside the development of the Maths and English classrooms. All were enlarged, re-equipped and changed to produce modern creative learning spaces with the latest relevant technologies. The dining room also had a complete overhaul at this time to improve eating facilities. In 2010 there was a complete change to the resource centre area with the creation of the Accessible Resource Centre - the 'ARC'. With new, redesigned rooms and corridors, the ARC is an advice and guidance area in the school, designed to be accessible to all students, particularly in supporting them through the difficult choice processes for their post 16 learning.

The first replica was purchased in 1962, and installed in the rotunda of City Hall in 1964. On November 21, 1970, it was destroyed in a bomb blast that also damaged the building's east portico. The second replica was installed outside of City Hall soon after the blast (c. 1972) with funds from private donations. It was dedicated on November 6, 1975. The bell is listed as a state veterans memorial by the Oregon Department of Veterans' Affairs. History Portland has had two replicas of Philadelphia's original Liberty Bell. The first replica was purchased in 1962 for $8,000. It was constructed at the McShane Bell Foundry in Baltimore and received a 25-year guarantee against breakage. The bell arrived in Portland in June 1963, with a damaged base and beam since the sculpture had slipped off its supports. Repairs were made before the replica was paraded through the city on a flatbed truck, then put into storage until Independence Day, when the bell was presented to the city. It was publicly rung for the first time during holiday celebrations and installed in City Hall's rotunda on May 5, 1964. On November 21, 1970, a dynamite bomb that had been placed beneath the bell detonated, damaging City Hall's east portico columns, shattering windows, and destroying the replica. No one was injured, but \\"shards of bell went everywhere through the main portico\\". The crime remains unsolved; no one claimed responsibility or was prosecuted for the blast. In 1993, The Oregonian said: \\"Wild, highly vocal speculation blamed the blast on either left-wing or right-wing terrorists, depending, of course, on the accusers' own political persuasions. Others guessed it was a monumental prank that careened out of control.\\" Portland City Hall's east portico, 2012 Portland's second replica is located outside of City Hall's east portico, near the intersection of Southwest Fourth and Madison streets and across from Terry Schrunk Plaza. Private donations totaling $8,000 allowed a new bell to be purchased for $6,000 and installed not long after the blast (c. 1972). The bell has also been attributed as a gift from Philadelphia residents to Portland school children. Note: \\"Walk 2: Civic Center / Urban Renewal\\". It was dedicated on November 6, 1975. The replica was surveyed and considered \\"treatment needed\\" by the Smithsonian Institution's \\"Save Outdoor Sculpture!\\" program in October 1993. The Oregon Department of Veterans' Affairs lists the bell as one of the state's veterans memorials. Description and reception The sculpture is made of Best Genuine Bell Metal, a sixteen percent min-copper alloy, and measures approximately . It is attached to a horizontal beam that is supported by two V-shaped beams. The base is made of brick, metal (steel) and wood (mahogany covering) that measures approximately .

They were operated by the United States Army Coast Artillery Corps. Most were installed on single gun disappearing carriages; the only installation with four guns in twin turrets was built at the unique Fort Drum in Manila Bay, Philippines.Coast Defense Study Group fort and battery list All of the weapons not in the Philippines were scrapped during World War II. History In 1885, William C. Endicott, President Grover Cleveland's Secretary of War, was tasked with creating the Board of Fortifications to review seacoast defenses. The findings of the board illustrated a grim picture of existing defenses in its 1886 report and recommended a massive $127 million construction program of breech-loading guns, mortars, floating batteries, and submarine (underwater) minefields for some 29 locations on the US coastline. Most of the Board's recommendations were implemented. Coast Artillery fortifications built between 1885 and 1905 are often referred to as Endicott period fortifications. After the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the government wanted to protect American seaports in the event of war, and also protect newly gained territory, such as the Philippines and Cuba, from enemy attack. A new Board of Fortifications, under President Theodore Roosevelt's Secretary of War William Taft, was convened in 1905. Taft recommended technical changes, such as more searchlights, electrification, and in some cases less guns in particular fortifications. The seacoast forts were funded under the Spooner Act of 1902 and construction began within a few years and lasted into the 1920s. The defenses of the Philippines on islands in Manila Bay were built under this program.Berhow, Mark A. and McGovern, Terrance C., American Defenses of Corregidor and Manila Bay 1898‚Äì1945, Osprey Publishing Ltd.; 1st edition, 2003; pages 7‚Äì8. 14-inch guns were emplaced in the harbor defenses of Los Angeles, the Panama Canal, Honolulu, Hawaii, and Manila Bay, Philippines, all constructed under the Taft program. Except for Fort Drum, the guns were on disappearing carriages; when the gun was fired, it dropped behind a concrete and/or earthen wall for protection from counter-battery fire. 14-inch gun M1907 and M1907MI The M1907 was a wire-wound gun 34 calibers long. The M1907MI was a built-up gun (the usual US practice) of the same length. Twelve were deployed, all on M1907 disappearing carriages. Four were in Hawaii and eight were in the Panama Canal Zone.Ordnance 1917, pp. 38‚Äì40, 45Berhow, pp. 158-163, 220-223 14-inch gun M1909 Fort Drum in Manila Bay, called the ‚Äúconcrete battleship‚Äù, was a unique fort mounting four 14-inch guns in two twin turrets. A twin 14-inch turret made for Fort Drum being tested at the Sandy Hook Proving Ground. Fort Drum in 1983 with behind the fort. Annotated photograph of an M1901 Buffington‚ÄìCrozier disappearing carriage for an M1900 12-inch gun, generally similar to 14-inch disappearing carriages The M1909 was a wire-wound gun 40 calibers long designed specifically for the turrets of Fort Drum on El Fraile Island in Manila Bay, Philippines. An unusual design feature was that it was made without trunnions.Ordnance 1917, pp. 40-42, 45 The turrets were made by Newport News Shipbuilding. Fort Drum was built by razing the small island down to the water and building a massive concrete fort on it. The fort had four 14-inch M1909 guns in two twin M1909 turrets, with four 6-inch M1908 guns in casemates on the sides.Berhow, pp. 102-103 Despite holding out against Japanese bombardment, the fort was surrendered after destroying the guns along with Corregidor on 6 May 1942. It was recaptured in April 1945 by Company F of the 2nd Battalion, 151st Infantry Regiment, 38th Infantry Division, and a detachment of the 113th Engineer Combat Battalion of the same division. The engineers lowered a 500-pound TNT charge into the structure with a 30-minute time fuze. They then pumped in 3400 gallons of fuel consisting of 75% diesel and 25% gasoline.\\"How We Boarded Fort Drum\\" By Brigadier General W. F. Heavey; Infantry Journal; August 1945 14-inch gun M1910 The M1910 was a wire- wound gun 40 calibers long. Eight were deployed, all on M1907 disappearing carriages. Locations included Fort Frank and Fort Hughes in Manila Bay (2 guns each) as well as Fort MacArthur, San Pedro, Los Angeles, CA (4 guns).Ordnance 1917, p. 42, 45 World War II Along with other coast artillery weapons, the 14-inch guns in the Philippines saw action in the Japanese invasion in World War II. Since they were positioned against a naval attack, they were poorly sited to engage the Japanese. Except for Fort Drum's turrets, whose guns were in action until the surrender, the open mountings were vulnerable to air and high-angle artillery attack; their only protection was camouflage nets. Destruction procedures were executed on all the guns prior to the surrender of US forces on 6 May 1942. In 1940‚Äì44, 16-inch gun batteries were constructed at most harbor defenses, and all 14-inch guns not in the Philippines were scrapped in 1943‚Äì44.

It is located on the corner of Largo Monsignor Muzi and Via Luca Signorelli, and adjacent to the Piazza di San Giovanni in Campo, in the center of Citt√† di Castello, region of Umbria, Italy. History The Dominican order was introduced in the city in 1269, and was affiliated with a number of different churches. Construction of this austere brick church was begun in 1400 and completed in 1424. The fa√ßade is unfinished. On the left side are the square bell tower and the ogival portal dating to the 14th-century. In 1724, the interior was refurbished, removing nine lateral altars.Guida storico-artistica di Citt√† di Castello, by Eugenio Mannucci, (1878), page 154-155. The church contains mostly fragmentary and restored frescoes inside; in 1911 many of the Baroque additions to the structure were removed. On the left wall, next to the side door, is a depiction of Saint Anthony (1426), facing the wall opposite a Crucifixion, both attributed to Antonio Alberti. On the left side of the nave are three chapels with pointed arch entrances, one of which is dedicated to the Fallen in War and retains a 14th-century fresco depicting the Crucifixion with the Virgin and St John. At the end of the aisle, the two altars once displayed respectively two Renaissance masterpieces, a Crucifixion (1503) by Raphael for the family Gavari, The Mond Crucifixion is now on display in the National Gallery, London.; the other, a Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian (1498) by Luca Signorelli, for the family Brozzi and now in the Pinacoteca Comunale of the town. The main altar of the church contains the tomb of Blessed Margaret (1287-1320), Dominican tertiary, called the Blind of Metola, from the place where she was born. The presbytery houses a precious wooden choir, called the Coro Manno, being carved and inlaid in 1435 by the Florentine Manno Benincasa. Other painters include Santi di Tito and Francesco da Castello. The adjacent convent still maintains its 17th-century cloister, recently acquired by the City of Citt√† di Castello The lunettes of the inner arches were frescoed between 1662 and 1667, depicting the Life of the Blessed Margherita.

According to , the exact date of his death is uncertain. and give 1787 as his year of birth. was a French conductor and violinist. From 1824 to 1832, he was co-conductor (with Fran√ßois Habeneck) of the Paris Opera, where he prepared and conducted the premieres of the first two grand operas, Auber's La muette de Portici and Rossini's Guillaume Tell. From 1832 to 1836, he was First Conductor of the Op√©ra-Comique, and from 1837 to 1841, conductor of classical music at the Concerts Valentino in a hall on the rue Saint-Honor√© in Paris.  Early life and career  He was born Henri-Justin-Armand-Joseph Valentino in Lille. His father was an Italian army pharmacist, who wanted his son to become a soldier, but Henri exhibited such a great talent for music, he was allowed to pursue that instead. At twelve he was playing violin in the local theatre (probably in Lille), and at fourteen was asked to substitute for a conductor on short notice, thereafter mainly dedicating himself to conducting. Later he conducted in Rouen.  At the Paris Opera  In 1813 in Metz, Valentino married the niece of the composer Louis-Luc Loiseau de Persuis,; ; . who at that time was also the chief conductor of the Paris Opera Orchestra.. Persuis held the post of First Conductor from 1810 to 1819. In April 1817, Persuis also took on the duties of R√©gisseur g√©n√©ral de la sc√®ne et du personnel des artistes [General Director of Scenery and Artistic Personnel], which he held until 13 November 1819, when it was taken over by Giovanni Viotti (). Persuis died on 20 December 1819, and Rodolphe Kreutzer, who had been a deputy conductor since 1816, was named chief conductor in January 1820. Valentino was appointed deputy conductor under Kreutzer on 1 April. (1 April 1820); (\\"after the death of Persuis, that is to say, in 1820\\"); gives the date as 1818. Valentino was \\"rewarded with the reversion of the title of first conductor conjointly with [Fran√ßois] Habeneck\\" in August. (quote); (Valentino becomes chef d'orchestre adjoint en titre, sharing with Habeneck, in August 1820). The decree did not take effect until Kreutzer's resignation on 1 December 1824, \\"when the two deputies had long been exercising the function of conductor in turn.\\" (quote); (Kreutzer's exact retirement date of 1 December 1824). Each of them was responsible for different new productions, that is, the conducting of the rehearsals and performances needed to bring a new work before the public. Among the premieres conducted by Valentino at the Paris Opera are the following works:All were performed at the Salle Le Peletier. * Olympie, 3-act opera (revised version) by Gaspare Spontini, 27 February 1826Autograph letter from Spontini to Valentino (Paris, 1 March 1826), thanking him for conducting the orchestra (BnF catalogue g√©n√©ral - Notice bibliographique). says Valentino conducted Olimpie (as a \\"new\\" work), but does not give the date. , states that Valentino conducted the premiere of the original version on 22 December 1819, possibly an error. * Mo√Øse, 4-act opera by Gioachino Rossini, 26 March 1827Manuscript letter (Paris, 2 April 1827) with the autograph signature of Rossini, addressed to \\"Monsieur Valentino, Directeur de l'Orchestre de l'Academie R. de musique\\", thanking him for conducting Mo√Øse (BnF catalogue g√©n√©ral - Notice bibliographique); .

The French music historian Arthur Pougin describes Valentino as a conductor of the first rank: > Gifted with a talent at once energetic and supple, meticulous of small > details, capably inspiring the confidence and respect of all who were placed > under him, he excited not only the admiration of the public, but that of the > singers, dancers, choristers, and orchestral players. Moreover, his kindly > nature and integrity, his firmness and fair-mindedness won him general favor > and gave him great moral authority.: \\"Dou√© d'un talent √† la fois √©nergique > et souple, soigneux des moindres d√©tails, sachant inspirer la confiance et > le respect √† tous ceux qui √©taient plac√©s sous ses ordres, il excitait non- > seulement l'admiration du public, mais celle de tous les artistes du chant, > de la danse, des choeurs et de l'orchestre. D'autre part, sa nature > bienveillante et droite, son caract√®re ferme et juste lui conciliaient les > sympathies g√©n√©rales et lui donnaient une grande autorit√© morale.\\"  Premiere of the Messe solennelle by Berlioz  Late in 1824, Valentino had applied for the post of conductor at the Chapel Royale, where he was already a violinist. The co-director of the Chapel, Jean-Fran√ßois Le Sueur, had a young student, Hector Berlioz, who was composing a mass (his Messe solennelle), intended for the Church of Saint-Roch in Paris. The forces required for performing the work were so large, that both he and his teacher believed it needed a great conductor. Realizing that the situation improved their chances of a positive response, they approached Valentino, who, after inspecting the score, agreed to conduct, despite having serious doubts concerning the quality of the players and singers that he might have at his disposal. The performance was set for 28 December. Unfortunately, the general rehearsal, held the day before the scheduled concert, was a disaster: many of the amateur musicians engaged by the church failed to appear, and the instrumental parts, copied by the choirboys, were full of errors, so the premiere had to be postponed. Despite the problems, Valentino encouraged Berlioz to persevere and promised to conduct, if conditions could be improved. Berlioz revised his score, copied out the parts himself, and managed to obtain a loan, enabling him to hire the Paris Opera orchestra, augmented with the best players from the Th√©√¢tre- Italien. The performance, conducted by Valentino on 10 June, was an undisputed success.; In 1824 Valentino was made the Chapel Royale orchestra's Second Conductor, under Charles-Henri Plantade, and was designated Plantade's heir apparent. Valentino never was able to take advantage of this privilege, however, since Plantade was still the First Conductor, when the monarchy was overthrown by the July Revolution of 1830.  Departure from the Paris Opera  Spontini's 3-act opera Olympie was initially rehearsed by Fran√ßois Habeneck, but at one of the general rehearsals Spontini and Habeneck argued violently, and Valentino was asked to take over, replacing Habeneck as conductor in the further preparations for the performance of the opera. Pougin suggests that Habeneck likely developed a grudge against Valentino; that this was not without consequence several years later when Valentino chose to retire under pressure from management, and \\"it was precisely the rectitude and firmness of his character which became the cause, or at least the pretext, of his departure from the Op√©ra.‚Äù: \\"C'est pr√©cis√©ment la droiture el fermet√© de son caract√®re qui devinrent la cause, ou tout au moins le pr√©texte, de son d√©part de l'Op√©ra.\\" After the establishment of the July Monarchy in 1830, the administration of the Opera was radically changed: on 1 March 1831, it ceased being an enterprise of the state and was entrusted to a director/entrepreneur, who was to run it \\"at his own risks, perils, and fortune\\".: \\"√† ses risques, p√©rils et fortune\\" (cahier des charges du directeur, 28 February 1831). Louis V√©ron, who assumed this responsibility, needed to reduce expenditures and decided to lower the salaries of the weaker members of the orchestra. Valentino, unwilling to subscribe to a measure he considered unfair, decided to take advantage of an offer to become chief conductor of the Op√©ra-Comique.; .  At the Op√©ra-Comique  Valentino officially became First Conductor of the Op√©ra-Comique on 1 October 1832.. Among the premieres he conducted for the company are the following works:All were performed at the Salle de la Bourse, except for Zampa, which was given at the Salle Ventadour. * Zampa, 3-act op√©ra-comique by Ferdinand H√©rold, 3 May 1831; . * Le pr√© aux clercs, 3-act op√©ra-comique by Ferdinand H√©rold, 15 December 1832 * Le prison d'√âdimbourg, 3-act op√©ra-comique by Michele Carafa, 20 July 1833 * Lestocq, 4-act op√©ra- comique by Daniel Auber, 24 May 1834 * Le chalet, 1-act op√©ra-comique by Adolphe Adam, 25 September 1834 * Robin des bois, 3-act op√©ra romantique by Carl Maria von Weber (Der Freisch√ºtz, adapted by Castil-Blaze), 15 January 1835 * Le cheval de bronze, 3-act op√©ra-f√©erie by Daniel Auber, 23 March 1835 * L'√©clair, 3-act op√©ra-comique by Fromental Hal√©vy, 16 December 1835 * Act√©on, 1-act op√©ra-comique by Daniel Auber, 23 January 1836; ; . * Les chaperons blancs, 3-act op√©ra-comique by Daniel Auber, 9 April 1836; . * Le postillon de Lonjumeau, 3-act op√©ra-comique by Adolphe Adam, 13 October 1836; . According to the music historian Gustave Chouquet, in his article on Valentino in the 1889 volume of A Dictionary of Music and Musicians, \\"on all these popular works [Valentino] bestowed a care, zeal, and attention to nuances beyond all praise.\\" Offenbach In Valentino's final year at the Op√©ra-Comique, Jacques Offenbach became a cellist in the orchestra. Siegfried Kracauer, in his biography of Offenbach, recounts an unverifiable anecdote concerning the latter's shenanigans, arising from his boredom with having to repeat the same repertory night after night: > In order to make life a little brighter, he [Offenbach] started indulging in > practical jokes, in which [Hippolyte] Seligmann [a fellow cellist] > occasionally joined him. For instance, instead of following the score as > they should have done, each would play alternate notes; or Offenbach would > secretly tie several chairs and music stands together and then make them > dance during the performance. The disadvantage of all this, however, was > that M. Valentino, the conductor, had a strong sense of discipline. > Offenbach's salary was eighty-three francs a month, and for disciplinary > reasons and also, perhaps, for educative ones, Valentino would fine the > culprit for each offense. Offenbach regarded boredom as the greater evil, so > his salary often shrank to an alarming degree.. , repeats the portion of > this story having to do with Offenbach and Seligmann playing alternate notes > and quotes , pp. 4‚Äì5, who describes it as a \\"steeplechase of a new genre\\".  Concerts Valentino  Valentino retired from the Op√©ra-Comique on 1 April 1836 and moved to Chantilly, but the following year, on 15 October 1837, he inaugurated a concert series in a hall at 247‚Äì251 rue Saint-Honor√© in Paris,, p. 619. See also the article Bal Valentino in the French Wikipedia. where Philippe Musard had held concerts of dance music and masked balls. Valentino's intent was to offer an alternative to the Concerts of the Conservatoire (conducted by Habeneck) and to expand the audience for \\"high-class\\" instrumental music. Known as the Concerts de la rue Saint-Honor√© and as the Concerts Valentino, the programs combined instrumental pieces by Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, as well as turn-of-the-century French composers. There were also quadrilles, waltzes, and contredances directed by Charles-Alexandre Fessy and Dufresne. The concerts were popular, but the orchestra was always close to insolvency. The 1839 season was cut short, and the final concert was in April 1841. (The series was shut down by order of the government, according to the Revue et Gazette musicale.) Afterwards the hall was used as a ballroom, but was still referred to as the .; ; . In 1839 Valentino went to London, where he gave concerts at the Crown and Anchor Inn., p. 806 (Appendix). Wagner's Columbus overture On 4 February 1841, as part of the Concerts on the rue Saint-Honor√©, Valentino conducted an all German program, which began with Wagner's Columbus overture. This work, composed 1834‚Äì1835 in Magdeburg for a play by Wagner's friend , called for six accomplished trumpet players, which the orchestra did not have. A cornettist, whom Wagner consulted, promised four, if Wagner would re-write the parts, although only two of these players were considered satisfactory. At the rehearsal Wagner found they were unable to play soft high notes without \\"cracking\\". Furthermore, Valentino and the rest of the orchestra made it clear they found the work \\"crazy\\". Perhaps unsurprisingly, the performance was a failure, and Wagner blamed the trumpets, although he also hints that the audience may have been bored by the piece. According to the German painter and historian , the overture was hissed. During Wagner's two-and-a-half-year stay in Paris, this was the only work of his that he heard performed. On 28 December 1841, an article in Leipzig's Neue Zeitschrift f√ºr Musik attacked Rossini's Stabat Mater, which was to be premiered at the Salle Ventadour in Paris on 7 January 1842. Although the article was written by Wagner, it was signed \\"H. Valentino\\". Wagner's biographer Ernest Newman writes: \\"It was inevitable that many readers of the article should regard it as coming from [Henri Valentino], and it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that Wagner maliciously intended to create that impression\\".  Later life  After the demise of the Concerts Saint-Honor√©, Valentino retired to Versailles. In 1846 L√©on Pillet, director of the Paris Opera, offered him 15,000 francs per year to succeed the ailing Habeneck as the conductor of the Opera orchestra, but he declined. Valentino, who had remarried, continued living in obscurity with family and friends in Versailles, and he died there in 1865.

Cooper House is a historic house located at 301 Main Street in Oxford, Alabama.  Description and history  The house was built by Davis Clay Cooper in 1911. Cooper was a prominent local business leader, starting in his father's mercantile business. He later became the president of the Bank of Oxford, and was instrumental in establishing the Blue Springs Cotton Mill and the Oxford Oil Mill, as well as other business ventures. He also served on the city councils of Oxanna (before it merged into Anniston), Anniston, and Oxford, the board of education of Oxford, and was mayor of Oxford for 20 years. The house passed to Cooper's daughter, Annie, upon his death in 1943, and was sold out of the family in the 1970s. The house is built in a restrained Colonial Revival style, one of few large-scale examples of the style in Oxford. The two-story house has a truncated hipped roof with exposed rafter ends. The main block of the house is three bays wide, with a one-story entry portico supported by two groups of three columns. The front door has twelve panes of glass, and is surrounded by multi-light sidelights and a transom. The portico is flanked by a grouping of three windows, one six-over- one sash window surrounded by two four-over-one sashes on each side. A similar grouping of casement windows sits above the portico, while the outer bays of the second story feature pairs of six-over-one sashes. On the south (right) of the fa√ßade is a one-story sunroom topped with a deck. The interior plan is irregular, with rooms surrounding a central stair hall. Interior details are a blend of Colonial Revival and Late Victorian features. The house was listed on the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage in 2003 and the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. Also contributing to the property are a recreation building (which contains a bowling alley used by the adjacent Baptist church), garage, and gazebo.

It has bright or pale yellow flowers, an unusual calyx and leaves that are slightly hairy, especially around the edges.  Description  Melaleuca ciliosa is shrub to about high but variable in shape. The leaves are also variable in size, from to long and to wide. The edges of the leaves are distinctly hairy, there are a few soft hairs on the surface and many prominent oil glands. The flowers are white or pale yellow and arranged in heads or spikes at or near the ends of the branches which continue to grow after flowering. Each head or spike has 3 to 15 groups of flowers, each group comprising three flowers and up to in diameter. An unusual feature of this melaleuca is that the sepals are joined, forming a continuous ring of thin, dry tissue in a band less than wide around the edge of the flower. The petals fall off as the flower opens and the stamens are joined in five bundles around the edge of the flower, each bundle containing 5 to 11 stamens. Flowering usually occurs in October and November. The fruit are woody, cup-shaped to almost spherical capsules, sometimes scattered and sometimes forming tight bundles of fruits up to long. Kalbarri lookout. M. ciliosa fruit Taxonomy and naming This species was first formally described in 1862 by the Russian botanist Nikolai Turczaninow in Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© Imp√©riale des Naturalistes de Moscou. The specific epithet (ciliosa) is from a Latin word cilium meaning \\"fine hair\\", referring to the hairs on the edges of the leaves of this species. Distribution and habitat This melaleuca occurs in sand heath between Geraldton and Perth in the Avon Wheatbelt, Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest and Swan Coastal Plain biogeographic regions. It grows in sand with lateritic gravel in uplands. Conservation status Melaleuca ciliosa is listed as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture This species adapts to a wide range of soils and conditions but prefers a well-drained soil in a sunny position. Regular pruning help to keep the shrub compact.

As someone with great command of literary technique and theory, on top of his exceptionally fluid style, Halasa's writings combine smooth reading with complex structuring. This was because he had the ability to draw on diverse narrative techniques and literary tradition. According to comparative literature professor Walid Hamarneh, Halasa wanted to \\"[utilize] modern and post-modern techniques in novel writing, while at the same time preserving the great insights and creative achievements of the nineteenth- century realists.\\" Hamarneh, Walid. 2003.

No one knows for sure on which day he was born, but most agree that he was either born on the 3rd or the 18th of December. Fairly early in life, Halasa began reading books in Arabic, French, and English, while also demonstrating strong writing skills at the Christian Mutran boarding school for boys. Specifically, Halasa read a great deal about Marxism, politics, and American literature.http://www.ghalibhalasa.org/ev.html ghalibhalasa.org This interest in American literature manifests later in Halasa's life when he translates into Arabic a biography about William Faulkner, and J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye. Following high school, Halasa attended the American University of Beirut, where he received his B.A. in Journalism. For two years, while at the university, Halasa split his time between studying at the American University of Beirut and teaching at a school in Amman, Jordan. While in college, Halasa also became a member of the Communist Party. This resulted in jail-time, including almost two years in a Baghdad prison.http://www.ghalibhalasa.org/ev.html ghalibhalasa.org Exile Forbidden from living in Jordan, Halasa headed to Egypt in 1955. He studied at the American University in Cairo, where he also taught, and began writing articles on various literary topics.

Throughout this time, Halasa remained interested and engaged in socialist ideologies and politics.http://www.ghalibhalasa.org/ev.html ghalibhalasa.org After attending protests against Anwar Sadat, Halasa saw time in prison once more, and eventually banishment from Egypt in 1976.Hamarneh, Walid. 2003.

Chicopee is killed in a rig accident, however, and rival Mike Rawlins then sabotages the rig. Things get worse for Johnny when con artists Nan and Oliver turn up. She pretends to be Chicopee's sister, so Johnny gullibly gives her the half-interest in his oil rig. Rawlins buys up Johnny's outstanding debts and intends to take over. In an act of desperation, Johnny uses nitroglycerine to blast open an oil well, resulting in a gusher. An explosion ends up knocking Rawlins unconscious and pinning Johnny beneath the wreckage, but Nan, having fallen in love with Johnny, comes to his rescue.

She was a dedicated member of the National Women's Party. Wenclawska's main goal within this organization was to advocate fair treatment in the workplace for women. She also worked as an actress and a poet. Early life Wenclawska was born in Suwa≈Çki, Poland, and immigrated to the United States with her parents when she was an infant. At the age of eleven, she began work as a mill girl in the hosiery industry in Pittsburgh. Her father was a miner and her brother a slate picker. Wenclawska also worked in factories in Philadelphia. When she was nineteen, she caught tuberculosis, and was unable to work for two years. During this time, Wenclawska put herself through night school, and began working as a labor organizer. Later life Wenclawska worked as a factory inspector and a trade union organizer in New York City with the National Consumers' League and the National Women's Trade Union League. She also worked with the Woman‚Äôs Political Union by 1913 before joining the National Woman's Party. Wenclawska became an excellent public speaker during her years of union activism and would travel across the country speaking to suffrage rallies, often with National Woman's Party founder Alice Paul. However, Wenclawska would advocate for the inclusion of working-class women and men into the National Woman's Party while Paul did not wish to organize men and did not encourage a pro- labor message in her platform.Groff, B. (2014). Prison Writings of a Radical Suffragist. Defining Documents: The 1920s, 155‚Äì158. In February 1914, Wenclawska and Doris Stevens spoke at a mass meeting for working women and organized a mass suffrage parade in which working women marched to the White House to meet with Woodrow Wilson on suffrage rights. Also in 1914, Wenclawska and Lucy Burns were leaders of the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage's campaign in California to urge voters to oppose Democratic congressional candidates. She did similar work with other organizers in Wyoming during the electoral campaigns of 1916. During this time, she also wrote a poem, \\"The 'New Freedom' for Women,\\" that was published in The Suffragist. There she compared Wilson unfavorably to Abraham Lincoln, who sacrificed his life to give freedom to slaves. Wilson, in contrast, told suffrage advocates, \\"You can afford to wait.\\" In 1917, she was part of the Silent Sentinels protests at the White House. On October 15, 1917, Wenclawska was arrested, sentenced to seven months in jail, and was sent to the Occoquan Workhouse in Virginia. Once in jail, Wenclawska and her fellow picketers were threatened, assaulted, and abused. Wenclawska, herself, was placed in solitary confinement for at least five weeks. These abuses resulted in a hunger strike, a symbolic protest that forced the authorities to either release them or torture them by force- feeding. This demonstration also intended to identify the picketers as political rather than criminal prisoners. During this time, Wenclawska smuggled letters out to her husband, Philip Lyons, and her friends. In one of these letters she writes, \\"I am waiting to see what happens when the President realizes that brutal bullying isn‚Äôt quite a statesmanlike method for settling a demand for justice at home...All the officers here know we are making this hunger strike that women fighting for liberty may be considered political prisoners; we have told them. God knows we don‚Äôt want other women ever to have to do this over again.\\" Eventually all of the women were released and courts ruled that the arrests had been improper. Following more than two years of White House picketing, Congress approved the 19th Amendment and sent it out to the states for ratification, which followed in August 1920. Her engagement in political activism appears to have ended with her White House picketing and subsequent jail time. Wenclawska married shortly after she was released from prison, and the 1920 census listed her and her husband Philip Lyons living in Greenwich Village. She listed herself as an actress and performed in several plays in New York City and Provincetown, including a part in Eugene O'Neill's \\"Desire Under the Elms,\\" on Broadway in 1924 She performed under her maiden name, Ruza Wenclawska. Her death date is unclear. Guy P√®ne du Bois wrote of her as \\"the late Rose Winslow\\" in his 1940 memoir, Artists Say the Silliest Things. However, the Library of Congress website, \\"Women of Protest: Photographs from the Records of the National Woman's Party,\\" indicates that she died in 1977. It is most likely that she died in 1977. Legacy She was portrayed by Vera Farmiga in the 2004 film Iron Jawed Angels. In this film, however, Wenclawska‚Äôs character is utilized as a composite character to represent all working class women that contributed to the women‚Äôs suffrage movement and downplayed her role in the movement. Whereas in real life, Wenclawska was a major player in the suffrage movement. The film indicates that Wenclawska was inspired to join the suffrage movement; after Alice Paul pointed out that a woman with the right to vote is also a woman able to voice her opinions, such as the need for a safer working environment. It is unclear as to when Wenclawska was first introduced to Alice Paul and the National Woman‚Äôs Party, but it is known that Wenclawska was a political activist before this introduction and that she would do much greater things than suggested in Iron Jawed Angels. Doris Stevens published excerpts of Wenclawska smuggled diary scraps from her time spent in the Occoquan Workhouse in Jailed for Freedom (1920), a history of militant suffragists in the United States between 1913 and 1919. In 2017 the book Feminist Essays by Nancy Quinn Collins was published; it was dedicated to Wenclawska.

The concept of Local Live is to find new solo recording artists who write and perform their own original music, with the winner being determined by a panel of industry professionals and viewers worldwide. Local Live wields a panel of industry professionals who critique and coach each contestants song and performance . The original judges were gold and platinum award winning record producer Michael Jack, music producer Jazzfeezy, pop singer / Recording Artist Lorraine Lawson, and music/vocal coach Edwina Douglas.

For season 3, radio personality Robyn Gerson was brought in as a judge, leaving only 3 judges at the panel with Lorraine Lawson quitting the show and Edwina Douglas not being asked to return. In season 4, Michelle Blade, a singer who aimed to expand strict musical borders, replaced Jazzfeezy while he spent the year away from the show working on Grammy Award winning recording artist T.I.'s newest single \\"I ain't goin\\". Robyn Gerson left the show after season 3 and was replaced with dance veteran, Marj Malcolm just in time for season 4. Drop Daniels, a fourth judge was re- introduced to the panel for season 4. Season 5 marked the return of Jazzfeezy reclaiming his judge seat back from Blade while Marj Malcom was replaced with international supermodel Amanda Strachan. Local Live's first season was co- hosted by on air radio personalities Tara Dawn Winstone, Robyn Gerson and Steve Major. Winstone and Gerson quit after one season, leaving Major to emcee the show on his own starting with season two. In-House mentors Beginning in season 4, a permanent mentor was brought in before the taping of the live shows to help arrange the contestants original works, and prepare them for their final performance. Renee Cingolani joined the series in 2014, mentoring and music directing from season 4 to present. Previous guest-mentors have included Tori Hathaway (Local Live Season II winner) and Carley-K (Local Live Season IV winner).

He explained his aim for this mission as follows: \\"I want several Brazilians to have believed that not only am I speaking Portuguese as good as a native, but that I actually am a native.\\" Before starting this mission Lewis had 8 months exposure to Portuguese, having lived in Brazil previously. At the end of this project December 2009, Lewis stated that the mission had been a \\"partial success\\" with some Brazilians believing he was a native speaker for periods of up to 30 seconds. At one point he was put in police cell for being cheeky to a Brazilian policewoman.

The house was built around 1832, soon after the Treaty of Cusseta and Muscogee removal in East Alabama. Brothers Dudley and Fielding Snow, born in North Carolina, came to Alabama from East Tennessee to found a farmstead. Dudley Snow built a one-and-a-half-story dogtrot house as the center of a complex that, by the mid-19th century, included a smokehouse, three barns, a cottonseed oil house, a cotton gin, grist mill, tannery, blacksmith shop, and slave quarters. Snow was a small-scale slaveholder, placing him in a class between a large planter and small farmer or sharecropper. The house was renovated in the 1960s, and was moved in the 1990s from the original address at 704 Snow Street (coordinates:) to the actual location of Peek Drive, just across the Talladega County line, to make way for the expansion of Quintard Mall. See also: The house originally had a single room underneath a gable roof on either side of the breezeway, but as Snow prospered, rooms were added on either side underneath a shed roof. Enclosed stairways lead from the central rooms to the upper floor. The open central breezeway was eventually enclosed and the exterior covered in clapboard. The rearmost portion of the dogtrot was left open, forming a recessed porch. The main entrance consists of a double-leaf door with simple sidelights and transom. The interior log walls are covered with horizontal boarding and a chair rail and baseboard. The house also features primitive Federal fireplace mantels. In the 1960s, the entry was replaced with a modern stoop. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

When SH 550 is complete, it will be a limited-access toll route around the northern and eastern edges of Brownsville and signed as I-169, partly replacing and expanding Farm to Market Road 511 (FM 511). Its purpose is to provide a new entry point for truck traffic to the Port of Brownsville and forming a loop that allows traffic to bypass the northern sections of the urbanized extent of the Brownsville city limits. This may serve as a relief route for future traffic congestion and as a future business corridor. Route description I-169/SH 550 acts as a connector between I-69E/US 77/US 83 and the Port of Brownsville. The routes were constructed on the same routing as Farm to Market Road 511 (FM 511) from its connection with I-69E and US 77/US 83 southeastward to FM 3248\\\\. However, only the stretch between the I-69E/US 77/US 83 interchange and Old Alice Road is currently signed as I-169, and SH 550 is currently also incomplete, running along incomplete freeway segments and frontage roads. Separated travel lanes, intended to be the frontage roads, were the first stage of construction from I-69E and US 77/US 83 to FM 3248\\\\. Flyover bridges have been constructed at FM 1847 and at two rail crossings. The second stage of construction built a new divided limited-access highway, which splits from FM 511 at FM 3248 and travels southeast to a new entry point for the Port of Brownsville, and a new crossover bridge at Old Port Isabel Road. The third stage that will complete the mainlanes on the Stage one portion, and construct exit ramps directly to and from I-69E and US 77/US 83 at Olmito, begun in March and will end in approximately 60 days. The route is a toll route, but the second and third stages of the route are being funded with $36 million of funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. According to local authorities in Cameron County, upon full completion, the route will be signed as I-169 as a spur route of I-69E. History Previous designation SH 550 was previously designated on May 22, 1947, from US 80 west of Fort Worth, eastward via Fort Worth and Dallas to US 67 and US 80 east of Dallas. On July 29, 1953, SH 550 extended to SH 183. On September 25, 1953, SH 550 extended north to White Settlement Road. On May 26, 1954, SH 550 extended west to US 80, and the old route to White Settlement Road became a connection. On April 27, 1955, the connection of SH 550 extended north from White Settlement Road to the entrance of the Convair Assembly Plant. On October 30, 1958, the section east of the Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth Turnpike was cancelled. This highway was transferred to I-20 (now I-30) and Spur 341 at the inception of the Interstate Highway System on September 26, 1960. Current designation The first segment of SH 550 was opened and designated on July 25, 2008, despite the first stage of construction having been expected to be completed in 2010, with bidding for the final sections. The first phase of the route opened on March 10, 2011, with tolling for the bridge over FM 1847 beginning on May 11, 2011. Phase two, which created a new limited access highway from FM 3248 to a new entrance to the Port of Brownsville, was opened on June 1, 2013. The I-169 designation along SH 550 between I-69E/US 77/US 83 and Old Alice Road was approved by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials on May 13, 2015. I-169 was officially designated along the portion of SH 550 between I-69E/US 77/US 83 and Old Alice Road on December 17, 2015. On February 16, 2016, I-169 signs were unveiled by state and local officials along the designated section. On March 26, 2020, the I-169 designation will extend east along SH 550 to the end of the freeway 0.4 mile east of FM 1847. Future I-169 will extend over the SH 550 freeway to SH 48 near the Port of Brownsville. The entire route was expected to open between early and mid-2016.

Lewis was also arrested in August 1918 at the Lafayette Square meeting in honor of the late Inez Milholland (where she was the primary speaker) and sentenced to 15 days. Later she was arrested in January 1919 during the watchfire demonstrations (which she began when she set fire to copies of President Wilson's speeches on democracy) and sentenced to five days.  Night of Terror  On the night of November 14, 1917, known as the \\"Night of Terror\\", the superintendent of the Occoquan Workhouse, W.H. Whittaker, ordered the nearly forty guards to brutalize the suffragists there, including Dora Lewis. The guards threw her into a dark cell and smashed her head against an iron bed, knocking her out. Her cellmate, Alice Cosu, believed Lewis to be dead and suffered a heart attack. According to affidavits, guards grabbed, dragged, beat, choked, pinched, and kicked other women. Newspapers carried stories about how the protesters were being treated.\\"Move Militants from Workhouse\\". 1917, November 25. The New York Times. p. 6. Dora Lewis went on a hunger strike while at Occoquan. Despite the violence she experienced as a result of her work on behalf of women's suffrage, Lewis chose to continue to be active with the movement. After the Nineteenth Amendment was passed through Congress, Dora Lewis went throughout states such as Georgia, Kentucky, and Delaware to encourage support for ratification, meeting with limited success. In 1918 Lewis became chairwoman of finance for the NWP, and in 1919 she became their national treasurer. In 1920 she headed their ratification committee. In 1921 she was photographed at the new suffragist memorial by Adelaide Johnson that was placed in the capitol.  Personal life  Dora Lewis was raised in a prominent family in Pennsylvania. She was married and often was referred to as Mrs. Lawrence Lewis. Her papers are known as the Dora Kelly Lewis Correspondence Collection 2137 and are located at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania.

The game ended as a scoreless tie. It was the inaugural game at Dudley Field (now known as Vanderbilt Stadium), the first dedicated football stadium in the South. Prior meetings The game matched Michigan head coach Fielding H. Yost against his former player and brother-in-law Dan McGugin. Owing to the relationship between Yost and McGugin, the two teams played nine times between 1905 and 1923, with Michigan winning eight times. This 1922 meeting between the schools was the first since 1914. \\"It's All In The Slant.\\" Ironwood Daily Globe 18 Sept. 1922: 6. McGugin learned what he knew of the game of football while playing under Yost as a guard on Michigan's \\"point-a- minute\\" offense, and it was Yost who recommended McGugin for the Vanderbilt job in 1904. \\"Vandy Opens South's First College Athletic Stadium on Saturday.\\" The Macon Daily Telegraph 8 Oct. 1922Campbell, Judith D. \\"Vanderbilt Football: The Glory Years.\\" Nashville Business and Lifestyle 15.8 (1992): 58 Between 1905 and 1907, Vanderbilt lost only three games ‚Äì all three of them to Michigan. The loss in 1907 stopped a 26-game home win streak. For the first ever meeting in 1905, Vanderbilt traveled to Ann Arbor and suffered its only loss, 18 to 0. On the even of the 1906 game, 4,200 students attended a mass meeting at University Hall. McGugin and Yost both spoke to the crowd and agreed that the game would be one of the closest played in Ann Arbor in many years. D. G. Fite, father-in-law of both McGugin and Yost, traveled from his home in Tennessee to watch the game. John Garrels put Michigan ahead with a field goal from the 25-yard line. On the preceding drive, Garrels had completed a 15-yard forward pass to Bishop, the first legal forward pass completed by Michigan under the new rules. Michigan led, 4‚Äì0, at halftime. Early in the second half, Vanderbilt tied the score with a field goal by Dan Blake from the 30-yard line. With two minutes left in the game, Garrels ran 68 yards for a touchdown. The Chicago Daily Tribune wrote: \\"Garrels, on a fake kick, with splendid interference by Hammond, Curtis, and Workman, ran Vanderbilt's left end at lightning speed for sixty-eight yards and a touchdown.\\" Michigan won 10 to 4. Despite the loss, Innis Brown rated the 1906 Vanderbilt team as the best the South ever had. For some, Vanderbilt's eleven was the entire All-Southern team. On November 2, 1907, Michigan defeated Vanderbilt 8‚Äì0, in front of 8,000 at the Old Dudley Field (referred to as Curry Field following the building of the new stadium in 1922) in Nashville. The crowd was the largest up to that date to see a football game south of the Mason‚ÄìDixon Line. (\\"Had there been another minute to play, though, the Michiganders would have negotiated a touchdown, for the ball was on Vanderbilt's one yard line when the last whistle blew.\\") Bradley Walker officiated his first Michigan-Vanderbilt game. The game was \\"a big society event in the south\\", and the elite of Nashville, Chattanooga, and Memphis were in attendance. Students from every college and preparatory school in Tennessee, including Belmont College and \\"other seminaries\\", also attended the game. Vanderbilt was hampered by sophomores in 1908 and Michigan won the game at Ferry Field 24-6\\\\. Vandy's Ray Morrison running against Michigan in 1911. Before the 1911 game, Coach Yost reminded reporters that Vanderbilt's 1911 team included the same veteran line that had held Yale scoreless in 1910. Yost predicted a hard game. Thomas A. Bogle, Jr. of Michigan attempted two field goals in the first half, but both kicks were blocked. After a scoreless first half, each team kicked a field goal in the third quarter. Zach Curlin kicked Vanderbilt's field goal after Shorty McMillan fumbled a punt, and Vanderbilt recovered the ball at Michigan's 27-yard line. Later in the quarter, McMillan carried the ball 33 yards to the Vanderbilt 10-yard line on a quarterback run. Frederick L. Conklin then place-kicked a field goal from the 19-yard line. In the fourth quarter, Stanfield Wells ran five yards for a touchdown, and Conklin kicked the extra point to give Michigan a 9-3 lead. Vanderbilt responded with a Ray Morrison touchdown, but the extra point failed due to a high kickout by Morrison. In the Detroit Free Press, E. A. Batchelor wrote: \\"Vanderbilt's failure to execute properly one of the simplest plays in the football catalogue was all that saved Michigan from the humiliation of a tie score with Dan McGugin's peppery Dixie lads this afternoon.\\" Michigan had its greatest victory over Vanderbilt in 1913, 33-2\\\\. Batchelor wrote: \\"Vanderbilt fairly gasped in amazement as the Wolverines shot the ball from one to another with the precision of baseball players.\\" Michigan won 23-3 in 1914. Dudley Field This was Vanderbilt's first game in its new steel and concrete stadium, Dudley Field. The field was named after William Lofland Dudley, once Chair of Chemistry at Vanderbilt University, and an instrumental figure in the organization of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association; as well as a member of the Executive Committee of the National Collegiate Athletic Association and the Football Rules Committee.

Charleston, South Carolina: History, 2011, p.33 and p. 77‚Äì80 Governor Alf Taylor welcomed the visiting Wolverines, with a response in turn from Michigan coach Fielding H. Yost. The dedication of the stadium followed: Lt. Herbert Fox of the 136th Air Squadron circled back, flying over the northern goal posts, and dropped a decorated football onto the field which Coach McGugin caught off a single bounce. He then handed the ball to Yost. This was just the second time Vanderbilt played Michigan at home.

Michigan captain Paul Goebel rested his hurt knee by not playing against Case Scientific School. Only one spot in the lineup could be said to give Michigan trouble, guard Eddie Johns was forced to sit out due to academic probation. Harold Steele was to replace him. Vanderbilt, however, felt its lineup was not at full strength. \\"Commodores, Shy Two Stars, to Meet Wolverines.\\" Dallas Morning News 14 Oct. 1922: 12. \\"Vanderbilt Opens $200,000 Stadium.\\" Miami Herald 14 Oct. 1922: 5. Vanderbilt end Percy Conyers had a rather badly hurt knee, and center Alf Sharpe had just hurt his shoulder. End Lynn Bomar was fighting through a pulled tendon, and end Tot McCullough had some kind of strain in his arm leading to noticeable swelling. Quarterback Doc Kuhn was trying to overcome a sickness, including fevers which kept him from practice. Captain Jess Neely also had an injured left arm. Conyers and Sharpe were expected to start the game on the sidelines. Last year's starting end Thomas Ryan not returning for the Michigan game was also taken bitterly by Vanderbilt's fans. Vanderbilt was also working to remedy problems seen in earlier weeks with its line. Game summary Lynn Bomar with the opening kickoff.The game saw little offense, featuring the season's top two defenses as measured by points against per game. Vanderbilt punted 17 times, and Michigan punted 10 times. Some were surprised with Michigan's lack of an offense, citing it as Michigan's best feature. For the entire game, Michigan made only six first downs, with two off of penalties, while Vanderbilt made just one. Michigan's consensus All-American halfback Harry Kipke, had been rendered moot for most of the game. Fullback Franklin Cappon seemed the only Michigan player able to gain much for his offense. \\"Powerful Wolverine Eleven Held To Scoreless Tie By Commodores.\\" Augusta Chronicle 1922 Oct. 15 First half: Michigan captain Paul Goebel won the toss and chose the south goal. Vanderbilt decided to kick. Kipke made a first down on the first drive, which started from his own 30-yard line, but Michigan punted the ball away soon after. Vanderbilt kicked back and Michigan punted again after three unsuccessful pass attempts. The best chance to break the tie came early in the first quarter when Vanderbilt was forced to punt from its own 7-yard line. The Wolverines completed their first pass, Doug Roby to Goebel, setting in motion the change in field position which led to their being poised to score inside the 5-yard line. The Commodore punt was partially blocked, giving Michigan the ball at Vanderbilt's 25-yard line. Two end runs, two line bucks, and a forward pass brought them there, first and goal. Some six minutes had gone by at this point. The Commodores' defense stiffened and repelled four attempts at a touchdown. Three runs straight up the middle were stopped before the goal line. Cappon made a yard, Kipke lost one, and Cappon then drove to within a foot of the goal. Vanderbilt captain Jess Neely was heard shouting 'Stop em!'Russell, Fred, and Maxwell Edward Benson. Fifty Years of Vanderbilt Football. Nashville, Tennessee, 1938, p. 40‚Äì41 On fourth down, Michigan faked a field goal and ran with Harry Kipke off tackle to the right. Kipke was stood up just inches from the end zone. One Vanderbilt player even pushed himself off of the goal post, in an attempt to generate a greater backwards push, as the crowd cheered. Vandy's goal line stand. Vanderbilt's only noteworthy offensive play came soon after. Vanderbilt punted out of the shadow of its goal post after the goal line stand, and Jess Neely tackled Kipke, or Irwin Uteritz, hard on the punt return, causing a fumble which Neely recovered. Neely then connected on a pass to Tot McCullough, Vanderbilt's lone offensive highlight on the day. This gave Vanderbilt the ball at Michigan's 20-yard line, but the subsequent plays for Vanderbilt saw runs stopped for little gain and a pass intercepted by Uteritz. An exchange of punts opened the second quarter. Vanderbilt's defense controlled the quarter after this, forcing two more punts from the Wolverines. On the second of these Gil Reese \\"side stepped his way through half the Michigan team for eight yards.\\" This seems the only substantial gain for this drive, as Neely kicked it away to Kipke. When the ball was on Michigan's own 40-yard line, its captain Goebel limped off the field. Michigan was forced to punt again by the Vanderbilt defense. The half ended, \\"with both teams completely baffled in their efforts to score;\\" as the Commodores had possession of the ball inside their own 30-yard line. Vanderbilt fans cheered wildly, having held the Michigan offense scoreless. Second half: Jack Blott kicked off to Kuhn to open the half. Neely quickly punted the ball back and Michigan's offense took the field at its own 25-yard line. Franklin Cappon dashed for a gain on the first play, but nothing followed and the Wolverines punted. Reese was tackled immediately, and the Commodores punted the ball away on first down. Uteritz completed a short pass to Kipke, which along with an offside penalty netted a first down. The Commodores showed more defensive prowess when it held the Wolverines for downs at the 25-yard line. Later, Reese rattled off 24 yards on a punt return, breaking two tackles. Blott missed a field goal on the ensuing Wolverines possession, from about the 25-yard line. Vanderbilt cheering sections were \\"frantic\\" as the third quarter ended and still Michigan had not scored. Herb Steger replaced Roby to start the fourth. Steger fumbled, making the Wolverines punt from their own 25-yard line. Reese again showed skill in his sidestepping, but was injured. Red Rountree replaced him. Goebel eventually came back in and hurled a pass, which if complete may have got 25 yards, but Rountree broke up the pass, forcing a punt. In desperation, Goebel was now often passing; and the Commodores were often deflecting the passes. A 15-yard penalty made it 3rd down and 33 for the Wolverines. On fourth down, Goebel attempted a 45-yard place kick which fell short of the cross bar.cf. The last try for Michigan involved two incomplete passes, an attempted end run by Steger, and an interception by Commodore guard Fatty Lawrence. Vanderbilt had the ball at Michigan's 48-yard line as the game ended. It is said the tie was preserved when Neely recovered a fumble near the Commodore goal.2012 Vanderbilt Football Fact Book, p. 119 Aftermath The tie was the greatest of achievements for the underdog Commodores.cf. The game's result was \\"a great surprise to the sporting world.\\" It features prominently in the school's history. \\"The Commodores surprising even to their followers, fought the Michigan eleven, headed by Coach Yost, to a standstill.\\" Commodore fans celebrated by throwing some 3,000 seat cushions onto the field. Many publications called it \\"one of the big moments of the gridiron season.\\"e.g. The Vanderbilt Alumnus wrote \\"That 0 to 0 finish meant night shirt parades and a sleepless night of jollification. And so it was.\\"Sherraden, Jim, Elek Horvath, and Paul Kingsbury. Hatch Show Print: The History of a Great American Poster Shop. San Francisco: Chronicle, 2001, p. 35 Vanderbilt's yearbook The Commodore remarked, \\"Whence came that irresistible spirit that shattered the Michigan plays no one knows. Every man on the squad possessed it. It was the re-enactment of more than one chapter in the record of Vanderbilt's past. There never was a greater reversal in the history of athletics than that day. The dwarf stood like a Titan foot to foot and breast to breast with the grim Michigan giant, and disarmed him.\\"The Commodore (Vanderbilt Yearbook 1923) p. 18 It was said one Detroit reporter wrote \\"Michigan was lucky to escape with their lives.\\" Sam S. Greene remarked, \\"The defensive showing of Vanderbilt against the touted attack of the Western conference moleskin wearers was a revelation even to the ardent followers of the gold and black, who had expected a defeat by at least three touchdowns.\\" Captain Neely had tears of joy streaming down his face by game's end. \\"They were lucky to tie us\\", Neely later said of Michigan. The Two Captains: Paul Goebel and Jess Neely. Lynn Bomar and Jess Neely are often acknowledged as the players of the game for Vanderbilt. Lynn Bomar spent much of his day tackling Michigan's runners for a loss, \\"Vanderbilt Opens Its News Stadium with Tie.\\" Charlotte Sunday Observer 15 Oct. 1922: 2. and \\"tore through the Wolverine line constantly, and always emerged after a play on the far side of the defense.\\" while Jess Neely was a battered and bruised captain playing so hard despite his injured frame. Other plays of note for the Commodores included the shifty moves of Gil Reese‚ÄîReese made 105 yards on punt returns. The yearbook spoke of Reese's play, \\"Time after time Gil Reece caught punts, and shifting from side to side in a most elusive fashion, would run almost through the Michigan team, by a hair's breadth, escaping each hand outstretched to seize him. He resembled old Lewis Hardage, who taught him that shifty trick.\\" Scotty Neill's punting matching that of Kipke, with an average of 42 yards per punt, was also of note. The defense of Tex Bradford and Tot McCullough received praise. Walter Camp noted the strong showing of Vanderbilt, particularly impressed with Reese's punt returns and McCullough's run defense. He credited McGugin with having developed a well-trained line, and a secondary that was not far behind. Franklin Cappon. The New York Times reported that, five days before the Vanderbilt game, Coach Yost had already begun \\"pointing the Wolverines for their tussle two weeks hence with the Buckeyes.\\" In response to the claim that Michigan could not manage a win because of undue confidence, Coach Yost had said \\"We have no alibi to offer over the showing made at Vanderbilt. We did not score because we encountered one of the best defenses which I have ever seen in action.\\" \\"Tie Put Pepper Into Workouts Of Wolverines\\" The Jackson Citizen Patriot [Jackson, Michigan] 17 Oct. 1922: 17. Another account reads \\"Thousands of cheering Vanderbilt fans inspired the surge of center Alf Sharp, guard Gus Morrow, tackle Tex Bradford, and end Lynn Bomar, who stopped Michigan cold in four attempts.\\" The Michigan Wolverines went on to have one of the best records in the US and receive many postseason accolades. The only blemish on their record was this tie. Michigan and Iowa finished the year tied atop the Western Conference,cf. \\"Michigan and Iowa Look the Best.\\" The Toledo News-Bee 14 Nov. 1922: 14. and Michigan won status as the team with the most All-Americans as cataloged by the Romelke Press Clipping Bureau. Included on this list was Harry Kipke, Paul Goebel, Bernard Kirk, Stanley Muirhead, Irwin Uteritz, Oliver Aas, and Franklin Cappon. Harry Kipke was also named best all- around player in the US by Norman E. Brown. The next week Michigan played at the dedication of another new stadium ‚Äì Ohio Stadium. Michigan went on to beat Ohio State by a score of 19 to 0.

The film is directed by Kaylie Milliken and produced by Prost Productions.Tiffany Wilson, ABC7 News (March 20, 2015) The film was released on May 21, 2019.https://www.prostfilms.com/blog/the-news-weve-been-waiting-to- deliver/ Production background Milliken said that she decided to take on the project when her doctor told her that she had begun seeing negative Yelp reviews for her practice that she was unable to reconcile with actual patient visits, and that she had become convinced that some of the reviews were fictitious when a complaint was posted describing symptoms she had never seen in her practice. Business Insider reported that on the day following the film's initial press release and Kickstarter campaign, Yelp stock declined by 4% in afternoon trading. The Hollywood Reporter announced on August 12, 2015, that public relations specialist Michael Levine, would become the executive producer for Billion Dollar Bully. Levine has represented 58 Academy Award winners, most notably including Charlton Heston. The film has an unspecified budget, and some backers were requesting that they remain unnamed. Yelp response An unnamed spokesperson for Yelp, commented to Business Insider, \\"The director has a conflict of interest, as she has a history of trying to mislead consumers on Yelp. There is no merit to the claims they appear to highlight, which have been repeatedly dismissed by courts of law, investigated by government regulators, including the FTC,FTC Document - 5,392 Complaints against Yelp / Extortion / Libel / Unfair Business ... https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/how-many-ftc- complaints-against-yelp-as-of-july-2016-26665/#file-103928 and disproven by academic study.\\" Milliken, however, has since responded to Yelp's allegations, citing the fact that the reviews in question had appeared before she and her husband were married and that repeated reviews were submitted due to a misunderstanding.http://www.eater.com/2016/7/21/12248622/yelp-film-billion- dollar-bully Legal background In Levitt v. Yelp! Inc. (2011), Judge Edward Chen, found that removal of positive reviews, or re-ordering of reviews, fell within the Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act's \\"traditional editorial functions.\\" Additionally, the firm's motive and ethical underpinnings are irrelevant under Section 230's editorializing allowance. Judge Chen concluded: \\"The Ninth Circuit has made it clear that the need to defend against a proliferation of lawsuits, regardless of whether the provider ultimately prevails, undermines the purpose of section 230.\\" This judgment was appealed, and in 2014 the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found that businesses do not have a pre-existing right to have positive reviews, and that \\"threatening economic harm to induce a person to pay\\" therefore was not extortion under California law. In its primary ruling, the court held that, \\"We conclude, first, that Yelp‚Äôs manipulation of user reviews was not wrongful use of economic fear, and, second, that the business owners pled insufficient facts to make out a plausible claim that Yelp authored negative reviews of their businesses. Accordingly, we agree with the district court that these allegations do not support a claim for extortion.\\"(p. 12) Secondarily, \\"In sum, to state a claim of economic extortion under both federal and California law, a litigant must demonstrate either that he had a pre-existing right to be free from the threatened harm, or that the defendant had no right to seek payment for the service offered. Any less stringent standard would transform a wide variety of legally acceptable business dealings into extortion.\\"Levitt v. Yelp! Inc., 765 F.3d 1123 (9th Cir. 2014)(p. 18) Eric Goldman, writing for Forbes Magazine, explains that extortion by economic threat is a narrow construct and that this ruling only addresses extortion. Other 2014 pending cases against Yelp included false advertisement, and securities fraud. After the Federal Trade Commission revealed a number of complaints, shareholders are taking Yelp to court, claiming Yelp artificially inflated the price of stock for its executive's benefit. The Class Action lawsuit,Federal Trade Commission class action lawsuit being led by investor Joseph Curry, focuses on Yelp's \\"first-hand\\" reviews. The suit says Yelp required businesses \\"to pay to suppress negative reviews,\\" and then lied about the practice. Crowdfunding campaigns Billion Dollar Bully surpassed its initial Kickstarter funding goal of $60,000 by 150%. Subsequent campaigns were held during the production phase, including an Indiegogo campaign.https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/billion-dollar-bully References External links *Trailer at YouTube *Prost Productions website * *Chris Crum, Web Pros News (March 19, 2015) *\\"Yelp Plays Defense as 'Billion Dollar Bully' Nears $60,000 Goal\\", CBS KPIX 5 Local (March 26, 2015) Category:2019 films Category:Documentary films about the Internet Category:American documentary films Category:American films Category:Kickstarter-funded documentaries Category:Crowdfunded films Category:Documentary films about business Category:English-language films ","title":"Billion Dollar Bully"},{"id":"46192081","text":"Aleksandr Arkadyevich Zakarlyuka (; born 24 June 1995) is a Russian football forward.

She was the first woman in Mexico to hold an elected office. Early life Mar√≠a Rosa Torre Gonz√°lez was born on the 30 August 1890 in M√©rida, Yucat√°n, Mexico to Sof√≠a Torre. Her grandparents were Paula Gonz√°lez and Gregorio Torre, whose surnames she used to mask the difficult circumstances of being an illegitimate child. She attended the Girls' Literary Institute operated by Rita Cetina Guti√©rrez, an innovative teacher who rejected teaching girls only domestic skills, teaching instead feminist theory as well as a curriculum including astronomy, constitutional law, geometry, geography, history, and mathematics.  Career  In 1910, Torre began working at the girls' neighborhood school in the colonia of Santa Ana. After four years, she transferred to the kindergarten attached to the normal school and worked there until 1917. At the age of 14, in 1910, Torre joined the supporters of Francisco I. Madero as a propagandist. With Madero's assassination, Torre became involved in espionage against the coup leader Victoriano Huerta in 1913. When Venustiano Carranza secured Huerta's agreement to step down and sent Salvador Alvarado to quell the rebellion in Yucat√°n, Torre served as a nurse with Alvarado's troops. By March, 1915, Alvarado's troops had taken the city of M√©rida (in Spanish) and Torre entered the state Normal School. In 1916, as part of his socialist regime, Alvarado called for a feminist congress to be convened. Torre served as a promoter for the gathering traveling to Acanceh, Temax and Motul to boost attendance of qualified women. In January 1916 the Primer Congreso Feminista (First Feminist Congress) was held and topics discussed were education, including sexual education; religious fanaticism; legal rights and reforms; equal employment opportunity; and intellectual equality among others. At the Second Congress, held later that same year, Torre served as President. Torre assisted Elvia Carrillo Puerto in establishing the Liga Rita Cetina Gutierrez (League of Rita Cetina Guti√©rrez) in 1919. The group \\"campaigned against prostitution, drugs, alcohol and superstition\\" and gave educational talks about birth control, child care, economics and hygiene. They also inspected hospitals and schools and helped to found the state orphanage. In coordination with Elvia, Torre set up over 45 feminist leagues over the next few years and organized over 5,500 workers. In 1922, at the urging of Governor Felipe Carrillo Puerto urged the legislature of the state to allow women to vote and hold office. Torre ran for a seat on the City Council of M√©rida and won, becoming the first woman in Mexico to hold an elective office. Her term was cut short with the assassination of Carrillo Puerto, but Torre was proud of her service and aware that the achievement was a symbol for other women. Torre attended the Primer Congreso Interamericano de Mujeres (First Inter-American Congress of Women) held on 27 August 1947 in Guatemala City, which had the goal of discussing how to attain equality between men and women and suffrage throughout the Americas. Torre was the delegate of Liga Internacional y People's Mandate of Quer√©taro and was accompanied by Judith Horcasitas de Forgerave representing the Civil Service of Mexican Women, Emilia Loyola representing the teachers of Mexico City, and Elena S√°nchez Valenzuela representing teachers and the Secretary of Education of Coahuila.  Personal life  Mar√≠a Rosa Torre Gonz√°lez died alone in Mexico City, on 13 February 1973. Her death has been described as \\"lonely\\" since she did not have any siblings, nor did she marry.

Her work included clinical care, teaching, and research, particularly into the presence and development of ego strength in inner-city families. Lawrence studied young children identified as \\"strong\\" by their teachers in Georgia and Mississippi, as well as on sabbatical in Africa in 1973, writing two books on mental health of children and inner-city families. Lawrence was chief of the Developmental Psychiatry Service for Infants and Children (and their families) at Harlem Hospital for 21 years, as well as associate clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons (P&S;), retiring in 1984. Early life Lawrence grew up an only living child of Mary Elizabeth (Smith) Morgan, a schoolteacher, and the Reverend Sandy Alonzo Morgan, an Episcopal minister. They lived in Richmond, Virginia but traveled to New York City for Lawrence's birth, as their first child had died in the local segregated hospital. Lawrence said, \\"In childhood and through adolescence I said I wanted to become a doctor because of the death of my only sibling, a brother, at eleven months, and two years before I was born. Someone like me could have saved him.\\" After Lawrence's birth, the family returned to Virginia, then moved to heavily segregated Vicksburg, Mississippi. Education Because she wanted to become a doctor, Lawrence moved to Harlem, New York City as a teenager in the 1920s to attend Wadleigh High School for Girls and live with family. Lawrence gained a scholarship from the National Council of the Episcopal Church and attended Cornell University from 1932 to 1936. She was the only African American undergraduate, denied a place in the segregated dormitory. Lawrence supported herself by working first as a maid to a white family, living in the attic, and later as a laboratory assistant. Despite excellent academic performance, she was refused admittance to Cornell Medical School because she was black. Lawrence became the third African American admitted to Columbia College P&S;, starting classes in the fall of 1936 and graduating in 1940. She was rejected from a residency at New York Babies Hospital because of her race, and rejected from Grasslands Hospital because she was married. Lawrence completed a two-year pediatric residency at Harlem Hospital (1940-1942). With a Rosenwald Foundation fellowship, Lawrence then earned a Masters in Science at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. One of her teachers there was Dr. Benjamin Spock, who introduced her to the connections between physical, social, and psychological health. During World War II, Lawrence taught pediatrics and public health at Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee and decided to become a psychiatrist. In 1947 she began a National Research Council fellowship at the Babies Hospital, now an associate professor. In 1948 she became the first African American to join to the New York State Psychiatric Institute, as well as the first African American psychoanalysis trainee at Columbia University's Columbia Psychoanalytic Center, gaining certification as a pediatric psychiatrist in 1951. Career Lawrence described her work with children and families in inner-city New York as integrating psychoanalytic wisdom with spirituality. When Swarthmore College awarded her an honorary doctorate in 2003, the citation said that through articles and books, Lawrence's work \\"markedly strengthened the social and ethical awareness of the field and inspired in it deeper appreciation for the resilience of spirit at the heart of every child.\\" Lawrence directed the Therapeutic Developmental Nursery at Harlem Hospital and was chief of the Developmental Psychiatry Service for Infants and Children (and their families) there for 21 years. Lawrence was also associate clinical professor of psychiatry back at Columbia's P&S;, retiring in 1984. She studied children with difficulties and children identified as \\"strong\\" by their teachers, in Georgia and Mississippi, as well as on sabbatical in Africa in 1973. In the 1970s and 1980s Lawrence was one of the founders of the Rockland County Center for Mental Health and served on the New York State Planning Council for Mental Health. After retiring from her hospital and academic positions in 1984, she went into private practice. Major achievements and honors Lawrence was co-founder of the Rockland County Center for Mental Health in New York, the first recipient of Rockland County, New York's J. R. Bernstein Mental Health Award. She was a founding board member of the Harlem Family Institute (HFI). The HFI presents the Margaret Morgan Lawrence Award to honor outstanding service to the children and families of Harlem. She is the author of two books, The Mental Health Team in Schools (1971) and Young Inner City Families: Development of Ego Strength Under Stress (1975). The Susan Smith McKinney Steward Medical Society honored her with its Outstanding Women Practitioners in Medicine Award. In 2003 Swarthmore College awarded Lawrence the honorary degree of Doctor of Science at Swarthmore College, and she gave the Commencement Address. Lawrence also received the Episcopal Peace Fellowship's Sayre Prize in 2003, in recognition of her work to promote peace, justice, and non-violence. In 2004 she was awarded the Virginia Kneeland Frantz Distinguished Women in Medicine Award by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University.  Personal life  Born in New York City, Lawrence grew up in a series of Southern towns. In 1938, while at medical school, Lawrence married Charles Radford Lawrence II, then a \\"more militant\\" sociology student from Morehouse College, who continued as a sociologist and social activist, dying in 1986. They shared a deep commitment to religion and pacifism. The Lawrences had three children, one of whom is sociologist Sara Lawrence-Lightfoot. Their other daughter, Paula Lawrence Wehmiller, has been an educator and Episcopal priest. Their son, Charles R. Lawrence III, is a professor of law. One of the founders of a cooperative community called Skyview Acres in Rockland County, New York, Lawrence lived there from 1951. She was also active on peace councils. In 1998 she was the oldest in a group of people on the 85-mile march for peace from London to Canterbury. She also served as a lay reader in the Episcopal Diocese of New York. Lawrence-Lightfoot wrote a dual autobiography and biography of her mother, Balm in Gilead: Journey of Healer (1988). Reviewed by H. Jack Geiger in The New York Times, the book chronicles \\"seven decades of struggle, change and achievement,\\" including the accompanying emotional scars and conflicts. Geiger writes: > Do these scars last? I have rarely read anything as painful as Margaret > Lawrence's account, told to her daughter, of her return to Columbia > Presbyterian Hospital nearly 50 years later. She is, by now, a famous > physician, full of honors and achievements.

Biography Goodwill grew up on the Little Pine First Nation in Saskatchewan; she was a member of the Cree First Nations and a daughter of Cree leader John Tootoosis, about whom she would later write a biography. She decided to train as a nurse after spending three years at the sanatorium in Prince Albert recovering from tuberculosis. Graduating from the program at Holy Family Hospital in 1954, she then worked in rural Saskatchewan, where she reached patients in an emergency via bush plane or dog team. She also worked in Bermuda. After returning to Canada she became increasingly interested in aboriginal affairs, helping to develop an aboriginal magazine called Tawow. Goodwill helped establish the Aboriginal Nurses Association of Canada, and served as the organization's president during the period of 1983 to 1990. She was the first Aboriginal woman to serve as \\"special advisor\\" to the minister of National Health and Welfare in the Canadian federal government; she also worked with the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. Goodwill taught Indian Health Studies at Saskatchewan Indian Federated College of the University of Regina (now First Nations University of Canada).

Both schools are members of the Sun Belt Conference. While the teams have only met six times in football (due to Georgia State beginning their program in 2010), the rivalry dates back to the 1970s in basketball and other sports. History Georgia Southern and Georgia State have only competed against each other in football since 2014. They played annually in basketball from the 1971‚Äì72 to 1980‚Äì81 seasons, 1995‚Äì96 and 1996‚Äì97, and 2009‚Äì10 to 2013‚Äì14 out-of-conference and as conference mates from the 1985‚Äì86 to 1991‚Äì92 seasons in the Trans America Athletic Conference (which is now the Atlantic Sun Conference) and since the 2014‚Äì15 season in the Sun Belt Conference. As of 2017, Georgia Southern has a 35‚Äì18 lead in the all-time series.Georgia State 2015‚Äì16 Men's Basketball, p. 153. Since both schools can be abbreviated GSU, a point of conflict between the two is the claim by either fan-base that their university is, in fact, the real GSU. Georgia State lays claim to the initials as it became a university (and therefore GSU) in 1969 while Georgia Southern didn't achieve university status until 1990. However Georgia Southern is, as an institution, the older of the two schools. Both schools are referred to as GSU colloquially in their region of the state, though Georgia State is the only one of the two that officially brands itself \\"GSU.\\" For Georgia Southern, the initials were tied to their storied athletics history. Georgia Southern's athletics began as Georgia Southern College or GSC and used the initials in several traditions and fixtures of campus life. As Georgia Southern gained university status in 1990, several of these fixtures were updated to use the initials GSU, most notably the famous GSU bushes at the entrance to the campus and gameday rituals including the \\"G-S-U Scramble.\\" When Georgia Southern joined the Sun Belt Conference in 2014 (the conference Georgia State had joined the year prior), Georgia Southern updated its branding and media guidelines to explicitly state the school was to be referred to as \\"Georgia Southern\\" or \\"GS\\" to avoid confusion in the media, however, the initials GSU are still a part of campus life at both universities. The football rivalry began after the hire of former Appalachian State (a major rival of Georgia Southern) athletic director Charlie Cobb to the same position at GSU. During Georgia State's press release introducing Cobb, he revealed that Georgia Southern's athletic director Tom Kleinlein told him \\"welcome, now the war is on.\\" The two teams met on the gridiron during the 2014 football season at the Georgia Dome. During the run up to the game, fans from both teams expressed their dislike for the other over social media outlets such as Twitter. Students at the time used the hashtags \\"SouthernNotState\\" and \\"StateNotSouthern\\" in their tweets to differentiate which GSU they attended. Both schools adopted the phrases as a slogan that defined their side of the rivalry. During the period before the game, a beat writer for the AJC dubbed the matchup as \\"Modern Day Hate,\\" a play on the rivalry between Georgia Tech and UGA, Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate. Georgia Southern beat Georgia State by a final score of 69‚Äì31 in the Georgia Dome in front of 28,427 mostly Georgia Southern fans. After the game, Georgia Southern fans unrolled a banner saying \\"Paulson Stadium North\\" claiming the stadium as their own and cementing the rivalry. The next season, Georgia State beat Georgia Southern 34‚Äì7 to give the worst home defeat for Georgia Southern in school history. Currently, the series is even at 3‚Äì3. Rivalry series On October 1, 2015, both schools' athletic directors at the time announced the beginning of an annual \\"rivalry series\\" in which the winner takes home the Rivalry Series trophy and bragging rights at the following year's football game. The trophy was awarded to the school that defeats the other in a points- based system that encompasses all sports. Most wins counted as 1 point with football counting as 2 points. 2 points total were awarded to community service projects, and 1 to the school with the highest departmental GPA. See external links section for full points explanation and scoreboard. 1 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, the Sun Belt Conference announced that all remaining spring sporting events after March 16th of that year would be cancelled. Men's and Women's Tennis, Men's and Women's Golf, Baseball, Softball, and Women's Outdoor Track and Field were omitted from the point totals for the 2019-2020. On September 12th, 2020, new Georgia Southern athletic director Jared Benko made a public statement that the Rivalry Series Point-based System will be discontinued in favor of a different approach.

It is a potential tourism hub in the region due to its specie of wildlife in Umuezukwe and green vegetation. Location Situated in Oru-East, Awo-omamma is some 25 kilometers from Owerri and 62.5 kilometers from Onitsha. It covers about 89.2 square kilometres, on the bank of Njaba River and lies in tropical rain forest, with hot and rainy seasons. According to Rich Piazza, a volunteer with the Peace Corps in Awo-omamma, a four-day torrential downpour typifies the extreme of the rainy season in the town. Awo-Omamma is bounded in the North by Amiri, Imo State in Oru-East, and Mgbidi and Otulu Nigeria both in Oru-West. In the East it shares boundaries with Okwudor in Njaba LGA. In the West Awo- Omamma is bounded by Akabo, Oguta LGA, Awa, Oguta LGA, Abiaziem and Ngbele communities in Oguta LGA, and in the South by Eziama Obiato and Njaba River. Health and Community Development In 1958, a health and community development project under Dr. Ben Nzeribe was established in Awo-omamma, his native home. Before the Biafran war, Dr Nzeribe and the Unitarian Universalist Service Committee (UUSC) helped the community build themselves the famous Awo- omamma Community Hospital (ACH) a seventy-five-bed hospital. They also built two new schools, Awo-Omamma Community Grammar School which later became Awo- Omamma Education Project (AEP), a Boarding School Santana Primary School, and an unpolluted water system, six well baby clinics, and a post office. They also assisted in introducing modern agricultural methods. Beside the famous Community Hospital, Awo-omamma is home to many other private and public health establishments including Chinwendu hospital, Rose Clinic, Awo-omamma Dispensary, Umuokwe Community Health Centre, and many others. Similarly, there are Umuezukwe Health Centre and Isieke Dispensary in Umuezukwe and Isieke sub- communities respectively. Awo-omamma is a modern Christian community. In 1959, the Holy Ghost Fathers, also known as Spiritan Congregation of Roman Catholic priests opened their Philosophy campus (now known as Awo-Omamma Catholic Seminary) in the town.Awo-Omamma is predominantly Roman Chatholics, and a sizable percentage of the population are Anglicans, and CMS (Church Missionary Society of British). Some of the notable Roman Catholic parishes included: The Saint Patricks Isieke, Saint Basil's The Great Umuokwe, Christ The King, Sanit Johns, Saint Pauls, Saint Mary's, St Anthony's and St. Michael's Catholic Churchs. Among other Protestant churches are: The Saint Mary's Anglican Church Isieke, and Saint Augustine's Anglican Church Umuokwe. Awo-omamma is developing into an economic centre and a large Urban area. There are branches of some Nigerian financial institutions in the town including that of First Bank of Nigeria. Brewery Plant Consolidated Breweries Plc, which became a subsidiary of the independent global brewer, Heineken in 2005, has one of its breweries in Awo-omamma. The Consolidated Breweries Plc emerged from the merger of Continental Breweries Limited and Eastern Breweries Limited in 1982. The plant's brands cover the Lager, Stout and Malt categories and include \\"33\\" Export Lager Beer, Turbo King Dark Ale, Williams Dark Ale, Hi- Malt and Maltex Malt. The management of Nigerian Breweries (NB) Plc, another subsidiary of Heineken confirmed merger with Consolidated Breweries (CB) Plc with effect from 31 December 2014. During the commissioning of a block of six classrooms and a library built and donated by Nigerian Breweries Plc to Ubachima Primary School, Awo-Omamma, the Managing Director of the company, Mr. Nicolaas Vervelde, disclosed that the company invested N3bn in upgrading of facilities at its Awo-Omamma Brewery, less than a year after the merger with Consolidated Breweries. Oil and Gas By end of Q4 of 2008, Addax Petroleum Corporation announced it was set to expand its Operations in Njaba River area through its new oil discovery in Awo-Omamma. The new discovery in the company's OML124 license area on the northeast edge of the Niger Delta contains undeveloped Njaba 2 well and other exploratory prospects onshore Nigeria. Oil exploration and production have been ongoing in Njaba River basin since early 1960s. Addax Petroleum, Shell and ChevronTexaco have been operating in OML 53 and OML 124 in neighbouring Izombe. The then Senate Committee Chairman on Gas Resources, Senator Osita Izunaso said by the time Addax starts oil activity in their latest Njaba 2, the company could be producing about 15,000 to 20,000 barrels per day in Imo State. The Senator, during a visit at Izombe flow station also disclosed that establishment of an oil and gas laboratory in Owerri as well as further studies on the gas reserve in the Anambra Basin was covered in 2010 federal budget. The crude oil discovery is set to boost development of Awo- Omamma, Njaba River basin, Imo and Nigeria. The President and Chief Executive Officer of the company, Jean Claude Gandur, said the new onshore Njaba 2 field was a further example of the company's commitment to development in Nigeria. Agriculture and Infrastructure Traditionally, the occupation of Awo-Omamma community is agriculture including fishing on Njaba River. And there is sand and gravel mining along Njaba River banks. Fishermen, Fish Landing Sites and Fisheries Cooperative Societies exist in many Imo State communities; some are found in villages of Awo-Omamma and its bordering communities. Among them are Udoka Fish Farmers Group, Umuezukwe Awo-omamma and their Ughamiri (Umuezukwe) Landing Site (river port). There is also Kalabari Beach Fishermen Cooperative Society, Oguta; and associated Osse Abiaziem and Osemotor Landing Sites. These farmers and residents experience economic constraints due to unreliable electricity and undeveloped inter-village and inter-town roads. These militate against efficient operation of their fish and crop farming activities in the villages. History and Culture The indigenous community speak Awo-omamma dialect of the Igbo language and English Language. Awo-omamma people are rich in culture and cultural festivals some of which are Owu, Okorosha, Ekeleke, Egwu-Nmawu, and Agwuechi (Agwu nwoloko) masks as well as Ara Na Umu, Mgba (traditional wrestling), Udu and Igba dance, Nfijioku (Ahajioku), and Iri‚ÄìJi (New Yam) festivals. Follow the external link below to view Rich Piazza's narrative on some of these cultural festivals and masks in Awo-Omamma. There are 2 famous oral accounts to origin of Awo-omamma; these are referred to as the \\"Nne-nasa\\" and \\"Oma\\" village groups theories. Trade Route Awo-Omamma, through Njaba River, Oguta Lake to Orashi River, was part of the trade route to southeastern Nigeria coast, which was used for trade including Oil Palm exports and transport of other Nigerian and European goods to and from the Eastern coast. The then Orie Bridge and Eke Beach Umuezukwe markets on the banks of the river aided trading between the community, its environs and other neighboring communities as far as Abonema. Biafran Crisis On 9 December 1968, Awo-omamma Community Hospital (ACH) then under the control of International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) was attacked from the air. In \\"Biafra: A People Betrayed\\", experience at the community hospital was mentioned. As of 11 August 1969, Unitarian Universalist Service Committee (UUSC) sent over $50,000 for emergency relief and program expenses to Awo- Omamma for Biafrans. As highlighted in African Studies review at Cambridge, Biafran refugees and patients were also abandoned at Santana Primary School, Awo-omamma. Demographics Traditionally, villages and autonomous communities in Awo-omamma include: Ubogwu (Ofekata I); Ubachima (Ofekata II); Okworji, Umubochi,(Ofekata III); Umuezeali, Umueme,(Ofekata IV); Umuokwe, Obibi, Ohuba,(Eziawo I); and Isieke, Umuezukwe, Ubahaeze and Umuezike,(Eziawo II).

The film was an official selection of the 2015 Sundance Film Festival lineup and also screened at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival.  Plot  Dora (Chloe Rose) is an average teenager who just wants to have fun and get high with her boyfriend, Jace (Luke Bilyk), the day of Halloween. She is stunned when her doctor, Henry (Rossif Sutherland), tells her that she is four weeks pregnant, something she says should not be possible. Distraught, Dora goes home to wait for Jace to pick her up for a Halloween party while her mother (Rachel Wilson) takes her younger brother, Remi (Peter DaCunha), trick or treating. But before her boyfriend can pick her up, Dora is visited by several children in strange costumes. Their presence is increasingly threatening, culminating with one carrying the severed head of Jace in a bag. Dora must fight the monstrous children, who want her unborn child, a feat made more difficult by the fact that her pregnancy is progressing at a very fast and unnatural pace.

It operated from July 1941 to April 1943. At its peak, the ghetto housed some 1,500 prisoners. It was located in what today is a city park; the location is marked by a wooden menorah carved by Juozapas Jak≈°tas (first in early 1990s, second in 2011). Establishment and operations Before the war, ≈†venƒçionys had about 9,000 residents of whom a third were Jewish. The ghetto was established soon after the Nazi Germany attacked Soviet Russia on June 22, 1941. At the end of September 1941, about 1,000 or 2,000 of ≈†venƒçionys Jews were moved to barracks of former military training grounds near ≈†venƒçionƒóliai. Jews from other nearby settlements were gathered there as well. These Jews were massacred on October 9‚Äì10 by Nazis and Lithuanians from the Ypatingasis b≈´rys. The J√§ger Report reported a total of 3,726 deaths (1,169 men, 1,840 women, 717 children). The ghetto in ≈†venƒçionys continued to function. It was surrounded by a barbed wire fence and guarded by armed guards. The territory was divided to four quarters, each having its own Jewish commandant. Additionally, the ghetto had a five- member Judenrat (council). According to a census of August 1942, the ghetto had 566 Jews, including 353 working men and women. Younger inmates began procuring weapons and establishing contacts with the Soviet partisans active in the region (now eastern Lithuania and western Belarus). A number of Jews escaped and joined Jewish partisans. Nazi officials were forced to strengthen security measures. The first step was liquidating small ghettos in various towns. About 1,000 Jews from the ghetto in Vidzy (modern Belarus) were moved to ≈†venƒçionys. Due to crammed and unsanitary conditions, a typhus epidemic broke out among the inmates. The epidemic was contained with the help from a group of Jewish doctors sent from the Vilnius Ghetto. Liquidation At the end of 1942, three other small ghettos operated in the area: (Astravyets District), (Smarhon' District), and Ashmyany. Due to increased partisan activities, it was decided to liquidate the four ghettos in spring 1943. To minimize resistance, Jewish policemen from Vinius Ghetto were brought in to facilitate the operation. About 2,700 able-bodied Jews were transferred to Vilnius Ghetto or work camps in ≈Ωie≈æmariai, ≈Ωasliai, or Kena. On April 4, the remaining Jews boarded onto a freight train in ≈†venƒçionƒóliai. They were told that they would be transported to Kaunas Ghetto. Instead, the train stopped at Paneriai. Five train cars were redirected to a work camp in Bezdonys, two other cars with members of the Judenrat were taken to Vilnius Ghetto. Few others managed to escape, but the vast majority were shot by German and Lithuanian policemen. According to Nazi sources, about 4,000 Jews were killed on April 5 at Paneriai.

Brunson (June 28, 1929 ‚Äì April 1, 1997) was an American gospel musician and former pastor and music director of Christ Tabernacle Baptist Church in Chicago, Illinois. Rev. Milton Brunson released his first musical project in 1988, Available to You with Word Records alongside Epic Records. The last album, When You Get High on Jesus, Oh My God, released in 1997 by Hob Records, was a posthumous release. The last album to chart was 50 Blessed Years, that charted on the Billboard charts. All-in-all, he has had ten albums that have charted on the Billboard Gospel Albums chart over the course of his career and some even after his death. He received a nomination for the Best Gospel Album, Group or Choir at the 1988 Soul Train Music Awards and for Best Gospel Album at the 1993 Soul Train Music Awards. He won a Grammy Award for Best Gospel Choir or Chorus Album at the 37th Annual Grammy Awards, while he was nominated two other times. Early life Brunson was born on June 28, 1929, in Chicago, Illinois. His father was a stockyard worker, while his mother was a music and religion teacher. After he graduated from McKinley High School, he pursued a career in music by getting trained by Thomas A. Dorsey, Mahalia Jackson, and Robert Johnson, to hone his craft in the arts.

The cell may be operating as either a galvanic cell generating an electric current or inversely as an electrolytic cell using an electric current to drive a chemical reaction. In the simplest nontrivial case faradaic impedance is modeled as a single resistor and single capacitor connected in parallel, as opposed say to in series or as a transmission line with multiple resistors and capacitors. Mechanism The resistance arises from the prevailing limitations on availability (local concentration) and mobility of the ions whose motion between the electrolyte and the electrode constitutes the faradaic current. The capacitance is that of the capacitor formed by the electrolyte and the electrode, separated by the Debye screening length and giving rise to the double-layer capacitance at the electrolyte-electrode interface. When the supply of ions does not meet the demand created by the potential the resistance increases, the effect being that of a constant current source or sink, and the cell is then said to be polarized at that electrode. The extent of polarization, and hence the faradaic impedance, can be controlled by varying the concentration of electrolyte ions and the temperature, by stirring the electrolyte, etc. The chemistry of the electrolyte-electrode interface is also a crucial factor. Electrodes constructed as smooth planar sheets of metal have the least surface area. The area can be increased by using a woven mesh or porous or sintered metals. In this case faradaic impedance may be more appropriately modeled as a transmission line consisting of resistors in series coupled by capacitors in parallel. Dielectric spectroscopy Over the past two decades faradaic impedance has emerged as the basis for an important technique in a form of spectral analysis applicable to a wide variety of materials. This technique depends on the capacitive component of faradaic impedance. Whereas the resistive component is independent of frequency and can be measured with DC, the impedance of the capacitive component is infinite at DC (zero admittance) and decreases inversely with frequency of an applied AC signal. Varying this frequency while monitoring the faradaic impedance provides a method of spectral analysis of the composition of the materials at the electrode- electrolyte interface, in particular their electric dipole moment in the role of dielectric of a capacitor. The technique yields insights into battery design, the performance of novel fuel cell designs, biomolecular interactions, etc. See also * Dielectric spectroscopy * Electrochemical cell * Faradaic current  References  Category:Electrochemistry ","title":"Faradaic impedance"},{"id":"46192639","text":"Map of the Sorbian-Lusatian tribes between the 7th and 11th century, by Wilhelm Bogus≈Çawski, 1861. Sorbs and their sub-tribes, Luzici, Milceni and Daleminci, seen in the southwest corner of early West Slavic tribal area, by W. Fix, 1869. The Sorbs, also known as White Serbs in Serbian historiography, were an Early Slavic tribe located in present-day Saxony and Thuringia, part of the Wends. In the 7th century, the tribe was part of Samo's Empire. The tribe is last mentioned in the late 10th century, but its descendants are an ethnic group of Sorbs and Serbs. Etymology They are mentioned between the 6th and 10th century as Cervetiis (Servetiis), gentis (S)urbiorum, Suurbi, Sorabi, Soraborum, Sorabos, Surpe, Sorabici, Sorabiet, Sarbin, Swrbjn, Servians, Zribia, and Suurbelant. It is generally considered that their ethnonym *S≈ïb—ä (plur. *S≈ïby) originates from Proto-Slavic language with a appellative meaning of a \\"family kinship\\" and \\"alliance\\", while other argue a derivation from Iranian-Sarmatian language. History 7th century Dervan's Sorbian province. Their origin is unclear. According to the opinion of some historians and archaeologists, the tribe arrived from the Middle Danube valley in the beginning of the 7th century and settled between Saale and Elbe river, but only since the 10th century their ethnonym was transferred to the Luzici, Milceni and other tribes of Sukow-Dziedzice culture of Tornovo group who were present from the 6th century. West of former were also present some Slavs with Prague-Korchak culture. However, some scholars like Heinz Schuster-≈†ewc consider it to be completely unfounded. It is considered that their earliest mention is at least from the 6th century or earlier by Vibius Sequester, who recorded Cervetiis (Servetiis) living on the other part of the river Elbe which divided them from the Suevi (Albis Germaniae Suevos a Cerveciis dividiit). According to Lubor Niederle, the Serbian district was located somewhere between Magdeburg and Lusatia, and was later mentioned by the Ottonians as Ciervisti, Zerbisti, and Kirvisti. Their area of settlement possibly also included part of Chebsko, the northwestern edge of the Czech Republic. The information is in accordance with the Frankish 7th-century Chronicle of Fredegar according to which the Surbi lived in the Saale-Elbe valley, having settled in the Thuringian part of Francia at least since the second-half of the 6th century and were vassals of Merovingian dynasty. The Saale-Elbe line marked the approximate limit of Slavic westward migration. Fredegar recounts that under the leadership of dux (duke) Dervan (Dervanus dux gente Surbiorum que ex genere Sclavinorum), they joined the Slavic tribal union of Samo, after Samo's decisive victory against Frankish King Dagobert I in 631. Afterwards, these Slavic tribes continuously raided Thuringia. The fate of the tribes after Samo's death and dissolution of the union in 658 is undetermined, but it is considered that subsequently returned to Frankish vassalage. According to 10th-century source De Administrando Imperio, writing on the Serbs and their lands previously dwelt in, they lived \\"since the beginning\\" in the region called by them as Boiki (Bohemia) which was a neighbor to Francia, and when two brothers succeeded their father, one of them migrated with half of the people to the Balkans during the rule of Heraclius in the first half of the 7th century. According to some scholars, the White Serbian Unknown Archon who led them to the Balkans was most likely a son, brother or other relative of Dervan. 8th century In 782, the Sorbs, inhabiting the region between the Elbe and Saale, plundered Thuringia and Saxony. Charlemagne sent Adalgis, Worad and Geilo into Saxony, aimed at attacking the Sorbs, however, they met with rebel Saxons who destroyed them. In 789, Charlemagne launched a campaign against the Wiltzi; after reaching the Elbe, he went further and successfully \\"subjected the Slavs\\". His army also included the Slavic Sorbs and Obotrites, under Witzan. The army reached Dragovit, who surrendered, followed by other Slavic magnates and chieftains who submitted to Charlemagne. 9th century Map of the Sorbian March, by W≈Çodzimierz Dzwonkowski, 1918. The Sorbs ended their partial vassalage to the Franks (the Carolingian Empire) and revolted, invading Austrasia; Charles the Younger launched a campaign against the Slavs in Bohemia in 805, killing their dux, Lecho, and then proceeded crossing the Saale with his army and killed rex (king) Melito (or \\"Miliduoch\\") of the Sorabi or Siurbis, near modern-day Wei√üenfels, in 806.Henryk ≈Åowmia≈Ñski, O identyfikacji nazw Geografa bawarskiego, Studia ≈πr√≥d≈Çoznawcze, t.

In May 826, at a meeting at Ingelheim, Cedrag of the Obotrites and Tunglo of the Sorbs were accused of malpractices; they were ordered to appear in October, after Tunglo surrendered his son as hostage and was allowed to return home. The Franks had, sometime before the 830s, established the Sorbian March, comprising eastern Thuringia, in easternmost East Francia. In 839, the Saxons fought \\"the Sorabos, called Colodici\\" at Kesigesburch and won the battle, managing to kill their king Cimusclo (or \\"Czimislav\\"), with Kesigesburch and eleven forts being captured. The Sorbs were forced to pay tribute and forfeited territory to the Franks. The Sorbian tribe of Colodici was furthermore mentioned in 973 (Coledizi pagus, Cholidici), in 975 (Colidiki), and 1015 (Colidici locus). Besides Colodici other tribes which scholars consider part of the narrow Sorbian alliance were Daleminzi-Glomacze, Chudzicy, Nieletycy, Nudzice, Sus≈Çowie, ≈ªytyce among others. The mid-9th century Bavarian Geographer mentioned the Surbi having 50 civitates (Iuxta illos est regio, que vocatur Surbi, in qua regione plures sunt, que habent civitates L). Alfred the Great in his Geography of Europe (888‚Äì893) relying on Orosius, recorded the Servians; \\"To the north-east of the Moravians are the Dalamensae; east of the Dalamensians are the Horithi, and north of the Dalamensians are the Servians; to the west also are the Silesians. To the north of the Horiti is Mazovia, and north of Mazovia are the Sarmatians, as far as the Riphean Mountains\\". It is considered that in the second-half of the 9th century, Svatopluk I of Moravia (r. 871‚Äì894) may have incorporated the Sorbs into Great Moravia. 10th century The Arab historians and geographers Al-Masudi and Al-Bakri (10th and 11th century) writing on the Saqaliba mentioned the Sarbin or Sernin living between the Germans and the Moravians, a \\"Slavic people much feared for reasons that it would take too long to explain and whose deeds would need much too detailed an account. They have no particular religious affiliation\\". They, like other Slavs, \\"have the custom of burning themselves alive when a king or chieftain dies. They also immolate his horses\\". In the Hebrew book Josippon (10th century) are listed four Slavic ethnic names from Venice to Saxony; Mwr.wh (Moravians), Krw.tj (Croats), Swrbjn (Sorbs), Lwcnj (Luƒçan√© or Lusatians). Between 932 and 963 the Sorbs lost their independence. Henry the Fowler had subjected the Stodorane in 928, and in the following year imposed overlordship on the Obotrites and Veletians, and strengthened the grip on the Sorbs. Bishop Boso of St. Emmeram (d. 970), a Slav-speaker, had considerable success in Christianizing the Sorbs. In the 10th century the region came under the influence of the Duchy of Saxony, starting with the 928 eastern campaigns of King Henry the Fowler, who conquered the Sorbs and Milceni (Upper Lusatia) by 932. Gero II, Margrave of the Saxon Eastern March, reconquered Lusatia the following year and, in 939, murdered 30 Sorbian princes during a feast. As a result, many Sorbian uprisings followed. The March of Lusatia was established in 965, remaining part of the Holy Roman Empire, while the adjacent Northern March was again lost in the Slavic uprising of 983. The later Upper Lusatian region of the Milceni lands up to the Silesian border at the Kwisa river at first was part of the Margraviate of Meissen under Margrave Eckard I. A reconstructed castle, at Raddusch in Lower Lusatia, is the sole physical remnant from this early period. These are the last mentions of the tribe. Aftermath Since then the Sorbian tribes disappeared from the political scene. From the 11th to the 15th century, agriculture east of Elbe River developed and colonization by Frankish, Flemish and Saxon settlers intensified. The Slavs were allowed to live mainly in the periphery of the cities, and the military-administrative as well as religious authority was in the hands of the Germans. Despite the long process of Germanization, part of the Slavs living in Lusatia preserved their identity and language until now, and in the early 20th century there lived some 150 thousand Lusatian Sorbs.

Description Melaleuca citrolens is a tree growing up to tall with grey or white papery bark. Its leaves are arranged alternately, long, wide and linear to narrow oval in shape. The flowers are white to cream coloured, in heads up to in diameter with the heads containing one to 15 individual flowers. The petals are long and fall of as the flower opens. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower, each bundle containing 7 to 11 stamens. Flowers appear from December to February and from April to June. The fruit which follow are woody capsules long. Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca citrolens was first formally described in 1986 by Bryan Barlow in Brunonia as a new species.

They usually have specific thematic concepts, some of them providing board games for customers, and some others lending books to customers. The wide variety of upstairs caf√©s has attracted many teenagers to pay a visit. According to Erikson's stages of psychosocial development, youngsters in this stage are in search of identity and looking to stand out from others. One way would be visiting these uncommon places.

Clery, who was a freshman at the time of her death, was raped and killed in her campus dormitory. Clery's parents, who believed the University had failed to share vital information with its students regarding campus safety, campaigned for legislative reform for several years following their daughter's death. Their efforts resulted in the passage in 1990 of the Clery Act, a federal law requiring all universities and colleges receiving federal student financial aid programs to report crime statistics, alert campus of imminent dangers, and distribute an Annual Campus Security Report to current and prospective students and employees, or face fines. Incident and aftermath On April 5, 1986, in the spring of her freshman year, Jeanne Clery was raped and murdered in Stoughton Hall at Lehigh University by Josoph M. Henry, who was also a student. Clery was awakened by Henry while he was in the process of burglarizing her room. He then beat, cut, raped, sodomized, and strangled her. Prior to Clery's death, there were reports that her dorm had 181 situations of auto-locking doors being propped open by residents. Henry is believed to have gained access to Clery's room through the propped doors, as well as her own room door having been left unlocked for her roommate, who forgot her key. He was reported to the police after confessing the murder to his friends and was subsequently apprehended. He was later sentenced to death via the electric chair, a decision upheld by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania upon appeal. In 2002, after his death sentence was thrown out, Henry opted to give up his appeal rights and accepted life in prison rather than face another death penalty hearing with the possibility of a reinstated death sentence. Campaign by the Clerys As Connie and Howard Clery learned more about their daughter's death, they grew convinced that she had died because of \\"slipshod\\" security on campus. Beyond this, they believed the university had \\"a rapidly escalating crime rate, which they didn't tell anybody about\\". At the time, Lehigh University's vice president, John Smeaton, said that security measures were \\"more than adequate, reasonable and appropriate for our setting and our situation. You can't prevent everything from happening.\\" Nonetheless, the Clery family believed that campus crime statistics had been significantly underreported, and her parents founded the nonprofit organization Security On Campus, Inc., later renamed the Clery Center for Security On Campus. Clery Act Enactment The Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act or 'Clery Act' is a federal statute codified at , implementing regulations in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations at . The Clery Act, signed in 1990, was originally known as the Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act. Requirements The Clery Act requires all colleges and universities that participate in federal financial aid programs to keep and disclose information about crime on and near their respective campuses. Compliance is monitored by the United States Department of Education, which can impose civil penalties, up to $56,906 per violation, against institutions for each infraction and can suspend institutions from participating in federal student financial aid programs. Each year, institutions must publish and distribute their Annual Campus Security Report to current and prospective students and employees. This report is required to provide crime statistics for the prior three years, policy statements regarding various safety and security measures, campus crime prevention program descriptions, and procedures to be followed in the investigation and prosecution of alleged sex offenses. Beyond this, universities are required to provide a crime log, timely warnings to students, and crime statistics. The institution's police department or security departments are required to maintain a public log of all crimes reported to them, or those of which they are made aware. The Clery Act requires institutions to give timely warnings of crimes that represent a threat to the safety of students or employees. Institutions are required to report on crimes such as: murder, rape, dating violence, robbery, and hate crimes, as well as any disciplinary actions by the institution. Violations Since its founding, major incidents for which universities were found in violation of the Clery Act include Eastern Michigan University and the Murder of Laura Dickinson, the Penn State sex abuse scandal, and the Virginia Tech shooting.

It is a private, maintained by student fees, entering this through vestibular and the AERP (Ribeir√£o Preto Teaching Association). Its two campuses are divided into two cities one in Ribeir√£o Preto and one in Guaruja.  History  The University of Ribeir√£o Preto was the first institution of higher education in the region of Ribeir√£o Preto. Founded in 1 June 1924 as \\"Society School Pharm√°cia and Ribeir√£o Preto Dental School\\" by a group of idealistic health professionals, intellectuals and educators. The establishment of the university was intended to promote the social, educational and cultural development of the area. In the 1920s, Ribeir√£o Preto presented itself as one of the most prosperous areas in the state of S√£o Paulo. The wealth generated by the production of coffee led to the region attracting migrants from various parts of the country and immigrants from abroad, with high numbers of Italian people moving to the area. It was against this background in 1928 that the Ribeir√£o Preto Education Association (AERP) was founded. Today the AERP maintains the UNAERP and has consolidated it in to an institution with strong academic tradition and one of the most prestigious universities in South America. In 1959, Professor Electro Bonini (1913‚Äì2011) took over the administration of the AERP. During this period the university underwent a large expansion and implemented new courses. In 1961, the Faculty of Law, Laudo de Camargo, was established as well as courses in Social Services, Industrial Chemistry and Business Administration. In the 70s, the AERP also offered the Social Communication courses, Physical Education, Chemical Engineering, Fine Arts, Arts Education, Music alongside other degree choices. As the courses offered by the university grew, the university campus itself needed to expand in order to accommodate the wide range of subjects taught. A new campus was opened in 1971 in the Ribeir√¢nia neighborhood of the city. The new campus encompassed an area of 120 thousand square meters. Alongside the expansion of the campus, the university added more courses for study. In 1985, the university was officially named as the University of Ribeir√£o Preto. At the same time Professor Elmara Lucia de Oliveira Bonini took over as dean of the university. Following the appointment of Bonini as dean, the University invested in research in the areas of speech therapy, computer engineering, tourism, nursing, and human, social, health, environmental and biotechnology. These investments continued to grow into the following decade and UNAERP again expanded its range of courses, while fostering the research projects and services for the population. In 1999 the campus in Guaruja was established in the coastal city of S√£o Paulo. The campus was opened in June of that year and adhered to the same philosophy of integrating to the social and regional economic demands.  Present day  Today, the UNAERP is one of the largest educational centers in the state of S√£o Paulo and boasts undergraduate and postgraduate courses in technology, health, and sciences. The university continues to maintain its relationship with the surrounding community and conducts regular visits to the community throughout the year. UNAERP also conducts 30 extension programs in clinics, laboratories, and in hospitals. In 2019 UNAERP was ranked in the top 200 universities in Latin America.

Development  In 1984, British Aerospace (now BAE Systems) decided to pursue development of a combat- orientated variant of the Hawk aircraft, designated as Hawk 200; up to this point the Hawk family had been typically employed by operators as an advanced trainer with secondary combat capabilities. A single flying demonstrator aircraft was produced to support the development process. This made its first flight on 19 May 1986. Less than two months after first taking flight, the Hawk 200 demonstrator was lost in a fatal accident, killing BAe test pilot Jim Hawkins; Hawkins is alleged to have either become disoriented or to have fallen unconscious, due to g-LOC (g induced loss of consciousness), while executing high-g manoeuvres to explore the aircraft's agility. Despite the loss of the demonstrator, the company decided to proceed with the Hawk 200; by 1987, the first pre-production samples were being manufactured. In 1990, the Hawk 200 received its first order when Oman opted to procure a batch of twelve Hawk 203s, all of which were delivered by 1993.  Design   Overview  The Hawk 200 is a single-seat, single engine light multirole fighter with a small visual signature and high maneuverability. It has a low-mounted cantilever wing and is powered by a single turbofan engine. The Hawk 200 differs from the earlier Hawks in the sense that it has a new forward fuselage whereby the forward cockpit area which normally houses a pilot is replaced by an electronics bay for avionics and onboard systems, including a fire control computer, multi-mode radar, laser rangefinder and forward-looking infrared (FLIR). The Hawk 200 also has an upgraded wing, which in addition to four wing pylons seen in previous Hawks, also has wingtip missile support as well as greater wing area, increased wing droop, larger flaps and an optional mid-air refueling capability.  Weapons  AIM-9L Sidewinder air-to-air missile The Hawk 200 has 7 external store points with four underwing pylons, an under- fuselage pylon, and wingtip air-to-air missile stations. The range of external stores which the aircraft can carry includes air-to-air missiles (AAM), anti ship missiles (AShM), torpedoes, a gunpod, rocket launchers, reconnaissance pod, retarded and free-fall bombs up to , runway cratering, anti-personnel and light armour bombs, cluster bombs (meanwhile prohibited), practice bomb and rocket carriers and external fuel tanks. The Hawk 200 can launch many NATO standard guided missiles including AIM-9L Sidewinder AAM, ASRAAM AAM, AIM-120 AMRAAM AAM, AGM-65 Maverick AGM, Sea Eagle AShM and Sting Ray homing torpedoes. The Hawk 200 can also carry a variety of bombs, including 113 kg bombs, 240 kg bombs, 540 kg bombs and Paveway II guided bombs. The AIM-9L Sidewinder missiles are launched from the wingtip air-to-air missile stations on each wing.  Sensors  AN/APG-66 radar The Hawk 200 is equipped with a Northrop Grumman AN/APG-66H multi-mode radar, LINS 300 ring laser gyroscope inertial navigation system, air data sensor, display processor and mission computer. The systems are connected with a dual MIL-STD-1553B digital bus. The Hawk 200 is also equipped with a Ferranti laser rangefinder and a Marconi forward-looking infrared. The self-protection systems include a BAE SkyGuardian 200 RWR and automatic or manual Vinten chaff/flare dispensers located above the engine exhaust. The AN/APG-66 radar is a solid state medium range (up to ) pulse-doppler planar array radar designed by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation (now Northrop Grumman) for the F-16 Fighting Falcon. It has ten air-to-surface and ten air-to-ground modes for navigation and weapon aiming purposes. The APG-66H variant of the radar is installed on the Hawk 200, which has a smaller antenna for slightly reduced capabilities.  Cockpit  The pilot has a hands-on throttle and stick (HOTAS) control system and a wide-field-of-view head-up display (HUD). Using the weapon control panel, which controls the stores management system, the pilot can select the weapons and release mode prior to initiating an attack. Like all other modernized Hawks, the Hawk 200's all-glass cockpit has a multi-functional colour display, with a dedicated processor and 15-colour graphics symbology generator. There are 27 display formats which provide flight and aircraft data. The cockpit is also compatible with night-vision goggles. Just outside of the cockpit is an inflight refueling probe.  Engine  Adour engine on display The Hawk 200 was originally powered by an Adour 871 two shaft, low bypass ratio turbofan engine from Rolls-Royce Turbomeca, providing the aircraft with 26.00 kN of thrust. In 2005, the Adour 951 engine was certified for use on the Hawk 200. The improved Adour 951 has improved performance (rated at thrust) and has up to twice the service life of the Adour Mk 871. It features an all-new fan and combustor, revised HP and LP turbines, and introduces Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC). Both engines are non-afterburning versions of the Adour series, and are fed to by air intakes on both sides of the fuselage. The internal fuel tanks are installed in the fuselage and compartmented integral tanks located in the wings, containing up to 1361 kg of fuel. Up to 2 x 591 liter drop tanks can also be carried on the in-board under-wing pylons.  Operational history   Malaysia  On 5 March 2013, amidst the 2013 Lahad Datu standoff, 5 Hawk 208s aircraft, along with 3 F-18D Hornets of the Royal Malaysian Air Force, were deployed in airstrikes on hideouts of the defunct sultanate and terrorist group Royal Security Forces of the Sultanate of Sulu in Lahad Datu, Sabah Malaysia ahead of the ground assault by joint forces of the Malaysian Army and Royal Malaysia Police. The Hawk 208s flew 15 sorties, each Hawk 200 dropping Mk 82 unguided bombs in the first sortie and firing CRV7 rockets at additional ground targets on the second and third. A spokesman for Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said in a phone interview that the objective of the airstrikes was to \\"soften the ground before troops move in.‚Äù  Variants  ;Hawk 203: Export version for the Royal Air Force of Oman ;Hawk 205: Proposed export version for the Royal Saudi Air Force ;Hawk 208: Export version for the Royal Malaysian Air Force; only version equipped with a mid-air refueling probe. ;Hawk 209: Export version for the Indonesian Air Force  Operators  *Operator figures from flightglobal and ; *Indonesian Air Force - 23 in active service.

After graduating from college, he went on to work at IBM, which led to him getting employment at Technitrol, Inc. After an unsuccessful service called Product & Area Locator (PAL), he filed for bankruptcy on March 17, 1983, and went on to create TeleMagic under his company Remote Control International, which was met with positive reception both in terms of sales figures as well as customer reception. This success led the company and the software it created to eventually be purchased by The Sage Group. During his college years, he worked on entrepreneurial endeavors, including a birthday cake delivery service, a restaurant, and advertising. He currently works as a mentor to other businesspeople.  Personal life  Michael McCafferty was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on September 7, 1942 to Verna M. McCafferty and Charles F. McCafferty. He is the second oldest of six siblings. He has two children and currently resides in Del Mar, California.  Career and education  In his early life, McCafferty worked on repairing bicycles with his brother, and in high school, he worked at a gas station. He was accepted into Mount St. Mary's College in September 1960. He went into multiple career paths during college, including selling advertising space to local retailers on desk bottlers, birthday cake sales and delivery, and a restaurant called \\"The Purple Onion.\\" McCafferty was employed by IBM as a salesperson shortly after he graduated from college. He became a top producer at IBM, and he sold computers in multiple states, including Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia, and Maryland. He used his career at IBM to learn more about computers and running a business. Later in his career, he left his job at IBM and began working on his own business ventures.  Eastern Data Processing  An IBM 1130 console. McCafferty got a job as a solo programmer at Technitrol, Inc. in Philadelphia programming on an IBM 1130 computer. The company's president hired him due to his own lack of experience with programming, McCafferty's background with IBM and his understanding of the programming language FORTRAN. After a year employed as programmer and manager of the Data Processing department, he and the President of Technitrol decided to form a company in 1968 called Eastern Data Processing (EDP) as a subsidiary of Technitrol when McCafferty was only 26. The goal of this company was to provide computerized payroll services to businesses. It was intended to compete with a similar business called \\"Automatic Data Processing\\". McCafferty was the company's President, and he had a 20% share in the company. In the first six months of the company's operation, the company saw $400,000 in losses, which was due in part to the fact that much of its business was not related to its intended business structure. As such, the company did not have a product to sell. Nevertheless, the Technitrol President allowed him to continue working with the company, though with a new vision for it. McCafferty then spent the next six years building a profitable business. In spite of these problems that the business faced early on, the combined success of it and other subsidiaries of Technitrol contributed to the parent company's success. The company experienced a 125% increase in sales between 1972 and 1973, an increase from $4.7 million to $10.6 million. Profits increased from $107,000 to $466,000. When his employer, E. Stuart Eichert, died, McCafferty learned that his promised shares in the company were not set in writing, and thus he lost his ownership in the company. He quit immediately. The first prototype for EDP ran on an IBM 360 Model 30 with IBM 2311 disk storage drives and two Tape Drives, and was programmed in COBOL. During seven years, it grew to support three- shift work-days and was used for thousands of companies‚Äô payrolls.  After EDP  When he left EDP, he went to work in Chicago, Illinois to work for Robert F. White & Company as the company's Vice President of Operations. In his new position, he was tasked with converting physical punch cards to tape/disk payroll files. After working there for 2 years, he moved to San Diego strictly for the weather.  TeleMagic  Michael filed for Chapter 7 personal bankruptcy on March 17, 1983. Following his filing, Michael went on to work on and invent the earliest known contact management software product for the PC called TeleMagic, which was made for use by salespeople and entrepreneurs so that they can keep track of customers. The product was marketed by his company, Remote Control International. The software was originally intended to be sold to telemarketers, but eventually became popular for more sales markets. The program could be used in conjunction with other pieces of computer software, including word processors and accounting. The program was originally made for DOS in 1985, and later in 1987, versions of the program were released on Unix and Apple Macintosh systems. While it was originally intended for use in the United States, it was expanded to other regions in 1988, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, and others. Remote Control International was generally successful, and ranked 79th and 348th on Inc. 500's list of the Fastest Growing Companies in 1991 and 1992, respectively. The company was later purchased by The Sage Group in 1992, which allowed Michael to live comfortably. After its purchase, TeleMagic was made available for Microsoft Windows in 1993, and Remote Control International was renamed to TeleMagic Inc. in 1994. It did not have any more software releases on later platforms after this. This is believed to be due in part to Sage's financial issues following the purchase of the company, and the fact that TeleMagic under Sage was posting losses at about one million pounds per year. On February 14, 2007, the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California accepted TeleMagic-related software and related items in order to preserve them. The product received praise around its release as well as well beyond its lifespan. The Baltimore Suns Patrick Rossello called TeleMagic the \\"hot software for this effort and is reasonably priced at many software stores.\\" including from a writer for Forbes.com who stated that TeleMagic felt that \\"had seen more robust solutions 20 years ago in TeleMagic, than were readily available on the Salesforce.com platform.\\" Other websites such as CMO.com.au gave TeleMagic credit for \\"marketers to consolidate, manage and track customer information.\\" Not all reception was positive however; according to The Guardians Guy Clapperton, Jane Harrad-Roberts, the consultant director of the company Marketing Projects, chose to drop TeleMagic after The Sage Group purchased it, feeling that they had made it a worse product.

It tells the story of seven horsemen who are sent to find why their country, a place with traits of both medieval and modern Europe, is becoming devoid of human life. The characters in the novel have names from all parts of Europe. Throughout the narrative are references to the poet Guillaume Apollinaire under his real name Wilhelm Kostrowitsky. The full title of the book is Sept cavaliers quitt√®rent la ville au cr√©puscule par la porte de l'Ouest qui n'√©tait plus gard√©e, which means \\"seven horsemen left the city at dusk through the Western gate which was no longer guarded\\". A comic-book adaptation was released in 2008-2010. Plot Colonel-major Silve de Pikkendorff is tasked by his margrave to go on a quest to find why human life seems to be disappearing and the City is turning into chaos. Pikkendorff gathers six horsemen to go with him: the lieutenants Richard Tancr√®de and Maxime Bazin du Bourg, the brigadier Cl√©ment Vassili, the cadet Stanislas V√©nier, the bishop Osmond Van Beck and the margrave‚Äôs squire Aba√Ø. Their destination is S√©phar√©e where the margrave's daughter Myriam, who Pikkendorff is in love with, has been sent. Having left the City, they hear a bell ring which signals that the margrave is dead. They reach Saint-Aulick, where they meet a man named Gustavson, whose son displays a behaviour which had appeared among children in the City as a first stage of destructive events. The horsemen travel to the Mountain, where they meet the head of a militia who disapproves of them. Tancr√®de manages to seduce a local girl, Natalia. Thirty years previously, Vassili took part in a campaign together with Captain Wilhelm Kostrowitsky, during which they thought they saw a group of Chechen, a people thought to have been destroyed 250 years earlier. Kostrowitsky, who was also a famous poet greatly admired by Bazin du Bourg, had returned to the Mountain after the campaign and mysteriously disappeared. After finding a trace from Kostrowitsky, Vassili goes missing, and the others find him dead with his throat slit. They eventually discover several old peoples thought to have been extinct. Leaving the Mountain, the horsemen travel through the Forest. One by one, the horsemen begin to leave the company. Tancr√®de decides to return to Natalia, Van Beck has lost his faith and stays in a church in hope of finding God, V√©nier decides to stay and take care of his family's land when they reach it, and Aba√Ø goes to search for his own people, the Ouma√Ætes, in the Forest. The two remaining horsemen, Pikkendorff and Bazin du Bourg, arrive at the River at the frontier post of S√©phar√©e, which has an unexpectedly modern bridge. They cross the bridge which causes them to lose all their memories as the bridge transforms into a train station. They meet again in a train some time later without recognising each other. Bazin du Bourg is reading a book by Guillaume Apollinaire. Legacy A spiritual sequel, les Royaumes de Bor√©e (\\"the realms of Boreas\\"), was published in 2003. It also features an officer named Pikkendorff and the narrative spans from the 17th century to modern day. Sept cavaliers was the basis for a comic-book adaptation by Jacques Terpant, published in three volumes from 2008 to 2010. Terpant used ink and watercolour in a style inspired by M≈ìbius. He also went on to adapt les Royaumes de Bor√©e in three volumes.

From 12 to 16 June 2009, a man using the alias \\"Peter Bergmann\\" visited the seaport town of Sligo in northwest Ireland. He used this alias to check into the Sligo City Hotel, where he stayed during the majority of his visit, and was described by the hotel staff and tenants as having a heavy German accent. The man's movements were captured on CCTV throughout the town; however, the details of his actions and intentions remain unknown. His interactions with other people were limited, and little is known of his origins or the reason for his visit to Sligo. On the morning of 16 June, the body of the unidentified man was discovered at Rosses Point beach, a popular recreation destination and fishing area near Sligo. Despite conducting a five-month investigation into Bergmann's death, the Garda√≠ have never been able to identify the man or develop any leads in the case. The mystery is often compared to the Tamam Shud case of Australia, in which an unidentified man was found dead on a beach shortly after World War II, though the Bergmann case has not achieved nearly the same amount of notoriety or international coverage. This case remains obscure to the public, and the official investigation has not extended to outside of Ireland. The case received renewed attention in the 2010s. It was the subject of a 2013 documentary, The Last Days of Peter Bergmann, which was shown at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival and has developed a small following on social media websites such as Reddit, where readers have constructed theories of the case. Physical description The man known as \\"Peter Bergmann\\" had a slender build, short grey hair, and appeared to be in his late 50s or early 60s. He stood tall with blue eyes and a tan complexion. From witness reports, the man was of Germanic descent and spoke with a thick German accent. He was neatly groomed; his face was shaven and his hair was clean and combed. The man was well dressed wearing a black leather jacket, blue trousers (size 50), blue socks, a black leather belt and a pair of black shoes (size 44). His clothes were from C&A;, a popular fashion retail store in Europe with most of its stores in Germany and Austria. From the man's appearance it was assumed he was a professional worker. He was a frequent smoker and several surveillance videos show him smoking outside often. Timeline of events On Friday, 12 June, the unknown man was first spotted at the Ulster Bus Depot in Derry between the time of 14:30 and 16:00. He boarded a bus headed to Sligo Station, carrying a black shoulder bag and a standard carry-on luggage bag. He arrived at 18:28 at the Sligo Bus Station and took a taxi to the Sligo City Hotel where he paid per night in cash. While checking in, he gave the false name of Peter Bergmann and an address that was later reported as \\"Ainstettersn 15, 4472, Vienna, Austria.\\" During his stay at the hotel, the man was seen on security camera footage leaving the building with a purple plastic bag full of items or personal effects. However, when he returned from his long walk he was no longer carrying the bag. It is presumed that he had disposed of his belongings throughout Sligo and then folded the bag and put it in his pocket. Authorities were unable to identify what he threw away in the public rubbish bins, as the man used the blind spots of the surveillance cameras to his advantage. His movements were very meticulous and methodical as if he knew where to hide his personal belongings that could have identified him. On Saturday, 13 June, the man was seen walking to the General Post Office at 10:49 and purchased eight 82-cent stamps and airmail stickers. The following day, the man left the Sligo City Hotel between 11:00 and 11:30 and asked a taxi driver recommendations for a nice quiet beach where he could swim. The taxi driver stated that Rosses Point would be the best place and proceeded to drive the unknown man to the beach. The man returned with the same taxi and was dropped off at the bus station in Sligo. On Monday, 15 June, the man checked out of the hotel at 13:06 and handed in his room key. He left with a black shoulder bag, a purple plastic bag, and a different black luggage bag. He did not have the same black carry-on luggage bag he had when he first arrived in Sligo. He walked to the bus station via Quay Street, Wine Street and stopped at Quayside Shopping Centre and awkwardly waited in the doorway for a number of minutes. At 13:16 he left the Quayside Shopping Centre and walked along Wine Street in the direction of the bus station, still carrying all three bags. At 13:38 he ordered a cappuccino and a ham and cheese toasted sandwich at the bus station. While eating his food, he looked at pieces of paper that he kept in his pocket. After reading the pieces of paper, he tore the paper in half and threw it away in a nearby rubbish bin. He then mounted a bus that departed at 14:20 for Rosses Point. It was reported that he was seen by sixteen people while walking on the beach, casually greeting the passersby. The following morning, Tuesday 16 June, Arthur Kinsella and his son Brian, who was training for a triathlon, found the man's body lying on the beach at 6:45 in the morning. He was wearing purple striped Speedo-type swimming trunks, with his underpants over the top and a navy T-shirt tucked into them. Arthur and Brian said the Lord's Prayer for the man, and then called the Garda√≠. At 8:10, Dr Valerie McGowan officially pronounced the man dead. Following the discovery of the man's dead body, a five-month investigation was conducted by Garda√≠. Some sources report that during the police investigation following his death, it was discovered that the address he gave belonged to a vacant lot. However, others have pointed out that a street with the reported spelling of \\"Ainstettersn\\" does not exist in Austria or Germany. Additionally, Vienna post codes begin with the number 1, rather than a 4, and the post code 4472 is unassigned. It is unclear how police would have been able to establish that the fake address was tied to a vacant lot, or whether they simply determined that it did not exist. What is certain is that the man wanted to remain unknown and he pre-emptively planned his moves so that he could not be identified. After death According to the post mortem report, the body of the man was found on Rosses Point beach with most of his clothes left behind on the shore, with no wallet, money or form of identification. Even though the man had been washed up on the beach, Sligo medical examiner Clive Kilgallen found no evidence of \\"classical salt water drowning\\", but also no signs of foul play that would give reason to believe the man's death was a homicide. The man's teeth were in good condition and showed signs of frequent dental work in his life. He had bridging, root canals, crowns and had a full gold tooth on the upper back right side of his mouth and a small silver filling along the gum of a tooth on the left side of the lower jaw. Despite his well- groomed and dressed exterior, the man was in very poor health. The post mortem showed that he had advanced stages of prostate cancer and bone tumours. His heart showed signs of previous heart attacks and he possessed only one kidney, the other having been removed. Notably for a man who had serious health conditions, the toxicology report stated that he had no medication of any sort in his system. The medical examiner noted that, due to his heart attacks and health status, the man would have been in significant pain and would have required prescription pain medicine or at least over-the-counter pain relievers. After a five-month investigation the body was buried in Sligo. The funeral was attended by four Garda√≠. In 2015, the French newspaper Le Monde reported that they had contacted the Austrian police about the case, and that the Austrian police commented that the Garda√≠ had never contacted them. Le Monde also reported that there is no Interpol notice for the unidentified man, stating that as the body did not fall into the two Interpol categories of 'missing person' or a 'wanted person'. It is up to his country of origin to report him as missing.

On February 1, 2016, he suspended his campaign after a poor showing in the Iowa caucuses. O'Malley and Jim Webb would switch places for third place in the polling, behind Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders until Webb dropped out. O'Malley dropped out of the race after receiving only 0.54% in the Iowa caucuses. Background First elected Mayor of Baltimore in 1999, O'Malley was reelected as mayor in 2003. Considering a run for governor in 2002, he instead focused on his mayoralty. In 2006, nearing the end of his second term as mayor, O'Malley announced his candidacy for Governor of Maryland, an office he would win by a sizeable margin. He ran against incumbent Republican Bob Ehrlich. O'Malley was reelected by a wider margin in a rematch against former Governor Bob Ehrlich in 2010. Prior presidential elections During the 2008 Democratic Presidential primaries, O'Malley endorsed then-U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton over then-Senator Barack Obama. O'Malley served as the chair of Clinton's campaign in Maryland. 2016 election O'Malley had been seen as a potential presidential candidate since at least November 2012. In the next month, he said that Clinton, who launched her own 2016 campaign, would be a \\"great president\\", brushing off questions about his own potential candidacy and commenting that he would have to do \\"a lot of soul-searching and discernment and introspection.\\" Campaign The day prior to his announcement, May 29, O'Malley released a video of himself strumming the presidential fanfare \\"Hail to the Chief\\" on his guitar, alluding to his impending announcement. The following day, May 30, he launched his campaign at a scheduled rally in Baltimore, Maryland. On January 20, 2016, the Federal Election Commission announced that his campaign would receive $846,365.09 in federal matching funds, on top of an initial $100,000 the campaign received after qualifying for matching funds. In November 2015, O'Malley became the first 2016 presidential candidate to be declared eligible by the Commission to receive federal matching funds. On February 1, 2016, O'Malley announced the suspension of his campaign after a poor showing in the Iowa caucuses. On June 9, 2016, O'Malley endorsed Hillary Clinton. Positions Living wage O'Malley speaking with supporters at a campaign event in Manchester, New Hampshire During a speech at Harvard's Institute of Politics, O'Malley stated his support for a $15 minimum wage, claiming that it will \\"fuel economic growth, greater consumer demand.\\" He is also careful to refer to his support for a \\"living wage\\" rather than a \\"minimum wage.\\" During his final year serving as the Governor of Maryland, O'Malley signed a bill to gradually raise the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. This followed a 2007 \\"living wage\\" law requiring government contractors to pay their employees significantly more than the minimum wage; the exact level of wage increase varied from county to county depending on the cost of living. Financial regulation O'Malley has made financial regulation a significant plank of his platform, placing such great emphasis on it that he has been nicknamed \\"the Glass-Steagall candidate.\\" This name also stems from his strong support for the reinstatement of the provision of the Glass-Steagall Act separating commercial and investment banking. O'Malley favors breaking up the nation's biggest financial institutions in order to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis, in which a number of banks were declared \\"too big to fail.\\" Immigration reform O'Malley speaking at an immigration roundtable in Phoenix, Arizona Many in the Latino community consider O'Malley a strong ally on immigration reform. For instance, Congressman Luis Guti√©rrez called him a \\"champion\\" of immigration in 2014 when the two were working to oppose the White House's deportation policy. O'Malley's support for allowing minors escaping violence in their home countries to stay in the United States put him at odds with the White House, which favored sending them home. When he was Governor of Maryland, O'Malley signed a statewide DREAM Act allowing young illegal immigrants to pay in-state college tuition and to a bill to get driver's licenses.  Gun control  O'Malley is a gun control advocate. In May 2013 he signed the Firearm Safety Act which bans magazines that hold more than 10 bullets; bans 45 types of semiautomatic rifles; and requires people seeking to buy any gun other than a hunting rifle or shotgun to obtain a license, submit fingerprints to police, undergo a background check and pass classroom and firing-range training in Maryland. He is calling for a national assault weapons ban. O'Malley says that he is \\"pissed\\" about the gun control climate and that Congress is not doing anything about it.  Right-to-vote amendment  O'Malley in August 2015 marked the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act in South Carolina by calling for a constitutional amendment to \\"protect every citizen's right to vote, once and for all.\\" He added that \\"Passing a constitutional amendment that enshrines that right... will give U.S. courts the clarity they need to strike down Republican efforts to suppress the vote.\\" Fiscal policy O'Malley generally promotes fiscally progressive economic policies.

The film had its world premiere on 15 March 2015 at South by Southwest. Plot In 1979, following the death of their son Bobby in a car crash, Anne (Barbara Crampton) and Paul Sacchetti (Andrew Sensenig) have decided to move to a new home in rural New England. Paul hopes that it will be therapeutic for Anne, as the death has caused her to spiral into a deep depression. However, as soon as they arrive Anne starts claiming that Bobby is present in the house, and neighbor Cat McCabe (Connie Neer) warns them to leave the house. The house was built in the 1800s by the Dagmar family as a funeral home. The Dagmars were reportedly run out of the village after the townspeople discovered that they were swindling their customers by selling the corpses and burying empty caskets. Undeterred, Anne invites her friends May and Jacob Lewis (Lisa Marie and Larry Fessenden), as they are both spiritualists and could help contact Bobby, as well as explain the strange supernatural occurrences happening in the house. Upon their arrival the two couples go out to eat, during which time the Lewises' son Harry (Michael Patrick) arrives with his girlfriend Daniella (Kelsea Dakota). Soon after arriving Harry is killed by an apparition on the basement stairs while Daniella watches. She flees the house in horror and drives away, only to be killed a short distance away. The Lewises and the Sacchettis head home, after which Cat's husband Dave (Monte Markham) arrives at the restaurant, murders a waitress, and then angrily discusses the Dagmar house with the restaurant's bartender, revealing that the house needs to feed every 30 years or the evil beneath it will search out fresh souls, potentially destroying the town. Jacob eventually manages to convince a reluctant Paul to hold a seance with him while their wives are out. This ends with Jacob becoming possessed by the spirit of Lassander Dagmar (Guy Gane III), who reveals that they were never run out of town, rather the villagers used him and his family as a sacrifice to the evil under their home. Lassander, overcome with rage, then causes Jacob to kill himself. His wife May tries to flee, only to be killed by Dave, who has come to the house with the other townspeople, determined to give the darkness under the home what it wants. The Sacchettis then hear the voice of their son Bobby urging them to leave the house, and flee upstairs as Dave and the townspeople begin breaking into and entering the house. The spirits of the Dagmar family then proceed to violently murder every one of the townspeople in the house until only Dave, Paul, and Anne remain. Still intending to sacrifice them, Dave tries to kill Anne and Paul, but before he can do so, he is killed by Lassander's spirit. As Paul and Anne stare at the carnage around them, the spirits of the family depart from the house, finally satisfied with their revenge. Still believing her son is in the home, Anne dazedly walks into the house's cellar, followed moments later by her husband. As he peers down the stairs, Paul smiles slightly, then says \\"Hey Bobby\\".

His diplomatic skills were highly appreciated. 1675 he was elevated to Swedish baron. Life Matthias Palbitzki was probably born in Stolp, where his father Georg Matthias Palbitzki was mayor of a Pomeranian District. From 1630 he was taught by private tutors and attended the 1637 Academic Gymnasium Danzig. Because of the Thirty Years' War in Pomerania, which also impacted the estates of the family, his mother sent him 1640 the Sor√∏ Academy. Together with his brother in 1642, he went on tour to the Dutch Republic or France to enter into military service. Already in Hamburg he met the commander Gustaf Horn, who persuaded him to get in Swedish service, and took him to Stockholm. Matthias Palbitzki became Hofjunker of Christina, Queen of Sweden. In 1643 he was an ensign of the bodyguard and the same year was promoted to lieutenant commander. In 1645 he continued his grand tour through the west and southern Europe, to Egypt, Greece and Constantinople. On the way back he spent almost a year in Rome and then traveled through Switzerland and France to Sweden. Upon his return in October 1648 he was appointed chamberlain.

Beginning in 1649 sent him Queen Christina diplomatic mission in the Republic of Venice, where he was to negotiate for mediation in the conflict with Poland and the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. In 1650 he posted in Neurenberg, where he brought Charles X Gustav the news of his appointment to the Swedish throne. In 1651, he undertook further diplomatic missions to Madrid. In Spain he reached the resumption of trade relations. He then took an extended trip through the country and visited the city of Saguntum. On his way home he tried in vain to mediate in the Fronde. In 1654 he was sent to the court of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria in Brussels. He courted the abdicated Queen Christina, who had arrived in Antwerp. On his duties under Charles X Gustav little is known. By his own account, he followed the Swedish king in the Polish-Swedish War and accompanied him to Hamburg in 1657 and 1658 to Gothenburg. Under the regency for Charles XI he was resumed in the diplomatic service. From summer 1664 to spring 1665, he was a Swedish ambassador in Warsaw. The following year, he was President of the Government in Swedish Pomerania, at the same time President of the court in Greifswald, and after a few weeks in office, sent again to Poland. In 1666 he was sent to the German imperial court to inform the Swedish position in conflict with Bremen. Palbitzki had a comprehensive education, including knowledge of Latin and Greek literature. He emerged as a connoisseur and promoter of European, particularly classical and Italian art and promoted foreign artists such as the sculptor Nicolas Cordier.

They are found in urban areas and new towns alike, although certain districts such as Mong Kok, Sham Shui Po, and Kwun Tong are known for high concentrations of hawkers. For many decades, hawking has served as a means for the lower class to make a living in Hong Kong, and allowed patrons to benefit from the convenience and low cost of hawker goods. However, the government has long considered the practice to be detrimental to public hygiene, and it has therefore been controlled by the Urban Council and its successor, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department. Characteristics Hawkers may be divided into the categories of fixed-pitch and itinerant (travelling). Both categories may sell a variety of goods, including food or dry goods. Street food hawkers commonly sell foods such as fishballs and fake shark fin soup () relatively cheaply, from roadside vendor stalls. The Hong Kong government has attempted to reduce the number of illegal vendors by designating hawker-permitted areas, but a large percentage of street vendors still operate illegally. According to Leung Yin Ling, author of the book Ê∂àÂ§±‰∏≠ÁöÑÂ∞èË≤©ÊñáÂåñ (Disappearing Hawker Culture), hawkers exemplify the spirit of determination in the face of adversity that is an indelible part of Hong Kong culture.Leung Yin Ling.

The Cantonese phrase jau gwei (Chinese: Ëµ∞È¨º; Jyutping: zau2 gwai2; lit. running [away from] ghosts) refers to the sudden abandonment of these stalls when Hawker Control Teams (Chinese: Â∞èË≤©ÁÆ°ÁêÜÈöä, or Ë≤©ÁÆ°Èöä in short) are imminent and the vendors are operating illegally or selling prohibited items, such as counterfeit branded goods. Gwei, meaning ghosts, refers to the Hawker Control Officers, who were traditionally Westerners. The phrase is shouted by vendors to warn others of the approaching squads, and can also be heard in Macao and Guangdong Province, where similar situations exist with illegal street vendors. History 1940‚Äì1960s: Migrant influx from rural China Temple Street in 1950 Between the 1940s and 60s, there was an influx of migrants from rural areas of mainland China into Hong Kong due to political instabilities in China (influenced by the Chinese Civil War and the Cultural Revolution) as well as famine. Many of these migrants were unskilled and uneducated, and became itinerant hawkers to earn a living with low operating costs, selling daily necessities such as food and clothing to those of the working classes.Ma Kwok Ming.

In addition, it was stated that street hawking discouraged market development, since hawkers paid lower licence fees (HK$1,000-HK$3,000) than shop and stall tenants who also had to pay rents. 1960‚Äì1970s: Increasing numbers Hawkers in Tuen Mun in 2015 In the 1960s and 70s, at a time when there were few shopping malls and markets and little governmental regulation, the number of hawkers exceeded 300,000.A positive view to hawkers and put their features into good use.Ê≠£Èù¢ÁúãÂæÖÂ∞èË≤© ÁâπËâ≤ÂñÑÂä†Âà©Áî®(2009,Dec.15).

In the 1970s, Itinerant Hawker Licences were issued and the succession and transfer of licenses was banned. The system granted licenses to 39,033 hawkers and prohibited 6,000 from the practice.Sataline, S., Renton, A. Closing time: How Hong Kong‚Äôs hawkers face a struggle to survive. South China Morning Post. Retrieved 3 March 2015, from http://multimedia.scmp.com/hawkers/ Thereafter, the number of itinerant hawkers continued to decline. In 2002, a five-year voluntary surrender scheme was implemented to encourage itinerant hawkers to surrender their licenses in exchange for \\"a one-off ex gratia payment, rental of a vacant stall in public markets under concessionary terms, or becoming a (non- cooked food) fixed pitch hawker.‚Äùhttp://www.fhb.gov.hk,.

Retrieved 13 March 2015,from http://www.fhb.gov.hk/download/committees/board/doc/2009/paper20090115_92.pdf The scheme drastically decreased the number of licensed hawkers, from 50,000 in 1974 to about 6,000 in 2007. As of November 30, 2008, the total number of Fixed-Pitch Hawker Licenses (including dai pai dongs) and Itinerant Hawker Licenses were 6,594 and 552 respectively. In 2009, the Hong Kong Food and Health Bureau (FHB) in conjunction with the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) reviewed the hawker licensing policy, with a view to potentially issuing new licenses to fixed-pitch hawkers. 2010 ‚Äì present: Lunar New Year incidents and protest against Link REIT In recent years, the FEHD has taken action during Chinese New Year night markets, targeting unlicensed food hawkers on grounds of unsanitary practices, obstruction of roadways, noise pollution, and other nuisances. At the same time, members of the community have increasingly valued hawking as an element of Hong Kong's cultural heritage and collective memory, and as a valuable means of support for grassroots people. During the 2014 Lunar New Year, unannounced inspections were conducted at Kweilin Street Night Market, with FEHD officers making arrests and confiscating a food cart. These actions led to public disquiet, with accusations of officers' opposition to ordinary citizens. Hawkers returned and the night market resumed as normal shortly after the officers' departure. In November 2014, Sham Shui Po District Council, controlled by the pro-Beijing camp, passed a vote for zero-tolerance of unlicensed hawkers during the upcoming Lunar New Year, although other District Council members including Frederick Fung of the Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood (ADPL) obtained an exception for vendors selling dry goods. In reaction, grassroots organisations claimed that due to the government refusal to issue new hawker licences or construct new markets, vendors could only subsist in defiance of the law. It was further asserted that Kweilin Street Night Market was enjoying a resurgence in popularity and that a zero-tolerance hawker policy would only serve to exacerbate grievances. During the 2015 Lunar New Year, there were at least three groups in Sham Shui Po giving vocal support for street vendors, and Hong Kong locals embarked on a campaign of street cleaning of the night market in order to allay concerns over hygiene. On 2 February 2016, in the approach to the Lunar New Year, a conflict occurred when hawkers were prevented from setting up stall at Leung King Estate, so as not to disrupt activity at the nearby shopping mall operated by Link REIT. On February 7, Lunar New Year's Eve, multiple hawkers set up stall in Kweilin Street Night Market and were chased away or arrested, as was teacher and activist Siu Lai, who acted in defiance of the policy. During the 2016 Lunar New Year, a violent bout of civil unrest dubbed the 'fishball revolution' () broke out in Mong Kok in response to the hardline approach taken by the FEHD to crack down on hawking in Hong Kong. On 22 May 2016 unrest broke out at Yat Tung Estate in Tung Chung, where residents had held a bazaar in defiance of ongoing rent increases by Link REIT, which owns the shopping centre and market in Yat Tung and many other estates. Staff from the Housing Authority called the police and stated that the bazaar was causing \\"obstruction\\", a claim that was dismissed by some residents.

He was a close associate of President Camille Chamoun. As the Tashnag Party prioritized good relations with the government they threw their support behind Tosbath.

The first restaurant was a caf√© that opened in 1998 at the Cahaba Mall Shopping Center (also known as the Colonnade) in Birmingham, Alabama. In April 2014, the chain had locations in nine U.S. states; total franchise sales were $28,800,000, with average sales of $1,100,000 per store. By November 2017, there were over 80 locations across 16 states. REAL certification The franchise was the first in the United States to earn REAL certification from the United States Healthful Food Council (USHFC). The certification is given to restaurants that serve vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, and where the food is primarily prepared from scratch. The award recognises that the chain uses minimal processed foods, and give priority to local and organic ingredients. However, there is no way to accurately measure the REAL certification's health benefits or what it actually means to consumers. The chain serves Gyro sandwiches made from Gyro loaf composed solely of lamb meat, rather than a mixture of lamb and beef. Lamb meat is seen as a more sustainable choice than beef. Philanthropy According to a corporate spokesperson, every restaurant location supports at least one charitable organization. Nine of Taziki's locations partner with schools to offer Project Hope, styling \\"Hope\\" as an acronym for \\"Herbs Offering Personal Enrichment.\\" This project provides special needs students with the opportunity to grow and package herbs that the local restaurant agrees to buy.

The cake filling leaks out when sliced, similar in appearance to a volcano. The traditional recipe combines egg, egg yolk, honey, white sugar and low-gluten flour. Filling flavors range from traditional honey to exotic flavors like cheese, matcha and chocolate. Concave cake was initially considered unsuccessful due to its namesake shape. However, it caught traction in China, and the cake is now part of popular culture. Ingredients Concave cakes are commonly made using eggs, egg yolk, low- gluten flour, honey and a small portion of sugar. History Concave cake is believed to have originated from Portugal during the Age of Discovery. Women who worried about their husbands and family members traveling as sailors baked concave cakes as a symbol of ‚Äúsunny days‚Äù and good luck. Between the 15th and 17th centuries, the cake was introduced to Nagasaki, a city in Japan best known for its roles in ending the Second World War. The original variety of this cake was honey, but as its popularity grew, different flavors such as strawberry, Earl Grey and matcha emerged. Popularity Onset The variety show Kangxi Lai Le in Taiwan is credited with sparking the concave cake trend in April 2013 when it recommended the cake. Due to the show's popularity, online searches for the term \\"concave cakes\\" rose overnight. Although the cake had previously garnered attention in Japan, the show helped increase popularity of the cakes in Taiwan and mainland China. Today, several shops in Taiwan advertise themselves as offering ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù concave cake. Celebrities and television programs Celebrities and television programs lauded the concave cake. Kangxi Lai Le introduced the cake on June 16, 2013. The host Dee Shu and Kevin Tsai recommended and praised it, creating a trend among the Taiwanese public. Taiwanese comedian once claimed that ‚ÄúIf someone wants to eat a half-cooked cake, they will have to wait for half a year,‚Äù to represent how difficult it was to buy one.

Bakeries across the city sell this cake as they see the potential in other Asian countries. Counterfeit controversy Some China stores were blamed for ‚Äúshanzhai,‚Äù or fake cakes. In 2014, a bakery in China called Grandpa Rick was forced to shut down after it was accused of illegally claiming itself as the franchisee of a Japanese Concave Cake store called Rikuro; Grandpa Rick used its name, logo and false promotion of its history.

His political career peaked and crashed in the late 1940s when he found himself on the losing side as the newly established German Democratic Republic reverted to one-party government. Biography Early years Arthur Lieutenant was born in Jauer, an old market town in Silesia, some west of Breslau. On leaving school he studied Economics before embarking on a career as a tax lawyer. The rather confused revolutionary period directly following the war involved the establishment and / or reinvention of several political parties in Germany. One of these was the German People's Party (DVP / Deutsche Volkspartei) established towards the end of 1918. Arthur Lieutenant was a founder member. As the country moved uncertainly towards a more democratic future, several centrist and left leaning liberal groupings coalesced around the same time to form the German Democratic Party (DDP / Deutsche Demokratische Partei). During the early post-war period the DVP initially rejected the Weimar Constitution which, as matters later turned out, would form the basis for government in Germany till 1933. In 1919 Arthur Lieutenant switched his party allegiance to the DDP which was proving less grudging in its acceptance of the post-imperial constitutional structure being put in place. Politics (Weimar Germany) By 1918 Lieutenant had moved to Glogau, a larger town, still in Silesia, but roughly to the north of Jauer. Here, in 1919, he joined the town council, serving between 1931 and 1933 as the town mayor. Regime change took place in January 1933 when the NSDAP (Nazi Party) took power and lost little time in implementing a retreat from democracy in favour of one-party government across Germany. Lieutenant was relieved of his civic duties, arrested and briefly imprisoned. Politics (Soviet occupation zone / German Democratic Republic) The war ended in May 1945 and with it the Hitler regime. Following frontier changes mandated by the military winners and large scale ethnic cleansing, there was no future for a German in the now Polish town of G≈Çog√≥w. In what remained of Germany it had been widely assumed that the fall of Hitler would open the way for a return from dictatorship, back to multi-party democracy. Arthur Lieutenant turned to national politics in the country's Soviet occupation zone. On 21 June 1945, at Wilmersdorf, he was a founding member of the Liberal Democratic Party of Germany (LDPD), effectively a re-founding with a new name of the old DDP, suppressed in 1933. The LDPD's first leader was Waldemar Koch, but he was forced to resign by the Soviets after a few months. Towards the end of 1945 the LDPD leadership passed to Wilhelm K√ºlz whom the Soviets found more accommodating on the issue of land reform: in 1946 Arthur Lieutenant became K√ºlz's deputy. There was a widespread perception across Germany that political division of the German \\"left\\" that had opened the way for the rise of the \\"right-wing\\" Nazi Party in the 1930s. Within the Soviet occupation zone, this provided justification for a contentious merger, in April 1946, between the old Communist Party and the Moderate-left SPD. However, within the resulting merged party, the Socialist Unity Party (Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands, SED) former members of the SPD quickly found themselves sidelined or excluded from positions of influence, and by October 1949, when the Soviet occupation zone was formally reinvented as the German Democratic Republic, the SED had effectively become a Soviet sponsored versions of the old German Communist Party with a new name. Although a return to one-party government was clearly on the agenda, this was to be achieved in East Germany not by banning opposition parties, but simply by ensuring that they were adequately controlled by the ruling SED (party). This gave rise to acute tensions within the LDPD between those seeking to retain power and influence by dancing to the tune of the SED and those still believing that there was a future for an independent liberal party in (East) Germany. Parallel tensions arose between the LDPD in East Germany and the Democratic Party of Germany, founded in March 1947 and seen for a time as a reborn pan-German liberal party. Lieutenant's career in the LDPD party leadership team was a correspondingly difficult one. In January 1948, at a meeting in Frankfurt of the Democratic Party of Germany, a last-ditch attempt to build a single post Nazi Liberal Party across Germany ended in recriminations, with the leading delegate from the western occupation zones angrily accusing eastern counterparts of having chosen \\"the Russian version of German unity\\". K√ºlz had not even turned up for the meeting and it was left to his dapper lawyerly deputy, Arthur Lieutenant, to spell out the obvious conclusion that under the circumstances further co-operation across the four occupation zones was from now on, for the eastern Liberals, impossible. As he left the meeting, Lieutenant concluded with the more telling comment, referencing a quotation attributed to Luther at his trial in 1521, \\"Know this. We can do nothing else\\"\\"Begreift doch, wir k√∂nnen nicht anders\\" By the end of December 1948 the consciously \\"western\\" Free Democratic Party had been founded in the western occupation zones. Before that, on 10 April 1948, Arthur Lieutenant visited his boss, Wilhelm K√ºlz, on the morning of 10 April 1948 to be greeted by the housekeeper with the information that unusually, even though it was already 8 in the morning, K√ºlz had not emerged from his bedroom. Lieutenant accompanied the housekeeper into K√ºlz's bedroom only to discover that the elderly \\"east German\\" Liberal Party leader had unexpectedly died in the night, apparently as the result of a heart attack. After the death of the party leader Arthur Lieutenant, as his deputy, took over his duties. Sources are nevertheless ambiguous on whether he can strictly be counted as party leader. Some commentators thought that if there had been an election of members, Lieutenant would have been voted in as party leader, but, possibly mindful of this possibility, the Soviet Military Administration did not permit such an election. Lieutenant's position in the party is accordingly sometimes described as that of \\"acting\\" party leader between April and October 1948. The structural device whereby East Germany's ruling SED (party) controlled the country's other parties (known as the \\"Bloc parties\\") was the National Front, an administrative framework incorporating political parties along with various officially approved mass movements, each entitled to participate in elections and to send members to the National Legislature (Volkskammer) on the basis of predetermined quotas.The Single list election process introduced for the 1949 assembly election and used for subsequent General Elections up to and including that of 1986 would ensure that the ruling party's candidate list was always supported by more than 99% of those voting and more than 98% of eligible voters were always recorded as having voted. Arthur Lieutenant was not a supporter of the Soviet style constitutional arrangements being imposed by the government: there were also sharp tensions within the LDPD. In October 1948 he resigned his party offices, succeeded as party leader, largely from a sense of duty, by Dr. Karl Hamann who for a few years continued to place hope in the miraculous possibility of a somehow reunited Germany delivering a return to democratic political institutions. In the month he resigned from the national party leadership team Arthur Lieutenant was appointed Finance Minister in the regional government of Brandenburg which may have been a necessary job at the regional level, although in Brandenburg and across the country the regional tier of government was increasingly being sidelined as power accrued to the central committee of the ruling party. In 1948/49 he was also nominated to membership of the \\" Provisional Volkskammer\\" which with the formal founding of the German Democratic Republic in October 1949 would become the new country's National Legislature (always subject to the Leading Role of The Party). Lieutenant evidently remained under pressure, however, and in October 1949, a few days before the founding of the German Democratic Republic was celebrated in East Berlin, Arthur Lieutenant fled to West Berlin. Between 1950 and 1953, based in West Berlin, he served as the party leader of the \\"Exil-LDPD\\", effectively the Liberal Democratic Party of Germany in exile.

Protestors claim that parallel trading has caused a shortage of household goods and an increasing inflation rate. Parallel trading and the protests have exacerbated the Hong Kong-Mainland conflict. There has also been conflict between local shop owners and citizens as the parallel trading boosts shop sales but raises the local prices of daily necessities. Background In 2012, 95% of travellers who travelled between Shenzhen and Hong Kong many times were mainland parallel traders. Mainland consumers are able to earn profits through smuggling because of the advantage of favourable exchange rate, the absence of taxes and tariff in Hong Kong, and lax customs on the mainland side. As multiple entry visa policy permits visa holders to cross the Hong Kong- mainland border many times in one day, thus the mainland parallel traders can export goods from Hong Kong to Mainland China frequently. Since the parallel traders buy a large amount of goods in Hong Kong, the local prices in Tuen Mun, Yuen Long, Tai Po and Shatin, which are districts close to the Hong Kong- mainland border, are boosted.Ma, Mary (10 February 2015). \\"Parallel lines of concern need fixing\\". The Standard Therefore, the first anti-parallel trading protest was started at Sheung Shui in September 2012.Luk, Eddie (21 September 2012). \\"Seeing red (white and blue)\\". The Standard Protests Sheung Shui =2012= Sheung Shui anti-parallel trading protests began on 15 September 2012. The first rally was organised on Facebook. Around 50 protesters, angry to the influx of mainland parallel traders, gathered outside Sheung Shui Station where a parallel goods distribution centre frequently operated. This action prompted confrontations between the protesters and parallel traders. The number of protesters then increased to over 100 people. Police including the Police Tactical Unit intervened and the protest ended in chaos. Similar protests took place frequently in the days and months that followed, until 2015. This series of protests has been referred to as \\"Reclaim Sheung Shui\\" (). = 2019 = On 13 July 2019, with the momentum brought by the anti-extradition bill protests, a protest was organized in Sheung Shui opposing cross-border smuggling by mainland Chinese dealers, with 30,000 attendees claimed by the organizer. The protest was largely peaceful for the first two hours. However, as it went on, the organizer and protesters refused to follow the authorized route, which had Sheung Shui Station as the destination. Instead, they marched on Sheung Shui Plaza, occupied some traffic roads and started skirmishing with the police who accused them of participating in an unlawful assembly, triggering an hour-long standoff which lasted until late night. A handful of journalists, including a female one working for the Agence France-Presse, were attacked by the police with batons for their live reporting of the event. During the skirmishes, protesters vandalised a number of dispensaries that they thought were directly complicit in cross-border smuggling. After the riot police cleared the crowd from the traffic roads, they chased the crowd onto a footbridge leading to Sheung Shui Station, when a teenager with uneven bottom length suddenly jumped off the footbridge to escape arrest, but was rescued jointly by the journalists and police. He was eventually arrested, insulted and ushered into a police van by the police, who told the press that he would be charged with \\"unlawful assembly\\", resulting in instant online uproar. Tuen Mun On 8 February 2015, hundreds of protesters chanted slogans at awaiting passengers at Tuen Mun B3X bus stop, and marched along the route of the B3X from Tuen Mun town centre to Shenzhen Bay border crossing. As protesters walked to Yan Ching Street, Police used pepper spray and batons in an attempt to calm rally participants. As a result, police and protesters who injured were sustained aside; 13 locals were arrested. One month later, on 8 March 2015, around one hundred protesters marched in the V City shopping mall. They walked around the mall while the police were on standby so as to prevent conflict. Later on, they turned to the pharmacies along Yan Ching Street and pulled down the goods. Then, they went to B3X bus stop and tried to use barriers to block the road. Police used shields and batons to separate two groups of people. Some mainland tourists had been surrounded and scolded by protesters. Seven protesters had been arrested in this rally until 11 March 2015. Sha Tin  Protest in New Town Plaza with Flag of the British colony of Hong Kong on 15 February 2015 A protest on 15 February 2015 began with more than one hundred protesters gathered at the MTR Sha Tin Station and chanted their slogans at New Town Plaza. The tensions and scolding between the demonstrators, mainland tourists and intervention of police officers caused the protest to turn into a conflict. There were around two hundred demonstrators in the whole protest. In this protest, six men were arrested, two citizens and one officer were injured. The protest was initiated by nativist activists and a related Facebook page called \\"Reclaim Hong Kong, Defend The Local\\" () and aimed at expressing resent towards parallel traders and the inclination of the shopping mall to the mainland tourists. Yuen Long Yuen Long protesters occupy Castle Peak Road YL section 1 March 2015 On 1 March 2015, hundreds of protesters marched from MTR Long Ping Station to downtown Yuen Long. The protest caused disruption along Yuen Long's main road and nearby businesses, resulting in conflict between protesters and groups of Yuen Long residents.

The protest was launched by two nativist groups which are Hong Kong Indigenous and Civic Passion.Wong, H., Luk, E., & Cheng, K. (2 March 2015). \\"Locals battle anti-mainland protesters\\" . The Standard. They demanded an abolition of the multiple-entry permit plan in the Individual Visit Scheme. Social response Citizens Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong and The Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions strongly condemned that the anti-parallel trading protesters were not rational and damaged the image of Hong Kong. They asked the police enforce to work and protect the safety of workers. Since the protests happened frequently, more citizens implied that the protesters were more radical than before. They agreed that the parallel traders disturbed their daily life. However, they also stated that the anti-parallel trading protests adversely affected them in recent months. On the other hand, legislative councillor Gary Fan claimed that the protests happened because the government did not take any adjustment policies. He suggested that the government should put limitation on the individual visit scheme and cancel multiple-entry permit. He believed that the demonstrations will continue if the government do not adjust their policy. Government Secretary for Security, Lai Tung-kwok strongly denounced protesters' behaviour during the anti-parallel trade demonstrations. He said the police will take resolute enforcement action to ensure safety and order. Police Commissioner Andy Tsang also blamed the protesters and stressed that the police would be decisive in enforcement. He emphasised that people should express their opinions in a peaceful way. In addition, Zhang Xiaoming the director of the central government liaison office, commented about the protests when meeting the Hong Kong representatives in Beijing. He warned the protesters that the parallel traders are the cause of the problem, but not all the mainland visitors. He claimed that the protesters should not damage the benefits of parallel traders and the problem should not be exaggerated or used as a tool to escalate cross- border conflict.

Location It is situated about north east of Elliott and south west of Borroloola. The property surrounds the Bullwaddy Conservation Reserve to the north, south and west. The station abuts Tanumbirini Station to the north east, Beetaloo to the south east, Shenandoah to the west and Nutwood Downs to the north. The Carpentaria Highway passes through the property. Description Amumngee Mungee currently occupies and area of and is situated on the Sturt Plateau bioregion. The area is characterised by thin infertile soils on a lateritic land surface. Large fragmented stands of Bullwaddy interspersed with area of lancewood are common to the area. History The traditional owners of the area are the Jingili peoples. The area around the Amungee Mungee waterhole, from which the station takes its name, is a significant dreaming area for the Jingili. The Overland Telegraph was completed in 1873 and led to the first leases being taken up in the area shortly afterward. Many were surrendered in 1889 for non-payment of rent. In 1883 Harold Murray Bathern known Bullwaddy Bates droved a herd of cattle to Brunette Downs Station. Bates and George Bostock took up Beetaloo Station with Bates leaving the property to Bates after he walked off the property. In 1968 the block of land now known as Amungee Mungee was put up for ballot and was won by Jeff and Cooee Hills. The station was renamed Cooee Hills and was inhabited by the Hills in 1971. The family fenced the property and stocked it with 1,250 head of cattle. The family left the property and went back to Queensland after their son died in 1977. Reg and Mollie Hartig acquired the property shortly afterward and remained there until 1981 when Reg died and was buried on the property. The Zlotowski family, who also own Wollogorang Station near the Queensland border acquired the property at some prior to 2006. As of 2014 the property was still on the market along with at least 15 others in the Kimberley and Northern Territory. The destocked property sold later the same year for 6.5 million by the Zlotowski family to a partnership. The majority partner in the venture is BB Retail Capital, headed by Brett Blundy, and the other partner is the Bullwaddy Pastoral owned by Adrian and Emma Brown. 10,000 head of cattle were purchased from the Australian Agricultural Company to restock the property later in 2014. The partnership hope to increase the number of watering points around the property from 20 to 160 and increase the stocking rate from 20,000 head to 100,000 head of cattle.

Its legal name was CFAS (College Financial Aid Systems), LLC. Origins Edifi was founded by Larry Schechter in 1991; he remained its sole owner throughout (with a hiatus in 2002-2004). It started in Wellesley, Massachusetts, but with Schechter's relocation to the Albany, New York area, it moved along with him, and operated first from a bare one-room office on Union Street in Schenectady. Growth led it to move in 2001 to an office suite located at 409 New Karner Road in an unincorporated area of Albany county (mailing address Albany); further growth led it to move in 2003 to a larger office suite at 450 New Karner Road, where it ran a call center, with five clocks - Eastern, Central, Mountain, Pacific, and Hawaii times - on the wall. When winding down operations it moved back to Union Street. The company started when friends and neighbors of Schechter asked him for help in completing FAFSA forms. Sensing that money could be made, Schechter formed a company, which initially sold its services door-to-door. His primary collaborator and second-in-command, once the company had moved to Schenectady, was Maura Kastberg, who had a B.S. in mathematics. In order to grow the company, they decided to use a seminar method to make presentations to larger groups of people. This was very successful and the company had explosive growth; in the early 2000s it made the magazine Inc.'s list of the fastest- growing companies in the United States. Edifi originally priced its services at about $495, and offered a money-back guarantee, if it could not get the family enough additional financial aid to cover its fee. It abandoned the guarantee after having to pay out on some cases. Organization Edifi was divided into five departments: Sales, Accounting, Reservations, which set up appointments for the seminars, Customer Service, which dealt with the clients and input data from client phone interviews and tax documents to the company's proprietary software (a customized \\"front end\\" for Microsoft Access), and Forms, which was in charge of completing financial aid forms, and whose new hires were tested for their printing ability. Marketing The company's services were hard to understand and marketing was expensive. In fact, its greatest single expense was postage for marketing materials. John Braat, who had previous experience in a variety of sales and management positions, was Chief Operating Officer and head of the sales department. The company had three teams of commissioned salespeople, many of whom made more than the employees who actually did the work. Braat spent a lot of effort analyzing where seminars (sales meetings) would best be held. It did not market in states with no clear centers of population, such as Montana. For large cities like New York, all three sales teams would work together. The seminars were scheduled so as to avoid hurricane season in the South, and winter storms in the North. Flying the salespeople all around the country was another large expense. Names of prospects were purchased, from brokers who sold information on college prospects; most were students who had taken the College Board examinations. Edifi came up with the technique of sending invitations to students - rather than their probably more skeptical parents - to attend a free seminar where they could learn about opportunities for college grants and scholarships. The salespersons were not to lie to the families about what Edifi could do (although sometimes they apparently did). The original contracts were rewritten to say that Edifi had no special \\"connections\\" with college financial aid offices and did nothing that parents could not do for themselves, if they put in the time and effort. Services The first service Edifi offered families was to give estimates of the financial aid a family could expect to receive from whatever colleges it chose, and what the \\"bottom line\\" for each of those colleges would be. Behind this was Edifi's ability to find or calculate the true cost of attendance for each college ‚Äî since 2011 posted on each college's Web site, by Federal law, but before that often hard to locate, if the figure was public at all. (In those cases Edifi calculated an estimate.) This was intended to help families make good decisions, at least from a financial point of view, of where the child should go to college. When the student was a senior, Edifi completed the FAFSA, Profiles, state, and college need-based forms and made sure things were submitted at the best times. For example, the FAFSA should be submitted immediately after the applications open, estimating income rather than waiting months until taxes are done before applying. Edifi would submit a second, updating FAFSA once a family's taxes were completed. When financial aid offers were received, if copies of those were sent to Edifi, it would prepare a written analysis of the offer to make it understandable. (A minority of financial aid award letters were easy to understand, but many were cryptic or outright deceptive, presenting unsubsidized loans as if they were really financial aid.) It would also indicate, based on published information and its own previous experience with the colleges, whether the offer was or was not \\"reasonable\\". Many families did not know, and still do not know, that financial aid offers can be appealed. Edifi looked for reasons that an appeal could be filed: because the offer was not in line with the college's offer history (it was not \\"reasonable\\"), the family had high medical expenses, loss of income, high debt, and so on. Edifi would write appeal letters which the parents would sign and send to the college. Edifi would analyze the revised offer, if any, and sometimes filed a second appeal if the results of the first were unsatisfactory. Some clients clearly benefited from Edifi's services and expert advice, and there were a few spectacular successes. For example, a little-known fact that Edifi informed its clients about was that more expensive colleges could actually cost less, because these colleges often had so much financial aid to give out that it more than made up for the higher price. Some families, especially non-English-speaking ones, needed help with the financial aid process and forms. Edifi told the parents what they needed to do and when they needed to do it, and made sure, at least in theory, that things were done on time. However, a student who was going to a local community college, and whose high school would help with the paperwork, got little return on the parents' investment. Because of the high cost of marketing in a seminar format, to ensure a reasonable return on investment, Edifi marketed its services on a \\"package\\" rather than a \\"menu\\" basis. One fixed price covered all the services and how many of them the family chose to use depended on which colleges the student applied to and the degree to which the family cooperated with Edifi, sending in needed documents like tax returns and financial aid offers. Not all did. Client dissatisfaction About one- third of the clients thought that they had made a great decision contracting with Edifi, enrolled their younger children, and got their friends to sign up, thereby receiving a discount on renewals of their service for the students' sophomore and later years. Another third was not as enthusiastic, but felt that they had at least gotten what they paid for. The last third felt they had been ripped off. Edifi had to deal with a constant stream of charge-backs from credit card companies, complaints filed with Better Business Bureaus (which gave Edifi an \\"F\\" rating, because of its marketing), and whose investigations Edifi took seriously, investigations by attorneys general, angry high school guidance counselors who said they did everything Edifi did, but for free (which most do not), and the like.Complaint Review: Edifi Financial Services, http://www.ripoffreport.com/r/edifi-financial-services/albany-new- york-12205/edifi-financial-services-ready-set-college-low-down-dirty-liars- riiippp-ooofff-high-sc-183125, retrieved 3/6/2015.

Under New York State law, a three-day (later, five-day) \\"cooling-off period\\" was required when a contract was made, during which time the contract could be canceled without penalty. After this period, Edifi rarely made refunds. Compounding the problem was when Edifi sold its services to undocumented immigrants who were ineligible for federal student aid and in most states, state student aid. Some parents did not know English and did not understand the contract they signed; however, under New York law the contract was still valid. The Client Services Department The department which interacted with the clients - interviewing them, gathering and processing their documents - was the Client Services Department. It was also this department that analyzed financial aid offers (arguably Edifi's most important service) and wrote appeals when appropriate. Translating the information gathered and input by Client Services into filled-out FAFSAs, CSS Profiles, and college financial aid forms was done by a different and much quieter department, Forms. As a quality control and check against errors, all completed work had to be proofed by a different employee. The workers who actually did the work were primarily college students paid an hourly wage ($9.00 to $10.00 an hour in 2003). Turnover was high and morale was low. Many quit when they learned what Edifi did and what its reputation was. Katzberg was universally perceived as an abrasive, unsupportive manager; a former, angry employee described her online as \\"Hitler in a ball gown\\", and her and Braat as \\"borderline con artists\\".http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/financial-aid- scholarships/564250-is-edifi-college-financial-aid-services-a-scam.html, consulted 6/1/2015. The company was uninterested in retaining experienced workers, who would have improved service but would have had to have been given raises. While it was not a deliberate policy (though it had the side effect of increasing the owner's profit), the company had difficulty retaining enough workers to service all its clients, and some clients did not receive the services they paid for. Other families did not use all, or any, of the services, ignoring or not noticing the notices (sometimes in the form of newsletters) Edifi sent through the mail. If the parents sent in documents as requested and called the company regularly to be sure their file was being processed, the company did as good a job as it could. Unfortunately, while documents should have been processed rapidly and without parent phone calls, this was not always the case, and cases in which nothing was done were not rare. One year hundreds of financial aid offers never got analyzed nor appeal letters written (unless parents called to inquire) because Client Services did not have the staff needed. The company did make a full refund to one pair of parents who pursued the matter, for whom nothing had been done as late as April of the student's senior year, although all necessary documents were in the student's file. Many families simply forgot about Edifi, amid everything going on in the senior year. Edifi did not have a philosophy of ripping people off, and complained bitterly and publicly that it was being unfairly lumped in with out-and-out scams, such as scholarship search services;\\"Common Scholarship Scams\\", http://www.finaid.org/scholarships/scams.phtml, consulted 6/1/2015. it pointed out repeatedly that a sign of its good faith was that it did not guarantee any particular result. To the contrary, there was some pride in what was done (much or most of the time), in the many cases in which students were really helped. Extra-FAFSA services Edifi (Maura Kastberg and Larry Schechter) were constantly looking for additional services they could provide other than filling out the FAFSA and other financial aid forms. These included: * Newsletters, whenever Kastberg found time to write one. These gave financial aid reminders and tips. * Handbooks for each year in high school, with things to be thought of or worked on for each year. * An on-line guidance counselor, who would respond to questions posted. Guidance counselor questions were answered by staff, there was no one guidance counselor. * A college search engine (a leased service). * Online SAT preparation and sample tests (also not an in-house product, acquired through a cooperative relationship with a major college prep company). The reason behind the push for non-FAFSA services was in part for marketing purposes but also because so many students did not take the proper high school classes that would best prepare them, or were required, for college and result, in some cases, in greater financial aid eligibility.  The end of Edifi Larry Schechter had dreams of enlarging the company: by partnering with financial planners, for example. In 2002 Schechter sold the company to two investors who hoped to make money by reselling it to the Princeton Review. This sale never took place and the investors returned the company to Schechter's care. The price of services went from $495 to $595, then to $795, $995, $1095, $1195, $1295, and $1595 over a 20 year period. Additional students in the same family were first $150, then $195, $295, and $495. In 2011 Edifi was faced with a national recession, increased air fares because of oil price increases, inability to raise prices further (price resistance), and the impracticality of automating an online application, as opposed to a paper FAFSA that came out of the computer printer in seconds. Maura Kastberg wanted to transfer FAFSA application data electronically, even before the FAFSA was put on line, but the Department of Education refused this. Faced with this situation, the company ceased selling new contracts, terminated most employees, moved back to Schenectady, and limited its activities to servicing contracts which had already been sold. As of 2015 it is out of business, and no longer has a Web site.

Deindustrialisation has taken place in many nations over the years, as social changes and urbanisation have changed the financial demographics of the world. Phenomena such as the mechanisation of labour render industrial societies obsolete, and lead to the de-establishment of industrial communities. Background Theories that predict or explain deindustrialisation have a long intellectual lineage. Karl Marx's theory of declining (industrial) profit argues that technological innovation enables more efficient means of production, resulting in increased physical productivity, i.e., a greater output of use value per unit of capital invested. In parallel, however, technological innovations replace people with machinery, and the organic composition of capital increases. Assuming only labour can produce new additional value, this greater physical output embodies a smaller value and surplus value. The average rate of industrial profit therefore declines in the longer term. George Reisman (2002) identified inflation as a contributor to deindustrialisation. In his analysis, the process of fiat money inflation distorts the economic calculations necessary to operate capital-intensive manufacturing enterprises, and makes the investments necessary for sustaining the operations of such enterprises unprofitable. The term de-industrialisation crisis has been used to describe the decline of labour-intensive industry in a number of countries and the flight of jobs away from cities. One example is labour-intensive manufacturing. After free-trade agreements were instituted with less developed nations in the 1980s and 1990s, labour-intensive manufacturers relocated production facilities to Third World countries with much lower wages and lower standards. In addition, technological inventions that required less manual labour, such as industrial robots, eliminated many manufacturing jobs. Australia In 2008, four companies mass-produced cars in Australia. Mitsubishi ceased production in March 2008, followed by Ford in 2016, and Holden and Toyota in 2017. Holden bodyworks were manufactured at Elizabeth, South Australia and engines are produced at the Fishermens Bend plant in Port Melbourne, Victoria. In 2006, Holden's export revenue was just under 1.3 billion. In March 2012, Holden was given a $270 million lifeline by the Australian government. In return, Holden planned to inject over $1 billion into car manufacturing in Australia. They estimated the new investment package would return around $4 billion to the Australian economy and see GM Holden continue making cars in Australia until at least 2022. However, Holden announced on 11 December 2013 that Holden cars would no longer be manufactured in Australia from the end of 2017. Ford had two main factories, both in Victoria: located in the Geelong suburb of Norlane and the northern Melbourne suburb of Broadmeadows. Both plants were closed down in October 2016. Until 2006, Toyota had factories in Port Melbourne and Altona, Victoria. Since then, all manufacturing has been at Altona. In 2008, Toyota exported 101,668 vehicles worth $1,900 million. In 2011 the figures were \\"59,949 units worth $1,004 million\\". On 10 February 2014 it was announced that by the end of 2017 Toyota would cease manufacturing vehicles and engines in Australia. Until trade liberalisation in the mid 1980s, Australia had a large textile industry. This decline continued through the first decade of the 21st century. Since the 1980s, tariffs have steadily been reduced; in early 2010, the tariffs were reduced from 17.5 percent to 10 percent on clothing, and 7.5‚Äì10% to 5% for footwear and other textiles. As of 2010, most textile manufacturing, even by Australian companies, is performed in Asia. Total employment in Australian textile, clothing and footwear manufacturing (thousands of people) since 1984 Austria Austria has many indicators that justify labelling them as a deindustrialising country. Data collected from the OECD for Austria has shown that since 1956 total employment did grow until 1994 and since then remained relatively steady. Employment in industry and construction, however, has declined steadily as service sector employment has steadily increased. Data also shows that even as employment in industry and construction has decreased, industry productivity has continued to grow. Austrian unemployment has steadily increased since 1983 due to deindustrialisation. Austria was one of the countries in a study that showed that increasing overall unemployment was significantly related to manufacturing unemployment. Austria's foreign and domestic policy has made deindustrialisation possible. High labour taxes and high withholding taxes repel low-skill immigration as low capital taxes enable domestic capital investment. Stern banking secrecy policies, no withholding taxes for non-residents, joining the European Union, and adopting the Euro enabled substantial growth in Austria's services sector. Belgium Data taken from the OECD website show that industrial employment in Belgium rose between 1999 and 2000 and then declined until 2003, rising again until 2006. The overall trend in industrial employment in Belgium, however, is still a decline. OECD data also shows that production and sales of total industry in Belgium has been on the rise since 1955, with the exception of small declines during a few years. Despite this trend, deindustrialisation is occurring at fairly rapid rates in Belgium. Variables such as large population increases and regional discrepancies account for these misleading statistics. Deindustrialisation is hitting the region of Wallonia much harder than the region of Flanders. Wallonia remains much more impoverished and has an unemployment rate of about 17% (twice that of the unemployment rate in Flanders). Other statistics displaying the effects of deindustrialisation in Belgium is the rise in employment in the service sector from 1999 until 2006. Today, industry is much less significant in Belgium than it has been in previous years. Canada Much of the academic literature pertaining to Canada hints at deindustrialisation as a problem in the older manufacturing areas of Ontario and the east. Nationwide, over the past fifty years, according to 2008 OECD data, industrial production and overall employment have been steadily increasing. Industrial production levelled off a bit between 2004 and 2007, but its production levels are the highest that they have ever been. The perception of deindustrialisation that the literature refers to deals with the fact that although employment and economic production have risen, the economy has shifted drastically from manufacturing jobs to service sector jobs. Only 13% of the current Canadian population has a job in the industrial sector. Technological advancements in industry over the past fifty years have allowed for industrial production to keep rising during the Canadian economic shift to the service sector. 69% of the GDP of Canada comes from the service sector.CIA World Factbook 2008Steven High, Industrial sunset: the making of North America's rust belt, 1969-1984 (University of Toronto Press, 2015). Denmark Regarding Denmark's industry, the country does not appear to be deindustrialising as a whole. Literature (Goldsmith and Larsen 2004) has stated that perhaps Denmark's size and \\"Nordic style\\" of governing has allowed it to hide from the detrimental effects of globalisation. Both men's and women's labour statistics (OECD data 2008) show a steady increase over the past decade. Despite a slight dip from 2001 to 2003, overall employment in Denmark has been at a steady increase since 1995. Denmark's total industry output has also been on the rise since the 1974, despite an economic recession from 1987 to 1993. The country's high employment and low unemployment rates have improved the production industry, and the high tax rates have strengthened the economy. Finland Based on the data from the OECD website, Finland has been industrialising according to industrial employment and industrial production statistics. Finland has been considered very resilient based on its remarkable economic comeback after their recession in 1990 due to the fall of the Soviet Union. During this time, production of total industry and civilian employment in industry declined rapidly. Finland has been ranked number one three times in the World Economic Forum competitiveness studies as one of the most developed IT economies since 2000. Since the 1990 recession, which was one of the largest in European history, Finland has managed to soar back to the top of the economic ladder. Finland has done so by focusing strongly on education. After their recession, Finland invested its money on boosting R&D;, education, and retraining workers that had lost their job due to the recession. With its investment in education, Finland has succeeded in increasing some of its industries. For example, the forest industry now specialises in high-quality papers. As a result of investment in education and technology, Finland is now one of the world's largest producers of paper-making machinery. According to the statistics on the OECD website, Finland is not deindustrialising. France Data for France indicates that while employment in industry relative to the total French economy has decreased, there is a lack of sound evidence pointing to an overall trend of deindustrialisation. Research (Lee 2005, Feinstein 1999) shows that at the same time relative employment in industry is decreasing, total production in industry has almost quadrupled since the mid 20th century, levelling off only since about the year 2000 (OECD 2008). Lee shows that between 1962 and 1995, employment in industry in France fell 13.1% (2005:table 1). Advances in technology that allow for higher output by fewer employees, coupled with a change in the type of products manufactured domestically, such as the high-tech electronics now manufactured in France, explain the negative relationship of employment and output in French industry. Thus, it may feel like deindustrialisation is occurring because of the relative decrease of employment or highly publicised cases of outsourcing, yet the data suggest industry production in France is not suffering. Germany Historic In occupied Germany after World War II the Morgenthau Plan was implemented, although not in its most extreme version.Frederick H. Gareau, \\"Morgenthau's Plan for Industrial Disarmament in Germany\\". The Western Political Quarterly, Vol. 14, No. 2 (June 1961) The plan was present in the U.S. occupation directive JCS 1067Michael R. Beschloss, The Conquerors: Roosevelt, Truman and the Destruction of Hitler's Germany, 1941‚Äì1945, pg. 233 and in the Allied \\"industrial disarmament\\" plans. On February 2, 1946, a dispatch from Berlin reported: > Some progress has been made in converting Germany to an agricultural and > light industry economy, said Brigadier General William H. Draper, Jr., chief > of the American Economics Division, who emphasised that there was general > agreement on that plan. He explained that Germany's future industrial and > economic pattern was being drawn for a population of 66,500,000. On that > basis, he said, the nation will need large imports of food and raw materials > to maintain a minimum standard of living. General agreement, he continued, > had been reached on the types of German exports ‚Äî coal, coke, electrical > equipment, leather goods, beer, wines, spirits, toys, musical instruments, > textiles and apparel ‚Äî to take the place of the heavy industrial products > that formed most of Germany's pre-war exports.James Stewart Martin. All > Honorable Men (1950) pg. 191. According to some historians, the U.S. government abandoned the Morgenthau plan as policy in September 1946 with Secretary of State James F. Byrnes' speech \\"Restatement of Policy on Germany\\".John Gimbel, \\"On the Implementation of the Potsdam Agreement: An Essay on U.S. Postwar German Policy\\". Political Science Quarterly, Vol. 87, No. 2. (Jun., 1972), pp. 242-269. Others have argued that credit should be given to former U.S. President Herbert Hoover, who in one of his reports from Germany, dated March 18, 1947, argued for a change in occupation policy, amongst other things stating, \\"There is the illusion that the New Germany left after the annexations can be reduced to a 'pastoral state'. It cannot be done unless we exterminate or move 25,000,000 people out of it.\\" Worries about the sluggish recovery of the European economy, which before the war had depended on the German industrial base, and growing Soviet influence amongst a German population subject to food shortages and economic misery, caused the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Generals Clay and Marshall to start lobbying the Truman administration for a change of policy.Ray Salvatore Jennings, \\"The Road Ahead: Lessons in Nation Building from Japan, Germany, and Afghanistan for Postwar Iraq\\". May 2003, Peaceworks No. 49, pp. 14,15 In July 1947, President Harry S. Truman rescinded on \\"national security grounds\\" the punitive occupation directive JCS 1067, which had directed the U.S. forces of occupation in Germany to \\"take no steps looking toward the economic rehabilitation of Germany [or] designed to maintain or strengthen the German economy\\". It was replaced by JCS 1779, which instead noted that \\"[a]n orderly, prosperous Europe requires the economic contributions of a stable and productive Germany.\\"\\"Pas de Pagaille!\\" Time, July 28, 1947. It had taken over two months for General Clay to overcome continued resistance to the new directive JCS 1779, but on July 10, 1947, it was finally approved at a meeting of the SWNCC. The final version of the document \\"was purged of the most important elements of the Morgenthau plan.\\"Vladimir Petrov, Money and conquest; allied occupation currencies in World War II. Baltimore, Johns Hopkins University Press (1967) p. 236 (Petrov footnotes Hammond, American Civil-Military Decisions, p. 443) Dismantling of (West) German industry ended in 1951, but \\"industrial disarmament\\" lingered in restrictions on actual German steel production, and production capacity, as well as in restrictions on key industries. All remaining restrictions were finally rescinded on May 5, 1955. \\"The last act of the Morgenthau drama occurred on that date or when the Saar was returned to Germany.\\" Vladimir Petrov concluded: \\"The victorious Allies ‚Ä¶ delayed by several years the economic reconstruction of the war torn continent, a reconstruction which subsequently cost the US billions of dollars.\\"Vladimir Petrov, Money and conquest; allied occupation currencies in World War II. Baltimore, Johns Hopkins Press (1967) p. 263 Current In the early 2000s, the unemployment in Germany was moderately high, while industrial output was steadily increasing. Germany's unemployment rate of roughly seven percent (OECD, 2008) is by and large due to the continuing struggles with the reunification process between East and West Germany that began in 1990. However, the unemployment rate has been declining since 2005, when it reached its peak of over ten percent. In the 2010s, Germany's unemployment rate has been one of the lowest in continental Europe. Between 2010 and 2017 the manufacturing employment in absolute terms has risen by 10% from 4.9 million workers to 5.4 million December 2016. Federal German statistics office Indian subcontinent During the reign of the Mughal Empire, India was estimated to be the largest economy in the world, apparently accounting for approximately one-quarter of the world economy.Angus Maddison (2006), \\"The World Economy\\", OECD Publishing, , p. 263 It had strong agriculture and industry, and was the world's largest cotton textile manufacturer (particularly Bengal Subah). But in the latter half of the 18th century, India underwent political turmoil and Europeans (mainly British) got an opportunity to become political masters. During their rule, British mercantilism targeted weakening of the craft guilds, pricing and quota caps, and banning production of many products and commodities in India. India's de-industrialization contributed to Britain's Industrial Revolution, with India no longer being a competitor in the global textile industry, as well as India itself becoming a large market for British textiles. Indian cotton-making could not compete with British inventions and modernisation, such as the: Spinning Jenny, Automatic Mule, Water Frame, Power Loom, Flying Shuttle or Steam Engine until Britain greatly surpassed the estimated production of India's more basic manual industry. Ireland Ireland has yet to de-industrialise. Industrial employment and production and sales in industry have increased since 1990, according to OECD data. The increase in industry coincided with the introduction of Intel to the Irish economy in late 1989. Though one may not think of Intel as industry in the same sense as steel production, it is considered to be industry. Intel is now the largest company by turnover in Ireland. This was the beginning of what was called the \\"Celtic Tiger\\" economy. Dell and Microsoft followed Intel to Ireland, creating a large software industry. As is evidenced by these three companies, a majority of the industries that exist in Ireland are a result of foreign direct investment. The top three FDIs are the US, the UK, and Germany. Italy Overall, Italy in 2008 did not seem to be deindustrialising. According to OECD (2008) data, the rate of industrial employment is at an all-time high, although, in general, it has stayed relatively consistent since 1956. The rate of industrial production is also on the rise after a small dip in recent years; even though production rates are still at almost 2 percent less than they were in 2000, the 2005 rate is eighty percent more than what it was in 1955. These figures, however, do not make the distinction between different regions of the country: according to Rowthorn and Ramaswamy (1999), most manufacturing plants are located in cities such as Genoa and Milan in Northern Italy, and the unemployment rate in the South is significantly higher than in the North. Prior to World War II, Italy's economy was mainly agricultural, but it has since shifted to become one of the largest industrial economies in the world. In general, Italy is continuing to experience a period of industrialisation that has been taking place since the shift. Japan Historic To further remove Japan as a potential future military threat after World War II, the Far Eastern Commission decided that Japan must partly be de- industrialised. Dismantling of Japanese industry was foreseen to have been achieved when Japanese standards of living were reduced to those between 1930 and 1934 (A footnote in Gareau states: \\"For a text of this decision, see Activities of the Far Eastern Commission. Report of the Secretary General, February, 1946 to July 10, 1947, Appendix 30, p. 85.\\") (see Great Depression). In the end the adopted program of de-industrialisation in Japan was implemented to a lesser degree than the similar U.S. \\"industrial disarmament\\" program in Germany. Current A notable event began in the 1990s as the economy of Japan suddenly stagnated after three decades of tremendous economic growth. This could be construed as directly linked to deindustrialisation, as this phenomenon began to be recognised in developed countries of the world around this same time. However, Japan had larger economic problems, the effects of which can still be seen in the country's low economic growth today. According to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (2008), deindustrialisation is occurring in Japan. However, although industrial employment as a percentage of total employment has dropped over the last couple of decades in Japan, total employment has not. Unemployment was fairly low at 3.5% in 2007, and the economy is relatively stable. Literature (Matsumoto 1996) has stated that the service sector has been expanding and providing jobs for those that have been displaced from industry. Strong union membership has also played a role in keeping employment rates stable. Although outsourcing and industrial decline may contribute to job loss in industry, the shift in modern economies from industry to service may help reduce negative effects. Netherlands Much like many other OECD countries, the Netherlands is not experiencing deindustrialisation in the usual way one might think of it. While the OECD's Annual Labour Force Statistics Survey may show that industrial employment opportunities in the Netherlands have significantly decreased in the past 50 years, the OECD's Production and Sales MEI for Industry and Service Statistics shows that the overall production in the industrial sector has actually improved. The Netherlands, like many other countries, has advanced to produce more with less. Also, perhaps in response to the decline in industrial sector employment, the service industry of the Netherlands has grown and expanded its employment opportunities. The timely response of alternatives for employment may have had something to do with the progressive policies the Netherlands has in place to complement the changes in industry. An example might include tax breaks for families where the father works full-time and the mother works part-time, also referred to as the \\"one-and-a-half breadwinner\\" policy. New Zealand New Zealand is in a phase of deindustrialisation starting in the late 1990s. The evidence for this phenomenon is apparent in the decrease of economic output, a shift from employment in the manufacturing sector to the service sector (which may be due to an increase in tourism), the dissipation of unions caused by immigration and individual work contracts, along with the influence on culture by highbrow mass media (like the internet) and technology. It is possible to interpret these trends in a different way due to the complex nature of the data and the difficulty in quantifying and calculating reliable results. These trends are important to study, because they might occur in waves that could help predict economic and cultural outcomes in the future. With the reduction and removal of tariffs through the 1980s and 1990s plus the importation of second hand Japanese cars, the major assembly plants began to close. New Zealand Motor Corporation which had closed its aging Newmarket plant in 1976 and Petone plant in 1982 closed their Panmure plant in 1988. General Motors closed its Petone plant in 1984 and its Trentham plant in 1990. 1987 saw a run of closures: Motor Industries International, Otahuhu, Ford Seaview, Motor Holdings Waitara. Suzuki in Wanganui closed 1988 and VANZ (Vehicle Assemblers of New Zealand a joint Ford and Mazda operation) at Sylvia Park in 1997. Toyota Christchurch in 1996 and VANZ Wiri the next year. Finally in 1998 along with Mitsubishi Porirua, bought from Todd in 1987, Nissan shutdown at Wiri, Honda closed in Nelson and Toyota in Thames.Mark Webster, page 193 Assembly, New Zealand Car Production 1921‚Äì1998 Reed 2002 Redundancies occurred in manufacturing industry; approximately 76,000 manufacturing jobs were lost between 1987 and 1992.Judith Bell, I See Red, Awa Press, Wellington: 2006, pp.22‚Äì56. Poland In Poland, as in many other former communist countries, deindustrialisation occurred rapidly in the years after the fall of communism in 1989, with many unprofitable industries going bankrupt with the switch to market economy, and other state-owned industries being destroyed by a variety of means, including arbitrarily changed credit and tax policies. The deindustrialisation in Poland was based on a neoliberalism-inspired doctrine (systemic transformation according to the requirements of Western financial institutions) and on the conviction that industry-based economy was a thing of the past. However, the extent of deindustrialisation was greater in Poland than in other European, including post-communist, countries: more than ‚Öì of total large and midsize industrial assets were eliminated. The perceived economic reasons for deindustrialisation were reinforced by political and ideological motivations, such as removal of the remaining socialist influences concentrated in large enterprises (opposed to rapid privatization and shock therapy, as prescribed by the Balcerowicz Plan) and by land speculation (plants were sold at prices even lower than the value of the land on which they were located). Among such \\"privatized\\" institutions there were many cases of hostile takeovers (involved in 23% of all assets transferred), when industrial entities were sold and then changed to the service sector or liquidated to facilitate a takeover of the old company's market by the buying (typically foreign) firm. According to comprehensive research data compiled by economist Andrzej Karpi≈Ñski and others, 25-30% of the reductions were economically justified, while the rest resulted from various processes that were controversial, often erroneous or pathological, including actions aimed at quick self-enrichment on the part of people with decision-making capacities. Unlike in the case of the Western deindustrialisation of the preceding years, in Poland modern competitive industries with established markets were also eliminated, including the electronic, telecommunications, computer, industrial machinery, armament and chemical industries. The abandoned domestic and foreign markets, often in Eastern Europe and the Third World countries, had subsequently been taken over by non-Polish interests. Nearly half (47%) of the lost enterprises represented consumer product light industry, rather than heavy industry. Capitalist Poland's early economic policies resulted in economic and social crises including high unemployment, and in what some see as irredeemable losses, impacting Poland's situation today. At the same time however, many constructive developments took place, including the widespread rise of entrepreneurship, and, especially after Poland joined the European Union, significant economic growth. The transformation process, as executed, generally replaced large enterprises with small, creating an environment inimical to innovation but conducive to human capital flight. The evaluation of Poland's economic advancement depends on the criteria used. For example, the country's industrial output had increased 2.4 times between 1989 and 2015, while the Polish GDP's percentage of the gross world product dropped from 2.4 in 1980 to 0.5-0.6 in 2015. In a number of measured categories of progress, Poland places behind its European Union formerly communist near neighbors (the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Lithuania), which had not undertaken deindustrialisation policies as radical as that of Poland.Eugeniusz Guz, \\"Polska w ogonie Europy [Poland in the tail of Europe]\\". PrzeglƒÖd magazine #22(856), 30 May 2016 Soviet Union Prior to its dissolution in 1991, the USSR had the second largest economy in the world after the United States. The economy of the Soviet Union was the modern world's first centrally planned economy. It was based on a system of state ownership and managed through Gosplan (the State Planning Commission), Gosbank (the State Bank) and Gossnab (State Commission for Materials and Equipment Supply). Economic planning was through a series of five-year plans. The emphasis was put on rapid development of heavy industry, and the nation became one of the world's top manufacturers of a large number of basic and heavy industrial products, but it lagged behind in the output of light industrial production and consumer durables. As the Soviet economy grew more complex, it required more and more complex disaggregation of control figures (plan targets) and factory inputs. As it required more communication between the enterprises and the planning ministries, and as the number of enterprises, trusts, and ministries multiplied, the Soviet economy started stagnating. The Soviet economy was increasingly sluggish when it came to responding to change, adapting cost‚àísaving technologies, and providing incentives at all levels to improve growth, productivity and efficiency. Most information in the Soviet economy flowed from the top down, and economic planning was often done based on faulty or outdated information, particularly in sectors with large numbers of consumers. As a result, some goods tended to be underproduced, leading to shortages, while other goods were overproduced and accumulated in storage. Some factories developed a system of barter and either exchanged or shared raw materials and parts, while consumers developed a black market for goods that were particularly sought after but constantly underproduced. Conceding the weaknesses of their past approaches in solving new problems, the leaders of the late 1980s, headed by Mikhail Gorbachev, were seeking to mold a program of economic reform to galvanise the economy. However, by 1990 the Soviet government had lost control over economic conditions. Government spending increased sharply as an increasing number of unprofitable enterprises required state support and consumer price subsidies to continue. The industrial production system in the Soviet Union suffered a political and economic collapse in 1991, after which a transition from centrally planned to market- driven economies occurred. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the economic integration of the Soviet republics was dissolved, and overall industrial activity declined substantially.Oldfield, J.D. (2000) \\"Structural economic change and the natural environment in the Russian Federation\\". Post-Communist Economies, 12(1): 77-90) A lasting legacy remains in the physical infrastructure created during decades of combined industrial production practices. Sweden Sweden's industrial sector presents diverging information in production output and industrial employment levels. Using OECD (2008) data, specific statements can be made about these elements. With this data, it can be seen that production output within the industrial sector has been constantly rising. Contrastingly, employment within industry has been steadily declining since the 1970s, as service sector employment rates increase. Though the decline in industrial employment points to a deindustrialising economy, the increasing levels of production output state otherwise. Sweden's industrial sector remains intact as it relies on its resource base of timber, hydropower, and iron ore as a large economic contributor.CIA World Factbook 2008 Because of its increased production rates in industry, it can be ascertained that deindustrialisation has not occurred in Sweden. The decrease in industrial employment has been countered by an increase in efficiency and automation, increasing output levels in the industrial sector. Switzerland Deindustrialisation is a phenomenon that has been occurring in Switzerland since the mid-1970s. Civilian employment in industry has been in decline since 1975, according to OECD (2008) data, due to a major recession in the market. Literature (Afonso 2005) has stated that this is due to large numbers of migrant workers being forced to leave the country thanks to nonrenewable working permits; the industry, heavily based in foreign labour, suffered greatly and those losses are still observed in the present. Production of total industry has been increasing consistently at a slow rate since a slight decline in 1974. United Kingdom The United Kingdom has experienced considerable deindustrialisation, especially in both heavy industry (such as mining and steel) and light manufacturing. New jobs have appeared with either low wages, or with high skill requirements that the laid- off workers lack. Meanwhile, the political reverberations have been growing.Tim Strangleman, James Rhodes, and Sherry Linkon, \\"Introduction to crumbling cultures: Deindustrialization, class, and memory.\\" International Labor and Working-Class History 84 (2013): 7-22. onlineSteven High, \\"'The Wounds of Class': A Historiographical Reflection on the Study of Deindustrialization, 1973‚Äì2013.\\" History Compass 11.11 (2013): 994-1007 Jim Tomlinson agrees that deindustrialization is a major phernomenon but denies that it represents a decline or failure.Jim Tomlinson, \\"De-industrialization not decline: a new meta-narrative for post-war British history.\\" Twentieth Century British History 27.1 (2016): 76-99. The UK's share of manufacturing output had risen from 9.5% in 1830, during the Industrial Revolution, to 22.9% in the 1870s. It fell to 13.6% by 1913, 10.7% by 1938, and 4.9% by 1973. Overseas competition, trade unionism, the welfare state, loss of the British Empire, and lack of innovation have all been put forward as explanations for the industrial decline. It reached crisis point in the 1970s, with a worldwide energy crisis, high inflation, and a dramatic influx of low-cost manufactured goods from Asia. Coal mining quickly collapsed and practically disappeared by the 21st century. Railways were decrepit, more textile mills closed than opened, steel employment fell sharply, and the car-making industry suffered. Popular responses varied a great deal;For a detailed field study by an anthropologist, see Tim Strangleman et al. found a range of responses from the affected workers: for example, some invoked a glorious industrial past to cope with their new-found personal economic insecurity, while others looked to the European Union for help. Pdf. It has been argued that these reverberations contributed towards the popular vote in favour of Brexit in 2016. Economists developed two alternative interpretations to explain de-industrialization in Britain. The first was developed by Oxford economists Robert Bacon and Walter Eltis. They argue that the public sector expansion deprived the private sector of sufficient labour and capital. In a word, the government ‚Äúcrowded out‚Äù the private sector. A variation of this theory emphasizes the increases in taxation cut the funds needed for wages and profits. Union demands for higher wage rates resulted in lower profitability in the private sector, and a fall in investment. However, many economists counter that public expenditures have lowered unemployment levels, not increased them.Christopher Pick, ed., What's What in the 1980s (1982), pp 86-87.Robert Bacon and Walter Eltis, Britain's Economic Problem: Too Few Producers (2nd ed. 1978) excerpt.Robert Bacon and Walter Eltis, Britain‚Äôs economic problem revisited (Springer, 1996, second edition). The second explanation is the New Cambridge model associated with Wynne Godley and Francis Cripps.Francis Cripps, and Wynne Godley, \\"A formal analysis of the Cambridge economic policy group model.\\" Economica (1976): 335-348 online. It stresses the long-term Decline and competitiveness of British industry. During the 1970s especially, the manufacturing sector steadily lost its share of both home and international markets. The historic substantial surplus of exports over Imports slipped into an even balance. That balance is maintained by North Sea oil primarily, and to a lesser extent from some efficiency improvement in agriculture and service sectors. The New Cambridge model posits several different causes for the decline in competitiveness. Down to the 1970's, the model stresses bad delivery times, poor design of products, and general low-quality. The implication is that although research levels are high in Britain, industry has been laggard in implementing innovation. The model after 1979 points to the appreciation of sterling against other currencies, so that British products are more expensive. In terms of policy, the New Cambridge model recommends general import controls, or else unemployment will continue to mount.Francis Cripps, and Wynne Godley, \\"Control of imports as a means to full employment and the expansion of world trade: the UK's case.\\" Cambridge Journal of Economics 2.3 (1978): 327-334. The model indicates that deindustrialization is a serious problem which threatens the nation's ability to maintain balance of payments equilibrium in the long run. The situation after North Sea oil runs out appears troublesome. De-industrialization imposes that serious social consequences. Workers skilled in the manufacturing sector are no longer needed, and are shuffled off to lower paying, less technologically valuable jobs. Computization and globalization are compounding that problem.Pick, What's What in the 1980s (1982), pp 86-878. United States This former industrial site in Connecticut was used for office space after the manufacturer ceased operations in 1994.National Welding and Manufacturing , U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, accessed 2009-09-07 Sectors of the US Economy as percent of GDP, 1947-2009 In the United States, deindustrialisation is mostly a regional phenomenon, centred on the Rust Belt of the original industrial centres from New England to the Great Lakes. While many Americans put the timing of industrial crisis as 1979 to 1984, in fact the most massive loss of US manufacturing jobs occurred in the 21st century: one third of US manufacturing jobs disappeared between 2001 and 2009, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. The mainstream of the economics professions argues nonetheless that loss of manufacturing jobs is not a problem for the following reasons: real industrial production rose in the United States in most years from 1983 to 2007. The argument is then that machines are replacing workers in the sense that more output is being produced by the same number of workers. In addition, the overall US labour force has increased dramatically, resulting in a massive reduction in the percent of the labour force engaged in industry (from over 35% in the late 1960s to under 20% today). Industry (and specifically manufacturing) is thus less prominent in American life and the American economy now than in over a hundred years. However, the interpretation that manufacturing employment declined as a result of replacing people with machines has not addressed the issue that US non-financial firms seriously dropped their investment in fixed capital as a percent of operating profits between 2001 and 2009 (see NIPA accounts at www.bea.gov). It appears that far from buying robots, US manufacturing firms may be buying fewer machines as well as hiring fewer workers. In general, the literature that argues loss of US manufacturing jobs is inevitable in an advanced capitalist nation does also not grapple with the prominent role of manufacturing in advanced economies such as Germany and Japan, which also tend to have unit labor costs at least as high (if not higher) than those of the United States, per the Conference Board. In fact, industry does continue in the United States, for example, there are export-competitive producers of precision technology in New England. Thus, the perception that all industry has left the United States is due to shifting patterns in the geography and political geography of production, away from metropolitan centers (such as New York, Boston, Chicago, Oakland, toward more \\"rural\\" areas (such as Georgia or New Hampshire or Utah). Since most Americans live in large cities, most Americans see empty factories, even if plants are operating well in other locations. Some argue also that the shift has been (from the heavily unionised Northeast and Midwest towards the Southeast and the high supply of workers (largely immigrant, first-generation, and second-generation) willing to accept low wages in the Southwest), along with increasing labour productivity, which has led to higher levels of output without increases in the total number of workers. Many argue that the textile industry, was the dominant factor in the industrialisation of New England, and in the 20th century increasingly textile factories were moved to the South. In recent decades the South has also lost its textile firms.David Koistinen, \\"Business and Regional Economic Decline: The Political Economy of Deindustrialization in Twentieth-Century New England\\" Business and economic history online (2014) #12 Yet it would be inaccurate to argue that the only sectors to leave New England after 1980 were labor-intensive sector such as shoes and textiles, and there are many non-union firms in New England today. Rather, even high productivity sectors in which the US might be expected to have a comparative advantage such as machine tool production departed the United States between 1980 and 1985. This is arguably because the US Federal Reserve advocated for a strong dollar policy, at precisely the moment when German and Japanese manufacturers had falling costs due to rising productivity (post WW II catch-up was complete). Under the circumstances of falling Japanese prices, for example, only a decline in the value of the US dollar could have kept US machine tools competitive. The fact that the US Federal Reserve followed precisely the opposite policy and caused the dollar to appreciate 1979 to 1984 was a death blow to New England's machine tools. In 1986, the Fed recognized its mistake and negotiated the devaluation of the dollar against the Yen and the German Mark with the Plaza Accords, but by then it was too late for many firms, which either closed, laid off hundreds, or were sold to conglomerates during the down periods.Duggan, M.C. 2017 Duggan, MC 2017 \\"Deindustrialization in the Granite State\\" in Dollars and Sense, Nov/Dec issue. Certain sectors of manufacturing remain vibrant. The production of electronic equipment has risen by over 50%, while that of clothing has fallen by over 60%. Following a moderate downturn, industrial production grew slowly but steadily between 2003 and 2007. The sector, however, averaged less than 1% growth annually from 2000 to 2007; from early 2008, moreover, industrial production again declined, and by June 2009, had fallen by over 15% (the sharpest decline since the great depression). Output thereafter began to recover.Federal Reserve The population of the United States has nearly doubled since the 1950s, adding approximately 150 million people. Yet, during this period (1950‚Äì2007), the proportion of the population living in the great manufacturing cities of the Northeast has declined significantly. During the 1950s, the nation's twenty largest cities held nearly a fifth of the US population. In 2006, this proportion has dropped to about one tenth of the population.Stephen Ohlemacher, \\"America's big cities are getting smaller\\", Associated Press Many small and mid-sized manufacturing cities in the Rust Belt experience similar fates. For instance, the city of Cumberland, Maryland, declined from a population of 39,483 in the 1940s to a population of 20,915 in 2005. The city of Detroit, Michigan, saw its population drop from a peak of 1,849,568 in 1950 to 713,777 in 2010, the largest drop in population of any major city in the U.S. (1,135,971) and the second largest drop in terms of percent of people lost (second only to St. Louis, Missouri's 62.7% drop). One of the first industries to decline was the textile industry in New England, as its factories shifted to the South. Since the 1970s, textiles have also declined in the Southeast. New England responded by developing a high-tech economy, especially in education and medicine, using its very strong educational base.David Koistinen, Confronting Decline: The Political Economy of Deindustrialization in Twentieth-Century New England (University Press of Florida; 2013) As Americans migrated away from the manufacturing centres, they formed sprawling suburbs, and many former small cities have grown tremendously in the last 50 years. In 2005 alone, Phoenix, Arizona has grown by 43,000 people, an increase in population greater than any other city in the United States. Contrast that with the fact that in 1950, Phoenix was only the 99th largest city in the nation with a population of 107,000. In 2005, the population has grown to 1.5 million, ranking as the sixth largest city proper in the US. References Further reading *Afonso, A.

Only recently has her work been recognized as that of an outstanding female Baroque artist, her works having been previously attributed to male artists, especially her brother Charles.  Biography  Born in Mons, Wautier was the youngest daughter of a family of eight children, including six boys. She shared her life with her brother, the painter Charles Wautier. Shortly after 1640, they settled in a mansion near Notre Dame de la Chapelle in Brussels.  Works  Michaelina Wautier painted in small formats as well as more ambitious canvases with as main subjects history, religion and mythology. At the time, large format paintings were still considered a preserve of male painters. Wautier multiplied representations of genre scenes, historical paintings, as well as more detailed representations of flower garlands. Her works also include a series of portraits. She was distinguished from other women painters by the diversity of her subjects and formats. Her first self-portrait, painted in 1649, was long mistakenly associated with the Italian painter Artemisia Gentileschi. It remains one of Wautier's most famous paintings. The painting is included in the 1905 book Women Painters of the World. It was not until 1672 that the painter Elisabeth-Sophie Ch√©ron produced what is considered the first female self-portrait in France. The painting named The Triumph of Bacchus (1650), now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, is often cited as one of the most representative of her works. She was familiar with masculine anatomy and painted it without shame, becoming one of the first female painters to expose a naked man. The artist depicted herself in the middle of the colourful crowd. She is the only character to look out at the viewer. Unlike many other women painters of this period, Wautier received recognition while alive. In particular, she sold four paintings to Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria for his painting gallery. The paintings are mentioned in the inventory of the collection drawn up in 1659. Michaelina Wautier in the RKD. Accessed 10 May 2018. However, her work fell into oblivion after her death. Some art historians link this absence to the attribution of her paintings to Thomas Willeboirts Bosschaert, Jacob van Oost or her brother Charles Wautier.

In 1979, a Nunawading Spectres men's team entered the National Basketball League (NBL), joining nine other teams for the league's inaugural season. In 1982, a Nunawading Spectres women's team entered the Women's National Basketball League (WNBL) for the league's second season. In 1987, the Spectres men changed their name to Eastside Spectres and spent five years under that moniker before merging with the Southern Melbourne Saints in 1992 to become the South East Melbourne Magic. During their time in the NBL, the Spectres were two-time grand finalists, losing to Launceston in 1981 and Perth in 1991. The Spectres women played 10 seasons in the WNBL and won six championships, including four in a row between 1986 and 1989.

Also before 1955 the term Triduum Sacrum, which now includes Easter Sunday and takes in only the close of Maundy Thursday, was applied to the whole of Maundy Thursday, including its matins, and excluded Easter Sunday.Frederick Aquilina, Benigno Zerafa (1726-1804) and the Neapolitan Galant Style (Boydell & Brewer, 2016), p. 74 Composers who produced polyphonic settings for the responsories in question, which are known also as the Tenebrae responsories, include Carlo Gesualdo (Responsoria et alia ad Officium Hebdomadae Sanctae spectantia, 1611, Jean L'H√©ritier, Marc-Antoine Charpentier, 19 settings (H 111 -119, H 126 - 134 and H 144), Joseph Haydn (Hob XXIIb), Jan Dismas Zelenka (ZWV 55), Max Reger, Francis Poulenc, Pierre Boulez. Composers generally set to music only some of the 27 responsories.  The responsories  Within the liturgy, each responsory followed a reading. Each day's matins was divided into three nocturns, each with three readings. Over the three days, therefore, the responsories, like the readings, came to a total of 27. They were originally sung in plainchant. Each day, the first nocturn had three readings from Jeremiah's Book of Lamentations, and the second nocturn three readings from one or other of Saint Augustine's commentaries on the Psalms. The three readings of the third nocturn were from the First Epistle to the Corinthians on Maundy Thursday, from the Epistle to the Hebrews on the other two days.Liber Usualis 1961, pp. 631‚àí773  Maundy Thursday responsories  Maundy Thursday is called in Latin Feria V/Quinta in Cena Domini (an older spelling has Coena instead of Cena), meaning Thursday (fifth day of the week) of the Lord's Supper. Compositions for its nine responsories can therefore appear under such titles as Feria V ‚Äì In Coena Domini. They can also be named by the day on which they were actually sung, as Charpentier's Les neuf r√©pons du mercredi saint (\\"The nine responsories of Holy Wednesday\\"). Responsories of the first nocturn of Maundy Thursday The three readings of the first nocturn of Maundy Thursday are Lamentations 1:1‚Äì5, 1:6‚Äì9 and 1:10‚Äì14. =In monte Oliveti= The first Maundy Thursday responsory refers to the Agony of Christ in Gethsemane at the foot of the Mount of Olives. * =Tristis est anima mea= The second responsory represents Jesus speaking to his disciples in the garden of Gethsemane.

The major shareholder of the company is the state-owned China Railway Engineering Corporation (CRECG). By revenue, CREC is the largest construction company in the world in the 2015 Engineering News-Record \\"Top 225 Global Contractors\\". In 2016, CRECG ranks in the 57th place among Fortune Global 500 Enterprises and the 7th place among Top 500 Chinese Enterprises. Business areas CREC holds a large share of the Chinese construction market and participates in many large-scale infrastructure projects overseas (especially in countries in the Southeast Asia and Africa). In addition to the core business of construction, the company does business in surveying and designing, installation, manufacturing, R&D;, technical consulting, capital management, as well as international economic and trade activities. History In November 2007, CREC announced that it would be listing A shares and H shares on the Shanghai and Hong Kong respectively. The IPO price of A share ranged from 4 to 4.8 Chinese yuan while that of H share ranged from 5.03 to 5.78 Hong Kong dollar. CREC joined the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index from 10 March 2008. In support of a cross country railway building boom in Venezuela, CREC began construction in 2009 of the Anaco-Tinaco railroad, an 800 million USD project to building a 471 km high speed railway line through the agriculture belt. This company appeared to break new ground in the European Union in 2009 when the COVEC subsidiary along with two Chinese partners were awarded the tender to construct two parts of the A2 highway in Poland. The project began well in the design and preparation stages with COVEC demonstrating \\"technical acumen\\" but work ran aground at later stages because of mismanagement within a tight regulatory framework, ending in failure for COVEC and replacement by other contractors.

The film is directed by Belgian filmmaker Bram Van Paesschen. In the documentary, the employees of the company just set up camp near the mining city of Kolwezi. The goal of CREC is to redo the road - covering 300 kilometers - that connects Kolwezi with Lubumbashi. The Chinese man Lao Yang is head of logistics of the group. Since a massive resources-for-infrastructure deal in 2007, China endeavors to take on a wide range of development projects (including roads, hospitals, schools and airports) to be paid for by Congo‚Äôs immense copper and cobalt reserves. Though a promising deal for the Congolese‚Äì the majority of whom live on less than $1.25 a day‚Äì the deal‚Äôs lack of transparency has made it the subject of scrutiny for human rights organizations. Empire of Dust examines the human aspect of this exchange. The documentary is lauded for its depiction of the cultural differences between the Chinese and Congolese employees.

The modern field of microeconomics arose as an effort of neoclassical economics school of thought to put economic ideas into mathematical mode. Traditional marginalism Classic duopoly model of Cournot: reaction functions of both firms are derived by imposing profit maximisation, the Nash equilibrium is given by intersection of R1 and R2. At equilibrium no firm has a rational self-interest in changing produced quantities. An early attempt was made by Antoine Augustine Cournot in Researches on the Mathematical Principles of the Theory of WealthA. Cournot, Researches into the mathematical principles of the theory of wealth, 1838 https://archive.org/details/researchesintom00fishgoog (1838) in describing a spring water duopoly that now bears his name.

Jevon, The Theory of Political Economy,1871 (1871), Carl Menger's Principles of EconomicsC.Menger,Principles of Economics, 1871 https://mises.org/etexts/menger/principles.asp (1871), and L√©on Walras's Elements of Pure Economics: Or the theory of social wealth (1874‚Äì77)Leon Walras, Elements of Pure Economics, 1874 https://books.google.com/books/about/Elements_of_Pure_Economics.html?id=hwjRD3z0Qy4C&redir;_esc=y gave way to what was called the Marginal Revolution. Some common ideas behind those works were models or arguments characterised by rational economic agents maximising utility under a budget constraint. This arose as a necessity of arguing against the labour theory of value associated with classical economists such as Adam Smith, David Ricardo and Karl Marx. Walras also went as far as developing the concept of general equilibrium of an economy. Alfred Marshall's textbook, Principles of Economics was published in 1890 and became the dominant textbook in England for a generation. His main point was that Jevons went too far in emphasising utility as an attempt to explain prices over costs of production. In the book he writes: In the same appendix he further states: Marshall's diagram: SS' is the supply curve, DD' is the demand curve and A is the equilibrium Marshall's idea of solving the controversy was that the demand curve could be derived by aggregating individual consumer demand curves, which were themselves based on the consumer problem of maximising utility. The supply curve could be derived by superimposing a representative firm supply curves for the factors of production and then market equilibrium would be given by the intersection of demand and supply curves. He also introduced the notion of different market periods: mainly short run and long run. This set of ideas gave way to what economists call perfect competition, now found in the standard microeconomics texts, even though Marshall himself had stated:A.Marshall, Principles of Economics, 1890, BOOK VI, CHAPTER II: PRELIMINARY SURVEY OF DISTRIBUTION, CONTINUED. One of Marshall's diagrams for monopoly: DD' is the demand curve, SS' the supply curve, QQ' is the monopoly revenue curve and q3 the maximum revenue point. Cournot had already considered the mathematics of monopoly in the Mathematical Principles of the Theory of Wealth but he draw no diagram An early formulation of the concept of production functions is due to Johann Heinrich von Th√ºnen, which presented an exponential version of it. The standard Cobb‚ÄìDouglas production function found in microeconomics textbooks refers to a collaborative paper between Charles Cobb and Paul Douglas published in 1928 in which they analysed U.S. manufacturing data using this function as the basis of a regression analysis for estimating the relationship between inputs (labour and capital) and output (product): this discussion takes place through the concept of marginal productivity. The mathematical form of the Cobb‚ÄìDouglas function can be found in the prior work of Wicksell, Th√ºnen, and Turgot. Jacob Viner presented an early procedure for constructing cost curves in his ‚ÄúCost Curves and Supply Curves‚Äù (1931), Reprinted in the paper was an attempt to reconcile two streams of thought when dealing with this issue at the time: the idea that supplies of factors of production were given and independent of rate of remuneration (Austrian School) or dependent on rate of remuneration (English School, that is followers of Marshall). Viner argued that, ‚ÄúThe differences between the two schools would not affect qualitatively the character of the findings,‚Äù more specifically, ‚Äú...that this concern is not of sufficient importance to bring about any change in the prices of the factors as a result of a change in its output.‚Äù In Viner's terminology‚Äînow considered standard‚Äîthe short run is a period long enough to permit any desired output change that is technologically possible without altering the scale of the plant‚Äîbut is not long enough to adjust the scale of the plant. He arbitrarily assumes that all factors can, for the short run, be classified in two groups: those necessarily fixed in amount, and those freely variable. Scale of plant is the size of the group of factors that are fixed in amount in the short-run, and each scale is quantitatively indicated by the amount of output that can be produced at the lowest average cost possible at that scale. Costs associated with the fixed factors are fixed costs. Those associated with the variable factors are direct costs. Note that fixed costs are fixed only in their aggregate amounts, and vary with output in their amount per unit, while direct costs vary in their aggregate amount as output varies, as well as in their amount per unit. The spreading of overhead is therefore a short-run phenomenon and not to be confused with the long-run. He explains that if the law of diminishing returns holds that output per unit of variable factor falls as total output rises, and that if the prices of the factors remain constant‚Äîthen average direct costs increase with output. Also, if atomistic competition prevails‚Äîthat is, the individual firm output won't affect product prices‚Äîthen the individual firm short-run supply curve equals the short run marginal cost curve. In the long run, the supply curve for industry can be constructed by summing individual marginal cost curves abscissas. He also explains that: *Internal economies of scale are primarily a long-run phenomenon and are due either to reductions in the technical coefficients of production (technical economies=increasing productivity by improved organisation or methods of production) or to discounts resulting from larger size (pecuniary economies). *Internal diseconomies of scale can be avoided by increasing industry output by increasing the number of plants without increasing the scale of the plant. *External economies of scale are also either technical or pecuniary, but in this case are due to the aggregate behaviour of the industry, and refer to the size of output of the industry as a whole. *External diseconomies of scale may occur if as industry output rises the unit price of factors and materials rises as well due to increasing competition for inputs with other industries. It should be made clear that these long-run results only hold if producer are rational actors, that is able to optimise their production so as to have an optimal scale of plant. Imperfect competition and game theory In 1929 Harold Hotelling published \\"Stability in Competition\\" addressing the problem of instability in the classic Cournout model: Bertrand criticised it for lacking equilibrium for prices as independent variables and Edgeworth constructed a dual monopoly model with correlated demand with also lacked stability. Hotteling proposed that demand typically varied continuously for relative prices, not discontinuously as suggested by the later authors. Following Sraffa he argued for \\"the existence with reference to each seller of groups who will deal with him instead of his competitors in spite of difference in price\\", he also noticed that traditional models that presumed the uniqueness of price in the market only made sense if the commodity was standardised and the market was a point: akin to a temperature model in physics, discontinuity in heat transfer (price changes) inside a body (market) would lead to instability. To show the point he built a model of market located over a line with two sellers in each extreme of the line, in this case maximising profit for both sellers leads to a stable equilibrium. From this model also follows that if a seller is to choose the location of his store so as to maximise his profit, he will place his store the closest to his competitor: \\"the sharper competition with his rival is offset by the greater number of buyers he has an advantage\\". He also argues that clustering of stores is wasteful from the point of view of transportation costs and that public interest would dictate more spatial dispersion. A new impetus was given to the field when around 1933 Joan Robinson and Edward H. Chamberlin, published respectively, The Economics of Imperfect Competition (1933) and The Theory of Monopolistic Competition (1933), introducing models of imperfect competition. Although the monopoly case was already exposed in Marshall's Principles of Economics and Cournot had already constructed models of duopoly and monopoly in 1838, a whole new set of models grew out of this new literature. In particular the monopolistic competition model results in a non efficient equilibrium. Chamberlin defined monopolistic competition as, \\"...challenge to traditional viewpoint of economics that competition and monopoly are alternatives and that individual prices are to be explained in terms of one or the other.\\" He continues, \\"By contrast it is held that most economic situations are composite of both competition and monopoly, and that, wherever this is the case, a false view is given by neglecting either one of the two forces and regarding the situation as made up entirely of the other.\\" Stackelberg competition represented as an extensive form game with Infinite action space. Later, some market models were built using game theory, particularly regarding oligopolies. A good example of how microeconomics started to incorporate game theory, is the Stackelberg competition model published in 1934, which can be characterised as a dynamic game with a leader and a follower, and then be solved to find a Nash Equilibrium. William Baumol provided in his 1977 paper the current formal definition of a natural monopoly where ‚Äúan industry in which multiform production is more costly than production by a monopoly‚Äù (p. 810): mathematically this equivalent to subadditivity of the cost function. He then sets out to prove 12 propositions related to strict economies of scale, ray average costs, ray concavity and transray convexity: in particular strictly declining ray average cost implies strict declining ray subadditivity, global economies of scale are sufficient but not necessary for strict ray subadditivity. In 1982 paperBaumol W., Contestable Markets: An Uprising in the Theory of Industry Structure, American Economic Review vol 72 pp. 1-15 1982 http://econ.ucdenver.edu/beckman/research/readings/baumol-contestable.pdf Baumol defined a contestable market as a market where \\"entry is absolutely free and exit absolutely costless\\", freedom of entry in Stigler sense: the incumbent has no cost discrimination against entrants. He states that a contestable market will never have an economic profit greater than zero when in equilibrium and the equilibrium will also be efficient. According to Baumol this equilibrium emerges endogenously due to the nature of contestable markets, that is the only industry structure that survives in the long run is the one which minimises total costs. This is in contrast to the older theory of industry structure since not only industry structure is not exogenously given, but equilibrium is reached without add hoc hypothesis on the behaviour of firms, say using reaction functions in a duopoly. He concludes the paper commenting that regulators that seek to impede entry and/or exit of firms would do better to not interfere if the market in question resembles a contestable market. Externalities and market failure In 1937, ‚ÄúThe Nature of the Firm‚Äù was published by Coase introducing the notion of transaction costs (the term itself was coined in the fifties), which explained why firms have an advantage over a group of independent contractors working with each other. The idea was that there were transaction costs in the use of the market: search and information costs, bargaining costs, etc., which give an advantage to a firm that can internalise the production process required to deliver a certain good to the market. A related result was published by Coase in his ‚ÄúThe Problem of Social Cost‚Äù (1960), which analyses solutions of the problem of externalities through bargaining, in which he first describes a cattle herd invading a farmer's crop and then discusses four legal cases: Sturges v Bridgman, Cooke v Forbes, Bryant v Lejever, and Bass v Gregory. He then states: This then becomes relevant in context of regulations. He argues against the Pigovian tradition: This period also marks the beginning of mathematical modelling of public goods with Samuelson's ‚ÄúThe Pure Theory of Public Expenditure‚Äù (1954), in it he gives a set of equations for efficient provision of public goods (he called them collective consumption goods), now known as the Samuelson condition. He then gives a description of what is now called the free rider problem: Used cars market: due to presence of fundamental asymmetrical information between seller and buyer the market equilibrium is not efficient; in the language of economists it is a market failure Around the 1970s the study of market failures again came into focus with the study of information asymmetry. In particular three authors emerged from this period: Akerlof, Spence, and Stiglitz. Akerlof considered the problem of bad quality cars driving good quality cars out of the market in his classic ‚ÄúThe Market for Lemons‚Äù (1970) because of the presence of asymmetrical information between buyers and sellers. Spence explained that signaling was fundamental in the labour market, because since employers can't know beforehand which candidate is the most productive, a college degree becomes a signaling device that a firm uses to select new personnel. A synthesising paper of this era is ‚ÄúExternalities in Economies with Imperfect Information and Incomplete Markets‚Äù by Stiglitz and Greenwald: the basic model consists of households that maximise a utility function, firms that maximise profit‚Äîand a government that produces nothing, collects taxes, and distributes the proceeds. An initial equilibrium with no taxes is assumed to exist, a vector x of household consumption and vector z of other variables that affect household utilities (externalities) are defined, a vector œÄ of profits is defined along with a vector E of households expenditures. Since the envelope theorem holds, if the initial non taxed equilibrium is Pareto optimal then it follows that the dot products Œ† (between œÄ and the time derivative of z) and B (between E and the time derivative of z) must equal each other. They state: One application of this result is to the already mentioned Market for Lemons, which deals with adverse selection: households buy from a pool of goods with heterogeneous quality considering only average quality, since in general the equilibrium is not efficient, any tax that raises average quality is beneficial (in the sense of optimal taxation). Other applications were considered by the authors, such as tax distortions, signaling, screening, moral hazard, incomplete markets, queue rationing, unemployment and rationing equilibrium. Behavioural economics Asymmetric value function in prospect theory: big losses have a much bigger psychological impact than big gains Kahneman and Tversky published a paper in 1979 criticising the very idea of the rational economic agent. The main point is that there is an asymmetry in the psychology of the economic agent that gives a much higher value to losses than to gains. This article is usually regarded as the beginning of behavioural economics and has consequences particularly regarding the world of finance. The authors summed the idea in the abstract as follows: Great Recession and executive compensation More recently, the Great Recession and the ongoing controversy on executive compensation brought the principal‚Äìagent problem again to the centre of debate, in particular regarding corporate governance and problems with incentive structures.

Miller and written by Umair Aleem. The film stars Kellan Lutz, Bruce Willis, Gina Carano, D. B. Sweeney, Dan Bilzerian and Steve Coulter. The film was released on December 18, 2015, in a limited release, and through video on demand by Lionsgate Premiere. Plot In 2005, undercover CIA operative Leonard Turner (Bruce Willis) is held captive and interrogated by a group of unidentified Russian arms dealers. His interrogators have been aware of Leonard's true identity and demand a full written list of individuals and businesses affiliated with the CIA in exchange for the safety of his wife and son. Leonard breaks from captivity and kills his interrogators, phoning his colleague Ken Robertson (D.B. Sweeney) to get his family to safety. Leonard's wife, Kate, was fatally shot by the interrogator's affiliates, while his teenage son, Harry (Nathan Varnson) hesitates on shooting the home invaders before being rescued by Robertson. In 2015, an adult Harry (Kellan Lutz) joins the CIA's Prague branch under Robertson's wing much to Leonard's disapproval. While working as an analyst, Harry undergoes numerous field agent training sessions only to be rejected repeatedly by Leonard behind the scenes. Meanwhile, Leonard is given an undercover assignment to recover an item called The Condor, a mobile computer capable of hacking the entire global telecommunications infrastructure that can only be deactivated with a physical key. While Leonard attempts to recover the device in Newark, New Jersey, he is ambushed and captured by arms dealer Drake Chivu (Joshua Mickel). C.I.A. Director Theodore Sitterson (Steve Coulter) is brought up to speed on the recent development and assigns field agent Victoria Phair (Gina Carano) to recover The Condor while keeping Harry out of the investigation. Incensed, Harry breaks free from his security escort led by Higgins (Dan Bilzerian) and flies to Newark in order to investigate Drake's associates. Harry's first visit is to a biker bar known for its business association with Drake. After instigating a fight and interrogating the patrons, Harry learns that Drake's brother is the lead mechanic at a local garage. Harry also encounters Phair, having previously parted from a romantic relationship on bad terms during their training. Harry only agrees to return after helping her recover the Condor and after rescuing Leonard. After interrogating Drake's brother, Harry and Phair learn that Drake is holding a party in a local nightclub. Enlisting Phair's roommate, Kris (Lydia Hull), Harry and Phair enter the nightclub. Meanwhile, Sitterson reviews Leonard's video-recorded ransom and prepares an assassin for deployment in suspicion of Harry having committed treason, much to Robertson's dismay. The assassin ambushes Harry in the nightclub's restroom while Drake captures Phair. Maintaining contact with their communications earpiece, Phair gives clues to Harry while he and Kris try to locate Drake's car. The final destination leads them to an abandoned factory, where Harry is tranquilized by Drake himself before being reunited with Leonard. Harry regains consciousness and is reunited with his father, only to find himself questioned on the people aware of Harry's whereabouts. Harry only confides that he told Robertson about his last known location, with Leonard's approval. At this point, Leonard reveals to his son that he went rogue and allied himself with Drake in order to draw out the people interested in recovering the Condor, as well as the perpetrators and CIA mole responsible for Kate's death. During the business deal, Leonard demonstrates the Condor's capabilities by sabotaging China's electronics infrastructure before double- crossing the Russian customers. The Russian customers have been revealed to be responsible for purchasing Leonard's personal information and ordering Kate's death, while Leonard has Harry fatally shoot the Russian ringleader. After seemingly tying up the loose end, Robertson and Higgins intercept the Turners, with Robertson revealing himself and Sitterson as the moles responsible for Leonard's blown cover, and also responsible for the recent assassination attempt on Harry. Robertson shoots Leonard in the stomach. Phair breaks free from captivity and shoots at Drake's henchmen while Higgins engages Drake in hand-to-hand combat. Harry engages in a car chase with Robertson and fatally wounds him with a vehicle collision. Shortly after recovering the Condor, Harry destroys the device with an assault rifle to prevent it from falling to enemy hands and mourns his father's death before leaving the scene with Higgins, Phair, and Kris. During the aftermath, Harry gives Phair a phone call to rekindle their romance before killing Drake with a car bomb.

His hermitage, on an island in the river Reie, lay at the basis of the later Eekhout Abbey. Very little is known about him.

Composition The band is led by three former members of the Billy Joel Band: multi-instrumentalist Richie Cannata, drummer/percussionist Liberty DeVitto, and guitarist Russell Javors. David Clark of the Joel tribute band \\"Songs in the Attic\\" mans the piano and provides lead vocals, Malcolm Gold plays bass in place of the late Doug Stegmeyer, Dennis DelGaudio plays guitar and Doug Kistner plays keyboards in the group.http://www.lordsof52ndst.com/malcolm-gold/ History Cannata, DeVitto, Javors, and the late bassist Doug Stegmeyer composed the core Joel recording and touring band from 1976 (when the Turnstiles album was recorded) until 1981 (after the end of the Glass Houses tour), save for Javors' absence from the recording of The Stranger in 1977. (Cannata stayed until 1981, returning for the River of Dreams recording sessions in 1993. Javors and Stegmeyer remained until 1988 and DeVitto stayed until 2006.) Four of the five Joel albums released during the foursome's 1976-1981 tenure reached the top ten on the Billboard charts: The Stranger, 52nd Street, Glass Houses, and the live Songs in the Attic. All four albums were produced by Phil Ramone and all four were critically acclaimed. The late Ramone wrote that the \\"Lords\\" nickname developed during the recording of 52nd Street in 1978. Because the album had a jazz mood‚ÄìManhattan's 52nd Street had been the center of New York City's jazz scene in the mid-Twentieth Century‚Äìit featured an \\"all-star\\" line- up of jazz soloists as guest artists. The guests and Joel's band clicked so well during the recording sessions that the group garnered the nickname \\"The Lords of 52nd Street\\" from Ramone. The video for the 52nd Street track \\"My Life\\" has shots of Cannata, DeVitto, Joel, and Stegmeyer strutting down Manhattan streets together on their way to their recording studio on the titular street. DeVitto has stated that jackets were even made to cement the identity, but the \\"Lords\\" name was not formalized while the group was working directly with Joel. The Lords of 52nd Street's status as an official group was established after Cannata, DeVitto, and Javors reunited at the October 23, 2014 ceremony in which they (with Stegmeyer, posthumously) were inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame, primarily for their work with Joel. During the ceremony, the three performed a short set of Joel hits that they had helped create. The performance included the songs \\"Scenes from an Italian Restaurant\\" (from The Stranger), \\"Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)\\" (from Turnstiles), and \\"You May Be Right\\" (from Glass Houses). It was the first time in more than 25 years that the three had shared a stage to perform from Joel's catalogue. Touring The band continued to perform, playing faithful renditions of the recorded originals. Although delayed by Cannata's 2015 diagnosis with lymphoma (from which he is in remission), a tour began in February 2016, opening at The Space in Westbury, New York.

This story was used as the basis for the 2004 film Hotel Rwanda, in which Tatiana was portrayed by Sophie Okonedo, who was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Tatiana.The Rwandan hero accessed 3/22/2015 Personal life and the genocide She was born Tatiana Mukangamije in Butare.

At the time, Paul was married to his wife, Esther, and he had three children, daughters Lys and Diane and son Roger. Esther and Paul soon divorced, and in 1989, Tatiana and Paul married. His ex-wife Esther is now deceased and Tatiana is stepmother to their children. They also had a son together, Tresor. She also gave birth to a daughter with Paul, that died a few days after birth. Paul and Tatiana are also the legal guardians of Anais and Karine, who are the children of Tatiana's brother Thomas and his wife Fedens, who had gone missing during the genocide against Tutsi in RwandaBeyond Brave accessed 3/22/2015 When Tatiana was working as a nurse, she was facing discrimination because of her Tutsi ethnicity, and Paul arranged for her to be transferred to a different location in Kigali, where Paul was the manager of a hotel called the H√¥tel des Mille Collines. Tatiana's mother was murdered in the genocide along with other family members and their bodies were thrown into a pit with many others. Her father paid to be killed by shooting, so that he did not have to die a more painful and horrific death. Her father had forged all of her family's identification cards to say that they were Hutu; however, the militia had other ways of tracking who was who. Two of her siblings survived the genocide.Rusesabagina's testimony accessed 3/22/2015 Tatiana's family was targeted specifically because they were Tutsi, which the Hutu people were killing in mass in an attempt to make the Tutsi extinct. The conflict between these two ethnic groups goes back centuries in Rwanda. Paul's family was of mixed Hutu and Tutsi which meant he was not as much of a target as a full blood Tutsi.An ordinary man accessed 3/22/2015 Paul was initially at the hotel himself, and later had Tatiana come to the hotel for safety with the children. He tried to smuggle them out of the country hidden in a truck that would take them to the airport, but the militia figured out their plan. Tatiana was a specific target of brutal beatings because the militia knew that she was the Tutsi wife of the hotel manager, and she barely escaped death and made it back to the hotel, where she was bed-ridden for several days because of her injuries. The people taking shelter inside of the hotel were all saved because of Rusesabagina's careful diplomacy with the government, which included bribing them so they would not enter the hotel and harm anyone.Paul Rusesabagina biography accessed 3/22/2015 Once they were able to leave the hotel, Paul and Tatiana went to a refugee camp to begin looking for friends and family. It was there that they were reunited with Tatiana's brother's two daughters, who were starving and covered in dirt when they were found.country disowns hotel hero accessed 3/22/2015 Later life The family escaped to Tanzania and later settled in Brussels, Belgium, where they received frequent threats. Tatiana currently lives in San Antonio, Texas, as Paul did. Paul was given the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005 by George W. Bush, with Tatiana by his side. The family is still active as advocates for genocide survivors and for the betterment of the Tutsi people in Rwanda.

Working at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, Yankauer was among the first surgeons to specialize in problems of the ear, nose and throat. A common medical suction device, the Yankauer suction tip, is named for him. Early life Yankauer was born in New York. His parents were German Jewish immigrants to the United States. He completed undergraduate studies at the City College of New York. He graduated from the College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1893. Career Following an internship at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, he took a position there. He worked with outpatient surgery patients for several years. Though otolaryngology was in its infancy, he increasingly focused on problems of the ear, nose and throat. During World War I, Yankauer served as a United States Army major in France, where he worked at a hospital largely staffed by Mount Sinai personnel. A story from the hospital in France spoke to Yankauer's ingenuity, and it was told at Mount Sinai for many years. Yankauer and Dr. Howard Lilienthal were working when the quartermaster accidentally locked a safe with the key inside it; the safe contained all the men's money. Yankauer devised a new key so that the safe could be opened and the money retrieved. Yankauer was president of the Mount Sinai Alumni Association in 1916. In 1917, laryngology was established as its own department at Mount Sinai with six surgical ward beds, and Yankauer was named its director. He was known for his skill at bronchoscopy; in 1905, he had been the first physician in New York City to use the procedure to remove a foreign body from a patient's airway. Innovations Modern version of the Yankauer suction tip Known for his medical innovations, Yankauer devised a suction device for the mouth known as the Yankauer suction tip. The device remains in use in modern medical settings. Yankauer helped to design several varieties of wire-mesh anesthesia masks, which were known as the Yankauer mask, the Yankauer-Gwathmey mask, and the modified Yankauer-Gwathmey mask. He was president of the American Broncho- Esophagological Association in 1927. Personal Yankauer's wife, Grace Prior, was also an otolaryngologist and the couple shared an office. She died in 1914 after falling out of a window at the couple's tenth floor apartment on Park Avenue. Yankauer married Margaret Kearns, a Mount Sinai nursing administrator, in 1919. They had one child. Yankauer died of heart disease at Mount Sinai Hospital in 1932.

It was commissioned by Maharajah Jagatjit Singh, the last ruler of Kapurthala. Kapurthala city, was then the capital city of the Kapurthala State, known as 'Mini Paris of Punjab' and the mosque was stated to be one of the best in South-east Asia. The mosque is a national monument protected by the Archaeological Survey of India. Location The mosque is situated in Kapurthala about from Jalandhar. kapurthala is also the nearest rail head to the mosque. History The mosque was built by Maharaja Jagatjit Singh, the last ruler of Kapurthala. He was ruler with extravagant tastes but known for the developmental activities implemented in the then Kapurthala State. He was renowned for his secular credentials. The Maharaja, a Sikh, who built it, believed in catering to the aspirations of his largely Muslim subjects (about 60%). The mosque was his ambitious effort to promote social integration among his people, and this is proved by the fact that when the then Viceroy of India sent him a letter questioning him on the large costs involved in building it, the Maharaja replied: \\"Your Excellency may be unaware that 60 per cent of my population my loyal Muslim subjects. It is only in the fitness of things that the best place of worship in my state be constructed for them\\". The mosque was built to the architectural design of the French architect Monsieur M. Manteaux, who had also designed the Jagatjit Palace in the city. Construction was started in 1927 and completed in 1930 and built at a cost of Rs 600,000. The mosque was inaugurated by Nawab Sadiq Mohammed Khan Bahadur, the Nawab of Bhawalpur. An inscription on the mosque also states that it was built in a period of four years. Features Facade of the Moorish Mosque in Kapurthala The mosque's architectural design is a replication of the Koutoubia Mosque in Marrakesh in Morocco. The art work of the inner dome is attributed to the artists of the Mayo School of Art, Lahore. Architecturally the mosque is very elegant and is built with marble stones. Its uniqueness lies in the fact that unlike other mosques in India it is built without any external domes or minarets but has a tall tower at one end of the edifice. The mosque's inner courtyard is paved entirely with marble, and has a unique design. Glass panes have been fitted in the arched sections of the doors, windows and other artistic feature. Wooden grills are provided in the interior while latticed iron work form the external features. The mosque is painted in light red colour. However, the doors and windows and eves are painted in green colour. In the interior of the mosque, the wooden ceiling is varnished in black and red colours. A model of the mosque was designed by Monsier Mantout and was exquisitely crafted in wood. This was presented to Mantout by the Maharaja on 14 March 1930. Restoration In 1972, as part of the operation \\"city beautification\\" programme initiated by the state government at the suggestion of then Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi, the mosque was cleaned up and a rose garden laid in its front lawn. The mosque is now in a rundown condition with growth of wild grass in its back yards. The garden is also in a neglected state. The last time some renovation was done on the mosque was when APJ Abdul Kalam, President of India visited the mosque, in late 2013, to offer prayers. The status of the mosque was studied by the Archaeological Survey of India to assess the extent of renovation required in the mosque. A Detailed Project report was to be prepared identifying required renovations.

Some game larders had separate rooms for small and large game. A stone or slate floor helped to cool the room. By the early 20th century, refrigeration via cooling pipes was employed. Game larders were sometimes combined with other outbuildings, especially ice houses, as for example at Elvaston Castle in Derbyshire and the Raith Estate in Fife. In central Europe, ice houses were themselves sometimes used for storing deer carcasses.Buxbaum T. \\"Commercial Icehouses\\" in Icehouses (Shire Publications; 2014) () Timber example at Audley End House, Essex John Claudius Loudon describes a small game larder in 1842: Game larder at Uppark, Sussex Rails or beams were used to support deer on hooks, with roof-suspended racks, sometimes on pulleys, for small game.Sambrook P.

She was a left- wing Gaullist, a feminist, and was active in many committees on social issues. Early years Solange Louise Troisier was born in the 16th arrondissement of Paris on 19 July 1919. Her father was Jean Troisier (1881‚Äì1945), professor of pulmonary tuberculosis at Laennec Hospital, a member of the National Academy of Medicine and laboratory director at the Pasteur Institute. Her grandfather was Charles √âmile Troisier (1844‚Äì1919), another eminent doctor. Her mother was born Genevi√®ve Emile-Ollivier. On her mother's side she was granddaughter of √âmile Ollivier (1825‚Äì1913), the last minister of Napoleon III during the more liberal final phase of the Second French Empire. He was the son of D√©mosth√®ne Ollivier (1799‚Äì1884), a socialist in the July Monarchy and the French Second Republic who was imprisoned several times for his views. Solange Troisier studied at the Lyc√©e Victor Hugo, Paris and the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Paris. She obtained the certificat d'√©tudes physiques, chimiques et biologiques (PCB) and undertook her medical studies during World War II (1939‚Äì45). After the German occupation she joined the Eleuth√®re network of the French Resistance. In January 1945 she became a doctor-lieutenant in General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny's office of the French First Army. She was then engaged as a doctor for the irregular Colonne Fabien led by Pierre Georges (\\"Fabien\\"), which was attached to the regular army. She participated in the campaign in France and Germany and performed her first amputation on the battlefield. She received the Croix de guerre from General Fran√ßois de Linares (1897‚Äì1955), but refused the Legion of Honour because so many who deserved it more had died. Career Troisier became an intern in 1948, then an assistant in 1955 in the H√¥pitaux de Paris. She was clinical director at the Faculty of Medicine of Paris from 1952, and in 1955 became a gynecological surgeon in Paris. She served as an expert to the tribunals of the Court of Cassation. Troisier set up in private practice where she specialized in obstetrics and the care of newborns, and became involved in social aspects of medicine. She traveled widely, usually with Princess Marie Bonaparte (1882‚Äì1962), great- grand-niece of the emperor Napoleon and an advocate of Freudian psychoanalysis. In 1962 she began a career as a prison doctor, and set up a gynecological consultation at La Petite Roquette. Troisier was a great admirer of General Charles de Gaulle, who had given women the vote, and adhered to the left wing of Gaullism. From 1968 to 1973 Troisier was deputy for Sarcelles in the Val-d'Oise department as a member of the Union of Democrats for the Republic. She was vice-president of the Committee on Cultural, Family and Social Affairs (1968‚Äì69). In the National Assembly she supported the education reforms of Edgar Faure, social spending, parental rights, equal pay for men and women, the fight against drugs and alcohol, reform of the 1920 Abortion Act and abolition of the monopoly of undertakers. As a doctor treating women prisoners Troisier became aware of the appalling conditions in which they were incarcerated, and began a crusade for prison reform. This led to her being appointed Medical Inspector General of the Prison Service in 1973. She was made a knight of the Legion of Honor in 1974. She set up psychological medical centers in each region and placed a psychiatrist in each prison. She was Medical Inspector General of Prisons until 1983. That year she was the star witness in a trial that revealed a profitable traffic in pardons for common criminals. She was relieved of her position. She eventually became as Grand Officer of the Legion of Honor. Solange Troisier died in Saint-Hymer, Calvados on 9 September 2008, aged 89. Committees Solange Troisier served on numerous committees and organizations. She was: *Member of the Committee of study and information on alcoholism (1969‚Äì83) *Honorary Professor of Forensic Medicine and Prison Medicine at Lariboisi√®re Hospital (1977‚Äì86) *President of the National Association of Midwives (1970‚Äì83) *President of the National Council of French Women (CNFF: Conseil national des femmes fran√ßaises) (1976‚Äì91). *Member of the Supreme Council of Sexual Information, Birth Control and Family Education (from 1974) *Member of the national council of the Rally for the Republic (RPR: Rassemblement pour la R√©publique) *President (1977‚Äì96) and honorary president of the International Council of Prison Medical Services *Member of the Economic and Social Council *Member of the National Consultative Ethics Committee for Life Sciences and Health (1996‚Äì2000) *Member of the National Council of the Rhine and Danube [Conseil national de Rhin et Danube) (from 1982) Publications * * References Sources  Category:1919 births Category:2008 deaths Category:Politicians from Paris Category:Union of Democrats for the Republic politicians Category:Deputies of the 4th National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic Category:French gynaecologists Category:Women members of the National Assembly (France) Category:20th-century French women politicians Category:French military doctors Category:French healthcare managers ","title":"Solange Troisier"},{"id":"46195264","text":"The Mowchadz ; ) is a river in Belarus, a left tributary of the Neman.

It was launched at 13:26:47 UTC on 9 December 2016 aboard H-IIB launch vehicle from Tanegashima Space Center.  Spacecraft  Major changes from previous Kounotori include: * Built-in payloads to demonstrate new technologies: SFINKS and KITE, described below. * Reduction of primary batteries to 6 from the previous 7. * Reduction of solar cell panels to 48 from previous 49. * Omission of some of navigation/position lights which were Earth-side when approaching to ISS. * Strengthened EP (Exposed Pallet) maximum payload to 1900 kg from the previous 1600 kg to carry Lithium-ion batteries. SFINKS (Solar Cell Film Array Sheet for Next Generation on Kounotori Six) will test thin film solar cells in space.  Kounotori Integrated Tether Experiment  KITE (Kounotori Integrated Tether Experiment) was an experimental electrodynamic tether (EDT). The tether was equipped with a 20 kg end-mass, and would have been 700 m long when deployed. A maximum current of 10 mA was planned to run through the tether. Kounotori's ISS rendezvous sensor would have been utilized to measure how the end-mass moves during the test. The EDT experiment was scheduled following Kounotori 6's departure from the ISS, with a planned duration of one week. After the experiment, the tether would have been separated before the spacecraft proceeds with the de-orbit maneuvers. The main objective of this experiment were the orbital demonstration of both extending an uncoated bare-tether, and driving electric currents through the EDT. These two technologies will contribute to gaining capabilities to remove space debris.  Cargo  Kounotori 6 carries about 5900 kg of cargo (including the support structure weight), consisting of 3900 kg in PLC (Pressurized Logistics Carrier) and 1900 kg in ULC (Unpressurized Logistics Carrier). Cargo in the pressurized compartment includes 30 bags filled with potable water (600 liters), food, crew commodities, CDRA Bed (Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly), TPF (Two-Phase Flow) experiment unit, PS- TEPC (Position-Sensitive Tissue Equivalent Proportional Chamber) radiation measurement instrument, ExHAM (Exposed Experiment Handrail Attachment Mechanism), HDTV-EF2 high-definition and 4K camera, new J-SSOD (JEM Small Satellite Orbital Deployer), and CubeSats (AOBA-Velox III, TuPOD which comprises two TubeSats (Tancredo-1 and OSNSAT), EGG, ITF-2, STARS-C, FREEDOM, WASEDA-SAT3). Cargo by NanoRacks includes TechEdSat-5, CubeRider, RTcMISS, NREP-P DM7, four Lemur-2. Additionally, the Blue SPHERES satellite of the MIT Space Systems Laboratory is being returned to the ISS for continued autonomous systems research. Cargo in the unpressurized compartment consists of six lithium-ion batteries and their associated adapter plates to replace existing nickel-hydrogen batteries of the International Space Station. Since each of the new lithium-ion battery has a capability equivalent to two of the current nickel-hydrogen batteries, the six new batteries will replace twelve old batteries, out of the 48 existing batteries of the ISS. On departure from the ISS, Kounotori 6 carries 9 out of the 12 replaced old batteries which will be disposed of by destructive reentry into Earth's atmosphere. The 3 remaining old batteries stay on the ISS.  Operation   Launch  On 26 July 2016, the launch was scheduled for 30 September 2016, but on 10 August 2016, postponement was announced due to the leak from piping. The H-IIB launch vehicle carrying Kounotori 6 lifted off at 13:26:47 UTC on 9 December 2016, and 15 minutes 11 seconds later, Kounotori 6 was released into initial 200 √ó 300 km orbit. SFINKS experiment payload began the data collection at 14:16, on 9 December 2016, but it stopped unexpectedly after 509 seconds. After a series of orbital manoeuvres, Kounotori 6 arrived to the proximity of ISS and captured by SSRMS (Canadarm2) at 10:39 (10:37 according to NASA), on 13 December 2016. Kounotori was bolted to the CBM (Common Berthing Mechanism) of the Harmony nadir port by 13:48 UTC.  Operation while berthed to ISS  Berthing operation completed at 18:24, on 13 December 2016 UTC, and the hatch opened at 19:44 UTC. Since 07:44, 14 December 2016, Exposed Pallet (EP) was extracted from Unpressurised Logistics Carrier (ULC) of Kounotori 6 by SSRMS and transferred to Payload and ORU Accommodation (POA). After a combination of two Extra-Vehicular Activities and robotic operations, the lithium-ion battery units and adapter plates were installed. The Exposed Pallet carrying old Nickel-hydrogen battery units was returned to Kounotori 6's Unpresurised Logistics Carrier on 23 January 2017.  Departure from the ISS and re-entry to the Earth atmosphere  SSRMS grappled and detached Kounotori 6 from the CBM of Harmony nadir port at 10:59, 27 January 2017, and Kounotori 6 was released at 15:45, on 27 January 2017. Following the undocking after moving to a safe distance from ISS, the Kounotori 6 was to demonstrate the \\"Kounotori Integrated Tether Experiment\\" (KITE) using electrodynamic tether to demonstrate space debris removal technology. This experiment was planned for seven days before reentry to the Earth's atmosphere. On 31 January 2017, media reported some problems in extending the tether, bringing to doubt the experiment's success. A series of deorbit manoeuvres were performed at 08:42, 10:12, and 14:42 UTC, on 5 February 2017. Kounotori 6 reentered to Earth atmosphere over southern Pacific Ocean around 15:06 UTC, on 5 February 2017.

It stresses the superiority of a simpler rural life as opposed to the complexity of city life. Classical era Greece and Rome In Greece, Hesiod, Aristotle, and Xenophon promoted agrarian ideas. Even more influential were such Roman thinkers as Cato, Cicero, Horace, and Virgil. They all praised the virtues of a life devoted to the tilling of the soil.Pitirim A. Sorokin, et al., eds. A systematic source book in rural sociology (1930) vol 1 pp. 24‚Äì52Paul H. Johnstone, \\"Turnips and Romanticism,\\" Agricultural History, Vol. 12, No. 3 (Jul., 1938), pp. 224‚Äì255 in JSTOR China Agriculturalism (Ëæ≤ÂÆ∂/ÂÜúÂÆ∂; Nongjia) was an early agrarian social and political philosophy in ancient China that advocated peasant utopian communalism and egalitarianism. The philosophy is founded on the notion that human society originates with the development of agriculture, and societies are based upon \\"people's natural propensity to farm.\\" The Agriculturalists believed that the ideal government, modeled after the semi-mythical governance of Shennong, is led by a benevolent king, one who works alongside the people in tilling the fields. The Agriculturalist king is not paid by the government through its treasuries; his livelihood is derived from the profits he earns working in the fields, not his leadership. Unlike the Confucians, the Agriculturalists did not believe in the division of labour, arguing instead that the economic policies of a country need to be based upon an egalitarian self sufficiency. The Agriculturalists supported the fixing of prices, in which all similar goods, regardless of differences in quality and demand, are set at exactly the same, unchanging price. They encouraged farming and agriculture and taught farming and cultivation techniques, as they believed that agricultural development was the key to a stable and prosperous society. The philosopher Mencius once criticised its chief proponent Xu Xing (Ë®±Ë°å) for advocating that rulers should work in the fields with their subjects. One of Xu's students is quoted as having criticized the duke of Teng in a conversation with Mencius by saying: ‚ÄòA worthy ruler feeds himself by ploughing side by side with the people, and rules while cooking his own meals. Now Teng on the contrary possesses granaries and treasuries, so the ruler is supporting himself by oppressing the people‚Äô. 18th and 19th centuries Physiocrats Physiocracy was a French agrarian philosophy that originated in the 18th century. The movement was particularly dominated by Fran√ßois Quesnay (1694‚Äì1774) and Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot (1727‚Äì1781).Steiner (2003) p62 The Physiocrats were partially influenced by Chinese agrarianism; leading physiocrats like Fran√ßois Quesnay were avid Confucianists that advocated China's agrarian policies. 18th- and 19th-century Europeans and Americans Borrowing from the French Physiocrats the idea that all wealth originates with the land, making farming the only truly productive enterprise, agrarianism claims that agriculture is the foundation of all other professions. Philosophically, European agrarianism reflects the ideas of John Locke, who declared in his Second Treatise of Civil Government (1690) that those who work the land are its rightful owners. His labor theory of value influenced the thinking of Thomas Jefferson, who in turn shaped the way many 19th-century American homesteaders understood ownership of their farms. Jefferson wrote in 1785 in a letter to John Jay that The political philosopher James Harrington influenced the development of explicit agrarian designs for the colonies of Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Georgia. James Edward Oglethorpe, who founded Georgia in 1733, implemented a comprehensive physical, social, and economic development plan organised around the central concept of \\"agrarian equality.\\" The Oglethorpe Plan allocated land in grants of equal size, prohibited acquisition of additional land through marriage or acquisition, and prohibited slavery for moral reasons as well as to prevent the formation of large plantations like those that existed in neighbouring South Carolina.Wilson, Thomas D. The Oglethorpe Plan: Enlightenment Design in Savannah and Beyond. Charlottesville, VA: University of Virginia Press, 2012, pp. 50, 57-59, 70-71, 187-192. Richard Hofstadter has traced the sentimental attachment to the rural way of life, which he describes as \\"a kind of homage that Americans have paid to the fancied innocence of their origins.\\" Hofstadter notes that to call this a \\"myth\\" is not to imply that the idea is simply false. Rather the myth so effectively informs an agrarian ethos that it profoundly influences people's ways of perceiving values and hence their behaviour. He emphasises the importance of the agrarian myth in American politics and life even after industrialisation revolutionised the American economy and life. He stresses the significance of the writings of Jefferson and his followers in the South, such as John Taylor of Caroline in the development of agricultural fundamentalism.Richard Hofstadter, The Age of Reform (1955) American politicians, for example, boasted of their agrarian or log-cabin origins, and praised the republicanism of the yeoman farmers.W. Burlie Brown, \\"The Cincinnatus Image in Presidential Politics,\\" Agricultural History Vol. 31, No. 1 (Jan., 1957), pp. 23‚Äì29 in JSTOR In the late 18th and early 19th century, agrarianism felt the influence of the European Romanticism movement. Romantics focused attention on the individual and described nature as a spiritual force. At a time when pristine wilderness was becoming scarce in many parts of Europe, what constitutes ‚Äúnature‚Äù was confused with the last remnants of wilderness‚Äîcultivated fields, managed woodlands, and cultivated livestock and crops. As someone in constant contact with (this watered-down version of) ‚Äúnature‚Äù, the farmer was positioned to experience moments that transcend the mundane material world. In doing so, these thinkers managed to redefine nature in the human image, accommodating enclosure with a new ‚Äúdomesticated‚Äù version of nature.  Ireland Agrarian Rebellions In Ireland, many agrarian rebellions occurred during the 18th and the 19th century because of the discontented rural landless Catholics. The first outbreaks occurred in 1711 to 1713, when a group called the ‚ÄòHoughers‚Äô slaughtered many sheep and cattle owned by landlords. This event became widespread and affected many other western counties in Ireland. However, the actions taken by the ‚ÄòHoughers‚Äô didn't produce any successors and did not create a tradition for peasant revolt. It took almost 50 years to see another agrarian rebellion in Ireland. This time the Whiteboy movement led the outbreak between 1761‚Äì65. This particular outbreak created a tradition of peasant protest throughout the provinces of Munster and Leinster. The first operations of the Whiteboys succeeded but did not have a long-lasting effect. The Whiteboys caused a second outbreak between 1769 and 1776. The outbreak started slowly but intensified quickly. At the same time, the Hearts of Steel and the Steelboys, who were also agrarian movements, led outbreaks in other parts of Ireland. The main goals of the Whiteboy movement were to short- circuit the judicial system, lower the price of the rents and the reduction of the tithe on potatoes and corn.James S. Donnelly, Irish Agrarian Rebellion: The Whiteboys of 1769-76 (Royal Irish Academy, 83C, 1983), pp. 293-296. In the late 18th century and early 19th century, the competition for potato land was extremely high in Ireland. This competition over land led to a lot of agrarian violence.James S. Donnelly, The Great Irish Potato Famine (Gloucestershire, The History Press, 2012, p. 4. In the 1820s, a new agrarian movement was created in Ireland called the Rockites. This newly formed movement was one of the most violent agrarian movements that Ireland has ever seen in its history. They would commit murder and use incendiary weapons in warfare. Most of their support came from the poor population. The actions taken by the Rockites led to the reinforcement of military presence in Ireland. Many observers believe that the creation of the Rockite movement occurred because of a single man called Alexander Hoskins. Alexander Hoskins owned over 34,000 acres of land around the small town of Newcastle West. People complained that he managed the land poorly and with irregularity. During 1821‚Äì22, Ireland went into an agricultural crisis, which led to an economic disaster that largely affected the rural population. However, the main reason why the Rockites took violent action in Ireland was to fight against those who owned economic survival. The competition for land at that time was very intense and the Rockites showed that the poor population would do anything to obtain some.James S. Donnelly, \\"Captain Rock: The Origins of the Irish Agrarian Rebellion of 1821-24,\\" New Hibernia Review (2007) 11#1 pp. 47-72. 20th century In the 1910s and 1920s, agrarianism garnered significant popular attention, but was eclipsed after 1945 as Agrarian movements were suppressed behind the Iron Curtain. It revived somewhat in conjunction with the environmental movement, and has been drawing an increasing number of adherents. Central and Eastern Europe Eastern European theorists include Pyotr Stolypin (1862‚Äì1911) and Alexander ChayanovFrank Bourgholtzer, \\"Aleksandr Chayanov And Russian Berlin,\\" Journal of Peasant Studies, July 1999, Vol. 26 Issue 4, pp. 13‚Äì53 (1888‚Äì1939) in Russia; Adolph Wagner (1835‚Äì1917), and Karl Oldenberg in Germany,Kenneth D.

Cottam, \\"Boleslaw Limanowski, A Polish Theoretician Of Agrarian Socialism,\\" Slavonic and East European Review, Jan 1973, Vol. 51 Issue 122, pp. 58‚Äì74 In Russia the intellectuals of the \\"Populists\\" (Narodnaya VolyaIsaiah Berlin, \\"The Populists' Moral Condemnation of Russia Political and Social Systems,\\" in Arthur E. Adams, ed. Problems of European Civilization: Imperial Russia after 1861 (1965)) and, later, the Socialist-Revolutionary Party developed a theoretical basis for a peasant movement, building a rich, well-developed humanistic ideology which influenced eastern Europe, especially the Balkans. It never attained the international visibility among peasants that socialism did among the urban workers.Hannu Immonen, The Agrarian Program of the Russian Socialist Revolutionary Party, 1900‚Äì1911 (1988). In Poland Boles≈Çaw Limanowski thought deeply about Agrarianism and worked out an eclectic program that fit Polish conditions. His practical experience as a farm manager combined with socialist, \\"single-tax,\\" and Slavic communal ideas shaped his world view. He proposed a form of agrarian socialism with large state farms to counteract the inefficiency of very small holdings. In independent Poland he advocated expropriation of gentry estates. His observation of peasant individualism convinced him that Poland should combine voluntary collectivism and individual possession of the leased land. His pragmatism left room even for private peasant ownership, despite his Marxism.K.J. Cottam, \\"Boleslaw Limanowski, A Polish Theoretician of Agrarian Socialism,\\" Slavonic and East European Review (1973) 51#122 pp. 58‚Äì74 in JSTOR  Canada  The most important Canadian theorist was an American immigrant, Henry Wise Wood, president of the United Farmers of Alberta (UFA) during that movement's time as the governing party of the province (1921‚Äì1935). He, as did many Canadian farmers of the era, conceived of farmers as a distinct social class in the midst of a class struggle against capitalists who owned the Canada's banks, railways, and grain trading companies. His solution was a kind of corporatism called \\"group government\\". In this scheme, people would be represented in government by a party or organization that defended the interests of their particular occupation or industry, not a particular ideology. On the basis of this philosophy the UFA, as the representative of the farmers as a class, ran candidates only in rural area and not in the cities. Instead they urged their urban sympathisers to vote for Labour candidates, as the representatives of the urban working class. This type of farmer-labour co-operation became common throughout Western Canada, leading to the creation of the short-lived Progressive Party of Canada in the 1920s, and the more durable Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (Farmer-Labour-Socialist) in Calgary, Alberta, in 1935, precursor to Canada's modern-day social democratic party, the New Democratic Party.Jeffery M. Taylor, \\"The Language of Agrarianism in Manitoba, 1890‚Äì1925,\\" Labour / Le Travail, Spring 1989, Vol. 23, pp. 91‚Äì118 Demeritt (1995) argues that in British Columbia (and Canada generally), there were three overlapping agrarian viewpoints. Arcadianism was based on nostalgic memories of rural England, and led to the widespread creation of orchards and gardens. Agrarianism claimed agriculture was the source of all wealth and called for the wide distribution of land as the foundation of democracy and freedom. The Country Life Movement was a loose grouping of social reformers, church leaders, and urban progressives; they sought solutions for rural economic decline, social stagnation, and the depopulation of the countryside.David Demeritt, \\"Visions of Agriculture in British Columbia,\\" BC Studies, Winter 1995, Issue 108, pp. 29‚Äì59 United States In American historyRoderick Nash, Wilderness and the American Mind (4th ed. 2001, Yale U.P.) important spokesmen included Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, J. Hector St. John de Cr√®vec≈ìur (1735‚Äì1813), and John Taylor of Caroline (1753‚Äì1824) in the early national period. The memory of George Washington was often upheld as an ideal agrarian.Alexandra Kindell, ‚ÄúWashingtonian Agrarianism: Antebellum Reformers and the Agrarian Image of George Washington,‚Äù American Nineteenth Century History 13 (Sept. 2012), 347‚Äì70. In the mid-19th century important leaders included Transcendentalists such as Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803‚Äì1882) and Henry David Thoreau (1817‚Äì1862). After 1890 came philosopher Josiah Royce (1855‚Äì1916), botanist Liberty Hyde Bailey (1858‚Äì1954), the Southern Agrarians of the 1920s and 1930s, novelist John Steinbeck (1902‚Äì1968), historian A. Whitney Griswold (1906‚Äì1963), environmentalist Aldo Leopold (1887‚Äì1948), Ralph Borsodi (1886‚Äì1977), and present-day authors Wendell Berry (b. 1934), Gene Logsdon (b. 1932), Paul Thompson, and Allan C. Carlson (b. 1949). In 1930 in the U.S. the Southern Agrarians wrote in the \\"Introduction: A Statement of Principles\\" to their book I'll Take My Stand: The South and the Agrarian Tradition that =Leading American Neo-Agrarian Theorists= Recent agrarian thinkers are sometimes referred to as neo-Agrarian and include the likes of Wendell Berry, Paul B. Thompson, and Gene Logsdon. They are characterised by seeing the world through an agricultural lens. Although much of Inge's principles, above, still apply to the French Revolution, the affiliation with a particular religion and patriarchal tendency have subsided to some degree. Aldo Leopold Leopold was born in 1887 and educated at Yale University. He developed the field of game management and introduced an ecological ethic that replaced an earlier wilderness ethic where human dominance is stressed. In addition, he included the farm as a place of conservation and is considered an agrarian scholar. Leopold believed that harm was frequently done to natural systems out of a sense of ownership and this idea eclipsed community.[18] He expanded the idea of community to include the environment and the farm. Leopold is the author of several essays and is perhaps best known for his book A Sand County Almanac (1953).Curt Meine, Aldo Leopold: His Life and Work (University of Wisconsin Press, 1988) Wendell Berry Wendell Berry is an author of several books, essays, and poems whose writing often illustrates his values which centre around sustainable agriculture, healthy rural communities, and a connection to place. He is a prominent defender of agrarian values and has an appreciation for traditional farming. Rod Dreher writes the following: ‚Äú[Berry's] unshakable devotion to the land, to localism, and to the dignity of traditional life makes him both a great American and, to the disgrace of our age, a prophet without honour in his native land.\\"[29] J. Baird Callicott Callicott is, perhaps, best known for his research which explores an Aldo Leopold ethic as a response to global climate change. Callicott supports a holistic, non-anthropocentric environmental ethic which is in accordance with Leopold's view that \\"A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise\\"[15] He holds the view that an adequate environmental ethic‚Äîone that addresses actual environmental concerns‚Äîmust be intrinsically holistic. Paul B. Thompson Paul Thompson is the W.K. Kellogg Chair in Agricultural Food and Community Ethics at Michigan State University. He has published extensively on the social and environmental significance of agriculture and a number of volumes and papers on the philosophical significance of farming, notably The Spirit of the Soil: Agriculture and Environmental Ethics (1995) and The Agrarian Roots of Pragmatism (2000).The Agriculture, Food, and Community Ethics Website His most recent publication called The Agrarian Vision focuses on sustainability and what agrarian philosophy can offer when we conceptualise what sustainability actually means.Thompson, Paul. 2010.

History Chola conquests during Rajendra Chola I The coast of Tamil Nadu was a part of ancient silk route and played an important role in spice trade with western empires. Roman and Greek traders frequented the ancient Tamil country securing trade with the seafaring Tamil states of the Pandyan, Chola and Chera dynasties and establishing trading settlements which secured trade with South Asia by the Greco-Roman world since the time of the Ptolemaic dynasty a few decades before the start of the Common Era and remained long after the fall of the Western Roman Empire.Curtin 1984: 100 Major ports included Uraiyur, Korkai, Poompuhar and Kaveripattinam.

Durai Raja Singam Sea-trade Container terminal at Chennai port Seashore in Tiruchendur Tamil Nadu has major seaports at Chennai, Ennore, Tuticorin and Nagapattinam. There are 11 other minor ports. Chennai Port is an artificial harbor and is India's second busiest container hub. Because of its shallow waters, Sethusamudramthe sea separating Sri Lanka from Indiapresents a hindrance to navigation through the Palk Strait. Though trade across the India-Sri Lanka divide has been active since at least the first millennium BCE, it has been limited to small boats and dinghies. Larger oceangoing vessels coming from the West have had to navigate around Sri Lanka to reach India' eastern coast. The Sethusamudram Shipping Canal Project is a proposed project to create a shipping route in the shallow straits between India and Sri Lanka which would provide a continuously navigable sea route around the Indian Peninsula. Fishing and aquaculture The state has a fishermen population of 1.05 million and the coast consists of 3 major fishing harbors, 3 medium fishing harbors and 363 fish landing centers. The marine fishing output from the state contributes to 10-12 % of the total marine fish production in India and is estimated at 0.72 million tonnes. Aquaculture include shrimp, sea weed, mussel, clam and oyster farming. There have been several alleged incidents of Sri Lankan Navy personnel firing on Indian fishermen fishing in the Palk Strait, where India and Sri Lanka are only separated by 12 nautical miles.Rumley et al. 2009:166 Indian Government protests periodically against Sri Lankan navy for its alleged involvement in attacks on Indian fishermen. The incidents continue to happen and over 530 fishermen have been killed in the last 30 years.

Most take place in the Muslim-majority, contested provinces of Narathiwat, Pattani, and Yala in the far south of Thailand bordering Muslim Malaysia. For earlier events see History of Thailand. Timeline 1960‚Äì1998 Although the conflict was carried out with less intensity, armed resistance in the 1960s and 1970s involved up to 1,500 insurgents. 1960: The Barisan Revolusi Nasional (BRN) was founded by Haji Abdul Karim in response to the introduction of a secular curriculum in Pattani's religious boarding schools. 1968: Patani United Liberation Organisation (PULO) was founded by Tengku Bira Kotanila (alias Kabir Abdul Rahman). PULO became the most powerful insurgent group during the 1960 ‚Äì 2000 period of the war. 29 November 1975: Thai marines allegedly murdered five Muslim youths in the Bacho District of Narathiwat Province. The government allegedly failed to conduct a proper investigation into the matter. 11 December 1975: PULO organised mass protests in response to the event, which were joined by 70,000 Malay Muslims. A bomb was thrown into the crowd killing 12 and injuring at least 30 protesters. The attack was blamed on Buddhist extremists. The government charged and imprisoned the perpetrators and launched an official inquiry and compensated the families of the victims. Despite the fact that the majority of the protesters demands were granted, the event led to an escalation of the insurgency. June 1977: Sabilillah (Path of God) bombed Don Mueang International Airport in Bangkok. In the aftermath of the bombing Sabilillah vanished into obscurity. September 1977: Black December 1902 members threw a bomb into a Thai royal ceremony. Five persons were killed and 47 wounded. The royal family managed to escape unharmed. 1977: Security forces killed BNPP leader Tunku Yala Nasae. * Renewed agitation began in the 1990s, led by Malay intellectuals influenced by revolutionary and Islamist ideas from the Middle East. The BRN split into three rival factions, of which the most militant were the BRN Coordinate and the BRN Congress. The BRN Congress is regarded as the most active group, but there are several others, and competition between these militant groups has helped fuel the insurgency. It is believed that there is now a co-ordinating body called the Patani United Liberation Organisation (Dewan Pembebasan Pattani or PULO), although little is known about the composition or leadership of the various groups. 1993: The New PULO, a dissident faction of the original PULO, was established by Arrong Moo-reng and Hayi Abdul Rohman Bazo. 1995: Nasoree Saesang founded the GMIP. August 1996: Thirty-six schools were torched in Yala, Pattani, and Narathiwat allegedly by members of the New PULO faction, reportedly a dissident faction of the original PULO established by Arrong Moo-reng and Hayi Abdul Rohman Bazo. The Thai Interior Ministry and Thai Military Intelligence reported that New PULO used unemployed youth and young drug addicts to carry out its terrorist missions.Rohan Gunaratna & Arabinda Acharya , The Terrorist Threat from Thailand: Jihad Or Quest for Justice? 1997: Members of the Barisan Revolusi Nasional Melayu Patani (BRN), PULO and the New PULO established the United Mujahideen Front of Pattani to improve co-ordination between rebel factions. August 1997: Bersatu launched an operation code named \\"Falling Leaves\\". Between August 1997 and January 1998, 33 separate attacks took place resulting in nine deaths. January 1998: Malaysia and Thailand launched a joint operation code named \\"Pitak Tai\\" to crack down on insurgent outfits. Malaysian authorities arrested New PULO's leader,Abdul Rohman Bazo, its military chief, Haji Daoh Thanam, and Bazo's senior assistant, Haji Mae Yala in Kedah, as well as PULO's military commander, Haji Sama-ae Thanam, in Kuala Lumpur, later handing them to Thai authorities. The Thai government also encouraged local people to monitor the movements of drug traffickers and, as a result, the tough policy on drugs deprived PULO of recruits for its acts of terror. 1999‚Äì2002 * Following the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States, leaflets calling for Holy War and support for Osama bin Laden were distributed in Yala by militants. 24 December 2001: Insurgents launched a number of attacks on police posts in the three provinces. Five police and one defence volunteer were killed. * The Thai National Intelligence Agency estimated that fewer than 1,000 armed militants were taking part in the conflict as of 2001. In that year, the Thai Ministry of Interior estimated that 50 insurgency-related incidents had occurred. By 2002, 75 insurgency- linked attacks had killed 50 police and army personnel. 2003 * In 2003, officials counted 149 incidents. The mounting scale and sophistication of the insurgency eventually prompted the government into a recognition that there was a serious issue in the southern provinces. 2004 4 January: An escalation of the violence in the southern border provinces of Yala, Pattani, and Narathiwat is reckoned to have begun on 4 January 2004 with the raiding of a Thai Army depot. Unidentified gunmen raided an army ammunition depot in Narathiwat Province in the early morning, and made off with over 400 rifles and ammunition. 5 January: Two policemen were killed while attempting to defuse a bomb outside a shopping mall in Pattani. A third policeman was injured in bomb blast that occurred in a nearby park. Two more bombs were successfully defused in nearby areas. Prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra declared martial law in the provinces of Narathiwat, Pattani, and Yala. 22 January: Rebels killed a Buddhist monk. 12 March: Somchai Neelapaijit, a Thai- Muslim lawyer and human rights activist, was abducted in Ramkhamhaeng, Bangkok. He represented Muslim defendants, who said they had been tortured, in terrorism cases. He was never seen again. 28 March: A bomb planted by insurgents injured 29 people, including 10 Malaysian tourists. 30 March: Masked men raided a quarry in the Yala District, stealing a total of 1.6 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, 56 sticks of dynamite, and 176 detonators. 23 April: Militants killed an army officer and set fire to 50 public buildings in all 13 districts of Narathiwat Province. 28 April: Militants launched a string of attacks on armouries and army positions in Pattani, Yala, and Songkhla.

Over 1,300 people were detained in the incident. 28 October: An IED detonated outside a bar, killing two persons and injuring 21. 2 November: A Buddhist official was beheaded by suspected Muslim insurgents. 4 November: Nine persons were killed including two police. 7 November: The Defence Minister of Thailand said that there had been more than 700 casualties in south Thailand since the unrest began in January. Many murders involved shooting and decapitation. During 2004, insurgents began to sow fear in attacks by beheading Buddhists. 13 November: One man was killed and at least 13 people injured when five bomb blasts occurred in various parts of the region. 5 December: Thailand airdropped nearly 100 million origami cranes over the southern regions of the country in an effort to bring peace. Militants respond with series of bombings the following day. * A total of 400 people were killed in over 1,000 incidents during 2004. 2005 17 February: A bomb exploded near a tourist hotel in the town of Sungai Kolok, killing five persons and wounding over 40. Four persons were killed in other incidents. 3 April: A series of bomb attacks in Songkhla killed two people and leaving 66 injured. The bombings marked the beginning of attacks against ethnic Thai‚ÄìChinese‚Äìowned businesses who were considered Thaksin supporters and against southern Thailand independence as a Muslim state. 14 July: A major attack was launched on the provincial capital of Yala city. Sixty militants targeted an area near a hotel, the railway station, two convenience stores and a restaurant roaming the streets using guns, fire-bombs, and explosives. 18 July: Two militants entered a teashop, shot Lek Pongpla, a Buddhist cloth vendor, beheaded him and left the head outside of the shop. 19 July: The Thai Prime Minister enacted the \\"emergency powers law\\" to manage the three troubled states giving himself sweeping powers to direct military operations, suspend civil liberties, and censor the press. Several human rights organisations and local press expressed their concerns that these new powers might be used to violate civil liberty rights. However, the emergency decree was highly popular, with 72 percent of Bangkok residents and 86 percent of people in the three southern provinces supporting it. Nevertheless, the insurgency escalated further. 31 August: Three bombs exploded almost simultaneously. Subsequently, 131 civilians from the south fled to neighbouring Malaysia seeking refuge from the Thai authorities. Thailand immediately accused the refugees of being insurgents and demanded that they be returned, sparking a diplomatic spat. Currently, the people are still in Malaysia. Thailand, suspecting that insurgents may also have fled with the refugees, has asked Malaysia to return these Thai citizens but Malaysia has refused on humanitarian grounds. 16 October: A group of 20 separatists attacked a Buddhist monastery, killing three. An extended state of emergency was announced in the three southern provinces plagued by the insurgency. The announcement sparked a large scale guerrilla raid on 60 targets, in which at least seven persons were killed and 90 weapons were stolen. 16 November: Separatists killed nine civilians and injured nine others. * A total of 500 people were killed during 2005. 2006 * A brief lull in the insurgency followed the 19 September 2006 coup that overthrew the government of Premier Thaksin Shinawatra. As Army Commander Sonthi Boonyaratkalin settled into his role as head of the junta, violence resumed. , more than 1,400 people had died in less than three years of southern violence. Most were innocent bystanders, both Buddhists and Muslims. 7 January: Four suspected militants fatally shot two border-police at a weekend market in Yala Province. Three others were killed in separate attacks on the same day. 10 May: A bomb exploded at a tea shop killing at least three persons and injuring more than a dozen. 15 June: During the 60th anniversary of the accession of Bhumibol Adulyadej to the Thai throne, well-coordinated bomb-attacks against at least 40 government and official buildings occurred. Two police officials died and 11 others were injured. Experts say that the bomb attacks were a message to the Thai authorities, rather than an attempt to do real damage, as the bombs were loaded with small amounts of explosives. Had the devices been larger, the casualties and injuries would have been notably greater. The Thai media was late in reporting the incident, only doing so after the BBC and other international news services had announced it. 18 June: Mass graves of about 300 migrant workers were found in southern Thailand.Breakingnews 27 June: Seven persons including five security personnel were killed in separatist attacks. 31 August: Twenty-two commercial banks were simultaneously bombed in Yala Province, killing a retired military officer and wounding 24 people. Afterwards, Army chief Sonthi Boonyaratglin announced that he would break with government policy and negotiate with the leaders of the insurgency. However, he noted that \\"We still don't know who is the real head of the militants we are fighting with.\\" In a press conference the next day, he slammed the government for political interference, and asked that the government \\"Free the military and let it do the job.\\" By 16 September, the army admitted that it still wasn't sure whom to negotiate with.Bangkok Post, Deep South: Army wants peace talks but unsure who with, 19 September 2006 September: Army Commander Sonthi Boonyaratkalin was granted an extraordinary increase in executive powers to combat the unrest. 16 September: Six remotely detonated motorcycle bombs simultaneously exploded in the 2006 Hat Yai bombings, killing four people and wounding more than sixty.

The club's colours are green and white, and its emblem is three circles, like Olympic circles. History Ampelokipoi was founded in 1929, originally as Hephaestus Athens. In the first post-war years, the club was renamed to Athletic Union of Ampelokipoi, and in the year 1954, the club merged with Niki Ampelokipoi, and was then renamed to Ampelokipoi Athletic Club. The club had departments in all popular sports in Greece: football, basketball, and volleyball. But the club was in the shadow of the nearby Panathinaikos club. Only during the 1990s, did the basketball team have some success, when it had Georgios Kalafatakis as head coach, and was promoted up through five division levels in five seasons, ultimately reaching the top-tier Greek Basket League. Ampelokipoi played in the top-tier Greek Basket League for two seasons (1994‚Äì95 and 1995‚Äì96), having notable players such as Tzanis Stavrakopoulos, Giorgos Floros, Lawrence Funderburke, and Ashraf Amaya in the team. After losing the most notable players of the team, the club then played in the Greek 2nd Division for the two next seasons. In those following years, the club's most notable player was Theo Papaloukas.

Nouri operated primarily as an attacking midfielder, but could also be deployed as a winger. A youth product of Eredivisie club Ajax, he played two years of senior football with its reserve team and the first team. He also represented the Netherlands at various youth levels. In July 2017, at age 20, during a pre-season friendly match, Nouri collapsed and suffered a cardiac arrhythmia attack, which left him with severe and permanent brain damage and unable to continue as a footballer. Early life Nouri was born in Amsterdam, and is of Moroccan descent. He made his name as a footballer largely in his youth, attracting attention from multiple publications as a future star. He was named as one of the best 40 youth players in the world by The Guardian in 2014, before he made his professional debut. Club career Nouri was a youth exponent from the academy at Ajax, and made his professional debut for the reserve side, Jong Ajax, on 13 March 2015, in an Eerste Divisie game against VVV Venlo, replacing Danny Bakker after 78 minutes in a 1‚Äì0 loss. On 21 September 2016, Nouri made his official first-team debut in a KNVB Cup match against Willem II, and scored a goal. His exploits throughout the season for Jong Ajax saw him being gifted the Player of the Season award for the 2016‚Äì17 season, as well as promotion to the first team for the 2017‚Äì18 season. Collapse Jan Mulder talks about Nouri in a broadcast from De Wereld Draait Door, 9 January 2018 On 8 July 2017, Nouri collapsed during a friendly match against Werder Bremen, due to cardiac arrhythmia. He was taken to the hospital by a trauma helicopter, and his condition was announced as stable. Five days later, however, Ajax reported that Nouri had suffered severe and permanent brain damage as a direct result of the incident. Nouri eventually left intensive care on 25 July 2017, being able to breathe unaided, but will not be able to play football again. In June 2018, Ajax announced an investigation had found that the medical treatment Nouri received on the field was \\"inadequate\\", which prompted a lawsuit from Nouri's family against Ajax through the Royal Dutch Football Association's arbitration panel, who stated a failure to resuscitate him with due haste was responsible for causing his brain damage. As of August 2018, Nouri was no longer in a coma and is said to be able to recognise and communicate with members of his family by moving his mouth and eyebrows. In September 2019 Nouri remained in a hospital bed. On 27 March 2020, Nouri's family confirmed that he had awoken from his coma, returned home to his family, and that they were caring for him. Shortly afterwards, Ajax announced they had cancelled Nouri's contract, which was due to automatically renew on 1 July, and that they were in talks with his family about a \\"future solution\\" for Nouri.  Tributes  Following Nouri's retirement, several tributes were conducted in his honor by Ajax and players at other clubs.
