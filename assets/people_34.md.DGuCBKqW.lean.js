The town is situated along the Balgarup River. Settlers had appeared in the area in the 1850s but it was not until 1899 that land was set aside for a townsite. The Shire of Kojonup requested for lots to be surveyed in 1905; this was carried out in 1906 and the town was gazetted in 1907 as Muradupp. More land was opened for selection in the area in 1909. A railway siding existed in the town on the Kojonup to Bridgetown line. In 1913 the local progress association asked for a school to be erected on a block that had been set aside in the town. The lands department changed the name of the town from Muradupp to Muradup after deciding the double P at the end of the name was superfluous. Land was granted in the area to returned soldiers in 1918. The first soldier to receive land was O. Fitzpatrick, who received 1,160 acres of land that had been confiscated from an \\"alien enemy subject\\" who had been interned. The town was named after the nearby Mooradupp pool, which was first recorded in 1846 when the area was surveyed. The name is Aboriginal in origin but the meaning is not known.

Biography  Larry Abramson was born in 1954 in South Africa. In 1961, his family immigrated to Israel and settled in Jerusalem. In 1970, as a high school senior, he was one of the signators of a conscientious objectors to Israeli rejection of Egyptian President Nasser's peace initiative. In 1973 Abramson studied a Foundation Course at the Chelsea College of Art and Design, London. Upon his return to Israel he took a position as printer and curator of exhibitions at the Jerusalem Print Workshop, where he worked for nine years, until 1986. Art career Abramson's first solo exhibition was in 1975. His work during the 1980s dealt with a variety of iconic symbols from modernist European art, particularly the \\"Black Square\\" by Kazimir Malevich, which he used to create dynamic situations combining abstraction and a figurative art idiom. During 1993 and 1994 Abramson created the series of work \\"tsooba,\\" which was exhibited at the Kibbutz Art Gallery, Tel Aviv. The series was composed of 38 landscape paintings (oil on canvas), 38 impressions on newspaper of the landscape paintings, and a group of still life paintings after samples of flora taken from the site. This series relates to a mound of ruins near Kibbutz Tzova, a site which was painted a decade earlier by the artist Joseph Zaritsky. While Zaritsky ignored the Palestinian ruins found on the site and thus abstracted the landscape, Abramson painted the view realistically and then defaced it. By \\"seeing\\" the ruins of the Palestinian village, he criticizes the Israeli point of view which seeks to erase the Palestinian identity from the appropriated territory. In 1984, Abramson joined the teaching staff of the art department of the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design in Jerusalem. In 1992 he was appointed head of the Fine Art department, and in 1996 he founded and headed the Bezalel Program for Young Artists (Master of Fine Art). In 2000 and 2003 he was invited as guest lecturer at the San Francisco Art Institute, and in 2002 he joined the academic team planning the establishment of a new art department at the Shenkar College of Engineering and Design in Ramat Gan, Israel. In May 2002 Abramson published in the journal Studio an article entitled \\"We Are All Felix Nussbaum\\", in which he raised the problematic relationship between art and history in the post- Holocaust era. In 2005 Abramson mounted an exhibition of works under the name \\"The Pile\\" which included charcoal drawings of piles of construction debris, relating to the issue of representation of ruins in art and the figure of Jewish-German painter Felix Nussbaum. This series was exhibited at the Felix Nussbaum Haus Museum in Osnabr√ºck, (Germany) and at the Chaim Atar Museum of Art on Kibbutz Ein Harod in the Jezreel Valley. In 2007 Abramson held an exhibition of recent paintings at the Gordon Gallery in Tel Aviv, and in 2010 an extensive retrospective exhibition of his work was held at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art.

Gordon was born Barney Gorodetsky. He appeared in many roles over his lengthy career and was known by the moniker \\"The Mad Russian\\". He was a regular on The Eddie Cantor Program, and also appeared on The Jack Benny Program, and The Abbott and Costello Program. In 1945 he starred in his own film vehicle, How Doooo You Do!!!, directed by Ralph Murphy; the film takes its title from Gordon's distinctive way of introducing himself, which became a catch phrase in the early 1940s. Gordon played himself in an episode of The Dick Van Dyke Show in 1964 along with several other radio-era performers.The Return of Edwin Carp - Season 3 : Ep. 27 of the Dick Van Dyke Showe In popular culture Gordon's character was parodied a number of times in Warner Bros. cartoons, including: *Bob Clampett's What's Cookin' Doc? (1944), in which Bugs Bunny wins a \\"Booby Prize Oscar\\", and tells it \\"I'll take youse to bed with me every night,\\", upon which the Oscar-like statue comes to life and says, in The Mad Russian's voice, \\"Do you mean it?\\".Beck, Jerry and Friedwald, Will.

After 1942, Bert Gordon was no longer referred to on the Eddie Cantor Show as The Mad Russian, but as \\"Our Russian Friend,\\" this presumably so as not to give offense to Stalin, the Russians having recently switched alliance so as to be on the side of the Allies. Following the defeat of Germany in the spring of 1945, and Russia then being at odds with the United States, Bert Gordon was dropped from the show entirely.

This ownership structure survived only for a few years until the collapse of Bond Corporation. A newly formed company, West Australian Newspapers Holdings, then purchased the paper from the receivers before being floated in an oversubscribed $185 million public offering. Kerry Stokes acquired 14.9% through Seven Network and he became chairman of West Australian Newspapers in 2009.

The Seven Network is one of five main free-to-air networks in Australia. =Origin= The Seven Network began as a group of independent stations in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth.Timeline 1950-1959 at television.au.com HSV-7 Melbourne, licensed to The Herald and Weekly Times Ltd (owners of two local papers at the time, The Herald and The Sun), was the first station in the country to use the VHF7 frequency. It launched on 4 November 1956, soon joined on 2 December by Amalgamated Television Services ATN-7 in Sydney. TVW-7 Perth began broadcasting almost two years later, on 16 October 1959, as the city's first commercial station. It was licensed to TVW7, a subsidiary of West Australian Newspapers, publisher of The West Australian. BTQ-7 followed on 1 November, signing on as Brisbane's second commercial television station. ADS-7 in Adelaide launched on 24 Oct 1959 as the final capital city VHF7 station. The station later swapped frequencies with SAS-10, however, with the latter becoming SAS-7. =1980s ownership changes= Perth-based businessman Robert Holmes √† Court, through his business the Bell Group, bought TVW-7 from its original owners, West Australian Newspapers in 1982. The Herald and Weekly Times, owner of HSV-7 and ADS-7, was sold to Rupert Murdoch in December 1986. Murdoch's company, News Limited, sold off HSV to Fairfax soon afterwards, for $320 million. Fairfax went on to axe a number of locally produced shows in favour of networked content from its Sydney counterpart, ATN-7 (also owned by Fairfax at the time). In 1987, Fairfax sold off its stations to Qintex Ltd., owned by businessman Christopher Skase. Qintex had previously bought, and subsequently sold off, stations in Brisbane and regional Queensland before taking control of the network. The next year, another new logo was introduced along with evening soap opera Home and Away and a relaunched Seven National News, now known as Seven News. The network expanded in 1988 when Skase bought out TVW for $130 million. A failed $1.5 billion bid for MGM Studios in the same year sent Qintex into receivership. Christopher Skase fled Australia in 1990 in order to escape extradition. The business' assets were bundled together by receivers and made into a new company, the Seven Network Limited, in 1991. =Advent of Kerry Stokes= The network was re-listed as a public company on the stock exchange in 1993 with News Limited holding 14.9% and Telstra holding 10%. In 1995, Stokes acquired 19.9% of the public company and was elected chairman. Shortly after it acquired Sunshine Television, a Seven Network affiliate in regional Queensland, Sunshine Television's regional stations effectively became a part of the Seven Network, identical in appearance and programming to the rest of the business' stations. Seven Queensland won the annual audience ratings for the first time in 1998. The year 2000 saw Seven as the host broadcaster for the Sydney Olympics. The Network adopted a new logo. In 2003, Stokes appointed David Leckie as CEO of Seven and Peter Meakin as Head of News and Current Affairs. In January 2006, the Seven Network, Pacific Magazine and online portal Yahoo! Australia and New Zealand combined in a joint venture to form Yahoo!7, representing all three companies' online assets. This venture is now Australia's most popular internet portal and the joint venture is driving a range of online and IPTV businesses. Seven is building and acquiring a range of broadband businesses, including wireless broadband group Unwired, VOIP operator Engin and has become the Australian licensee for TiVo,Joint Seven and TiVo announcement ‚Äì 30 May 2007 due to be launched in 2008. The group has also established a strategic 20 per cent shareholding in West Australian Newspapers Ltd. Since 2007, the Seven Network has been the highest rating television network in Australia, ahead of the Nine Network, Network Ten, ABC and SBS. In 2011, the Seven Network won all 40 out of 40 weeks of the ratings season for total viewers. Seven is the first to do this since the introduction of the OZtam ratings system in 2001. it was the second largest network in the country in terms of population reach. 68% owned by Kerry Stokes (), Seven Network is a network of commercial free-to-air television stations in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide, as well as regional Queensland and Perth.

She first appears as a guest star in the seventh season, where she interviewed for the Regional Manager position at the Dunder Mifflin Scranton branch. She is an original character, and has no counterpart in the original British version of the series. Initially a one- episode guest star, she was reportedly the top choice to replace Steve Carell, but was unable to join the series, due to her commitment to the West End production of the Shakespeare play Much Ado About Nothing. However, Tate later returned to the role as a series regular for the second half of season eight and continued in the role for the final season. Biography Nellie Bertram is portrayed as a crass and outspoken woman of English nationality. She has an anti-Irish sentiment. She was born in a \\"working-class town\\" in Basildon, and, until the age of 32, spoke in a \\"horrendous\\" Essex accent. She is an old friend of Jo Bennett's, and believes that it is possible that she is Jo's best friend, while stating that Jo, however, is not her best friend. It is highly probable that their friendship is the only reason why Jo recommended her for the Regional Manager job, as Nellie is shown to make considerably poor decisions in her professional life, such as rejecting Cathy Simms' idea of the Sabre retail stores having a beach, winter, and jungle theme, simply because she did not like the winter theme concept, and refusing to change that one theme in order for Cathy's idea to appeal to her. However, she is shown to be aware of her legion of shortcomings, telling the camera crew, in the episode \\"Get the Girl\\", \\"I grew up poor. I have had little formal education, and no real skills. I don't work especially hard. Most of my ideas are either unoriginal, or total crap\\". Her stated philosophy in business is \\"if the seat is open, the job is open\\", a motto which had led her to briefly race a Formula One car (for what were the three slowest laps ever recorded). Long before her move to Scranton, Nellie was in a long-term relationship with a stage magician named Henry, only to have him suddenly leave her for a waitress and vanish from her life, resulting in a loathing for anyone of that profession. Nellie first appeared in the seventh-season finale, where she interviewed for the Regional Manager position of the Dunder Mifflin Scranton branch, the occupation that Michael Scott held for the majority of the series. She returns in the episode \\"Tallahassee\\", as the President of Sabre's special projects. She reveals that she reacted to being rejected for the Manager job by going on a destructive shopping spree (she mentions that she purchased 13 pianos). But, she soon came up with the concept of the Sabre company opening up a chain of retail stores, an idea that Jo was ecstatic about, which resulted in her hiring Bertram to get that project under way. Nellie had long harbored a desire to adopt a child, and after being initially rejected by an adoption agency during season eight, finally achieves her wish in the series finale. Seasons 7‚Äì8 Nellie made her debut in \\"Search Committee\\", interviewing for the Regional Manager position at the Dunder Mifflin Scranton branch, but proves herself to be woefully inept for the job. However, in a talking-head interview, she expresses confidence that she will be chosen for it, due to her friendship and recommendation from Jo. Bertram reappears in the eighth season episode, \\"Tallahassee\\". In the episode, Dwight Schrute, Jim Halpert, Erin Hannon, Stanley Hudson, Ryan Howard, and Cathy, as well many employees at Sabre headquarters, attend her orientation meeting, where she explains how she obtained her occupation as President of Sabre's special projects, recalling how she interviewed for the Regional Manager position at the Dunder Mifflin Scranton branch, but was not hired, because the search committee decided, as she pointedly reminds Jim, that she and the job were not \\"A good fit\\". However, she later thought of the concept of the Sabre company opening up a chain of retail stores, and called Jo to inform her of the idea. Jo was ecstatic about it, and hired Nellie to oversee it. Throughout the episode, Dwight and Todd Packer compete to see who will become Nellie's Vice President. While she is initially impressed with Packer, and the two are even seen flirting with one another, she is soon impressed with Dwight, as well, who, despite being rushed into surgery, after developing an appendicitis, returns three hours after his appendix is removed in order to impress her. After nearly butchering a slide-show presentation, he finally impresses Nellie by telling the audience that the only element of marketing that matters is \\"Desire\\". Bertram subsequently invites Packer and Dwight to have breakfast with her the following day. In \\"After Hours\\", Dwight and Packer compete to seduce Nellie after work at the hotel bar, in order to become VP under her. For most of the night, Packer seems to be the more successful; but Dwight has Gabe spike Packer's beer with his asthma inhaler, which causes Packer to vomit, and leaves Dwight alone with Nellie. Dwight eventually succeeds in seducing her, and she asks for a key to his room. Dwight scratches off the magnetic strip on his hotel card before giving it to Nellie, stating the seduction was only to gain approval and doesn't intend to have sex with her. She later shows up at his door, drunk, and unsuccessfully attempts to enter. In \\"Test the Store\\", at the Sabre store opening, Dwight attempts to put on a theatrical presentation in order to impress Nellie. Several things go awry; and after Ryan departs, Jim is forced to give the presentation, which, despite a rocky start, impresses the crowd. After the opening, Nellie names Dwight as Vice President. In \\"Last Day in Florida\\", she accompanies Dwight, Jim, and Robert California on a golf outing celebrating Dwight's new Vice President position. While Robert seems to take a liking to her, he reveals to Jim that he dislikes the business plan for the Sabre store, and that he only approved it because Jo Bennett wanted it. He says that it is now evident that the store is a failure, so he plans to sandbag it at a high-level meeting. However, for this failure he plans to terminate Dwight, the Vice President of the project, instead of Nellie (presumably because of her friendship with Jo). Later, when Jim is keeping Dwight from attending the meeting, in hopes of keeping Dwight from getting fired, Packer convinces Nellie to appoint him Vice President in Dwight's absence, which she does. During the meeting, Robert chastises Packer, pretending that the Sabre store was a brilliant concept, but that Packer simply botched it in execution. Nellie then steps up, apparently defending Packer, as she tells the board not to blame Packer, but then states to simply blame his upbringing, and the society that \\"molded this idiotic creature\\". She says that, while they should fire Packer as an employee, they should not fire him as a man. An infuriated Packer protests this, stating that it is actually Nellie's fault for her poor business plan. Yet, Robert still terminates him instead of Nellie, and it is implied that Robert was impressed at how Nellie manipulated the situation. It also hinted at that Nellie might be interested in Robert romantically, as before, at the golf course, she pretends to play poorly in order for Robert to come around behind her and demonstrate on how she could better swing her golf club.\\"Last Day in Florida\\" In \\"Get the Girl\\", Nellie travels to the Scranton branch and tries to claim the manager position, while Andy is out of the office. She uses her motto of \\"if the seat is open, the job is open\\", to coax Robert into letting her stay. She attempts to win over the rest of the office, save for Jim, Pam and Darryl, by giving them raises.\\"Get the Girl\\" In \\"Welcome Party\\", Jim and Dwight reluctantly help Nellie move into her new apartment. She tells them about a bad breakup she went through with her longtime boyfriend, Henry. In \\"Fundraiser\\", Nellie attempts to befriend Darryl, and they appear to bond a little bit when he buys them some tacos, a food which she has never heard of or tried before; and, after watching her struggle with the mechanics of consuming one, realizes that she truly is trying to be nice to and socialize with her employees. In \\"Turf War\\", it is revealed that Nellie is a shopaholic and is in severe credit card debt, and also that her efforts to adopt a child were turned down because she is single. After Pam discovers this, she decides to be nicer to Nellie, and she strikes up a friendly conversation with her. Nellie reveals to the camera crew that she is deeply moved to have a real friend at the office. During the eighth-season finale, Andy recruits David Wallace, to help him take back Dunder Mifflin. Andy, after being re-appointed manager, fires Nellie as revenge for stealing his job. After she pleads to him, he rehires her as Special projects manager.\\"Free Family Portrait Studio\\" Season 9 At the start of season 9, Andy returns from management training intending to fire Nellie for what she did to him the previous year. After he is informed by Toby Flenderson that Nellie can not be fired without cause, Andy vows to make life miserable for her, while also putting his newly Michael Scott-esque dislike of Toby on display.\\"New Guys\\" In \\"Roy's Wedding\\" Nellie initiates a charity program within the office, which Dwight ridicules, believing charities are useless. When Nellie insists he choose a charity, Dwight mocks her initiative further by deliberately choosing a front organization for the Taliban. To test Dwight's resolve, Nellie has him sign a pledge to live by Taliban law in the office, and then steals his pen, noting that the penalty for theft would require him to cut off her hand, even offering him a knife with which to do so. Though clearly unsettled at this idea, Dwight maintains his bravado for several hours, until Darryl walks in and suggests the two of them watch the movie 127 Hours. Eventually the two become engrossed in James Franco's performance and forget about the hand-cutting.\\"Roy's Wedding\\" In \\"Andy's Ancestry\\", after being tasked by Andy to research his family tree, to spite him, Nellie falsely tells him that he is related to U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama. Not long afterwards, Pam agrees to help Nellie practice for a driving test, and the two end up bonding when she shows appreciation for Pam's art, which leads to Nellie later asking her to paint a mural in the warehouse.\\"Andy's Ancestry\\" In \\"Work Bus\\", Nellie moves forward with her plans for adoption and asks for Andy to give her a reference as her employer, something he says he will only consider if she tells the truth (as the truth about someone as awful as her will ruin any chances for Nellie to be matched with a child). Andy's girlfriend Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), who herself was a foster child who was never adopted, helps Nellie with her application, clearly excited at the prospect of a child being adopted. Andy gives her a scathing non-endorsement, however, leaving her stunned and saddened but stoic. After seeing that this upset Erin even more than Nellie, Andy reconsiders and writes her a more favorable recommendation.\\"Work Bus\\" In \\"Here Comes Treble\\", Dwight finds an anti-anxiety pill on the floor, and Nellie aids him in investigating who the office \\"madman\\" is, all the while trying to convince him that he is making a much bigger deal of it than it actually is. After he sets a trap by leaving the pill out on a plate in the kitchen, Meredith heads right for it, excited about finding a \\"free upper\\". Dwight then jumps out and captures her in a net, at which point Nellie frees her from the net and admits to Dwight that the pill is hers, and pops it into her mouth, leaving Dwight stunned. Later, Dwight, rethinking his stand on anxiety medication, now would like some of her pills, claiming that they would help his cousin, Mose. Nellie, understanding that Dwight is having trouble admitting to his anxiety, tells him that she hopes \\"Mose\\" feels better. In another subplot involving her, she unintentionally titillates Toby with her Halloween costume, a \\"sexy\\" version of himself. At the end of the episode, he is seen giving her a bouquet of flowers, but after she takes her wig off, he realizes that he was only attracted to her because of the costume.\\"Here Comes Treble\\" In \\"Dwight Christmas\\", at the office Christmas party, Nellie is intrigued when Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) mentions he was on the jury for the Scranton Strangler. After inquiring about it, however, Toby proceeds to bore her with a long, drawn-out account that is implied to last for several hours. Nellie finally leans close to Toby and shushes him. A puzzled Toby asks if Nellie intends to kiss him, which she does to save face. An emboldened Toby then gives her an even more passionate kiss.\\"Dwight Christmas\\" Nellie is horrified to realize Toby has fallen for her, and while she is briefly impressed when he goes to see if the Scranton Strangler is innocent and is nearly killed by the very guilty man, she goes back to showing great disdain for Toby afterwards. During the \\"Finale\\" episode, Nellie comes back to attend the documentary's open panel, and Dwight and Angela's wedding. Nellie avoids Toby, and snidely remarks that she \\"un-friended\\" him when he knows about her open-Twitter based personal life. She also says she is living in Poland, \\"the Scranton of the EU\\". While at the wedding, former Dunder Mifflin employee Ryan Howard leaves his infant son Drake to run off with his married ex Kelly Kapoor. Nellie tells Kevin that she'll contact Child Services, but instead lets the camera know that if Ryan wants to come back for Drake, he should head to Europe because Nellie will be raising her new son there. Behind the scenes Tate originally guest-starred in the seventh-season finale episode, \\"Search Committee\\". While she was initially the top choice to join the cast as the Manager, she was unable to join the series, due to her commitment to the West End production of the Shakespeare play, Much Ado About Nothing. However, on October 21, 2011, it was announced that she would be returning to The Office in order to reprise her role of Nellie, who has been hired as the \\"Misguided special projects manager\\". It was noted that she will strike up a \\"Far from professional\\" relationship with current Sabre CEO, Robert California. Reception The Nellie Bertram character received mixed reviews from her initial guest appearance. In her review of \\"Search Committee\\", Cindy White, of IGN, wrote \\"As for Catherine Tate, I'm a fan of her work across the pond ‚Äì not just as the Doctor's companion Donna Noble, but from her self-titled sketch show as well ‚Äì so I had high expectations. Unfortunately, she was probably the least compelling of the applicants\\". In Sam Morgan's recap of the episode, he wrote that \\"[Tate's] character wasn‚Äôt that interesting nor competent\\". In Kaili Markley's review, she wrote \\"Catherine Tate is brilliant, but the addition of this Nellie Bertrum to the show would spell certain disaster for The Office: she is too over-the-top, too obnoxious, too unrealistic, and just plum unlikeable\\". Meghan Carlson, of BuddyTV, was slightly positive of Nellie, writing that \\"I hope they'd flesh out the character in a different way. I've seen Tate be LOL-worthy on her UK series innumerable times, but something about her interview didn't feel right. Still, Nellie just might have the right combination of self-assurance and stupidity, if reworked a little, to replace the great Michael Scott\\". The reception of the character became more positive when she returned in a regular capacity. In their review of \\"Tallahassee\\", TV Equals wrote that they were \\"Hoping that this special project lasts a very long time so we get much more Nellie Bertram in the future\\". In his review, Brett Harrison Davinger, of the California Literary Review, wrote that Nellie proved herself to be \\"A good addition [to the show]\\". In her review, White wrote that \\"The character played by Catherine Tate in last season's finale \\"Search Committee\\" may not have been that popular with Office fans, but anyone familiar with Tate's work in the U.K. (including her award-winning self-titled comedy sketch show and a season on Doctor Who as the feisty Donna Noble) knows how versatile she is. Tate came back strong as the eccentric Nellie Bertram, president of Special Projects for Sabre, and remained just wacky enough to be amusing without going over the top\\". Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club, wrote in his review of \\"Free Family Portrait Studio\\", that he found Tate's portrayal solid, and that the recent re-characterization of Nellie would help reinvent the show. Many critics noted how Nellie would play a major part in the final season's story lines. Most also noted how this would give her a second chance to win critics over. Cindy White, of IGN, enjoyed the pairing of Nellie and Pam in \\"Andy's Ancestry\\", noting how \\"Nellie was a lot more tolerable with Pam along for the ride.\\" References Category:The Office (American TV series) characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2011 Category:Fictional English people Category:Fictional British people Category:Female characters in television ","title":"Nellie Bertram"},{"id":"31651835","text":"Robert California, also known as Bob Kazamakis, is a fictional character on the U.S. comedy television series The Office, portrayed by James Spader. In the eighth season, Robert managed to persuade Jo Bennett to appoint him CEO in her place. In the eighth-season finale, Robert departs from the company after David Wallace purchases Dunder Mifflin. California is an original character and has no counterpart on the original British version of the series. Biography Robert California is the former CEO of Dunder Mifflin/Sabre. An enigmatic individual, he was often inspiring and intimidating to the staff in the Scranton branch office, especially so to Regional Manager Andy Bernard. Robert has been married three times, with his third wife, Susan, leaving him after the events of \\"Mrs. California\\". In a talking-head interview from that episode, Susan states (when referring to the staff's instructed dislike of her), that the last time she was employed, she \\"hated the boss' wife\\" as well, revealing that the woman she is referring to was one of Robert's ex-spouses. This would mean that she and Robert met while she was under his employment at one time, and that the two possibly began their relationship while he was still married. Robert also has a young son, named Bert. It is unknown if Robert fathered him with Susan. The Sabre Corporation website implies that Robert may be of partial Native American descent, which could be the reason why he so strongly dislikes Christopher Columbus. In \\"Turf War\\", it is revealed that \\"Robert California\\" is not his real name, and in the next episode, he introduces himself to David Wallace as \\"Bob Kazamakis\\", although it is unknown whether \\"Kazamakis\\" is his actual surname or simply another alias. However, throughout the series, the other characters almost always refer to him by the full name \\"Robert California\\". Robert appears to typically manipulate situations in a duplicitous fashion, as seen in the episodes \\"Mrs. California\\", \\"Trivia\\", and most greatly in \\"Last Day in Florida\\", when he privately admits to Jim Halpert that the newly opened Sabre store was a poor concept, and that he only approved it because Jo Bennet wanted it, but pretending, at a high-level meeting, that the store was a brilliant idea, and using newly appointed Vice President Todd Packer as a scapegoat for the store's failure, stating that Packer executed it poorly. He has been shown to have somewhat of a fascination with the PBS program Sesame Street (which he refers to as \\"The Street\\"). In \\"Garden Party\\", he reveals that his body has become acclimated to Southern Italy, despite the fact that he has never even been there. During \\"Trivia\\", it is shown that he uses a monthly wrestling meet instead of exercising. He also dislikes The Black Eyed Peas, stating \\"It's rock and roll for people who don't like rock and roll; it's rap for people who don't like rap; it's pop for people who don't like pop\\". Upon meeting her in \\"Last Day in Florida\\", Robert develops a deep attraction to Nellie Bertram, and, as such, allowed her to get away with her irrational and unprofessional behavior. While she would often imply to him that she was attracted to him, in \\"Turf War\\", this is revealed to be nothing more than a mere manipulation tactic, as she reveals to Pam that she is, in fact, repulsed by Robert. Throughout his appearances, Robert has been shown to have innumerable unhealthily salacious appetites and beliefs (once proclaiming that \\"Everything... is sex\\" ‚Äì even calling this opinion of his a \\"universal truth\\"). He has displayed a need for intercourse regularly, as shown in \\"Christmas Wishes\\", when he becomes depressed after being deprived of it for only ten days. On more than one occasion, Robert has attempted to convince the staff to engage in group sex with him; in a deleted storyline from \\"Free Family Portrait Studio\\", he asks Jim and Pam Halpert if they would be interested in having a threesome. Some episodes have also implied that he is bisexual. This is most heavily hinted in the eighth-season finale, in which he is seen drinking an energy drink for Asian homosexuals (and complaining about the coconut taste in the new \\"Coconut Penis\\" flavor), and bids Andy farewell by kissing him on the lips. Robert is seen driving a silver Chevrolet Corvette Convertible just before he takes over as CEO. Seasons 7‚Äì8 Robert first appeared in the seventh season finale, \\"Search Committee\\", as an interviewee for the Scranton branch Manager position. While his intense personality disturbs the search committee, after he departs from the interview, Jim admits that, while Robert \\"creeps [him] out\\", he believes he ‚Äúmight be a genius‚Äù. Soon afterwards, he stops by Dwight's Caffeine Corner in the lobby, and attempts to sabotage Merv Bronte (Ray Romano), who is on his way up for his interview, by telling him that the office staff act as if they were imprisoned. When Dwight questions Robert why he feels he is qualified to judge a place after a mere interview, he studies Dwight for a moment. Dwight commands him to stop, but Robert states that he has already \\"figured [him] out\\". Dwight then asks him if he knows anything about paper, to which Robert responds by saying he viewed an episode of how paper is manufactured on Sesame Street. Dwight, disgusted by him, orders him to leave. Later, in a talking- head interview held in the parking lot, Robert informs the documentary film crew that he is confident that he will be offered the job, as it is a call he has received many times. In the season 8 premiere, \\"The List\\", it is revealed that Robert was hired as the branch manager over the summer. But, after one look at his new workplace environment, he quickly drives to Florida and convinces Sabre CEO Jo Bennett to give him her job. Once CEO himself, he appoints Andy Bernard as the Regional Manager. Jim notes that when Robert visits the office, he spends half of his time working out of the conference room, and occasionally ventures out and wanders around, randomly choosing employees to have conversations with, an experience that Jim describes as simultaneously terrifying and highly desirable. Robert makes a list of all the workers in the office, dividing them between perceived \\"Winners\\" and \\"Losers\\"; after finishing the list, he takes the winners out to lunch. When confronted about the list, after he and the winners return, he states that those are his impressions, and they could change, challenging the office with: \\"winners: prove me right; losers: prove me wrong\\". Andy later intercedes on behalf of the 'losers', making a new list on his team of 'winners' relaying their positive and productive qualities observed over years in the office and from being their supervisor; Robert appears to gain respect for Andy's effort, as it unites the office around him. During \\"The Incentive\\", Andy tries to get on Robert's good side by picking out a tie that he thinks will impress him. Robert challenges Andy to get the branch to double their sales with a motivational speech. Upon why he chose Andy for the job, he says of Andy that he is \\"all surface...uncomplicated, what you see is what you get\\" and that causes people to rally behind him, because he is an underdog. Robert later says, even if it's an underdog to unexceptional people. He also detects that Erin is attracted to Andy and tells Andy that he's aware of it, before saying he's already lost interest in that little tidbit of information. Andy organizes a garden party at Schrute Farms during \\"Garden Party\\", to impress him. When California arrives, various employees make attempts to make a good impression, most notably Ryan and Gabe, who offer him their jackets. California also discusses the possibility of holding his birthday party at Schrute Farms, with Dwight. In \\"Spooked\\", Robert brings his young son, Bert, to the office Halloween party. Throughout the episode, California attempts to figure out everyone's deepest fears, in order to tell a ghost story that simultaneously frightens the entire office, itself a conscious effort to prevent the staff from allowing fear to run their lives. During \\"Doomsday\\", Robert is unhappy after discovering that an accounting error allowed a billed order to go to a client for free. He orders Andy to correct the error and Andy turns to Dwight, who uses a system nicknamed \\"The Doomsday Device\\". The device will count the number of errors made in the office and will generate an email report to Robert. Dwight also reveals several e-mails that are unflattering of Robert, including Jim, Oscar and Kelly that all discuss his odd and intense personality. When the staff initiates an error e-mail report to Robert, Andy tasks Jim with intercepting him at his squash session. The ploy is successful, particularly when Dwight decides to stop sending the report after a crisis of conscience. However, Jim plays quite poorly against California, who is particularly skilled at the game. In \\"Pam's Replacement\\", he joins Andy, Darryl and Kevin's band with a surprising talent for the harmonica, but it gradually appears that when his musically talented friends come to play, the original trio are phased out. When Andy takes much of the staff to visit Gettysburg, Robert is elated to see those who stayed behind and calls them the \\"free thinkers\\". He then has a staff meeting where they will present all their best ideas. While he shoots down many of the ideas, Robert takes a shine to Kevin's cookie idea with the vending machine. Although he perceives Kevin's simple ideas as metaphors, he eventually realizes that Kevin is speaking literally. In the episode \\"Mrs. California,\\" Robert's wife, Susan (Maura Tierney) comes to the office looking for a job, something he does not want, although he pretends to help her out. Andy ends up giving her a job with accounting, enraging Robert. Andy then gets the staff to be mean to her to urge her to quit. She catches on and confronts Andy and her husband. Susan later asks Jim if Robert didn't want her working in the office. Though he does not answer, Jim says he loves working with his wife, Pam. Andy and Jim then leave the conference room as Robert and Susan sit and talk afterward. The episode ends with Susan talking to Andy later and asking him on a date. During \\"Christmas Wishes\\", it is revealed that Robert's marriage is ending in divorce, prompting him to become quite despondent and lonely. He arrives at the branch Christmas party in a track suit, despite wearing his normal dark blazer with hopes of being cheered up by the party, after the Sabre party is a bland affair. California becomes a bartender for the party and notices early on that Erin is visibly unhappy over Andy's new girlfriend. He assigns Oscar to take over and ends up comforting Erin, who ended up intoxicated and arguing with Andy. Robert drives her home, hugs her and gives her advice on how to cure her hangover, much to the relief of Andy who trails them in Meredith's car as her designated driver. In \\"Trivia\\", Dwight travels to Florida to meet with Robert for an interview over a potential manager position. However, a two-faced Robert says he now can't meet with Dwight and will have him meet with another executive. Robert secretly calls Gabe to tell Dwight that the executive can't meet him either, and to have Gabe listen to Dwight's proposal as a manager before rejecting it. Frustrated, Dwight manages to force Gabe into directing him toward Robert's condo and calling him out. When Dwight finally meets with him, it is revealed that the CEO has a hired wrestling partner once a month as a form of exercise, a task that he performs in his apartment before Gabe and Dwight. When they later discuss Dwight's proposal, he attempts to put Dwight down easily by offering him his grandfather's war medal in lieu of a manager's position. Dwight initially seems taken before snapping out of it, and telling Robert that he came for an interview, \\"Not a flea market\\". California is then prompted to tell Dwight that he's better as a salesman than he is a Manager, but when and if something comes up, he will let Dwight try it out. Dwight seems pleased with this, before Robert says \\"Get the hell out of my house\\". In \\"Pool Party\\", after Robert decides to sell his mansion following his divorce, Kevin suggests that he throw an office pool party, which he acts upon, as a last hurrah. At the party, Robert gives Ryan, Gabe, Oscar, Toby and reluctant Jim, a tour of his home. Throughout most of the tour, Robert opines about the parties he never had. Upon returning to the pool area, Robert erroneously believes the atmosphere to be that of an orgy, at which point he undresses and jumps into the pool, completely nude, and only followed by Ryan and Gabe. At the end of the episode, a drunken Robert dances to erotic music with them, in his home theater. In \\"Special Project\\", while he is not seen, he texts Jim, inviting him on the trip to Tallahassee. Jim and Pam attempt to respectfully reject his offer, by informing him that, as a father of two infant children, Jim should remain in Scranton. However, Robert responds to this by texting back \\"LOL\\" (Laugh Out Loud). Jim and Pam eventually agree that Jim should just go. Robert appears in \\"Last Day in Florida\\", accompanying Dwight, Jim, and Nellie Bertram on a golf outing celebrating Dwight's new Vice President position. After playing, Robert stuns Jim by revealing that he dislikes the business plan for the Sabre store, and that he had only approved of it because Jo Bennett wanted it. But with the knowledge that Sabre products are inferior and will illuminate the fact that the store is a failure, he plans to sandbag it at a high-level meeting of the Sabre company board, and also strongly hints that, despite liking Dwight, he is going to fire him over it. Later, after Jim stops Dwight from attending the meeting, Nellie appoints Todd Packer as Vice President in his place. During the meeting, Robert chastises Packer for the failure of the store, pretending that the Sabre store itself was a great concept, but that Packer botched in execution. While Packer protests that he has only been Vice President for half an hour, and that Dwight is to blame, Robert commends Dwight for being smart enough not to show up at the meeting, and terminates Packer. Robert and Nellie's interactions also hint that the two might be attracted to one another. In \\"Get the Girl\\", to the employees' surprise, Robert allows Nellie to have a job at the Scranton branch. Despite the fact that Andy is already employed as Regional Manager, Nellie declares herself the new Manager and takes over the position. However, Robert is unable to stand up to her, and instead takes on a detached Darwinian view of her antics. In \\"Welcome Party\\", Robert forces the office to throw a welcome party for Nellie, and, throughout the episode, he makes very obvious attempts to make a good impression on her. In \\"Angry Andy\\", Andy enlists Robert to give him his job back from Nellie by claiming it was an interim position for her. Nellie refuses, but manipulates Robert by flirtatiously hinting that she is attracted to him. Robert then stays detached from their conflict until Andy has an anger outburst, in which he throws his chair at Robert and then punches his hand through the wall over Nellie stealing his job. Robert then chooses Nellie as the branch Manager and demotes Andy to a position that they will create for him. When he tells Andy and Erin this, Andy calmly says \\"no\\", to which Robert replies that he will fire Andy if he keeps saying \\"no\\", and asks if he has anything else to say. Andy replies \\"no\\", and Robert fires him. In \\"Fundraiser\\", Angela's husband, the State Senator Robert Lipton, hosts a silent auction fundraiser for aging dogs. Robert purchases two tables so the Scranton branch can attend, of which Erin brings Andy with her. This leads to an awkward situation when Andy, in an emotional crisis, causes an argument with Robert. Robert in turn, politely makes an offer to treat Andy and Erin out for their own romantic dinner. When Andy rejects it, Robert tells Andy that he should leave. As he is about to make a speech at the fundraiser, Andy interrupts his former boss and volunteers to adopt the 12 dogs brought by the animal activists. In \\"Turf War\\", while celebrating the finalization of his divorce, Robert drunkenly shuts down the Binghamton branch in Binghamton. Meanwhile, Andy decides to land an important client as a \\"rogue\\" and jumpstart his Dunder Mifflin comeback by using his success as leverage with Robert. After Nellie reveals to Robert that he sent her a sexually suggestive voicemail, Robert tasks Pam to find out what the voicemail entailed. Pam manages to steal her cellphone, however, as Robert goes through Nellie's messages, Pam relents and tells Robert that she will not help him anymore. The two struggle over the phone, but Pam manages to delete the messages before Robert can hear his voicemail. Later, Andy calls Robert, after having stolen his largest client, and offers him the client back if Robert will rehire him. Robert is furious with his former employee's attempt at blackmail, and tells Andy that he does not even know his real name, proclaiming that he is \\"The fucking lizard king\\". At the end of the episode, when Jim and Dwight talk with Harry Jannerone, an employee from the Syracuse branch, Jannerone predicts that Robert will ruin the company within six months. In \\"Free Family Portrait Studio\\", Robert is surprised when he learns that David Wallace is purchasing Dunder Mifflin. He then quickly introduces himself to David as \\"Bob Kazamakis\\", and offers to brief him on the company. After talking with him in the conference room, David announces that Robert is leaving, but that he will be working on an important new charity: seeing college-aged girls (particularly gymnasts) in developing countries on their paths through to college. Wallace also mentions that he has donated one million dollars in matching funds for Robert's three-year-long mission. Robert then bids Andy goodbye, kisses him on the mouth, and states that \\"It's been a great year\\". Development James Spader first appeared on The Office in the episode \\"Search Committee\\". He was originally expected to be just a one-time guest star, as the producers were planning to hire either Catherine Tate or Will Arnett for the series, but neither could commit due to their involvement with other projects. In an interview with Digital Spy, Spader stated \\"I never really considered whether I would do more [episodes]. \\"Then....suddenly [the producers] called me back again and said, 'We'd really... like your character to come back in some capacity'\\". While Spader was initially hired as the replacement for Steve Carell in the series, Spader's presence actually filled the void of two departed actors: Carell, and Kathy Bates, who left the show in order to focus on her starring role in the NBC drama Harry's Law. Spader was also the second actor to receive an \\"And\\" credit, after Amy Ryan, during her appearances in season seven. Spader stated in an interview that he only took the role in order to supplement his income after working on Lincoln, which he stated paid little due to the size of the cast. He only ever intended for his role to last one season. On February 28, 2012, Spader announced that he would be departing from the show at the end of its eighth season. The season eight finale, \\"Free Family Portrait Studio\\", marked his final appearance in the series. Reception The character of Robert California was met with acclaim during his guest appearance on the season 7 finale \\"Search Committee\\". In the IGN review for \\"Search Committee\\", Cindy White cited the guest appearance by Spader as being the \\"meatiest part [of the episode]\\", comparing Robert's role of the \\"dominating boss\\" to that of Spader's similar character in Secretary. In James Poniewozik's review of the episode, he wrote that \\"James Spader killed as an overqualified candidate who was creepily perceptive\\". While his review was less favorable, Alan Sepinwall wrote that he found \\"Spader's persuasive evil genius to be somewhat amusing\\". Seth Abramovitch, of TV.com, wrote that he enjoyed Spader's \\"mildly sociopathic (but highly effective)\\" portrayal of Robert. In her review, Kaili Markley wrote that Spader's appearance in the episode was the \\"high point of the show\\" for her. BuddyTVs Meghan Carlson wrote that Spader was \\"the most memorable and impressive guest\\". Spader's acting had been particularly lauded by his fellow Office cast members. In an interview with Huffington Post, Brian Baumgartner stated that \\"the energy [Spader] has is so totally different. The writers have done really a great job. He has these demented arguments that on the surface make no sense, but he's talking, and suddenly and you're like, 'Oh yeah, that's right! That's right!'\\". In the same interview, Kate Flannery commented that Spader \\"has this grounded intensity that we've never seen on our show before that makes these kind of little Scranton peons stand at attention\\". In an interview with NBC Chicago.com, Angela Kinsey praised Spader's portrayal of California, stating \\"He is amazing. Our first table read with him was a week before we went back and at that moment I was like, 'Oh, we're going to be just fine'. He crushed the table read. He brings such a cool, amazing, intensity as Robert California that's so different from Michael Scott. Michael wanted everyone to love him. Robert California wants to run the best company in the world, and to see him turn that kind of intensity onto Kevin Malone was cracking me up. I just love him as this character. And it's been really fun to watch Dwight and Robert California act\\". Paul Lieberstein was pleased that Spader would be joining the cast in the eighth season, stating that \\"James has an energy that is completely his own, and 'The Office' has no tools for dealing with this guy. We're thrilled he's joining our cast\\". On July 28, 2011, Rainn Wilson favorably tweeted, when referring to Spader's acting on the series, \\"[he's] Killing it!!!!\\". Former leading actor Steve Carell was also impressed by the decision to hire Spader, stating in an interview with Access Hollywood, \\"I think it's an excellent choice. I think it's great and he will infuse all this new energy into the show\\". However, as time passed, critics, even ones who had initially praised Robert, began to respond negatively to the character. In his review for the episode \\"Gettysburg\\", Chris Plante, of New York, critiqued the way that Robert, as well as Andy, were being written, writing, \\"That isn't to say every character has been fleshed out well. [...] Andy and California seem off point.\\" In his review for \\"Mrs. California\\", Plante called Robert the worst part of The Office. While initially reacting positively to the character, by the episode \\"Doomsday\\", Seth Abramovitch wrote that \\"Spader's character is a lot more successful a fit than Will Ferrell's, whose brand of comedy was just too broad, too surreal for the Dunder-Mifflin crew. Robert California has definitely added some menace and mystery to the proceedings. He's funny, too. But the way the show is using him so far‚Äîsparingly, as an aloof, omniscient, and fearsome motivator‚Äîis essentially as nothing more than a plot instigator, and it's doing nothing to enrich the series. It's also getting repetitive\\". In his Hitfix blog, Alan Sepinwall wrote that \\"Robert California could have become the new comic engine that drove the series, but the character has been neutered from his first appearance. Instead of a lunatic capable of performing the Jedi mind trick, he's just an inscrutable eccentric, who wanders around looking amused at everything the branch is up to, and whom no one can get a read on\\". Myles McNutt, of The A.V. Club, criticized Robert's role as one \\"that the narrative reacts to as opposed to something actually involved in the narrative\\". Saloon.coms Matt Zoller Seitz wrote that \\"The Office loses something by having Spader's Zen master drive the action instead of Michael Scott\\", he also suggested that, perhaps, if Robert was still positioned as Regional Manager, instead of CEO, the series might be more enjoyable. In response to this, Myles McNutt wrote \\"It may just be me, but I'm not convinced that Spader's presence has been as prominent as Seitz suggests. While I would agree that Robert California alters the tone and rhythm of the series when he is present, he isn't present particularly often (and wasn't present at all during what Seitz and I would both identify as the season's strongest episode, \\"Lotto\\") and, even when he is present, he isn't really being developed as a character with motivations or multi- dimensionality. His omniscience is valuable on some level, but it also creates a distance between the character and the narrative, which makes me reluctant to consider him as Carell's replacement (which is what Seitz suggests in his piece). In truth, and picking up on something I suggested last week, I think I would be enjoying this season a lot more if Spader were positioned as Carell's replacement, and we were seeing the season from his perspective\\". In White's review of \\"Last Day in Florida\\", she wrote that \\"As for Robert's return, I don't think it's a coincidence that the weakest episode of this otherwise strong [Florida story arc] was the only one in which he appeared. [...] Robert has had his moments of brilliance in the past, but this wasn't one of them. He was merely a tool here, and yeah, I mean that in both senses. It's pretty clear by this time that the writers have never quite gotten a handle on the character or figured out how to use him properly since he joined the cast. With Spader leaving at the end of this season, that won't be a problem for much longer. In the meantime, we have to put up with a character who is all over the map. One week he's quirky and zen, the next week he might be vulnerable and mopey, the next he's a ruthless, calculating executive. There's still some time to pin him down by the season finale, it's just hard to imagine at this point\\". In her review of the season 8 finale, she wrote \\"At least we saw that last of Robert California, who walked away with $1 million to travel around Europe educating gymnasts. Um, okay. I'm too pleased to see him go to care about the logistics\\".

It is endemic to Tennessee in the United States, where it is known only from Wilson County.Lesquerella perforata. The Nature Conservancy. This very rare plant is threatened by the loss and degradation of its habitat.USFWS. Lesquerella perforata Recovery Plan. September 2006. It is federally listed as an endangered species. Description This is an annual herb growing mostly erect to a height of 10 to 15 centimeters. The leaves are auriculate (ear- shaped), up to 5 centimeters long by 1.5 wide, and have toothed or lobed edges. They are usually hairy. The flowers have white or lavender petals with a yellow tinge at the bases. The fruit is an inflated silique drying to a papery texture and measuring about half a centimeter wide.Paysonia perforata. Flora of North America. This species is similar to Paysonia stonensis, another Tennessee endemic, from which it differs only in the arrangement of hairs on its fruits. Natural History This plant only grows in the Central Basin of Tennessee, where there are 21 known occurrences in Wilson County. The occurrences are almost all located on the floodplains of two or three creeks within a five-mile radius of Lebanon. The plant is adapted to a regime of periodic flooding as the creeks swell. The scouring action of the floodwaters maintain a floodplain that is clear of perennial grasses and large or woody vegetation that would otherwise take hold and compete with the bladderpod. Large sections of this floodplain region have been converted to agricultural use, and the soil disturbance created by plowing has replaced the natural disturbance of flooding. Certain agricultural practices do not adversely affect the plant, such as delaying spring plowing until the time of year when the plant has finished its reproduction. The fruit is mature and splits to release seeds in late April and early May. Other practices, such as no-till farming, do not favor the plant's growth because they do not produce the soil disturbance that it would require in nature. Plowing the soil during times of the year when this annual plant has not yet matured and set seed can prevent the species' propagation. The floodplain soil is silty and overlies limestone substrates. The habitat includes natural floodplains and farm land such as crop fields and pastures. Other rare plants in the Nashville Basin include Boechera perstellata, Dalea foliosa, Dalea gattingeri, and Echinacea tennesseensis.Lesquerella perforata. Center for Plant Conservation. Conservation The lack of disturbance in the habitat causes its degradation by allowing the encroachment of large vegetation that crowds out the annual plants. The habitat in this region is being destroyed outright, however, by other processes, particularly the development of residential, commercial, and industrial complexes and associated utilities such as water lines and sewers. The plant's range is on the outer fringe of the Nashville metropolitan area, which is undergoing rapid growth. These threats prompted the addition of this plant to the endangered species list of the US.

Nelson, 562 U.S. 134 (2011), is a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States holding that NASA's background checks of contract employees did not violate any constitutional privacy right. Background In 2004, President George W. Bush, on the recommendation of the 9/11 Commission, issued a directive ordering new, uniform identification standards for federal employees, including contract employees. Previously, federal contract employees were not generally required to undergo background investigation, except as required by specific contracts. Pursuant to this directive, the Department of Commerce mandated that contract employees with long-term access to federal facilities must complete a background check and set an October 2007 deadline for completion of this effort. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), a NASA facility that is operated by the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) under government contract and hence is staffed entirely by contract employees, was subject to this requirement. In January 2007, NASA modified its contract with Caltech to include a new background-check requirement. All employees of JPL, including those deemed in low-risk positions, were informed that they must complete OPM form SF-85, which included an open-ended authorization to release effectively all personal information, or else they would be voluntarily terminated. In August 2007, 28 JPL scientists and engineers including lead plaintiff Robert \\"Half\\" Nelson, a senior research scientist at JPL, sued NASA, Caltech, and the Department of Commerce in the District Court for the Central District of California, alleging that the background-check requirement violated a constitutional right to informational privacy. The district court denied a motion for a preliminary injunction, but the Ninth Circuit reversed the district court's order. The circuit court held that portions of the background-check forms were likely unconstitutional, particularly portions requiring disclosure of drug treatment or counseling (which the court questioned whether the government had a legitimate interest in requiring), as well as open-ended questions soliciting \\"any adverse information\\" concerning financial integrity, mental stability, and \\"other matters\\" (which the court doubted were narrowly tailored to meet legitimate interests). The Ninth Circuit later denied rehearing en banc. The government appealed, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari. Opinion of the Court The issue before the Supreme Court was whether the background checks required of the JPL employees violated a right to informational privacy. In two previous cases, Whalen v. Roe and Nixon v. General Services Administration, the Supreme Court hinted that such a right might exist, but it had never settled the issue definitively. In an 8‚Äì0 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the NASA background checks did not violate any such constitutional privacy right that might exist. The majority of the Supreme Court decided to leave open the question of whether any such constitutional right exists. Taking an approach similar to the Court in Whalen, they assumed, without deciding, that such a right does exist, and then ruled that the background checks do not violate such a right. In particular, they found that the government has a legitimate and long-standing interest in conducting reasonable employment background checks and said that courts should \\"keep those interests in mind when asked to go line-by-line through the Government‚Äôs employment forms and to scrutinize the choice and wording of the questions they contain\\". In addition, the Court found that the government's interests do not hinge on the distinction between federal civil-service employees and federal contract employees; the contract employees at JPL perform critical work, and the government has a strong interest in carrying out background checks on them. Justice Scalia, in a concurring opinion joined by Justice Thomas, agreed that the background checks did not violate any constitutional rights, but argued that the Court should have settled the constitutional privacy question‚Äîin the negative. Scalia accused the respondents of asking the Court \\"to invent a constitutional right out of whole cloth\\" and dismissed their position as \\"farcical\\". Scalia criticized the Court's decision to evade the constitutional question, writing: \\"Thirty-three years have passed since the Court first suggested that the right may, or may not, exist. It is past time for the Court to abandon this Alfred Hitchcock line of our jurisprudence.\\" In addition to joining Scalia, Thomas also filed his own, very short (single-paragraph) concurrence, objecting to the idea of a constitutional right to informational privacy. It was later revealed that Alito, who wrote the opinion of the Court, had cited a false statistic to justify the background checks. Alito cited a statistics by the National Association of Professional Background Screeners saying 88 percent of private companies conduct background checks. An investigation by ProPublica found that this statistic was made up.

Hochkirch et al. observed the reproductive interference between T. ceperoi and T. subulata, a neighbor and closely related species. Often two species that are very similar and share similar habitats are able to coexist, but do so at the cost of one species eventually being displaced by the interaction and experience lower fitness. Before one is displaced, the two species can go through intense competition. Two different ways animals can experience competition could be resource competition and reproductive competition. Resource competition could consist of fighting for food or territorial locations strategically safe from harm whether that be from predators or weather. Reproductive competition is the result of similar species exhibiting similar mating and courting systems. T. ceperoi shares some common territory with T. subulata because of common habitat requirements, however they do not \\"co-occur locally\\". Experiments were conducted by based on the mechanisms of coexistence to better understand the interaction because previous \\"in lab\\" and \\"in the wild\\" experiments disagreed. This study had four primary ways of attacking the question of how reproductive interference was handled. First, they studied wild ground hoppers in order to understand the magnitude and sexual interaction of species in the wild. Second, they analyzed if the species used different micro habitats, which was important because it could lead to \\"segregation on a micro-scale\\". Third, they mapped where and in what amounts each species was present in relation to food sources in order to see if there was any type of segregation or aggregation. Lastly, they experimentally changed the different habitats in order to see if the spatial distribution was a reflection of the \\"micro-habitat preferences\\". One theory of temporal segregation was able to be ruled out immediately based on the fact that both species are diurnal. If one had been nocturnal, while the other was diurnal, the temporal patterns of each species could be deemed the way reproductive interference was battled. Next, the species courting actions could be separated based on the movements of their body. T. ceperoi performed \\"pronotal bobbing\\", which is basically quick movement of the hind legs and the covering of the first thoracic segment. T. subulata on the other hand must simply swing their body both laterally and frontally, spending less energy than T. ceperoi, to mate. The study conducted in Emsland, Germany, was conducted between 10:30 and 17:00 on 116 individuals for thirty-minute increments. Results showed that males, who are inclined to court anything that is about their size and moves, more often attempted to court females. However, the females that were the receivers of the attention were not limited to the species of the male, indicating heterospecific interactions. Furthermore from the female standpoint, T. ceperoi females fought off heterospecific interactions more than T. subulata, who performed defensive maneuvers equally towards heterospecific interactions as well as conspecific. Microhabitat preference analysis results yielded T. subulata enjoyed taller vegetation areas with more ground cover than T. ceperoi. This is important because Hochkirch et al. believe although resource and reproductive competition play a huge role in the interspecies interaction, the costs can be offset by different habitat factors such as segregative mechanisms, dilution effects, and life history effects. In accordance with Wertheim et al., the results showed coexistence can be explained by intraspecific aggregations despite the presence or absence of unequally distributed resources.Wertheim, B. et al. 2000. Species diversity in a mycophagous insect community: the case of spatial aggregation vs resource partitioning. J. Anim. Ecol. 69:335-351. Lastly, the group was able to determine the reason for difference between testing done in the lab versus testing done in the wild could most likely be accredited with the increased number of forced heterospecific interactions due to small arenas in the lab testing. This conclusion further indicated that reproductive interference is density dependent, which was in accordance with previous studies.Kuno E. 1992. Competitive exclusion through reproductive interference. Res. Popul. Ecol. 34: 275_284.Westman, K. et al. 2002.

Sexual dimorphism T. ceperoi males are able to distinguish between similar species, but not between sexes, due to a rather large sexual dimorphism. Sexual dimorphism is the different characteristics present in individuals of the same species, but opposite sexes. The sexual dimorphism between the two sexes is a result of a single additional instar in the female larval stages. This indicates the male emerges sooner than the female and therefore can link the larger size to the additional period of growth. T. ceperoi is not unique in its apparent sexual dimorphism, as many Orthoptera present the similar traits of females averaging 9% larger than males. T. ceperoi is a member of the Caelifera suborder, in which sexual size dimorphism is about 37% strong and ranges from -20%-140% across the suborder. One important fact to take note of is the females in this suborder are larger than males, while males conserve a comparable height across species, which is different from the Ensifera sexual dimorphism where females are comparable and male size decreases. Sexual dimorphism causes resource competition as a result of \\"niche breadth and dispersion pattern\\". Sexual size dimorphism experimentsHochkirch et al.= The dimorphism in the order could either be a result of intersexual competition or differential equilibrium.Hochkirch, A. and Groning, J. Sexual Size dimorphism in Orthoptera. Journal of Orthoptera Research 2008, 17 (2): 189-196. Intersexual competition refers to the sexes feeding on different resources in order to reduce the competition within the species, while differential equilibrium refers to the different body sizes as a result of the opposing strategies of each sex to increase fitness. Females tend to lay more eggs and invest more time in those specific eggs directly opposing males who in order to increase their own fitness, spend less time on a specific group of eggs, and attempt to fertilise as many eggs as possible. The differential equilibrium hypothesis is well supported; however it cannot be deemed the clear answer because not enough experiments have tested intersexual competition. One problem with comparing these two different hypotheses comes from the chance that dimorphic niches may have evolved from something in the past that is no longer present today, also known as \\"ghost of competition past\\" by Connell.Connell J.H. 1980. Diversity and the coevolution of competitors, or the ghost of competition past. Oikos 35: 131-138. Information was collected from 3 main databases, which spanned 1503 species of Oriental and African Orthoptera, to determine females were larger in the majority of the 99.6% of the species. Another hypothesis was that perhaps the temperature controlled the growth of Orthoptera, which would be in accordance with previous data that Omocestus viridulus had the additional instar stage in only low altitude areas of the Alps.Berner D., Blanckenhorn W.U. 2006. Grasshopper ontogeny in relation to time constraints: adaptive divergence and stasis. Journal of Animal Ecology 75: 130-139. The study concludes with numerous theories, but decides there is not sufficient research to determine the exact cause of sexual size dimorphism in Orthoptera. =Krause et al.= The sexual dimorphism is believed to be a result of the different niches selected by each sex.Ingrisch S, K√∂hler G (1998) Die Heuschrecken Mitteleuropas. Westarp Wissenschaften, Magdeburg The choice between habitats for each sex has been hypothesised by Krause et al. to be a result of the reproductive costs and activities. Krause et al. discovered males flock to brighter areas and are on bare ground (which is used during mating) more than females. Females on the other hand \\"rest and feed on the vegetation\\". These different places probably evolved due to the males who put themselves in danger of predation accruing greater chances at mating, while females enjoy nutrients to provide healthier offspring. Diet The diet of T. ceperoi is composed of moss and various plants. The common mosses eaten by T. ceperoi include Bryum argenteum, B. caespiticum, Ceratodon purpureus and Barbula sp..SCRIPRA FACULTATIS RERUM NATURALIUM ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES UNIVERSITATIS OSTRAVIENSIS, 186, 2008 AND BIOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT IV 348 Bryophagy in the groundhopper Tetrix ceperoi (Orthoptera: Tetrigidae): analysis of alimentary tract contents Petr KO_AREK, ≈†arka GRUCMANOVA, Zuzana FILIPCOVA, Lenk BRADOVA, Vit_zslav PLA≈†EK & Jaroslav HOLU≈†A Less common diet choices include grasses, algae, and sometimes animal fragments and organic debris. Reproduction Throughout May and June, Male insects of the Orthoptera order lure females to them using mating sounds, and then forcibly insert their sperm directly into the female‚Äôs abdomen.http://animals.jrank.org/pages/2369/Grasshoppers-Crickets-Katydids- Orthoptera-BEHAVIOR-REPRODUCTION.html However, another source notes that Tetrigidae do not have tympanums and are unable to stridulate, but still display courtship behaviours for the female.Hochkirch A, Deppermann J, Gr√∂ning J (2006) Visual communication behavior of three pygmy grasshoppers (Orthoptera, Tetrigidae). J Insect Behav 19:559‚Äì571 Since T. ceperoi is both Orthoptera and Tetrigidae, it seems there is some discontinuity and more research must be done to clear up the discrepancy. The sperm packet inserted into the female constitutes about 60% of the males' body weight. Sperm packages are important because they are a nuptial gift given to the female in exchange for mating. Nuptial gifts are packages put together by the male in order to be able to mate with the female. The female has the choice to accept the sperm package and mate, or deny it and wait for a more suitable candidate. The sperm package might seem like an entirely selfless and generous gift of the male in order to mate, but in reality, the nutrients in the sperm package provide nutrition for the female and therefore benefit the male‚Äôs offspring which increases his fitness. Moreover, nuptial gifts fulfill the selfish nature of most animal behaviours.

Created for David Loew's Enterprise Productions, it was the first of three films distributed by Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer after parting ways with United Artists, and was the last of four films made by Dana Andrews for director Milestone. Background After the expensive flop of Arch of Triumph bankrupted Enterprise Productions, a film which United Artists called \\"probably the greatest commercial failure in the history of motion pictures\\", No Minor Vices was conceived as a means to keep Enterprise going until all possible revenues could be gotten from Arch of Triumph. Enterprise co-founder Charles Einfeld gave Lewis Milestone the title No Minor Vices and suggested he create film to go with it. Milestone called in friends to make the film, with Dana Andrews even investing some of his own money in the project, but losing his investment when the film bombed. Andrews felt that part of No Minor Vices poor box office showings were due to the film being released by MGM rather than by United Artists, and with MGM not doing a decent a job in promoting as might have UA. Milestone chose to \\"play it safe\\" with the film. In order to keep audiences interested in the simple plot line, Milestone would sometimes cut to a scene that had a little man in a window making cigars and reacting to things that had nothing to do with the scene just intercut. Film editor Robert Parrish reported that if a scene was lousy, Milestone could cut to this little guy, but the running gag was not enough upon which to build a film. No Minor Vices kept Enterprise alive as a company, but money was tight. Plot Successful pediatrician Perry Ashwell (Dana Andrews) takes his attractive wife April (Lilli Palmer) and their conservative lifestyle for granted. When he allows artist Octavio Quaglini (Louis Jourdan) into their lives to sketch their \\"inner selves\\", Octavio becomes enamoured with April and tries to steal her away from Perry.

Mercury transiting the Sun as viewed by the Curiosity rover on Mars (June 3, 2014).  Overview  The word is often used in reference to the Sun, Earth, and either the Moon or a planet, where the latter is in conjunction or opposition. Solar and lunar eclipses occur at times of syzygy, as do transits and occultations. The term is often applied when the Sun and Moon are in conjunction (new moon) or opposition (full moon). The word syzygy is often used to describe interesting configurations of astronomical objects in general. For example, one such case occurred on March 21, 1894, around 23:00 GMT, when Mercury transited the Sun as would have been seen from Venus, and Mercury and Venus both simultaneously transited the Sun as seen from Saturn. It is also used to describe situations when all the planets are on the same side of the Sun although they are not necessarily in a straight line, such as on March 10, 1982. On June 3, 2014, the Curiosity rover on Mars observed the planet Mercury transiting the Sun, marking the first time a planetary transit has been observed from a celestial body besides Earth.  Occultations, transits, and eclipses  Syzygy sometimes results in an occultation, transit, or eclipse. * An occultation occurs when an apparently larger body passes in front of an apparently smaller one. * A transit occurs when a smaller body passes in front of a larger one. ** In the combined case where the smaller body regularly transits the larger, an occultation is also termed a secondary eclipse. * An eclipse occurs when a body totally or partially disappears from view, either by an occultation, as with a solar eclipse, or by passing into the shadow of another body, as with a lunar eclipse (thus both are listed on NASA's eclipse page). Transits and occultations of the Sun by Earth's Moon are called solar eclipses regardless of whether the Sun is completely or partially covered. By extension, transits of the Sun by a satellite of a planet may also be called eclipses, as with the transits of Phobos and Deimos shown on NASA's JPL photojournal, as may the passage of a satellite into the planet's shadow, as with this eclipse of Phobos. The term eclipse is also used more generally for bodies passing in front of one another. For example, a NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day refers to the Moon eclipsing and occulting Saturn interchangeably.  Einstein ring  As electromagnetic rays are somewhat bent by gravitation, when they pass by a heavy mass they are bent. Thus, the heavy mass acts as a form of gravitational lens. If the light source, the gravitating mass and the observer stand in a line, one sees what is termed an Einstein ring.  Tidal variation  Syzygy causes the bimonthly phenomena of spring and neap tides. At the new and full moon, the Sun and Moon are in syzygy. Their tidal forces act to reinforce each other, and the ocean both rises higher and falls lower than the average. Conversely, at the first and third quarter, the Sun and Moon are at right angles, their tidal forces counteract each other, and the tidal range is smaller than average. Tidal variation can also be measured in the earth's crust, and this may affect the frequency of earthquakes.

Its first location was the Casona building of the Universidad de Guayaquil. The area around the historical Pe√±as area provided a central location in the city, and the buildings in that area were bought by ESPOL with an initial payment of 12 million sucres. In 1969, the Quinto Guayas Battalion gave ESPOL the area between the Sim√≥n Bol√≠var embankment and Loja Street, where the four engineering departments were located. In 1973, the Ecuadorian marines moved from their base in Guayaquil, and in their place, new installations for the Facultad de Ingenieria Maritima y Ciencias del Mar were constructed.  Campuses  In 1995, ESPOL moved from its historic campus to the new campus on the outskirts of the city. The new campus was more than in size and included a protected forest that the university took over.  Twenty-first century  ln 2009, ESPOL began construction of the Parque del Conocimiento (Knowledge Park), where the research centers of ESPOL will be located. Also in 2009, ESPOL built buildings to host the prepolitenico (first year general studies). In 2010, ESPOL started the construction of the new EDCON building.  Campuses = Campus de Pe√±as  2.5 ha in size and located near the historical center of Guayaquil, Las Pe√±as campus was the center of academic life. Almost everything was moved into the Gustavo Galindo campus for the 2011-2012 academic year.  Campus Gustavo Galindo  724 ha in size, the Gustavo Galindo Campus is the main and largest campus. Its location on the Via Perimetral highway eases access to commuting students. The central administration of the university and research centers are located there. Its infrastructure is the result of a development plan, the Plan de Desarrollo (1983‚Äì1992) as well as the creation of the new PARCON.  Campus Via de la Costa  The Campus Via de la Costa, located on the coast of the Santa Elena province, hosts the CENAIM-ESPOL Foundation and maritime-related research and degree programs.  Academics = Schools and colleges  COPOL = The Polytechnic High School (Colegio Politecnico) is a secondary educational institution linked and colocated with the university.

In 2013, the festival moved location from its original location in Avon to Winter Park. The 3rd edition of the festival took place March 8‚Äì10. Outreach Organizers of Snow Ball decided to have an event not only centered around music, but a bigger cause as well. They partnered with the non-profit organization, The Realm of Caring, to raise money to help fund the education of music in elementary schools. For the 2013 festival, a limited edition t-shirt (featuring the festival's unofficial moose mascot) was sold with a portion of the profits benefiting Pencils of Promise‚Äîa non-profit organization that builds schools and increases educational opportunities in the developing world.

Construction Capt. Dora Wells Troutman Dode was originally the schooner William J. Bryant. Prior to construction as the Dode, the Bryant had been one of a flotilla of Gold Rush ships sent to Alaska. Most of the vessels were older, some had been pulled off mud flats and given a paint job, which led a newspaper of the time to call them \\"floating coffins.\\" In 1898, following return from Alaska, the Bryant was rebuilt into a propeller steamer for Capt. Dan Troutman's Hood Canal service. The rebuilt vessel was named Dode after his nickname for his wife, Dora Wells Troutman, who was also a licensed captain. The Troutmans owned a farm at the small Hood Canal town of Lilliwaup.Newell and Williamson, Pacific Steamships, at 98 and 103/ Captain Dan Troutman is reported to have mysteriously disappeared in 1899, forcing Dora Troutman to take over full management the Dode.Faber, Steamer's Wake, at 90, 106-107, 134, and 136. Hood Canal route By 1900, Dode was the only boat on the Hood Canal route, which started at Seattle and included landings at Kingston, Port Gamble, Seabeck, Brinnon, Holly, Dewatto, Lilliwaup Falls, Hoodsport and Union City. Dode typically left Pier 3 (now Pier 54) on a Tuesday, made all the stops on the run on that day, and then returned on the same route the next day to Seattle. Transfer to Bellingham interests In 1902, Captain C.E. Curtis acquired Dode, with plans to run the vessel with another steamer, the Willapa, which Curtis had acquired from the Canadian Pacific steamship service. Curtis, doing business as the Bellingham Bay Transportation Company, renamed Willapa as Bellingham. During 1903, the rapidly growing Puget Sound Navigation Co. acquired Bellingham Transportation Company, but Dode and Willapa did not go to PSN operational control until the spring of 1904. Collision and grounding On December 6, 1903, in heavy fog, Willapa, by then renamed Bellingham, was towing Dode to Whatcom for repairs, the vessels still being run by the Bellingham Bay company. The fast steamer Flyer pulled away from the Seattle dock en route to Tacoma and five minutes later Bellingham collided with Flyer. Dode, under tow and unable to maneuver, also collided with Flyer. Flyer was badly, but not irreparably damaged. No one was injured. Flyer's passengers were taken off by boats from nearby vessels. Shortly after Dode was taken over by PSN, the company was hit by a seaman's strike. The workers, who were seeking pay of $45 per month, shut down operation of all the company's boats for a while, but in the end they obtained their raise and returned to work. In 1904, with PSN now fully in control of the Bellingham company's boats, Dode was placed on routes connecting the various lumber company ports. On May 4, 1907, while proceeding in a heavy fog, Dode ran aground on Marrowstone Island near Fort Flagler. This proved to be not serious, as Dode was gotten off with only minor damage. Loss On July 20, 1910, Dode was lost permanently, striking a rock and sinking, again off Marrowstone Island.

It is located in the Free State of Saxony in Eastern Germany.  Reservoir  To create the Amselsee in Saxon Switzerland, in 1934 a stream, the Gr√ºnbach (or Amselgrundbach), the main waterbody in the Amselgrund valley, was impounded by the municipality of Rathen just above its confluence with the Wehlgrund that joins from the rights 1934. The dam is around five metres high. At 127 m above sea level the curved, narrow, roughly 550 m long trout pond is used in summer for boat rides (using slot machines!) as well as for fish breeding and also provides flood prevention. Round trips have been possible since 1969. The trout stock is sometimes mixed with American rainbow trout. Amongst the lakeside vegetation broad-winged damselflies or demoiselles may be seen.  Dam  The barrier is a straight gravity dam made of rubble stone masonry. It was built in 1934 and taken into service in 1935.

The service allows users to search for upcoming concert events in their area, and also track individual artists to receive notifications of upcoming shows in their area. The company was first established in 2007. as a Y Combinator-backed startup. In 2015, it merged with CrowdSurge‚Äîa company that provided services for running and managing ticket sales on behalf of artists. In 2017, the Songkick concert discovery service and brand was sold to WMG, while the ticketing assets were sold to Live Nation Entertainment in 2018 to settle a lawsuit with the company. History Songkick was founded in 2007 by Ian Hogarth, Michelle You and Pete Smith as part of the 2007 Y Combinator program, a seed accelerator that focuses on technology start-ups. Songkick's initial business model, based on its concert discovery service, was based on referral fees from ticketing companies. The company launched its first mobile application in 2011. In June 2015, Songkick merged with CrowdSurge, an artist ticketing services provider, with the combined company operating under the Songkick name. CrowdSurge was founded by Matt Jones in 2008, and he and Hogarth said they decided to merge the two companies to correct ‚Äúa massive inefficiency in the market.‚Äù Songkick had systems to detect ticket resellers, reduce the incentive for reselling (e.g., by creating general admissions areas, rather than assigned seats) and make it easier for regular fans to buy tickets (e.g., by having multiple releases of tickets, not just one release) that have reduced the percentage of concert tickets that end up in the secondary market to 1.5 percent of the total. Jones and Hogarth served as co- CEOs of Songkick until Jones took on the role of CEO in January 2016. In December 2016, Songkick filed an antitrust lawsuit against Live Nation Entertainment and its Ticketmaster division. The lawsuit was later amended to accuse it of stealing trade secrets, by means of former Songkick employees who had joined the company. In July 2017, Warner Music Group acquired Songkick, including its concert discovery service and brand, but excluding its ticketing business and associated \\"pending litigation\\". Songkick shuttered its ticketing business in October; Jones described Live Nation as having \\"effectively blocked our U.S. ticketing business\\". In January 2018, shortly prior to a pending trial, Live Nation settled the lawsuit for $110 million, and also acquired the remaining intellectual property not sold to WMG for an undisclosed amount.

Its roots are obscure, with some French attributes to the Norman Conquest of 1066, others to place names in England. Mottley is very frequently spelled as Motley and the two spellings are often incorrectly used interchangeably, causing some confusion. In general, Mottley tends to be Catholic, while Motley tends to be Protestant and more related to England. However, Mottley is listed in the Irish Catholic convert rolls of the mid 1700s which required Catholics in Ireland to adhere to English rule. Mottley apparently arrived in Ireland from England during Oliver Cromwell's 1649 Irish conquests and concentrated in Counties Carlow, Laois, Wicklow. In the 1916 Irish Easter uprising, a Private W. Mottley was wounded in battle. Mottley can also be encountered in the Caribbean and in Virginia. A large portion of the New World Mottleys, especially Motleys, are of mixed African descent.

Life He was the son of Colonel Thomas Mottley, a Jacobite adherent of James II in his exile, who entered the service of Louis XIV, and was killed at the battle of Turin in 1706; his mother was Dionisia, daughter of John Guise of Ablode Court, Gloucestershire. John was born in London, was educated at Archbishop Thomas Tenison's grammar school in the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields, and obtained a clerkship in the excise office in 1708. He was compelled to resign his post in 1720, and from that time gained a precarious subsistence by his pen. He died in 1750, having for some years previously been almost bedridden with gout. Works Title page for Joe Miller's Jests (1739), written by Mottley as Elijah Jenkins. He made his debut as a dramatic author with a tragedy in the pseudo-classic style, entitled The Imperial Captives, the scene of which is laid at Carthage, in the time of Genseric, who with the Empress Eudoxia and her daughter plays a principal part. The play was produced at the Theatre Royal, Lincoln's Inn Fields, in February 1719‚Äì20. At the same theatre was produced in April 1721 Mottley's only other effort in tragedy, Antiochus, based on the story of the surrender by Seleucus Nicator of his wife Stratonice to his son Antiochus. Both tragedies were printed on their production. In comedy Mottley was more successful. In a humorous vein are his dramatic opera, Penelope, in which he was assisted by Thomas Cooke (1703‚Äì1756), a satire on Alexander Pope's Odyssey, and his farce The Craftsman, or Weekly Journalist (both performed at the Haymarket, and printed in 1728 and 1729 respectively). His comedy, The Widow Bewitched, produced at Goodman's Fields Theatre in 1730, and printed, was a successful play. Mottley was joint author with Charles Coffey of the comic opera, The Devil to Pay, or The Wives Metamorphos'd, a ballad opera produced at Drury Lane on 6 August 1731, and frequently revived. Under the pseudonym of Robert Seymour he edited in 1734 (perhaps with the assistance of Thomas Cooke) John Stow's Survey of the Cities of London and Westminster (London, 2 volumes). Under the pseudonym of Elijah Jenkins he published in 1739 the classic jest-book, Joe Miller's Jests, or the Wit's Vade-Mecum (see Joe Miller). Mottley is also the author of two historical works: The History of the Life of Peter I, Emperor of Russia, London, 1739, 2 vols.; and The History of the Life and Reign of the Empress Catharine, containing a short History of the Russian Empire from its first Foundation to the Time of the Death of that Princess, London, 1744, 2 vols. He is the reputed author of the Compleat List of all the English Dramatic Poets and of all the Plays ever printed in the English Language to the Present Year 1747, appended to Thomas Whincop's Scanderbeg, from internal evidence it being clear he at least wrote the article on himself.

It was organized and opened to the public on April 13, 1919 by Mr. Guillermo Restun, the Chief Librarian from the Ilo-ilo Branch. The province of Cebu took charge of the initial collection and other maintenance and operating expenses. Since its establishment, the public library has been housed in many different buildings until in 1938 an edifice was inaugurated for the library. The Rizal Memorial Library and Museum Building became its permanent home. This entire three story building served as a fount of knowledge among education-conscious Cebuanos. When the Second World War broke out, the library was closed. The building was utilized as headquarters by the Japanese Army, and books were either dumped, ruined or stolen. In 1953, the institution was reopened due to public clamor. The Cebu City Government appropriated a budget for the library collection and other operating expenses. Close for Good In December 2008, an announcement was made by Cebu City Acting Mayor Mike Rama that Cebu City's Rizal Memorial Library would be closed for good. Pressure from Friends of the Cebu City Public Library, with the help of media exposure, led to the welcome news that the building would be renovated for three to six months and the library restored.

Shiny silver ink surrounds the flowers, a very light blue ink is used for the sky, and several types of printing are combined, with the various inks using different methods. Biography Kronheim was born on October 26, 1810 in Magdeburg, Germany. By the age of 22 he resided in Edinburgh, and died at the age of 85 in 1896, in Berlin. Kronheim & Co. During the mid-1860s, Kronheim and Co. printed hundreds of biblical prints, adding to the firm's eventual total output of as many as 5000 different prints. Kronheim & Co. utilized the Baxter process to create prints. Kronheim's chief innovation in the field was the use of zinc instead of wood blocks, which reduced the amount of time needed to complete prints, but resulted in a less shiny finish. By 1855, thanks in large part to the firm's use of zinc blocks, Kronheim & Co. had produced over 1000 different prints, including some for the 1855 Paris Exhibition. After the exhibition, Kronheim sold his share of the business to Oscar Frauenknecht. Kronheim retired to Germany and attempted to set up other printing businesses, including an American one. However, these efforts failed, causing Kronheim to lose all of his investments. So, he rejoined Frauenknecht and his old firm, Kronheim & Co., but not as a partner. The firm expanded into Manchester and Glasgow. In 1875, due to the rise of steam power and steam lithography machines, Kronheim & Co. ceased using the Baxter process. Kronheim worked under Frauenknecht for Kronheim and Co. until 1887. Legacy and Criticism Kronheim and Co. produced at least 4000 and as may as 5000 different prints. This immense output has led some critics (such as Courtney Lewis) to assert that his firm was more concerned with quantity than quality. Others, such as author Mike Martin, argue that Kronheim simply preferred a larger subject variety. Martin argues that Kronheim was an important book illustrator, of children's books in particular, and that much of his work was of high quality. Kronheim is best known for his set of four large coaching scene prints, entitled Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter. In July 2000, the New Baxter Society held an exhibition sampling Kronheim's work at St. Albans.

The palace was built for, and is named after, the Genoan trader and banker Tommaso Marino. It became a property of the State in 1781. History The original design of the facade of the Palace facing Piazza San Fedele (illustration found in the \\"Raccolta Bianconi\\", a collection of tables in the Biblioteca Trivulziana, vol.I, p. 25, A 4042) The palace was built from 1557 to 1563 for Tommaso Marino.C.

Sandonnini, Tommaso Marino mercante genovese, \\"ASL\\" 1883, pp. 54‚Äì84 It was designed by architect Galeazzo Alessi from Perugia. Its main facade was originally that facing Piazza San Fedele, as Piazza della Scala didn't yet exist; the corresponding area was occupied by buildings.C. Baroni, Documenti per la storia dell'Architettura a Milano nel Rinascimento e nel Barocco, vol. II, Accademia dei Lincei, Rome 1968, pp. 398‚Äì424 The construction was occasionally slowed down by the opposition of the population, that had a very conservative attitude towards the architecture of the centre of Milan.G. Marangoni, La casa del Comune di Milano: Palazzo Marino, in \\"La cultura moderna\\", September 1925 Several sculptors from the Fabbrica del Duomo were involved in the decorations of Palazzo Marino. In the courtyard, sculptures were erected representing the Labours of Hercules and the Metamorphoses.Palazzo Marino The ceiling of the main hall (now known as \\"Salone dell'Alessi\\") had frescos and stuccos with the Marriage of Cupid and Psyche by Andrea Semini and Ottavio Semini. The four corners of the ceiling were also decorated with paintings by Aurelio Busso representing the Four Seasons. Further frescos as well as bas reliefs decorated the walls, with mythological themes such as the Muses, Bacchus, Apollo and Mercury by Ottavio Semini. The reliefs depict the story of Perseus. When Marino died leaving his family bankrupt, the palace became a property of the State, but in 1632 it was sold to another banker, Carlo Omodei. The House of Omodei never inhabited the palace, which maintained its original name \\"Marino\\" and was rented to several notable Milanese.G. Vigo, Fisco e societ√† nella Lombardia del Cinquecento, Il Mulino, Bologna 1979 In 1781, the palace was once again bought by the State (the notable Milanese scholar Pietro Verri had an important role in convincing the authorities to buy the palace) and became the seat of administrative and tax offices. The palace was then restored, with the supervision of architect Giuseppe Piermarini, who was responsible for the renovation of the entire area. Piazza della Scala: the statue of Leonardo da Vinci, Palazzo Marino (on the left) and the entrance of Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II (on the right) In 1848, after the Five Days of Milan, the palace was temporarily used as the seat of the new government of Lombardy. It was finally elected as Milan's city hall on 19 September 1861. The acquisition of the palace by the city administration marked a new thorough restoration of the building and the surrounding area. The block that occupied what is now Piazza della Scala was demolished to create the plaza; the facade of Palazzo Marino facing the plaza was renewed to become the palace's main facade (on a design by Luca Beltrami, completed in 1892). A second major restoration, directed by Arrigo Buonomo, occurred after the end of World War II. The original stuccos and frescos in the Salone dell'Alessi (which had been severely damaged by bombings) were recreated ex novo by notable artists of the time.Vergani, Guido, Palazzo Marino.

Stanley's family had a history of flying: all his five siblings were also aeronauts, with Arthur and Percival the more well-known; his father Charles Green Spencer pioneered gliding and founded the balloon factory C.G. Spencer & Sons in London; and his grandfather Edward had flown balloons with Charles Green since 1836. On 15 September 1898, Stanley piloted a hydrogen balloon for the meteorologist Arthur Berson in what was believed to be a record ascent to 27,500 feet. On 15 November 1899, Spencer ascended with John Mackenzie Bacon and Gertrude Bacon to observe the Leonid meteor shower from above the clouds. Ten hours later, their balloon landed near Neath, South Wales, narrowly avoiding drifting out over the Atlantic. The Spencer airships=Spencer's first airship The success of the airships designed and flown by Alberto Santos Dumont in Paris led Spencer to believe that he could build an improved version. To fund the construction costs, he entered into a sponsorship contract with Mellin and Company of Peckham, the manufacturer of \\"Mellin's Food\\", a leading brand of infant formula \\"for babies and invalids\\". The sum of ¬£1,500 was payable in return for twenty-five return flights carrying an advertisement for \\"Mellin's Food\\".Papers Past - Christchurch Star, 31 December 1903, WAYS OF AIRSHIPS (p. 2) The airship was assembled in Spencer's balloon shed at Crystal Palace, London, then a popular site for balloon ascents. The envelope of the airship measured some in length and had a capacity of of hydrogen. The gondola was an open framework of bamboo poles, on which was mounted a Simms petrol engine. William J. Claxton, The Mastery of the Air The Echo Library 2007, (p.91) There was only space for a single person.St. John Daily Sun - 18 October 1902 (p. 6) The engine drove a wooden propeller which worked in tractor configuration; previous airships had used a pusher configuration, which, being mounted at the back, ran the risk of igniting any escaping gas. A fan pump and valve designed by Spencer replaced any lost gas with air, to prevent the envelope from deforming. A further safety feature was that in the event of a catastrophic failure of the envelope, Spencer claimed that it was designed to collapse into the shape of a parachute. William J. Claxton, The Mastery of the Air The Echo Library 2007, (p. 91) Spencer's first airship in flight, showing the advertising for \\"Mellin's Food\\" The completed airship was reported to have made its first flight some time in late June 1902.J M Bacon (Rev), The Dominion of the Air; The Story of Aerial Navigation, Cassell and Company Ltd, London 1902 (pp. 338‚Äì339) There followed a series of trial flights at the Crystal Palace polo ground. On 14 July, the airship was piloted by Spencer's wife, Rose,Motoring Illustrated, 2 August 1902, pp 215‚Äì216 on a powered flight in a circuit around the ground, \\"under perfect control\\" according to one newspaper report.Manawatu Times - 11 September 1902: A LADY NAVIGATES AN AIRSHIP (p. 3) If the various press reports of the event are correct, this makes Mrs Spencer the first woman to pilot a powered aircraft.Three Forks News - 18 December 1919 (p. 12) Although designed to be a single-seater, Spencer flew with his three-month-old baby daughter Gladys on at least one occasion, claiming that she was the first female to have flown in an airship. During a further trial flight on Friday, 19 September 1902, the conditions seemed right for Stanley Spencer to try to equal Santos Dumont's feat of flying around the Eiffel Tower, by himself flying around the dome of Saint Paul's Cathedral in the City of London. The airship set off from Crystal Palace at 16:15, watched by a crowd of cheering spectators. Travelling at an altitude of up to , it soon became apparent that central London had become obscured by mist, so Spencer headed west, making a low pass near Clapham Common, causing \\"intense astonishment among the thousands of persons in the streets...\\"New York Times - 20 September 1902 - AN AIRSHIP TRAVELS NEARLY THIRTY MILES Spencer continued across the River Thames at Chelsea Bridge and continued over Kensington and Earl's Court. During the flight, he frequently flew around in circles to demonstrate the airship's maneuverability, and threw out small rubber balls, to demonstrate \\"what an army airship could do with bombs\\".The Press (Christchurch) - 23 October 1902, A Successful Airship (P. 5) As darkness approached, Spencer landed in a field at Eastcote, near Harrow;\\"The Airship Journey Across London\\" Times [London, England] 22 Sept. 1902: 8. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 25 Mar. 2013. he claimed that the airship \\"came down so lightly, that a child underneath it would not have been harmed\\". The distance travelled in the three-hour flight was about , about three times the distance of any of Santos Dumont's previous flights. Spencer used the same airship to fly the from Blackpool to Preston in Lancashire in a \\"high wind\\" on 21 October 1902. In November of the same year, he flew from the Isle of Man across the Irish Sea to Dumfries. The airship must have been modified because he took fellow aeronaut John Mackenzie Bacon on the flight; newspaper reports state that Bacon also took the controls.The Mercury (Hobart, Tasmania) - Friday 14 November 1902: Cross Sea Steering (p. 5) On 28 October 1903, Spencer took Mellin and Company to court in an effort to recover the final ¬£5,000 of advertising fees, which had been withheld on the grounds that the stipulated twenty-five return flights of the airship had not been completed. After an argument about the exact meaning of a \\"return flight\\", the judge, Justice Darling, ruled in favour of Mellin's. Spencer's second airship Stanley Spencer soon directed his energies to the construction of a larger and more powerful airship. The envelope was long, with a capacity of . The gondola was an open frame of ash wood spars, on which mounted a Thomas Green & Son engine of that drove a pair of wooden propellers, designed by Hiram Maxim. The controls were activated by means of Bowden cables, the first time that these had been used on an airship. On 11 July 1903, the new airship was prepared for its first flight at the Ranelagh Club in Barnes, Surrey. However, it slewed sideways during take off and one of the propellers was smashed against the ground. Nothing daunted, Spencer proceeded to dismount the engine and the airship was flown as an unpowered balloon, landing three hours later near Ongar, Essex.Reading Eagle (Pennsylvania) - 2 August 1903: Trying a New Airship (p. 8) He later reverted to a single propeller and carried advertising for the London Evening News. On 17 September 1903, Spencer attempted to circumnavigate the dome of Saint Paul's; the streets below were crowded with expectant spectators. Despite breaking some telephone cables on take off at Crystal Palace, the airship arrived at Saint Paul's at about and flew a semi circle to the east but was unable to turn back towards the south due to the wind. After several attempts, he gave up the struggle and turned away to the north, eventually landing near New Barnet.Examiner (Launceston, Tasmania) - Tuesday 10 November 1903: The Airship Trial (p. 3) Spencer's third airship One source suggests that Spencer planned a third and yet larger airship, 150 feet (46 metres) long, driven by two 50 horse power engines with accommodation for ten passengers and crew members. Family life Spencer had married Rose Isabel Hawkins on 9 September 1895 at Hornsey.Harvey History 071117 - Rose Isabel Hawkins (I19661) A son, William was born in 1897 but died, aged just 5 months.Harvey History 071117 - William Spencer (I19662) They had a daughter, Gladys Rose in 1899.My Genealogy Home Page - Gary E Strong - Gladys Rose Spencer (b. 14 June 1899, d. date unknown) He died in Malta on 27 January 1906 of typhoid.

Despite the Duomo being a consecrated Roman Catholic church, the Venerable Factory is completely independent of the Holy See. The Fabbrica was created in 1387 by the governor of Milan, Gian Galeazzo Visconti. At the time, the construction of the Duomo had already begun, and was supervised by Superstantia di Santa Maria Maggiore, a similar organization established by archbishop Antonio da Saluzzo, which was then replaced by the Fabbrica. The Fabbrica was responsible for a major change in the plans for the Duomo, including the adoption of the new Gothic style that was then becoming popular all over Europe (especially France). The original administrative board of the Fabbrica included all of the most notable Milanese authorities of the time, including the Duke of Milan, much of the local aristocracy, and the archbishop. This was later reduced to seven members during the Austrian rule of Milan. Today, the board has six members and a president. Over the centuries, artists and workers from the Fabbrica del Duomo have collaborated with other notable architectural projects in the city; for example, sculptors of the Fabbrica have been involved with the decoration of the facades of Palazzo Marino (Milan's city hall).

The company was founded in 1985 as a spin-off from the University of Li√®ge. Eurogentec's contract manufacturing organization facilities are licensed by the Belgian Ministry of Health to produce clinical trial and commercial biopharmaceutical material and also licensed by the US FDA to manufacture a commercial recombinant protein product for the US market. Eurogentec operates two manufacturing facilities in Belgium that provide custom biologics and oligonucleotide-based components for diagnostic and therapeutic/prophylactic applications. History Eurogentec Biologics division in Seraing 1985: The company was founded in Li√®ge by two young researchers from the University of Li√®ge, Prof. Joseph Martial and Prof. Andr√© Renard. Prof. Joseph Martial crossed the Atlantic at the end of the 1970s to work at University of California, San Francisco in an American laboratory and returned a few years later, as a trained genetic engineer, at a time when these technologies were still largely confined to North America. Above all, he came back with a certain concept of the economic role potentially assumed by a university researcher in creating his own enterprise. At that time, there was no ad hoc structure at the ULg to support the launching of a spin-off. Prof. J. Martial recruited a young researcher (Prof. A. Renard). The laboratory was then welcomed by ULg authorities in their facilities. The company's first goal was to perfect a vaccine for fish breeding through genetic engineering. 1987: Eurogentec started to distribute Oligonucleotides for Research laboratories. The company's first years were difficult but in the very early 1990s, Jean- Pierre Delwart, economist from Brussels University, boarded the ship and put Eurogentec in a favorable current. San Diego, CA 1996: Eurogentec became a contract research organization (CRO) for the biopharmaceutical sector and entered into collaboration with SmithKline Beecham biologicals (Rixensart, Belgium) for the production of recombinant proteins for phase I, II and III clinical trials. In addition to its pharmaceutical manufacturing activities, Eurogentec became a service company for the biotechnical research industry and university laboratories. 1999: Eurogentec acquired Oswel Research Product Ltd. a biotechnology company based in Southampton, Great Britain and specialized in the synthesis of chemically modified and complex oligonucleotides and their analogues (DNA, RNA, PNA). 2002: Eurogentec acquired Wita Proteomics, a company specialized in proteomics services, based in Berlin (Germany). A few months later, Eurogentec installed its US office in San Diego for the production of oligonucleotides (EGT NA). Eurogentec headquarters building in Seraing, Belgium 2004: Eurogentec opened its new production laboratories (Oligonucleotides and peptides synthesis) in the Liege Science PARK (Belgium). This intelligent building is also ecological: the building is equipped with a home automation system (lighting without switch) and the heating is produced from a condensation boiler allowing energy savings. From 2000 to 2008 Eurogentec intensified its services and signed agreements with several companies like Cepheid, Epoch Biosciences, Exiqon, Delphi, In Cell Art. 2007: In order to fully meet the Oligonucleotide in vitro diagnostics stringent manufacturing requirements, Eurogentec expanded its current GMP facility in Li√®ge. 2008: Eurogentec received ISO 13485 Certification for the production and sales of In Vitro Diagnostics (IVD) oligonucleotides in Li√®ge. Two years after EGT NA also received ISO 13485 certification for the Oligonucleotide diagnostics manufacturing. Fremont, CA 2009 October, Eurogentec announced the acquisition of AnaSpec, a privately owned proteomics company based in Fremont, USA. Anaspec is a provider of proteomics for life science research; they specialize in peptides synthesis, labelled peptides and antibodies, fluorescent dyes and enzyme activity assays. 2010: Kaneka acquired a majority stake in Eurogentec S.A. Kaneka's products include synthetic resins, resin products, chemicals, foodstuffs, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, electrical raw materials and synthetic fibres. 2012: Start commercial manufacturing of a biopharmaceutical for USA market. Products and services Eurogentec has developed three interrelated business units, Life Science Research Products and Services, In Vitro Diagnostics Manufacturing Solutions, and GMP BioManufacturing. :The life science business unit specializes in genomics, and involves the development of oligonucleotides, DNA polymerases, Real-time qPCR Probes, assay services, and proteomics. The proteomics operations are primarily concerned with custom peptides and antibodies, assay kits and Proprietary Dyes & Quenchers. :The in vitro diagnostics business unit provides technical and project support for contract manufacturing of good manufacturing practice (GMP) Oligonucleotides and Taq DNA polymerases for use in Molecular Diagnostic applications. Manufacturing processes take place in clean rooms. :The GMP BioManufacturing BU is a full-service Contract Manufacturing Organization (CMO) and offers significant know-how in process development, technology transfer, formulation, scale-up and manufacturing of GMP proteins, protein conjugates, plasmids and bacterial vaccines for pre-clinical, clinical and commercial uses, all according to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and EMA requirements.

Life From Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, he was probably born there about 1633. A Baptist in early life, he joined the Quakers soon after their rise, was imprisoned in London for preaching in 1658, About 1659 Wollrich, although a Quaker, actually baptised a convert. In this he was supported by some in the Society of Friends, while severely judged by others. Sir Richard Browne, Lord Mayor of London in 1661, who was particularly severe against Quakers, committed Wollrich to prison for keeping his hat on before him. In 1661 he was taken out of a meeting in Staffordshire, and, for refusing the oath of allegiance, carried to prison. On 2 December 1662 he arrived in Chester at the end of the assize. On the following Sunday he entered Chester Cathedral during the anthem, and when the singing ceased attempted to speak, but was hastily removed and confined in the castle. In February 1682 he was fined ¬£20 and sent to prison for offering prayer at the burial of a quaker woman in her husband's garden at Keel, Staffordshire, the priest having threatened to arrest the corpse if Wollrich did not pay the fees. Wollrich died, after a painful illness from cancer in the mouth, at the Friends' Almshouses in Clerkenwell on 31 August 1707, and was buried on 2 September. Works In 1659 he wrote ‚ÄòA Declaration to the Baptists‚Äô ‚Ä¶ London, 1659. This is an account of a ‚Äòdispute‚Äô held at Withcock, Leicestershire, on 27 February 1658‚Äì9, at which Isabel, wife of Colonel Francis Hacker, was present. In his defence after his bapstising, Wollrich wrote ‚ÄòThe Unlimited God ‚Ä¶‚Äô London, 1659. Wollrich was in prison in 1660, and wrote, with John Pennyman and Thomas Coveney, ‚ÄòSome Grounds and Reasons to manifest the Unlawfulness of Magistrates and others who commit Men to Prison, or fine them for not putting off the hat,‚Äô London, 1660 also a broadside dated Newgate Prison, 14 January 1661, ‚ÄòOh!

It is one of some 37 species of Duroia, which are shrubs or canopy trees in the family Rubiaceae, favouring ants (myrmecophilous), and occurring in Central America as far north as Mexico, the Amazon Basin, the Guiana Shield, the Brazilian Atlantic coast and planalto. A number of Duroia species, and possibly all, are capable of biochemical interactions inhibiting the growth of neighbouring plants. Analysis of root extracts from Duroia hirsuta have yielded a strong plant growth inhibitor plumericin, a tetracyclic iridoid lactone, and duroin, another iridoid lactone. This process, common amongst plants, is termed allelopathy. In the case of Duroia hirsuta, the chemical inhibitor is aided by the Lemon Ant, a resident on and in the tree, and playing an active role in suppressing and destroying plant growth in the vicinity of their host by injecting and spraying formic acid, and defending against herbivores - other ant species such as Azteca spp. and Allomerus octoarticulatus demerarae exhibit the same mutualism. The area around this understory tree is often devoid of all other plant types, leading to the local name \\"Devil's garden.\\" The cost to the host plant for this protection is considerable, since the resident ants subject the tree to increased leaf cutting. Trees that grow outside the cleared area often have the living tissues of their trunks excavated and galled for ant accommodation.

Raskin was the art and theater critic for Abraham Reisen's Yiddish language weekly Dos Naye Land (The New Country), an \\"illustrated weekly of literature, art, criticism and culture\\", launched in 1911. In the 17 November 1911 edition, Raskin wrote an article titled An Exhibition of Jewish Artists, A Proclamation in which he proposed that Jewish artists exhibitions should be held and suggested practical ways to organize them. The following week, Dos Naye Land published a letter to the editor from a writer opposing Raskin's suggestion on the grounds that \\"good artists\\" would refuse to exhibit and suggesting that art appreciation in the Jewish community should be cultivated by first exhibiting reproductions of good art in public places. Raskin wrote about The Future of Jewish Art in another article for Dos Naye Land in 1911 in which he discussed the inability to find a common Jewish characteristic in the works of artists such as Mark Antokolski, Jozef Isra√´ls, Max Liebermann, and Camille Pissarro. Raskin suggested that rather than examining the various techniques, forms, and styles used by Jewish artists, \\"Jewish Art\\" might emerge by examining the common subject matter and themes in his contemporaries' work, specifically in genre and history paintings. Raskin's articles advocating what he regarded as the humanitarian and demographic value of art rooted in folk themes were amongst the earliest articles on art in Yiddish. Educational and cultural work Raskin worked to bring Jewish art to the attention of the Jewish public. He believed that art should not be the exclusive preserve of the wealthy and that by collaborating with artists, the public's interest in art could be cultivated. He conducted museum tours and lectured on art for the Arbeter Ring (Workmen‚Äôs Circle). In 1910, the Arbeter Ring Education Committee (EC) was formed to oversee its members educational and cultural development. In 1914 the EC organized ten guided tours of New York art museums most of which were conducted by Raskin. The \\"shpatsirungen\\" (strolls) as they were called could draw as many as four to five hundred people. The museums participated by remaining open at special times and providing rooms for lectures at no cost. Raskin's guided tours included a short historical overview of the exhibits highlighting the prominent artists and their works. Raskin carried out similar educational work outside of New York. In the 1930s Raskin served as the art director for the 92nd Street Young Men's and Young Women's Hebrew Association (92nd Street Y) in New York. Visual art Raskin was probably known more as a painter and caricaturist within the American Jewish community than as a critic. He worked in various media and was known for his realist approach and attention to detail. His work focused on scenes of Jewish life and tradition particularly in the Lower East Side of New York. His first exhibition was in 1922. Raskin's paintings, sketches and lithographs portraying Jewish life in the Yishuv in Palestine were well known in the U. S. having appeared in many exhibitions and the press. They were widely praised by art critics. The lobby of a theater at the corner of Second Avenue and Eleventh Street, at the northern end of the \\"Yiddish Broadway\\" in the Yiddish Theater District in the Lower East Side was decorated with his paintings of Palestine. He made a number of trips to Palestine, at least four between 1921 and 1937, five by 1947 and later to Israel. He stayed at the kibbutz Ramat Yochanan while in the British mandate for Palestine. In 1947 Raskin published Land of Palestine which contained \\"more than 300 drawings and paintings made during the artist's five visits to Palestine, together with short essays on Palestinian life.\\" He produced poster art to support the Zionist movement. His poster Stand Up and Be Counted from the 1930s shows a central figure of a tall and determined American Jew holding up a Shekel surrounded on one side by images of destruction and on the other by images of a brighter future in a Jewish homeland promised by contributing to the Zionist organization. Cover of Hebrew Rhapsody (1959) Illustrated books Raskin provided illustrations for a number of Hebrew texts such as Pirkei Avot: Sayings of the Fathers (1940), the Haggadah for Passover (1941), Tehilim. The Book of Psalms (1942), the Siddur (1945), Five Megiloth: Song of Songs, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, Esther (1949), the Kabbalah in Word and Image (1952), and other books such as Aron Hakodesh: Jewish Life And Lore (1955) and Between God and Man: Hebrew Rhapsody in 100 Drawings (1959). Aron Hakodesh (The Holy Ark) illustrates the life of a boy named Moishele from his Bar Mitzvah to marriage, to teaching his own children and in his old age, his grandchildren reflecting the idea of passing down traditional Jewish wisdom. The last pages are about Israel and the Promised Land. The book includes games, jokes, and folklore with about 150 illustrations with Yiddish and English descriptions. Hebrew Rhapsody contained sections on \\"Moses the prophet supreme\\", \\"Samson the tragic hero\\", \\"Job the good man\\", \\"the Golem\\", \\"a wedding in town\\", \\"the Hasidim who serve God with joy\\" together with a set of drawings on the Land of Israel to mark the tenth anniversary of the State of Israel with the final pages describing his experience as an artist. Raskin described the book as a \\"Rhapsody in the medium of graphic art\\" and \\"An ode to my people, my wonderful 'old and young again' people.\\" In 1960 Raskin published the book The New Face of Israel. In 1962, when Raskin was in his eighties, he published Personal surrealism, an illustrated book that included his thoughts on surrealism, dreams and his life in a mixture of Hebrew and English. Political and personal views Politically, Raskin described himself as initially an \\"International Marxist\\", then a \\"Social Revolutionist\\", later a \\"Bundist\\" and after World War I, a \\"Jewish Nationalist\\". Following the Balfour Declaration of 1917, Raskin became an ardent Zionist. On Raskin's eightieth birthday he said \\"I am an artist and I am a Jew, but first and above all, I am a Jewish artist, for Jewishness is the source, the centrality, the essence of my art, as it is the essence of my being.\\" Artists' societies membership Raskin was a member of the American Watercolor Society, the Society of American Etchers, the Audubon Artists and the New York Watercolor Club. Personal life Raskin married Rae Malis. They had at least one son, Eugene Raskin. Raskin's wife Rae also wrote for a number of publications such as the mass circulation Yiddish daily nationalist-Zionist newspaper Der tog (The Day} in the late 1910s and the nonpartisan Froyen zhurnal (The Jewish Women‚Äôs Home Journal) in the early 1920s. In Der tog , her articles were intended to educate women in basic civics but she also addressed topics like home decoration and beauty. In Froyen zshurnal, she provided instructions in civics which she hoped would demonstrate how governing related \\"to the woman, her home economics, her and her family‚Äôs health, raising her children, etc.‚Äú. She also wrote articles about Federal and State governments and the setting up and organization of a woman‚Äôs club. Raskin died in New York in 1966. Archives The Yeshiva University in New York maintain a collection of cards, newspaper clippings, correspondence, and publicity forms covering the period 1960 - 1966.

Buildings Main Building The oldest part of the building was built in 1860 as a town-palace by count Theodor von Helmersen, the owner of Karula manor house in the north of Viljandi and was registered as a protected architectural monument in 1998.http://register.muinas.ee/?menuID=monument&action;=view&mtab;=main&id;=14715 In the first period of Estonian independence in the 1930s, the building was home to the Sakala partisan battalion's company's and officers' mess. In the 1940s, the time of the first Soviet occupation, it was used by the Soviet army. After 1945, it was home to several city institutions, e.g. the \\"Leola‚Äú state combine. In the 1960s, it went back to the use of the Soviet Army as home to the parachute troops. The building went back into the use of the Estonian army, after the Soviet army left Viljandi in 1994. Since 1995 Viljandi Culture Academy is situated in the building. In the main building are lecture rooms, special study rooms such as dance classes, a multifunctional black-box type hall, a multimedia-class, a painting class as well as a hand- loom class.

The building is home to the whole music department of the academy, including the chairs of traditional music, classical- and church-music, jazz music, and school music. The music house is of importance not only for the academy but for the whole city. The renovated building is situated in the heart of Viljandi city as well as the main building. Both buildings contribute to the idea of a culture district in the city centre. The Music house, Carl Robert Jakobson street 14, is located at the corner of Carl Robert Jakobson- and Lossi street, in the historical monument preservation zone of Viljandi's old town.http://register.muinas.ee/?menuID=monument&action;=view&mtab;=main&id;=27010 The house was built in 1888 in historicist style as a two-storey stone dwelling house, which belonged in the beginning to the Viljandi governor of the Russian tsar, baron von Wolff.http://www.sakala.ajaleht.ee/010605/esileht/5016260.php In 1917 the building hosted the Viljandi war-revolution committee. Later it was home to the staff of the Sakala partisan battalion and in soviet time it was used as a war-commissariat. After Estonia restored its independence in the beginning of the 1990s, the building was used as the Viljandi department of Estonia's state-defence. The building has been protected as an architectural monument since 1964.http://www.viljandimaa.ee/turismiinfo/?lg=est&mod;=9&sort;=1&id;=92&pknd;= Vilma House In 2012, UT VCA bought the former building of the Vilma pastry factory in the town centre of Viljandi.

The headquarters are based in Andover, Hampshire. The company makes varying types of lifts, but it is best known for its stairlifts with which the company's name has become synonymous. The company headquarters, escalator and stairlift division are in the Portway Industrial Estate on the western outskirts of Andover. Its microlift division is in a separate building in the same estate, and its passenger lift division is near the town centre. The company also operates a factory in Newburn, near Newcastle-upon-Tyne. History The company was founded in London in 1867 by Joseph Stannah, who had worked as an engineer since the 1820s. Initially a manufacturer of cranes and hoists for transporting ships' cargo, the company began to make hand-powered passenger lifts at the turn of the 20th century. Its first headquarters were on Southwark Bridge Road, before moving to Bankside in the early 20th century. The company remained here until the site was destroyed during the London Blitz. The chairman at the time, Leslie Stannah, built new headquarters at Tiverton Street, Southwark using compensation money awarded to the company. Stannah Lifts moved from London to Andover in 1974, produced its first stairlift in 1975, and began exporting in 1979. From there, it established itself as the leading manufacturer of stairlifts worldwide, as well as Britain's largest lift manufacturer. Subsidiaries were opened in the United States and The Netherlands in 1992, and Slovakia in 2003. The company also purchased distributors in Ireland in 2005, and Norway in 2010. The company produced its 500,000th stairlift in February 2011 during a visit by the Prince of Wales to the Andover headquarters. Products=Stairlift division The company's stairlift division manufactures new stairlifts for purchase or rental, as well as reconditioning old units. Five models are produced for both straight, curved and external staircases, with all units run on a rail fitted to the stair tread and powered via a mains-charged battery. The lift is controlled by a control pod or a joystick attached to the arm of the seat (depending on the model), together with a remote controller. All models are fitted with a seatbelt and safety edges, which will stop the lift if an obstruction is encountered. The Solus and Sofia models are also fitted with a seat load sensor, which prevents movement of the lift unless the occupant is safely seated. Access & Passenger lift division The company provides a range of passenger and platform lifts. Inclined platform lifts - Stairiser inclined platform lifts are an option if a building cannot accommodate a vertical lift. A Stairiser carries one person over a straight or curved stairway, seated in a wheelchair or on the seat provided on the lift. When the lift is not in use it folds away to leave the stairway free for pedestrian use. Vertical platform lifts - Midilifts are designed to provide an alternative to the stairs for travel up to 12 metres. Four product ranges are available: Lowriser, open platforms for wheelchair users; Midilift SL, standard platform lifts and the Midilift SLplus and Midilift XLplus, their top-of-the-range cabin platform lifts. All Midilifts are supplied either in a skeleton structure or with their own structure-supported enclosure, which can be fitted with either steel or glass panels, or a combination of the two. Passenger lifts - Maxilift 2.0 Range: from 6-13 persons - For low/medium rise and medium use for travel up to 15m. The lift system is either wall-mounted or supported by an independent structure, and is powered by either a conventional lift motor (mounted in a separate lift motor room), a hydraulic drive system or a traction motor. The Xtralift range is designed for high-use applications and is available in six standard models for between 17 persons / 1250 kg and 33 persons / 2500 kg. Lifts in this range are fitted within a modular structure and driven by a traction motor.

These are structure-supported systems provided with a load weighing device and alarm, and can be manned or unmanned. Unmanned lifts are controlled by a control panel installed at each floor level, with manned lifts having a panel located in the cabin. The Trolleylift range is of a similar specification, but with a maximum capacity of 300 kg. The Microlift range of dumb waiters has rated capacities of 50 kg and 100 kg, and is available in models designed for restricted headrooms and spaces. This includes a 'double decker' version, incorporating two cars in a single shaft. Escalator division The company's escalator division produces escalators and moving walkways, which are available as horizontal or inclined units.

Ethie Castle Her association with David Beaton, then abbot of Arbroath, may have begun around 1525, when she wound up her late mother's affairs at Airlie. Marion is recorded in Edinburgh with David Beaton in February 1526, and after she lived at Beaton's Ethie Castle near Arbroath. Beaton's relationship with Marion is often cited as one of his faults, as a Catholic clergyman supposed to remain celibate. However, Beaton's clerical status was complicated. He was not a monk, or professed member of the Benedictine Order, though Abbot or Commendator of Arbroath Abbey. Neither was he in full priest's orders at the start of their relationship. At this time clergymen who pursued secular careers as royal administrators and diplomats were able to postpone their ordination by seeking permission from the Pope. Despite these reservations, the historian Margaret Sanderson sees their relationship as example of clerical concubinage which Beaton himself condemned in others.Sanderson, Margaret H. B., Mary Stewart's People, James Thin (1987), 5-6. In her biography Cardinal of Scotland, Sanderson discusses the issue at greater length and points out that all their eight children were born before he was fully ordained, which presumably occurred at the time his consecration as Bishop of Mirepoix in 1538. The Cardinal's relationship with Marion seems not to have become a specific target of his critics or an embarrassment to his apologists until the 19th century.Sanderson, Margaret H. B., Cardinal of Scotland: David Beaton, John Donald (1986), 30-39. Ogilvy built up considerable property, held from the abbey, and frequently appeared in court to defend her rights.\\"Marion Ogilvy, Lady of Melgund\\", The Biographical Dictionary of Scottish Women, Edinburgh University Press One of her incomes was the rents of the Kirktoun of St Vigeans. Melgund Castle In 1543, David Beaton bought Melgund Castle from his widowed sister-in-law. The castle became Marion's home. A chamber in the new tower has their heraldry displayed over the windows, just as any landed married couple. The Cardinal was killed at St Andrews Castle in 1546. According to John Knox, Marion had just left the castle by the privy postern before it was overwhelmed by Beaton's enemies.Knox, John, The History of the Reformation in Scotland, Wodrow Society, vol. 1 (1846), pp174-175. In 1547, Marion married a William Douglas, but was a widow by 18 September 1547. Marion died at Melgund in June 1575 and was buried in the Ogilvy aisle at Kinnell parish church.Sanderson, Margaret H. B., Mary Stewart's People, James Thin (1987), 19.

Life Lawson was born 10 October 1630 at Lawkland, in the parish of Clapham, Yorkshire, the son of Thomas and Elizabeth Lawson. Educated at Giggleswick School, the local grammar school, he was admitted sizar of Christ's College, Cambridge 25 July 1650. Lawson apparently dropped out of university, although his brother completed a course. Lawson became an adept in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin. At some point in the early 1650s he became a clergyman at Rampside, a village on the Furness Peninsula. The village had a chapel of ease and was part of the parish of Dalton. During this period, although the Church of England was retained, episcopacy was suppressed and there was tolerance of independent churches. George Fox visited him at Rampside in 1652, and was invited to preach.In his journal Fox recorded his visit to the chapel \\"in which Thomas Lawson used to preach, who was an eminent priest. He very lovingly acquainted the people in the morning of my coming in the afternoon, by which means many were gathered together.\\" Lawson soon after became convinced of the unlawfulness of preaching for hire, and at twenty-three gave up his living to join the Quakers. He was frequently distrained upon for non-payment of tithe, and was imprisoned. He was one of the early activists known as the Valiant Sixty. Lawson married, 24 March 1658, Frances Wilkinson, and settled at Great Strickland in Westmorland, where he took pupils from the sons of the gentry round. Herbalist and botanist In the 1670s Lawson had to close temporarily his school in Westmorland because of problems with the authorities. In 1674 he taught botany to the daughters of Margaret Fell at Swarthmore. (Margaret Fell, who was by this time married to George Fox, had seven daughters from her first marriage). According to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, this is our \\"earliest firm evidence\\" of Lawson's interest in botany. Gerard Croese called Lawson the most noted herbalist in England. John Ray, to whom he was close, speaks of him as a \\"diligent, industrious, and skilful botanist\\", from whom he received much assistance. Lawson was asked to contribute to Synopsis Methodica Insectorum, which Ray planned but did not live to complete, and Thomas Robinson in his Essay towards a Natural History of Westmoreland and Cumberland used manuscripts supplied by Lawson's daughter. Several English plants were first noted by him, and a species of hieracium (Hieracium Lawsonii) was named after him. Death, family, legacy Lawson died at Great Strickland 12 November 1691, leaving land in Westmorland and Pennsylvania.According to the ODNB, the land in Pennsylvania was contested. The will is in the registry of Carlisle. A former pupil of Lawson erected a monument above the grave at Newby, which is a listed structure.Memorial to Thomas Lawson and Shelter Against East Wall of Friends Burial Ground (At Ngr Ny 585 215), Newby. An engraving of it after Myles Birket Foster is in Maria Webb's The Fells of Swarthmoor Hall. In it were also deposited the remains of his wife, and their only son, Jonah. https://archive.org/stream/earlycumberland00ferggoog#page/n82/mode/2up Of his three daughters the eldest, Ruth, whose letters in Latin are still extant, married without her father's knowledge Christopher Yeats, one of his pupils, who took holy orders; Lawson was rebuked by the Friends for his readiness in accepting the situation. His manuscript notes made on walking tours throughout England, giving localities of plants, and arranged under counties, came into the possession of a descendant, Lawson Thompson of Hitchin. To Yeats and his wife Lawson left most of his property, including all his manuscripts. Several of those were preserved at Devonshire House, and Thomas Ellwood, in a letter (1 July 1698) which is among them, recommends publication. Works He published the following: * (With B.

Laure sees a group of boys playing outside the window and goes to play with them, but they disappear quickly. Instead, Laure meets Lisa, a neighborhood girl. Lisa assumes that Laure is a boy and asks for Laure's name.Lisa uses the French pronoun that suggests she expects to hear a male name. After a moment's thought, Laure comes up with the male name \\"Micka√´l\\". Lisa then introduces Micka√´l/Laure to the rest of the neighborhood children, stating that Micka√´l is the new kid in the apartment complex. Micka√´l becomes friends with Lisa and the boys, playing soccer with them. When invited to go swimming, Micka√´l cuts a one-piece swimsuit into male swim trunks, and makes a clay penis to put inside. Over time, Lisa and Micka√´l become closer, and Lisa eventually kisses Micka√´l. Micka√´l also becomes increasingly accepted by the group of boys. One day while playing, Lisa makes up Micka√´l's face and comments: \\"You look good as a girl.\\" Micka√´l goes home hiding her face under a hoodie, but Laure's mother says she likes it, encouraging her to be more like a girl. When Lisa comes by the apartment to look for Micka√´l, she runs into Laure's precocious six-year-old sister Jeanne instead. The conversation makes Jeanne realize that Laure has been presenting as a boy. Jeanne confronts Laure and wants to tell their parents, but when Laure promises to take her along on all of Laure's outings for the rest of the summer, she quickly becomes happy to have a big brother, which she says is \\"way better\\" than having a big sister. She also helps cut Micka√´l's hair to be more boyish, and promises to keep Micka√´l's secret. Although their mom is somewhat supportive of Laure's gender non- conformity (for example, by painting Laure's room blue), she also seems to want Laure to be more feminine. After Micka√´l has a fight with one of the boys for pushing Jeanne, the boy and his mother come to Micka√´l's door to tell Micka√´l's mother about her son's bad behavior. Laure's mother is quick to understand and plays along, but after the visitors have left, she scolds Laure for \\"pretending to be a boy\\". Jeanne understands Laure's predicament and does her best to support her sibling emotionally. Laure's mother forces Laure to wear a dress and takes Laure to the apartment of the boy that Laure hit, and also to Lisa's apartment. Lisa is stunned to see Micka√´l in a dress and runs off without a word. Deeply embarrassed, Laure goes to the woods. After a time there, Laure takes off the blue dress, leaving on a tank top and boy-style shorts. Walking away from the discarded dress, Micka√´l sees the other children in the distance. Micka√´l can hear them talking, speculating about whether Micka√´l is a girl or not. When they spot Micka√´l, the boys chase and capture Micka√´l and say they're going to see if Micka√´l's really a girl. Lisa stands up to them and tells them to leave Micka√´l alone. But when they tell Lisa: \\"You kissed him. If it's a girl, that's disgusting, isn't it?\\" Lisa agrees and reluctantly looks in Micka√´l's shorts, with Micka√´l in tears but letting her. Lisa is shocked. The boys and Lisa leave while Micka√´l remains in the woods, devastated. Later, we see that Laure's mother has given birth to a baby boy. The family spend time together at home, with Laure not wanting to go outside. However, Laure sees Lisa waiting outside the window, and goes out to see her. After a long silence, Lisa quietly asks for Laure's name. \\"Je m'appelle Laure\\", Laure responds, and smiles a little.

Film critic Roger Ebert said \\"If you think you're looking at a boy, you see one. If a girl, then that's what you see.\\" C√©line Sciamma, the writer and director, said \\"I made it with several layers, so that a transexual person can say 'that was my childhood' and so that a heterosexual woman can also say it.\\" She also said the \\"movie is ambiguous about Micka√´l's feelings for Lisa.

At the time, the Borromeo (originally from Florence) were quickly consolidating their influence on Milan and Northern Italy, partly through their good relationship with Duke Francesco Sforza. The palace eventually became the centre of a sort of \\"Borromeo citadel\\" within the city proper. The Borromeo used the area for celebrations and events such as chivalrous tournaments. The palace was also renowned for housing a prestigious art collection.See Lanza, pp. 27-30 The palace has a late Gothic architecture, which has nevertheless undergone several major modifications through the centuries (and most notably after being damaged by bombings in World War II). The main feature of the facade is the large doorway, decorated with white and red marble. The inner courtyard is the part of the palace that is best preserved; some of the original frescoes are still visible, some representing the tourneys held by the Borromeo are found in one of the rooms of the palace, known as the \\"architecture study\\"; they are credited to painter Michelino da Besozzo.

In May 2011, the Holy See removed Morris from pastoral care of the diocese, attracting international press coverage. Pastoral career Morris was born in Brisbane, where he was educated at St Joseph's College, Gregory Terrace, before studying for the priesthood at Pius XII Provincial Seminary in Banyo. He was ordained a priest of the Archdiocese of Brisbane in 1969. His parish appointments included Sunnybank, Nambour, Mt Gravatt, Goodna and Surfers Paradise. During 1979 to 1984 he served as secretary to Archbishop Francis Rush in Brisbane and also as Diocesan Director of Vocations. In 1992, Morris was appointed by Pope John Paul II to head the Toowoomba diocese. His consecration took place at St Patrick's Cathedral on 10 February 1993. He became known for his pastoral leadership and his work with diocesan cases of sexual abuse. In 2009 he dismissed the principal of a Toowoomba Catholic primary school and two Catholic Education officials for failing to report to the police an early complaint from a schoolgirl. There were reports of liturgical unorthodoxy and controversy about his support of the Third Rite of Confession. In 2006 Morris released a pastoral letter that discussed the declining number of priests in remote parishes like Toowoomba. The letter called for discussion of the ordination of married men and the ordination of women. To call for such a discussion could be interpreted as a challenge to the teaching of John Paul II's apostolic letter Ordinatio Sacerdotalis, which said that \\"the Church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women.\\" The letter also suggested that the Catholic Church might consider recognising \\"Anglican, Lutheran, and Uniting Church orders\\". In December 2006, Morris received a fax requesting that he come to Rome by February 2007 for meetings with three cardinals; Giovanni Battista Re, then head of the Vatican's Congregation for Bishops, William Levada, then head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and Francis Arinze. Morris did not attend, citing \\"pastoral reasons\\", and offered to present himself in May. An apostolic visitation of the diocese was conducted by Charles J. Chaput OFM Cap, Archbishop of Denver during April 2007. Chaput reported to the Congregation for Bishops in May 2007. Morris says that he has never seen this report. He was given an unsigned document from the Congregation for Bishops indicating 13 separate issues. Morris then negotiated with several Vatican congregations for several years. Attempts by Vatican administrators to reconcile Morris with the church's position included several meetings in Rome where, it has been reported, he was asked to resign several times. In December 2008, Morris wrote to Pope Benedict XVI requesting an audience. He was received by the Pope on 4 June 2009. Later Morris claimed that he was told that \\"it is God‚Äôs will that you resign\\". In February 2011 the Apostolic Nuncio to Australia, Giuseppe Lazzarotto, wrote to Morris requesting his resignation. Removal as diocesan bishop On 1 May 2011, Morris stated in a letter to parishioners of his diocese that \\"it has been determined by Pope Benedict XVI that the diocese would be better served by the leadership of a new bishop\\", but that he felt that he was being denied \\"natural justice\\". Morris announced his early retirement at age 67, stressing the fact that he had not resigned. On 2 May, the Apostolic Nuncio to Australia announced that the Pope had \\"removed [Morris] from pastoral care\\" of his diocese. At this time, Morris was appointed Bishop Emeritus of Toowoomba. Several hundred people attended two separate vigils for Morris on 3 May in Toowoomba. On 13 May 2011, the Australian Catholic Bishops' Conference (ACBC) issued a statement, stating that they supported Pope Benedict's decision to remove Morris. In the statement they noted: > \\"it was judged that there were problems of doctrine and discipline, and we > regret that these could not be resolved. We are hopeful that Bishop Morris > will continue to serve the Church in other ways in the years ahead\\". At a meeting of the Permanent Committee of the ACBC on 2 August 2011, a petition was presented from many Catholics of the Diocese of Toowoomba in support of Morris. In a statement on 11 August the Permanent Committee said that > \\"the reality of our ecclesial structure is that the Conference is not able > to resolve the issues that have arisen. Not only do the local Bishops not > have access to all the information on which Pope Benedict came to his > decision, but what has happened in Toowoomba is a matter between the Holy > Father and Bishop Morris.\\" During an Ad Limina visit in Rome that month, ACBC bishops held discussions regarding the situation in Toowoomba with both Cardinal Marc Ouellet and Cardinal William Levada and among themselves. Archbishop Mark Coleridge said that the talks \\"went very positively\\" and \\"surpassed\\" their expectations. In a letter from the ACBC, released on 21 October: > \\"What was at stake was the Church‚Äôs unity in faith and the ecclesial > communion between the Pope and the other Bishops in the College of Bishops > ... we express our acceptance of the Holy Father‚Äôs exercise of his Petrine > ministry ... (and) we return to Australia determined to do whatever we can > to heal any wounds of division.\\" Morris responded to the letter on 24 October 2011, writing: > \\"The statement of the Australian Catholic Bishops contains inaccuracies and > errors of fact evidenced by the documentation relating to the issues > concerning myself and a number of Vatican Dicasteries. The Statement made by > the Australian Bishops invites me to tell my story which I will publish in > the foreseeable future.\\" In October 2011, it was reported that several lay Catholics in Toowoomba had expressed concern that Morris still had a high profile in the diocese, giving a public lecture, in-service talks to teachers and officiating at parish anniversaries. Cardinal George Pell said to CNA \\"if he is a loyal man of the Church he'll realize that this is totally inappropriate and that won't continue. That is my hope.\\" Morris gave an address for Women and the Australian Church on 26 March 2013. He spoke about the vital role of lay people in interpreting the Second Vatican Council and \\"reclaiming its spirit\\". In June 2014 his book Benedict, Me and the Cardinals Three was published, describing his experience of the dismissal.

In audiology, GBF is a measure of hearing aid performance. In both fields the amount of gain is measured in decibels at or just below the point at which the sound from the speaker driver re-enters the microphone and the system begins to ring or feed back. Potential acoustic gain (PAG) is a calculated figure representing gain that a system can support without feeding back. Live sound In live sound mixing, GBF is dependent on a wide variety of conditions: the pickup pattern (polar pattern) of the microphone, the frequency response of the microphone and of the rest of the sound system, the number of active microphones and loudspeakers, the acoustic conditions of the environment including reverberation and echo, and the relative positions of the microphones, the loudspeakers, the sound sources and the audience. Each doubling of the number of open microphones (NOM) reduces the PAG by 3 dB. Directional microphones are used in live sound to maximize GBF. Directional microphones with cardioid and hypercardioid pickup patterns are designed with reduced sensitivity to the rear (cardioid) or to an angle between the side and the rear (hypercardioid). Such microphones are aimed such that their pickup pattern is weakest in the direction of the loudspeakers. This is especially useful in the presence of foldback monitors (stage wedges). Directional loudspeaker systems may also be used to increase GBF. The distance from the sound source to the microphone is a critical element of GBF. Greater GBF is obtained with the performer closer to the microphone; an instance of the inverse-square law. If the performer reduces the distance to the microphone by half, the PAG is increased by 6 dB while the environmental sounds remain relatively the same. The sound system operator can use equalization to change the frequency response of a microphone or loudspeakers system to increase GBF. The frequency which first begins ringing or feeding back is identified by the operator, and a notch filter or parametric filter is engaged to reduce the overall level of that frequency. This process is repeated several times to identify and reduce the level of further feedback frequencies. A graphic equalizer can be used for the same purpose but with somewhat less precision. Automatic feedback suppressors automate and speed the process of identifying and reducing feedback frequencies. A small amount of pitch shift applied to the signal can increase GBF, as can the addition of a few milliseconds of straight delay. The latter will increase the number of feedback frequencies while reducing the frequency range within which they occur, but it will slow the rate at which feedback grows. In practice, adding straight delay to a signal improves GBF. Hearing aid A hearing aid incorporates a miniature microphone and a very small speaker driver, and various conditions may increase or decrease the amount of gain that can be applied to the microphone signal before feedback. A well-fitted hearing aid has more GBF than one that is loose. The shape of the earmold is a factor, with larger and heavier designs capable of delivering greater GBF. Hearing aid designs deliver gain in increasing steps depending on the severity of the patient's hearing loss; the range spans from 10 to 65 dB of gain. To prevent feedback with the highest amounts of gain, such designs require the tightest- fitting earmolds with no venting, and the deepest penetration of the ear canal to place the speaker driver as close as practical to the eardrum.

Nichols played college football at Eastern Washington. He has also been a member of the Dallas Cowboys, Winnipeg Blue Bombers, and Edmonton Eskimos. College career Nichols was a four-year starter at Eastern Washington, where he compiled 996 completions on 1608 attempts (62%) for 12,616 yards, 96 touchdowns and 46 interceptions in 47 games (42 starts). Nichols' career passing yards are the most in Big Sky Conference history and ranks sixth overall in NCAA history. Nichols also holds the school record for touchdown passes with 96 and was named the 2007 and 2009 Big Sky Conference Offensive Player of the Year. The Business Management major attended college with former Winnipeg Blue Bomber defensive end Greg Peach. Professional career= Dallas Cowboys  Nichols attended training camp with the Dallas Cowboys as an undrafted free agent in 2010 and appeared in two pre-season games, recording 10 completions in 16 attempts for 81 yards and two interceptions. He was released on August 19.  Edmonton Eskimos  Nichols was signed as a free agent by the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League on October 13, 2010. Nichols spent the next three games on the practice roster before being released on November 2. On February 4, 2011, he was re- signed by Edmonton through the end of the 2012 season. In the playoffs of the 2012 CFL season Nichols sustained a devastating broken leg injury. He worked hard all off-season in order to be able to play for the 2013 CFL season. Entering the 2013 CFL season Nichols was in open competition with Mike Reilly for the starting quarterback job. Nichols was awarded the start for the first preseason game on June 14, 2013. However, he left the game early on after attempting to tackle a player after throwing an interception. The tests revealed that he had torn ACL and required surgery; this caused him to miss the entire 2013 season. In the offseason, Nichols was signed to a two-year contract extension through the 2015 CFL season.  Winnipeg Blue Bombers  Nichols was traded to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, on September 2, 2015. Nichols played in numerous games for the Bombers in 2015, due in large part to various injuries to starting quarterback Drew Willy. Nichols started the 2016 season as the backup to Drew Willy, however following a 1‚Äì4 start to the season head- coach Mike O'Shea announced that Nichols would be the starting quarterback for their week 6 match-up against Edmonton. In 2016, Nichols began his tenure as the Bombers starting quarterback with 7 wins in a row propelling the Bombers to a record of 8‚Äì4. The Bombers would finish the season with a record of 11‚Äì7, finishing 3rd place in the Western Division. In the playoffs the Bombers were unable to hold onto a 19-point lead over the BC Lions, falling 32‚Äì31 thus ending their 2016 campaign. Drew Willy was traded in the middle of the season, and veteran quarterback Kevin Glenn was released in January 2017, confirming the Bombers belief that he could be their starting quarterback for the foreseeable future. This sentiment was reinforced when they signed him to a 3-year contract extension on January 18, 2017. Nichols had a breakout 2017 season, setting career highs in every major category (attempts, completions, yards, touchdowns). Nichols led the Bombers to a 12-6 record, clinching a home playoff game; however, the team was defeated by the Eskimos in the first round. During the lead up to the start of the 2018 season Nichols suffered a non-contact knee injury in practice, and it was announced he would miss four to six weeks, returning in four as he made his 2018 debut on July 7 against the BC Lions. Nichols had a strong season for the Blue Bombers, leading the team to a record of 10-8 and a playoff berth. The Bombers advanced to the West division finals after defeating the Saskatchewan Roughriders 23-18 on the road, but was unable to overcome the Calgary Stampeders who went on to win the 106th Grey Cup. Nichols was having an outstanding 2019 season and was leading the league in touchdown passes (15) and passer rating (107.2), but suffered an upper-body injury in Week 10 against the BC Lions which caused him to be placed on the six-game injured reserve. On September 26, 2019 it was revealed that Nichols underwent shoulder surgery which meant that he would remain sidelined for the remainder of the 2019 season. Teammate Chris Streveler took over the helm and the Bombers traded for Zach Collaros, these two quarterbacks would go on to help the team win their first championship in 29 years at the 107th Grey Cup. Collaros was signed to a two-year extension in January 2020 following the Grey Cup and the team released Nichols early on January 28, 2020 so that he could find a role as a starter in the CFL.  Toronto Argonauts  Nichols signed with the Toronto Argonauts on February 7, 2020.

Host plant determines the phytoplasma transmission competence of Empoasca decipens (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae). Journal of Economic Entomology, 104: 360-366The adults reach of length and a are homogenously green with whitish markings on its pronotum and vertex. E. decipiens is commonly referred to as the ‚Äúgreen leafhopper‚Äù because of its colouration.https://www.naturespot.org.uk/species/empoasca-decipiens The absence of clear stripes along the forewings can easily distinguish it from the similar leafhopper species E. vitis, but distinguishing it from other leafhoppers with the same colouration requires examination under a microscope. It is present in most of Europe, in the eastern Palearctic realm, in North Africa, in the Near East, and in the Afrotropical realm.Raupach, K., Borgemeister, C., Hommes, M., Poehling, H.-M., S√©tamou, M. 2002. Effect of temperature and host plants on the bionomics of Empoasca decipiens (Homoptera: Cicadellidae). Crop Protection. 21: 113-119. Both nymphs and adults of this small insect are considered to be a very destructive pests on field crops, vegetables and greenhouse plants.  Life history = Reproduction and development  The green leafhopper is dioecious and reproduces sexually. Females will insert their fertilized eggs into the tissue or the stem of a host plant using their ovipositor. The larvae will hatch after 1-4 days. E. decipiens undergoes incomplete metamorphosis, meaning the nymphs resemble adult leafhoppers during their five nymphal stages, but do not develop wings until their fourth instar. Development takes 10-37 days depending on temperature and the host plant selected. The optimal temperature for egg development is 24¬∞C, and broad bean has been recorded numerous times as the preferred host plant although it has been noted to choose a large variety of plants for oviposition. The leafhopper may have 10 generations per year in warmer climates, such as in North Africa, 2-3 generations per years in Europe, and 4-5 generations in greenhouses. Adults can typically be seen from June through to December.https://species.nbnatlas.org/species/NHMSYS0020705542  Habitat  E. decipiens usually colonizes the under surface of leaves. Previous studies have established that the leafhopper prefers species of plants whose leaves lack trichomes, have soft tissues, and are of large size.Naseri, B., Fathipour, Y., Talebi, A., A. 2009. Population density and spatial distribution pattern of Empoasca decipens (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) on different bean species. Journal of Agricultural Science and Technology, 11: 239-248. They typically aggregate in groups on leaves when population density is high, but will be randomly distributed when populations are small. They are diurnal, and studies conducted in Turkey revealed that leafhopper activity starts at 8:00 a.m. and gradually increases to its maximum during the hours of 12:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.Mahmoud, Y. A., Amr, E. M., Ebadah, I. M. A. 2011. Some ecological behaviors of the leafhopper, Empoasca decipiens (Paoli) on some winter plantations in Egypt. Journal of Basic and Applied Scientific Research. 12: 88-94. The amount and time of activity does change with regards to the geographic location of the species.  Feeding damage  Both adult and nymph green leafhoppers are polyphagous and attack various kinds of vegetables, ornamental plants, and field crops.Agboka, K., Tounou, A., K., Poehling, H.-M., Raupach, K., Borgemeister, C. 2003. Searching and oviposition behavior of Anagrus atomus L. (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae) on four host plants of its host, the green leafhopper Empoasca decipiens Paoli (Homoptera: Cicadellidae). Journal of Insect Behavior. 16: 667-678. They do so by puncturing the phloem and xylem tissues of the plants with their stylets. They then inject saliva containing certain chemicals that allow them to rupture plant cells and ingest the mixtures flowing through the plant tissues. The movement of the insect‚Äôs stylet in the plant causes the vessels to become blocked and obstructs the flow of nutrients throughout the disturbed plant. This type of damage is caused by many other leafhopper species and it is called hopperburn.Backus, E. A., Serrano, M. S., Ranger, C. M. 2005. Mechanisms of Hopperburn: an overview of insect taxonomy, behavior, and physiology. Annual Review of Entomology, 50: 125-151. Symptoms of hopperburn resembles plant senescence and include necrosis around the feeding sites, which may cause leaves to prematurely drop, and chlorosis occurring at the leaf margins and around the leaf veins].] This feeding behavior can lead to significant monetary losses for growers of vegetables and crops as hopperburn can reduce the quantity of crops by stunting young plant growth and can reduce overall yield.Atakan, E. 2009. Damage assessment of the leafhopper complex [Asymmetrasca decedens (Paoli) and Empoasca decipiens Paoli] (Homoptera: Cicadellidae) in cotton. Journal of Pest Science, 82: 227-234. Additionally, the chlorosis caused by hopperburn can reduce quality of crops, and stylet punctures can remain visible on some fruits (e.g. capsicum, tomato) decreasing their market value. E. decipiens is considered a pest of many crops throughout its geographical range, and it has increasingly become a serious pest in greenhouses throughout Europe. The green leafhopper has been recorded on broad bean (Vicia faba), green bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), pea (Pisum sativum), potato (Solanum tuberosum), tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), aubergine (Solanum melongena) and cucumber (Cucumis sativus), as well as sugar beet (Beta vulgaris) and cotton (genus Gossypium).  Control = Synthetic insecticides  Synthetic insecticides have been the traditional way of eradicating or controlling for E. decipiens in greenhouses and on crops. Chemical control of E. decipiens can be difficult as many insecticides can also threaten biological control programs already established to protect against other greenhouse pests such as aphids, whiteflies, and leaf miners.Agboka, K., Tounou, A. K., Al-moaalem, R., Poehling, H.-M., Raupach, K., Borgemeister, C. 2004. Life-table study of Anagrus atomus, an egg parasitoid of the green leafhopper Empoasca decipiens, at four different temperatures. Biocontrol. 49: 261-275. Additionally, many insecticides are expensive and difficult to obtain due to their lack of registration as allowable insecticides.Tounou, A. K., Poehling, H.-M., Agboki, K., Raupach, K., Zimmerman, G., Borgemeister, C. 2001. A laboratory assessment of the potential of selected entomopathogenic fungi to control the green leafhopper Empoasca decipiens Paoli (Homoptera: Cicadellidae). Journal of Applied Biosciences, 46: 3195-3204. Buprofezin, an insect growth regulator, has been proven to effectively control for the leafhopper, and it is of little to no harm to other natural organisms present in greenhouses. But, this insecticide does not affect adult leafhoppers who are then still able to cause notable feeding damage.  Biological control  Predators = Orius spp. (minute pirate bugs) are predatory insects that are commonly used as a biological control in greenhouses and against E. decipiens. This form of control is typically unsuccessful in significantly controlling the green leafhopper populations as the leafhopper will hop away when disturbed and are capable of flying, making the chance of a successful capture by a predator such as Orius spp., very difficult. Both the adults and the nymphs exhibit this high mobility which means predatory biological control will not significantly control for a large part of the E. decipiens life cycle. = Parasitoids = The use of parasitoids is another form of control that has been utilized against E. decipiens. Egg parasitism is beneficial because it stops the production of more green leafhoppers which will prevent future damage of plants. Anagrus atomus is a solitary egg parasitoid of that has been most commonly associated with E. decipiens in many studies. Females of this species will search for eggs with their antennae by sensing for traces of leafhopper activity, such as feeding bumps or oviposition wounds, on plants. When they come across host eggs, they will insert their ovipositor into the egg and lay their own eggs within the host egg.Hesami S., Seyedoleslami, H., Ebadi, R. 2004. Biology of Anagrus atomus (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae), an egg parasitoid of the grape leafhopper Arboridia kermanshah (Homoptera: Cicadellidae). Entomological Science, 7: 271-276 One study found that the lowest development threshold for A. atomus was found at the temperature 8.28¬∞C. This temperature is much lower than what is found in many greenhouses where E. decipiens is becoming more predominantly located, therefore the ability of A. atomus to develop at lower temperature thresholds is thought to aid in its effectiveness in controlling the green leafhopper. In the same study, significantly higher numbers of parasitized eggs were found in the stems of plants than in any other parts. This spatial distribution of parasitized eggs corresponds with the preference of egg oviposition in the stems of plants by E. decipiens. The ability of A. atomus to discriminate between infested and non-infested plants, recognize preferences in location for oviposition by E. decipiens, short life cycle, and its ability to parasitize eggs throughout the development of E. decipiens, are all reasons that make A. atomus a parasitoid that may be effective in the biological control for the leafhopper. Additionally, the mean parasitism of A. atomus in this study was 44.7% ranging from 27.2-62.5%. However, the low fecundity of A. atomus often results in no significant effect on host population density, and therefore it is considered poor for controlling E. decipiens if the parasitoid is not used in conjunction with other control methods. = Virulent Fungi = Recent studies have shown that certain fungi that is parasitic towards other Empoasca spp. is also parasitic towards Empoasca decipiens. Specifically, the species M. anisopliae, P. fumosoroseus and B. bassiana. One study found that isolates of these fungi species were virulent to both nymphs and adult E. decipiens. All isolates were proven to be highly virulent to fifth instar nymphs where the fungi caused 60-98% mortality 4-6 days after the nymphs were infected. In the treatments where M. anisopliae and B. bassiana were utilized, first instar nymphs were less sensitive to the effects of the fungi compared to older leaf hoppers. This is most likely due to the ability of the younger nymphs to shed the fungal spores through ecdysis. The fungus species P. fumosoroseus was observed to grow more rapidly on E. decipiens cadavers than any of the other fungi tested. It is thought that this characteristic may enhance the virulence of this fungus to first instar nymphs by growing so rapidly it can overcome multiple molts that E. decipiens nymphs undergo. The ability of these fungi to develop in high humidity and moderate temperature environments, in addition to their virulence, make them good potential microbial controls for E. decipiens.

It is the first recorded theatrical adaptation of the novelPresumption; or, the Fate of Frankenstein - The Image of the Creature - Documenting the Evolution of Frankenstein's CreationDouglas William Hoehn, The First Season of Presumption!; or, The Fate of Frankenstein, Theatre Studies, 26-27 (1979-81), 79-88Charlene E. Bunnell, All the World's a Stage: Dramatic Sensibility in Mary Shelley's Novels, Routledge (2002) - Google Books p35 and had 37 performances during its original run. It was revived at the English Opera House until at least 1850. The play marks the first recorded appearance of Victor Frankenstein‚Äôs servile assistant character, who is known commonly in pop culture as Igor. Here, the character is named 'Fritz', just as he is named in the 1931 film adaptation. Such a character does not exist in the original novel. Mary Shelley attended the play in London during its original run. It was the only presentation of Frankenstein performed during her lifetime. Background Because Charles II had only awarded royal patents allowing for the staging of plays to the \\"Theatres Royal\\" (the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden) all the other theatres, even in 1823, could only perform melodramas, burlesque, pantomimes, puppet theatre, musical entertainments, and spectacles. This meant that Peake's Presumption had to include music, pantomime and spectacle in order for it legally to be staged. Thus, the play had songs that the Creature could react to, pantomime as the Creature was mute and spectacle in the form of an avalanche in the finale. The drama opened on Monday, 28 July 1823, at the head of a programme that included two farces, The Rival Soldiers and Sharp and Flat. In its original form the play ran for thirty-seven performances at the English Opera House during a summer season that lasted for three months.Introduction to Presumption; or, the Fate of Frankenstein on the Romantic Circles website The play was performed in New York City in January 1825, and at the Porte St. Martin in Paris in 1826 - on both occasions with great success.Joseph N. Ireland, Records of the New York Stage From 1750 to 1860, (New York: Benjamin Blom, Inc., 1966), I, 437; Henry Barton Baker, History of the London Stage (New York: Benjamin Blom, Inc., 1968), 284. In the meantime, support for Presumption in London continued through to 1824 when it was performed three times at the Theatre Royal in Covent Garden. The 1824 performances were presented with a different cast with the exception of T. P. Cooke and Robert Keeley, who continued in their roles from the previous year. The play was performed for several evenings in 1827, with William Bennett as Frankenstein, Richard John O. Smith as the Creature, and Keeley as Fritz. The English Opera House occasionally revived Presumption as an afterpiece until at least 1850. Mary Shelley 1823 playbill advertising the closing night of Presumption; or, the Fate of Frankenstein Presumption was seen by Mary Shelley and her father William Godwin on 29 August 1823 at the English Opera House shortly after her return to England.'Shelley's Ghost - reshaping the image of a literary family' - An exhibition by the Bodleian Library and the New York Public Library Shelley approved of the way the Creature, played by T.P. Cooke in over 350 performances during his acting career, was represented by a series of dashes in the advertising.Playbill for Presumption: or, The Fate of Frankenstein - Bodleian Library, Oxford To capitalise on the success of the play, Godwin arranged for his daughter's novel Frankenstein to be reprinted in two volumes with emendations by himself.Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft Frankenstein Bedford Publishing (2000) pg 3 Google Books Mary Shelley, writing to her and her late husband's friend Leigh Hunt, said of the play: > \\"Frankenstein had prodigious success as a drama & was about to be repeated > for the 23rd night at the English opera house.

P. Cooke as --------- in Presumption Set in Geneva 'and its vicinity', Peake's adaptation of Mary Shelley's novel portrays the story of Frankenstein as he creates a mute blue-skinned Creature, known as the Hobgoblin. Often shown through the concerned eyes of his bumbling servant, Fritz, and his esteemed friend, Clerval, Frankenstein's work is brought to light. This play brings Mary Shelley's famous characters to life in a series of three acts, each of which highlight the important themes of community and romance. In the opening scene, Clerval shows concern for Frankenstein's health and continuous work in his laboratory, just like in Mary Shelley's novel. However, in the play, Clerval offers to pay Fritz to find out what work Frankenstein is doing. Clerval's actions are significant by giving the audience a feeling of community, that Frankenstein is not alone, which is very different from the isolation established in Shelley's novel. By having Fritz and Clerval with Frankenstein, there is a diffusion of responsibility for the creation of the Hobgoblin. Fritz states to Clerval, \\"Now my shrewd guess, sir, is that, like Dr. Faustus, my master is raising the devil,\\" sharing that he has a good idea of what Frankenstein is up to (Presumption, Act I, scene I). Neither Clerval nor Fritz try to stop Frankenstein in the midst of his work, even though they show concern for his welfare. The creation of the Creature happens off stage, during which the audience hears Victor Frankenstein cry 'it lives!', and then run on stage as his creation breaks out of the laboratory and reveals itself to the audience. Frankenstein draws a sword and points it at the Creature, who promptly snatches it and breaks it in two. Throwing Victor Frankenstein to the floor, the Creature runs up the staircase and exits the building through a window. Although Frankenstein destroys the Creature in the end by firing upon it with a pistol, triggering an avalanche which kills both of them, his friends rush to try to help him if they can. Fritz states, \\"Oh, I don‚Äôt know, there‚Äôs Mr Frankenstein gone after the great creature, Mr. Clerval and Mr. Felix have gone after Mr. Frankenstein, and I‚Äôm going after them all,\\" displaying the community the men share with Frankenstein (Presumption, Act III, scene IV).

It was the first football video game to feature 3D polygonal graphics (it took longer for football games to adopt fully polygonal graphics than other genres because their large number of players and requisite fast pace made it difficult to do so at a reasonable frame rate). Gameplay NFL GameDay 98 is a football game featuring polygon players and a 3D engine. Development Jerome Bettis and Tim Brown served as the motion capture actors for the game. Reception Like its two predecessors, NFL GameDay 98 was met with critical acclaim. Reviewers universally applauded its pioneering use of polygonal players in a football game, and in particular, the fact that it manages to do so without noticeable slowdown. GameSpot, for example, remarked that \\"After two years of sprite- based 32-bit football games, many believed it wasn't possible to create a fully 3D PlayStation football game without making tremendous sacrifices in gameplay or aesthetics. NFL GameDay '98 is proof that the PlayStation is capable of accomplishing such feats.\\" Next Generation stated that \\"While Madden is still trying to get old school done right in the 32-bit age, Sony has, for the third year in a row, successfully reinvented the wheel and made it spin.\\" Some critics also noted that the use of polygons for the players enabled new moves that would not be possible with sprites. Reviews also widely praised the game's accessibility, player animations, and sound effects. However, some still concluded that it fell second to its chief competitor, Madden NFL 98. GameSpot found the selection of moves excessive and the A.I. more vulnerable to \\"money plays\\" than that of Madden NFL 98. Electronic Gaming Monthlys Kraig Kujawa likewise found it too susceptible to \\"money plays\\" to consider it as outstanding as Madden, though his co-reviewer Dean Hager held NFL GameDay 98 to be the better of the two games. GamePro, while giving it a 4.5 out of 5 in sound and a perfect 5.0 in every other category (graphics, control, and funfactor), found it to be less realistic than Madden, likening it to stepping outside during the Super Bowl to play street football. Next Generation, however, asserted that if Madden NFL 98 were to outsell NFL GameDay 98, \\"then there is a serious problem with the game-buying public.\\" In 1997 Electronic Gaming Monthly named the PlayStation version the 31st best console video game of all time (while ranking Madden NFL 98 as 19th best), citing its revolutionary 3D graphics and solid gameplay. Note: Contrary to the title, the intro to the article (on page 100) explicitly states that the list covers console video games only, meaning PC games and arcade games were not eligible.

It was written to commemorate the death of composer's daughter, Olga Jan√°ƒçkov√°. Jan√°ƒçek composed the piece to the text of the Russian teacher Marfa Nikolayevna Veveritsa.  Background  Olga was the first-born child of Leo≈° and Zdenka Jan√°ƒçek. She was born on 15 August 1882 in Brno.Helfert (2006), p. VI From her childhood, she showed remarkable talent in various arts, though not in music (to the mild disappointment of her father). Her mother later recalled that \\"[Olga] grew up into a lovely girl. Her skin was delicate and smooth with a peach-bloom to it; like her father, she had a dimple in her chin.\\"Helfert (2006), p. II (Ale hned od maliƒçka mƒõla po t√°tovi tvrdou hlaviƒçku.) Sadly, her health was poor from an early age, and her physical state brought a lot of anxiety to her parents. At the age of six, she fell ill with inflammation of joints. She recovered, however, the illness negatively affected the functioning of the heart. The situation worsened after her younger brother Vladim√≠r died in November, 1890. Olga remained the only child of her parents, and also the only bond connecting the members of the family.Helfert (2006), p. II (Od t√© doby byla Olgy jedin√°, kter√° tvo≈ôila pouto rodiny Jan√°ƒçkovy.) Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek and his daughter, both keen admirers and supporters of Russian culture, were members of the Russian Circle in Brno. In March, 1902, the composer accompanied Olga to Saint Petersburg, in order to deepen her knowledge of Russian language and to let her become familiar with Russian life and society. His brother Franti≈°ek worked there as a teacher. A month later, Olga fell ill with typhoid fever. Her health deteriorated rapidly, and she was forced to return to Brno in July of the same year. After her return, she spent some time in Hukvaldy in order to recuperate; however, her illness reappeared with new and worse complications. After months of suffering, Olga Jan√°ƒçkov√° died on 26 February 1903. Her parents were completely devastated. Jan√°ƒçek, raving with pain and despair, tore at his hair and cried: \\"My soul, my soul!\\". Zdenka later remembered their loneliness and despair in her memories: \\"We stayed in our dining room alone. Abandoned, silent. I looked at Leo≈°. He sat in front of me, destroyed, thin, grey-haired.\\"Helfert (2006), p. II (Z≈Østali jsme v j√≠delnƒõ sami dva. Opu≈°tƒõn√≠, nemluvn√≠. Zad√≠vala jsem se na Leo≈°e. Sedƒõl p≈ôede mnou zniƒçen√Ω, zhubl√Ω, pro≈°edivƒõl√Ω.) Jan√°ƒçek dedicated two of his works to his daughter.Ort (2005), p. 48 He inscribed the first published piano reduction of the opera Jen≈Øfa, his first masterwork and the composition which later opened him the way to the world opera stages, \\"To the memory of Olga Jan√°ƒçkov√°\\".Helfert (2006), p. VII The second work, the Elegy, was inspired by their common love of Russian culture. It was composed to original Russian verses written by Marfa Veveritsa, a member of the Russian Circle and a friend of Olga. The composition was completed on 28 April 1903, however, Jan√°ƒçek later (in March, 1904) altered some parts of it. The Elegy was apparently composed directly to the Russian original, and it was translated later by B. Zavadil. It was premiered after Jan√°ƒçek's death, on 20 December 1930, in the Brno Radio. The manuscript of the composition was not preserved. The duration of the work is approximately 6 minutes.  Recordings  *Jan√°ƒçek, Leo≈°: Vƒõƒçn√© evangelium [The Eternal Gospel] [CD].

All four were executed by beheading on 10 November 1943 less than 3 minutes apart from each other at Hamburg's Holstenglacis Prison (then called Untersuchungshaftanstalt Hamburg-Stadt, in English: Investigative Custody Centre of the City of Hamburg). Eyewitnesses reported that the blood of the four clergymen literally ran together on the guillotine and on the floor. This impressed contemporaries as a symbol of the ecumenical character of the men's work and witness. That interpretation is supported by their last letters from prison, and statements they themselves made during their time of suffering, torture and imprisonment. \\"We are like brothers,\\" Hermann Lange said.  History  The Catholic priests worked at the Herz-Jesu Kirche (Sacred Heart Church) in the centre of L√ºbeck, Prassek as a chaplain, M√ºller as assistant minister and Lange as vicar. Stellbrink was pastor of the city's Lutherkirche (Luther Church). The four had been close friends since 1941, exchanging information and ideas, and sharing sermons, including those of Clemens August Graf von Galen, Catholic bishop of M√ºnster. In his Palm Sunday sermon, 29 March 1942, Stellbrink said \\"In the misery of our home city we hear God's voice\\" [quoted from Stellbrink's Statement given during interrogation 9 April 1942http://www.luebeckermaertyrer.de/en/geschichte/dokumente/vernehmung- stellbrink.html (Accessed 26 January 2018)] which some had interpreted then as Stellbrink meaning God's judgment upon the city was expressed in the effects of a British air raid on L√ºbeck the previous night. More than 300 people had been killed, the worst civilian casualties in an Allied bombing raid up to that time in the war.Beheaded by Hitler: Cruelty of the Nazis, Judicial Terror and Civilian Executions, 1933‚Äì1945; Fonthill Media, Stroud; 2014. Stellbrink was arrested on 7 April 1942, followed by Prassek on 18 May, Lange on 15 June, and M√ºller on 22 June. In addition to the clerics, a further 18 Catholic lay people were arrested, including Stephan Pf√ºrtner, who later became a moral theologian. A year later, between 22 and 23 June 1943, the trial of the four men took place before the second chamber of the People's Court, with Wilhelm Crohne presiding. He had journeyed to L√ºbeck specifically for the trial. Following Joseph Goebbel's directive that the People's Court's judges \\"must base their decisions less on law and more on the basic idea that the law- breakers be removed from the national community\\",Quantifying Resistance: Political Crime and the People's Court in Nazi Germany; Springer Nature Singapore; Singapore; 2017 the clerics were sentenced to death for 'broadcasting crime [specifically, listening to enemy broadcasts http://www.luebeckermaertyrer.de/en/geschichte/index.html (accessed 2 May 2011)], treasonable support for the enemy and demoralisation of the Armed Forces'. Some of their co-accused lay brethren received long prison sentences. The trial became known as the \\"L√ºbeck Christians' Trial\\", an indication of the anti-Christian bias in the proceedings. The clerics were immediately transferred to Hamburg's Holstenglacis Prison, which had become the regional center for executions in 1936 and had added an execution building with permanently mounted guillotine in 1938.Untersuchungshaftanstalt Hamburg-Stadt website, German language. Between 1938 and the end of the war in 1945, 500 executions took place at this site. A plaque on the prison wall now honors the four L√ºbeck martyrs. The Catholic bishop under whose care the Catholic priests fell, Wilhelm Berning (Diocese of Osnabr√ºck) visited the priests in prison and wrote a plea for clemency, which was rejected. Pastor Stellbrink received no support from his Province's church authorities, and prior to his execution was ejected from Holy Orders because of his conviction. The four clerics were guillotined on 10 November 1943.  Karl Friedrich Stellbrink (28 October 1894 ‚Äì 10 November 1943)  Son of a customs official, Karl Friedrich StellbrinkSee biographical page(English)at the Memorial Center for German Resistance (GDW) in Berlin - http://www.gdw-berlin.de/bio/ausgabe_mit-e.php?id=290 served in the First World War until he was medically discharged in 1917 with a crippling wound to his hand. After completing his Lutheran theology studies, he was ordained in 1921 to the Evangelical Church of Prussia's older Provinces. In the early days of the Nazi regime he was briefly caught up by the political movement and joined the Party. He soon realized, however, its inhumanity and incompatibility with Christian teaching. He was called before a Nazi Party investigative board when he refused to break off his friendships with Jews. He quit the Party in 1937. After his death, Stellbrink's widow was billed for his court costs, imprisonment, and execution. Fifty years would pass before the North Elbian Evangelical Lutheran Church, successor of the L√ºbeck Lutheran church body, would initiate court proceedings to clear Stellbrink's name and admit their shame at how this noble martyr had been treated. In November 1993, the German courts officially overturned the guilty verdict against him.  Johannes Prassek (13 August 1911 ‚Äì 10 November 1943)  Johannes PrassekCf. GDW biographical page(English)- http://www.gdw- berlin.de/bio/ausgabe_mit-e.php?id=283 was ordained to the Catholic priesthood in 1937. Father Prassek was assigned to Herz-Jesu Church together with Eduard M√ºller and Hermann Lange. He openly warned soldiers and youth groups against antisemitism, and protested the shooting of prisoners and Jews. Under German law at that time, such words were subject to the death penalty if reported to the Gestapo. Because of his sympathy for Polish workers who were forced laborers in the area, Father Prassek learned Polish so he could minister to them. Again, such ministry was illegal and could have led to his arrest - but the Gestapo never found out.  Eduard M√ºller (20 August 1911 ‚Äì 10 November 1943)  Eduard M√ºllerCf.

Ordained as a Catholic priest in 1940, he served at the Herz-Jesu Church. His youth group work and a discussion group he directed were very popular. Having experienced trade training himself probably gave him special rapport with young journeymen of the discussion group he led.  Hermann Lange (16 April 1912 ‚Äì 10 November 1943)  Hermann LangeCf. GDW biographical page(English)- http://www.gdw-berlin.de/bio/ausgabe_mit-e.php?id=277 was an intellectual preacher. He told young soldiers, in discussions, that participation in a war was strongly against the Christian faith. He wrote in a letter from prison on 25 July 1943 about the ecumenical consequences of the sufferings he and his fellow Catholics had shared with their Lutheran neighbors, even prior to the shared arrests and imprisonment: \\"The common sufferings of the past few years have brought about a rapprochement of the two Churches. The imprisonment of the Catholic and Protestant clergy is a symbol both of their joint suffering and of the rapprochement.\\"Quotation in: Conscience in Revolt: Sixty-four Stories of Resistance in Germany 1933-45.

On the left, the Loggia degli Osii (farther) and Palazzo delle Scuole Palatine (closer); on the right, the Palazzo della Ragione Piazza MercantiAlso known as \\"Piazza dei Mercanti\\", although the particle \\"dei\\" (\\"of\\") is not part of the formal name. (\\"Merchants Square\\") is a central city square of Milan, Italy. It is located between Piazza del Duomo, which marks the centre of the modern city of Milan, and Piazza Cordusio, and it used to be the heart of the city in the Middle Ages. At the time, the square was larger than it is now (as part of it has later become what is now Via Mercanti, the street located between Palazzo dei Giureconsulti and Palazzo della Ragione) and known as \\"Piazza del Broletto\\", after the \\"Broletto Nuovo\\", the palace that occupied the centre of the square (now on the north side). In the 13th century, there were six entry points to the square, each associated to a specific trade, from sword blacksmiths to hat makers. Until the late 19th century, Oh bej! Oh bej! (the most important and traditional fair of Milan) was held in Piazza Mercanti. The palaces The square houses four main buildings: * the \\"Broletto Nuovo\\", also known as Palazzo della Ragione, occupies the north-eastern side. It was built in 1233, and served as the \\"broletto\\", i.e., the administrative headquarters of the city. In the original layout of the piazza, which extended further to the north-east, the palace was located in the centre. * the Gothic Casa Panigarola, also known as \\"Palazzo dei Notai\\" (Notary's Palace), built in the 15th century, is on the south- western side; * the Baroque Palazzo delle Scuole Palatine, built in the 17th century and designed by Carlo Buzzi, is on the south-eastern side; it replaced a former building known as \\"Scuole del Broletto\\" (\\"Broletto Schools\\"); * also on the south-eastern side is the Loggia degli Osii, built in 1316 for Matteo I Visconti and designed by Scoto da San Gimignano; this was also an administrative seat, and included the parlera, i.e., the balcony from which the authorities addressed the population. The 16th century Palazzo dei Giureconsulti, now located in Via Mercanti, used to mark the north-eastern side of the piazza before it was redesigned. It was built in 1561 on a design by Vincenzo Seregni; the tower of the building is much older, dating back to the 13th century (although it was largely restored in the 17th century). At the centre of the square is a 16th-century pit, surmounted by two 18th century columns. The pit was originally adjacent to the Palazzo dei Giureconsulti; where it stands now, a large stone was found, known as the \\"pietra dei falliti\\" (\\"bankrupts stone\\"), where those guilty of bankruptcy would have their naked bottom exposed as a penance.Guida ai misteri e segreti di Milano (SugarCo 1977), p. 272 Monuments A number of statues and other monuments are found in Piazza Mercanti. Palazzo della Ragione has two renowned reliefs, one of a boar (that is reportedly of Roman origin and associated to the legend of the scrofa semilanuta) and one representing Oldrado da Tresseno, who ordered the construction of the palace itself. Sculptor Giovan Pietro Lasagna has realized two statues of the square, that dedicated to Ausonius (located on Porta Orefici, i.e., the \\"Jewellers' Portal\\", one of the entry points to the square) and that dedicated to Augustine of Hippo (on the facade of the Scuole Palatine). Another notable statue dedicated to Ambrose, by sculptor Luigi Scorzini, is found on the facade of the Palazzo dei Giureconsulti. References in popular culture A sequence of the film Chiedimi se sono felice by the comedian trio Aldo, Giovanni e Giacomo has the trio play a basket game in Piazza Mercanti, using the iron aureola of the statue of a saint as the basket.

It has many common names, including bur tree, canary wood, Leichhardt pine and yellow cheesewood. It grows to a maximum of around in height and has large glossy leaves. It bears spherical clusters of fragrant flowers that develop into golf ball-sized edible but bitter fruits. The yellowish to orange soft wood is also used for timber and in woodcarving and folk medicine. Taxonomy and nomenclature Mature bark Nauclea orientalis is known by the common names Leichhardt tree, cheesewood, yellow cheesewood, and canary cheesewood. It is also sometimes known as the Leichhardt pine due to the overall shape of the tree, though it is not a conifer. \\"Leichhardt pine\\", however, is more commonly used for the kadam or burrflower tree (Neolamarckia cadamba), a closely related species. The two were often confused together, but the native range of Leichhardt trees do not extend to India where kadam trees are common. It is known chiefly as bangkal in the Philippines. Regional variations of the name include balikakak, kabag, kabak, mabalot, and malbog. It is closely related and sometimes confused with the bongkol or bulubangkal tree (Nauclea subdita). It is called kanluang in Thailand.C. Orwa, A. Mutua, R. Kindt, R. Jamnadass, & S. Anthony (2009). Nauclea orientalis L. (Rubiaceae). Agroforestree Database:a tree reference and selection guide version 4.0 , World Agroforestry Centre. Retrieved May 3, 2011 Among the Djabugay people of Australia, they are known as gadugay. Among the Kuku Yalanji, they are known as kabal. The Jawoyn people call it jirrib or wowerlk. In various other languages of the Indigenous Australians, the names for Leichhardt trees include kaapi or kalpi in Pakanh, atulwanyj in Uw Oykangand, atulganyj in Uw Olkola. In avoidance speech (Uw Ilbmbanhdhiy or \\"respect language\\"), it is known as oboy in Uw Oykangand and opoy in Uw Olkola. The common name \\"Leichhardt tree\\" is from the German explorer Ludwig Leichhardt, who encountered the tree in his first expedition from Moreton Bay to Port Essington (from October 1, 1844 to December 17, 1845). He mistakenly identified it as a closely related Sarcocephalus and remarked on their preponderance near large riverbanks. Leichhardt trees belong to the genus Nauclea classified under the tribe Naucleeae, subfamily Cinchonoideae of the coffee family (Rubiaceae). The species was first described as Cephalanthus orientalis by Carl Linnaeus in the first edition of Species Plantarum, but was transferred to the genus Nauclea in the second edition in 1762. The specific epithet orientalis means \\"eastern\\". The generic name Nauclea comes from Greek naus (\\"ship\\") and kleio (\\"close\\"). It is unknown why, as no part of the plant is remotely boat-like. A likely explanation is that Linnaeus was using different parts of plants when he first described the species and may have erroneously attributed a boat-like part of another plant to the species. It might also be a reference to the shape of the fruit cells. Description The spherical inflorescence of Leichhardt trees. Leichhardt trees are medium to tall trees, reaching maximum height of around with a diameter of . They are deciduous, shedding their leaves during the dry season. The bark surface of Liechhardt trees are grayish to reddish brown and may be smooth or fissured and flaky. It is orange to yellow in color when cut. The broadly ovate smooth (glabrous) leaves are opposite and around by in size. The upper surface is glossy green. The bottom side has raised prominent yellow venation. Like most members of the family Rubiaceae, the stipules of Leichhardt trees are interpetiolar. In Nauclea, these interpetiolar stipules are held erect and pressed together, resulting in strongly flattened vegetative buds. They are large, around long. On their inside surfaces are a number of small red glands that can resemble insect eggs. The small fragrant flowers are tubular and are yellowish to orange with white stamens. They are grouped into a spherical cluster originating from a central point about in diameter. They bloom from September to January in Australia, and August to October in the Philippines. The individual flowers are small, about long and in diameter. They possess a perianth (each composed of five petals and sepals in separate whorls), The internal surface of the corolla are yellow to orange and sweet-smelling. They are frequently partly fused together, forming a long corolla tube tipped with the individual lobes of the petals. The flowers are bisexual, with 5 short and separate stamens attached to the perianth. The calyces are also fused together, resulting in the spherical shape of the flower head. They are epigynous, with the ovary inferior (lying below the attachment of the other flower parts). After three months, the flower heads develop into a fleshy globular multiple fruit (syncarp) joined by their calyces (each flower becoming a fruitlet containing one seed). They are around in diameter, about the size of a golf ball. The fruit is rugose (wrinkled), brown, and strongly aromatic. The fruits are indehiscent. The ovoid to ellipsoid seeds are small, around in length and are not winged. They are very numerous but do not remain viable for long. Being recalcitrant (unable to survive drying and freezing temperatures), it's impossible to store them. The seeds germinate above ground (epigeal germination) around 15 days after being sown. Distribution and habitat Leichhardt tree from Gregory National Park, Northern Territory, Australia Leichhardt trees usually grow near bodies of water, as they prefer alluvial soils. They can occur from shrublands of rheophytes, in areas often subjected to flooding, to rainforests where they flourish best. Leichhardt trees are pioneer species, settling areas leading to ecological succession. In Australia, they are usually associated in ecosystems including red gums and honey myrtles in drier habitats. In wetter areas they are associated with brush cherries, Moreton Bay chestnuts, and blush walnuts. They grow along with honey myrtles in swamps. In the Philippines, Leichhardt trees are usually found growing in secondary forests. Leichhardt trees grow at elevations of above sea level. Their native range extends from tropical Northern Australia and New Guinea to Southeast Asia; from the Philippines to Myanmar and Thailand (the biogeographic region of Malesia). They are the only species of Nauclea occurring in Australia, though in some regions they can be easily confused with species from the genus Neolamarckia (=Acanthocephalus). Uses The tree is cultivated for ornamental purposes. The fruits of the tree are edible and are eaten by Indigenous Australians, though it is very bitter-tasting. They are also eaten by flying foxes and birds (like Cassowaries). In Malaysia, it is one of the food sources of proboscis monkeys (Nasalis larvatus), along with other members of Rubiaceae. The wood is easily cut (hence the common name of \\"cheesewood\\") but is not durable to weather exposure. It is distinctively yellowish to orange in color. The timber is used for frames and internal floorboards. It is also used in woodcarving, paper production, house construction, and for making canoes. The bark is also used to make fish poison. The extract is added to slow-moving bodies of water to stun fish and make them easier to catch. In folk medicine, bark infusions cause vomiting and are used by Indigenous Australians to treat stomachaches and animal bites. It is the source of a yellow dye. In the Philippines, it is used to treat wounds. Studies on indole alkaloids extracted from Leichhardt trees have also pointed to possible antimalarial and anticancer effects. Pests and diseases Leichhardt trees are susceptible to Lyctus beetles and blue stain fungus (Grosmannia clavigera). It is also reportedly vulnerable to termites.

The light station was one of the most important lights in the archipelago. It was established in 1853 to guide ships to the entrance of Manila Bay on their way to the port of Manila, the most important trading center in the country. This light occupies the converging point of two lines of approach for vessels from the China Sea which steer for the entrance of the Manila Bay. Vessels from Hong Kong and the ports of China to the northwest first sight the Capones Island light off the southwest coast of Zambales. Vessels from ports of Indo- China first sight the Corregidor lights in the center. Vessels from Singapore, Indonesia, India, and all the ports of the Philippine Islands, to the south, first sight the Cabra Island light. All lines converge on Corregidor light at the bay entrance.United States Bureau of Insular Affairs. \\"A Pronouncing Gazetteer and Geographical Dictionary of the Philippine Islands, United States of America\\", p. 186. Washington Government Printing Office, 1902. Description Corregidor, together with Caballo Island, divide the entrance of the bay into the North Channel and South Channel, also known as Boca Chica and Boca Grande, respectively in the Spanish era. The passage between the two islands is only 1/4 mile and is dangerous for large vessels. The lighthouse was located on the highest point of the island (later known as the Topside) with an effective height of above sea level or 42-ft high from the base of the light tower. The total height of the tower measured from the base to the top of the wind vane. The light was obscured when well into the steep north side of the island. The cylindrical tower was originally colored gray with octagonal keeper's dwelling surrounding the base. The roof of the base also doubles as rain collector for the cisterns next to the lighthouse, which provide water not for only the station but supplements the need of the island. History The lighthouse in 1893 during the Spanish colonial period. Spanish Colonial Era The two light stations, Corregidor and Caballo, were the second oldest lighthouses established in the country after the lighthouse at the mouth of Pasig River.\\"Guia Oficial de Filipinas, 1892\\", p.107. Tipo-Litografias de Choere y Comp., Escolta num. 33, 1892. The establishment of a lighthouse station on the island of Corregidor was recommended in the year 1835 during the administration of Governor Pascual Enrile y Alcedo. Its construction was not authorized, however, until 1846 with the passing of Royal Order of April 14 by the Spanish Government.San Pedro, D. Joaquin Rodriguez, \\"Legislacion Ultramarina, Tomo Cuatro\\", p.532. Establecimiento Tipografico de Jose Fernandez Cancela, Madrid, 1865. The lighthouse was not completed until 1853 - eighteen years after the recommendation of its construction had been made.Vargas, Jose B. (1934). \\"A Brief Outline of Aids to Navigation in the Philippine Archipelago\\". Port of Manila Yearbook 1934, p.21. On January 18, 1853, notice to mariners were released announcing the start of service on February 1, 1853 for the second- order light on Corregidor, together with the fourth-order light on Caballo Island. Both lighthouses were equipped with lighting apparatus from Henry Lepaute of Paris. The white light on the summit of Corregidor revolved once every ten or twenty seconds, and visible in clear weather from a distance of 20 miles. Later, a fixed white light was also shown from the white tower on the West Mole Head, at the entrance to the bay on the north side of the island. In 1897, the aging lighting apparatus was replaced by a provisional light of the same character, but of less power, before the installation of a new permanent light that was exhibited on August 1, 1897. The new apparatus flashed white and red light, showing white and red flashes alternately every ten seconds, separated by total eclipses, and is visible 36 miles in clear weather. The lighthouse in 1899 during the Philippine-American War American Colonial Period When the Americans took control of the country, the newly established Bureau of Coast Guard and Coast Guard made a complete tour of the country, inspecting all lighthouses and stations in the archipelago in 1902. All the lighthouses were found urgently needing repairs to preserve their good condition, to make the stations efficient and habitable. In Corregidor, repairs were done to rehabilitate the dwellings and tower, and a bamboo fence was erected.U.S. War Department. \\"Report of the Philippine Commission, 1902 Part I\\", pp. 243-245. Washington Government Printing Office. The main construction works in 1903 were renovating the old buildings, and the construction of new quarters for the light station. A school of apprentices was established in Manila the previous year to train competent lighthouse keepers, using Corregidor lighthouse as a training station. Three frame buildings for quarters and kitchens were erected.U.S. War Department. \\"Fourth Annual Report of the Philippine Commission, 1903, Part 1\\", pp.202-203. Washington Government Printing Office. The year after, a small party was sent to this station to make more minor repairs to doors, windows, and drains, part of the appropriation from Acts 807 and 1049.Bureau of Insular Affairs, War Department. \\"Fifth Annual Report of the Philippine Commission, 1904, Part 3 of 3\\"] , p.152. Washington Government Printing Office, 1905. In 1905, the bamboo fence at Corregidor light station being found in bad condition and was replaced with posts and boards. The system of gutters was changed to increase the water supply. A latrine was built, new floors were put in the keepers' dwellings as they were damaged by termites.Bureau of Insular Affairs, War Department. \\"Sixth Annual Report of the Philippine Commission, 1905, Part 3 of 4\\"], pp.287-289. Washington Government Printing Office, 1906. With funds from the approval of Act No. 1225 for lighthouse maintenance, some were applied to the purchase of the necessary parts from Paris to convert the polygonal lantern at Corregidor into a cylindrical lantern to diminish the interval between flashes from ten to five seconds and to replace the wick burner with the incandescent system. In 1908, the Corregidor Island became a U.S. military installation and was designated as Fort Mills as part of the harbor defense of Manila Bay. The Americans started fortifying the island as main naval defense fort for the bay in case of war. World War II On December 8, 1941, the day the Japanese invaded the Philippines, the lighthouses on Corregidor, Caballo, and Monja Island were extinguished as agreed by the Navy and the Harbor Defense Commander.\\"The Moore Report-The Campaign\\". Corregidor.org. Retrieved on 2011-05-31. From December 16, Corregidor lighthouse was used by the Navy to facilitate the entrance of submarines carrying supplies and ammunition for the troops on the island as authorized by General Douglas MacArthur. The light was shown the first ten minutes of each one-half hour on a secret schedule furnished by the Navy for each entry. Only white light was shown and on a fixed specified azimuth. As the submarine passes through the controlled mine fields, the Inshore Patrol coordinating with the Harbor Defense put the mines on \\"safe\\" and the marking buoys were illuminated by searchlights. The first damage to the lighthouse happened on January 14 around noon when two flights of bombers, nine each, bombed mostly the Topside. The lighthouse and surrounding buildings were damaged but the light was still operable using a kerosene lamp. During the fight for liberation from the Japanese, the island was heavily bombed leaving every building in the island in ruins. The lighthouse did not survive the bombardment. The lighthouse today Around the 1950s, the lighthouse was rebuilt using some of the original stones from the ruins but using a different design. The base now houses a souvenir shop for tourists of the historical island. The lantern was replaced in the 1990s with a solar-powered light as part of the Maritime Safety Improvement Project by the Philippine Coast Guard.\\"Project Summary and Comparison of Original Plan and Actual\\".

The woods are centred at grid reference 53.820061,-1.560144Google Maps and are enclosed by Meanwood Road to the east and by Headingley to the north and Woodhouse, Leeds to the South. The Ridge has a number of interesting features, including a Victorian bandstand, a world war two air raid shelter, a packhorse bridge, the Meanwood Beck and allotments, all connected by a network of public footpaths. History The Ridge is one of the few remaining woodland areas of the ancient manor of Leeds.Leodis - a photographic archive of Leeds - Display The area was set aside for leisure activities from at least 1846, when it was partly quarried open moorland with a network of paths.Forest of Leeds - Woodhouse Ridge & Sugarwell Hill This network of paths and a bandstand is visible in photographs from the early twentieth century, at which time the area was much more open than it is today, with areas of moorland and views across the undeveloped valley to Farm Hill and Sugar Well Hill.Leodis - a photographic archive of Leeds - DisplayLeodis - a photographic archive of Leeds - DisplayLeodis - a photographic archive of Leeds - Display The public area was expanded in 1901 with the addition of Batty's Wood, an area of oak and ash woodland that is shown on John Tuke's 1781 map of common land in Leeds district as \\"Battye Wood\\", located on steeply sloping land above Meanwood Beck, its western flank marked by a footpath to the bridge crossing to former Bentley Common. Battye or Batty's's Wood was a gift from Alderman John Warburton to the City of Leeds. In 1974, the abandoned mill buildings and silted millpond abutting the Meanwood Beck, which were believed to have dated from at least 1610 were acquired by the City Council, demolished and the site planted with trees and a grassy glade and added to The Ridge's parkland. The nickname 'The Ridge' is captured in the names of three local streets: Ridge Road, which runs from Meanwood Road up to The Ridge's southern entrance, Ridge Grove, a short residential street off Meanwood Road backing on to the woodland and Ridge Terrace which leads to the northern Headingley entrance, from Wood Lane.

Don Fernando Ruiz de Castro (Opening stanzas from a poem in El Drama Universal by Ram√≥n de Campoamor, with translation.) :Mi esposa Estefan√≠a, que est√° en gloria, :fue del S√©ptimo Alfonso hija querida; :desde hoy sabr√©is, al escuchar su historia, :que hay desgracias sin fin en nuestra vida. :Yo la mat√© celoso; y si, remiso, :no me mat√© tambi√©n la noche aquella, :fue por matar despu√©s, si era preciso, :a todo el que, cual yo, dudase de ella. My wife Estefan√≠a, who is in glory, / was of Alfonso VII a dear daughter; / after today you will know, upon listening to this story, / that there are disgraces without end in our life. // Jealous, I killed her; and if, reluctant, / I did not kill myself also that night, / it was to kill later, if it was necessary, / all who, like me, doubted her. She bore her husband two sons, among them Pedro Fern√°ndez de Castro. Death On 1 July 1180, Stephanie was murdered by her husband, Fernando, who according to some sources listed, while others have left no record of the event, it is assumed that his wife had been unfaithful and murdered. When Fernando first heard about his wife's affair with an unknown man, he watched the lovers. He then later stabbed the man to death. Later, he entered the chambers of his wife and stabbed her to death. When Fernando realized what the situation had turned to, he begged for forgiveness from his brother-in-law the King. The King did not punish his brother-in-law for the murder. Stephanie was buried in the basilica of San Isidoro de Le√≥n. She left two young children.

Six riders would sit in a raft that resembled a giant tyre and wind their way down a river with artificial rapids in it. At the completion of the four-minute cycle, many customers would step off wet. The ride was extremely popular during the warmer summer months as an easy way to cool down. When Wonderland Sydney first opened the ride was staffed by up to 8 people. There were four staff on the loading platform and four positioned around the ride in towers. Their job was to keep an eye on the boats as they went around, and ran smoothly. Over time, and as cost cutting was made, a number of the staff were replaced by cameras, and the ride was operated by only two people. It was a common misconception of customers, that the staff members whose job it was to observe the ride from the towers were also in charge on the geysers that shot water into the air and over the boats as they passed. This activity was actually controlled by the location of sensors placed throughout the ride, that were triggered when a boat went past.

It was established in 1877 and was dissolved in 1927. The organisation was secular, utilitarian, individualistic, and \\"above all malthusian.\\" The organisation maintained that it was concerned about the poverty of the British working class and held that over-population was the chief cause of poverty. History The league was initially founded during the \\"Knowlton trial\\" of Annie Besant and Charles Bradlaugh in July 1877. They were prosecuted for publishing Charles Knowlton's Fruits of Philosophy which explained various methods of birth control. A publication about birth control. View original copy. The League was formed as a permanent body to advocate for the elimination of penalties for promoting birth control as well as to promote public education in matters of contraception. The trial demonstrated that the public was interested in the topic of contraception and sales of the book surged during the trial. Origins The first president was Charles Robert Drysdale, who was succeeded by his free union partner Alice Vickery. The league initially restricted itself primarily to an \\"educative role\\" which emphasised the importance of Malthus' economic arguments rather than practical information about birth control. The league had an increasingly socially and economically conservative tone as the 19th century wore on. Thus some earlier agreement between Malthusians and social reformers was replaced by mutual distrust. The league believed that the sole cause of poverty was an excess of births, and therefore opposed socialism, considered strikes and reforms of labour laws to be \\"useless.\\" League members were primarily middle class and did not make many serious efforts to communicate with the working class aside from some debates with socialists during the 1880s. Although the league doctrine as a whole was hostile to socialism, some members were indeed socialists who were sympathetic to arguments in favour of birth control. The league also maintained some overlap with the women's rights movement, which was concerned with birth control. The League began plans for a birth control clinic in 1917 but these stalled until they received funds from the philanthropist Sir John Sumner and finally the clinic opened on 9 November 1921 at 153a East Street, Walworth with Norman Haire as their honorary medical officer, three afternoons a week. Marie Stopes and her husband had opened their clinic nine months earlier. Stopes‚Äô clinic was the first in the British Empire (but not the first in the world) and the League always emphasised that theirs was the first English clinic where birth control instruction was given under medical supervision.Diana Wyndham. (2012) Foreword by the Hon. Michael Kirby AC CMG. (Sydney: , p. 77 International Movements Similar leagues were founded in several other European countries including Germany, France, and the Netherlands in the following years. In 1892, the Dutch league became the first to set up a medical clinic to provide information directly to the poor. The period of the league's activity coincided with a substantial drop in the birth rate in Britain, and many European countries. Some have credited its activities, but others have disputed this conclusion, citing the general fall in birth rates even in countries without active league activity. The Malthusian League forms part of the society within Aldous Huxley's novel Brave New World.

Parvaz entered Syria at Damascus on Friday, April 29, 2011, to cover the Syrian protests and was not heard from for the next nineteen days. After it was reported that she was missing, campaigns were formed on Twitter and Facebook to press the Syrian government to free her. Syria revealed that Parvaz had been deported to Iran. On May 18, 2011, Dorothy was released by Iranian authorities. Born in Iran, she holds passports from Iran, Canada, and the United States. She is the global politics reporter at ThinkProgress.  Early life  Homa Dorothy Parvaz was born in October 1971 in Tehran, Iran to an Iranian father and an American mother. She lived in Iran until she was ten years old, then spent the next four years in Dubai. Parvaz moved to Canada with her family in 1985, ultimately graduating from a Canadian high school.  Education  Parvaz obtained her undergraduate degree in English literature from the University of British Columbia. She subsequently obtained a master's degree in journalism from the University of Arizona. She has been the recipient of journalism fellowships at Harvard and Cambridge.  Career  After obtaining her degree from the University of British Columbia, Parvaz worked for the English language edition of the Asahi Shimbun in Japan. Following her sojourn in Japan, Parvaz obtained her master's degree in journalism from the University of Arizona. She moved to Seattle in 1999, where she worked first for The Seattle Times, then as a columnist, feature writer, and ultimately editorial board member for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. After the latter ceased to exist as a print newspaper, and following her journalism fellowships, she accepted employment with Al Jazeera, for whom she reported on the 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami. Parvaz is now the global politics reporter at ThinkProgress. She is based in Washington, D.C..  Disappearance  Parvaz arrived in Syria on Friday, April 29, 2011, via Qatar Airways to cover recent protests there for Al Jazeera. She was not heard from after landing at the airport, and it was suspected that she had been detained at the airport. Her family feared for her safety. Syria's efforts to limit foreign media coverage of recent events had previously led to the detention of numerous journalists. On May 2, 2011, Parvaz's family released the following statement: Voices calling for her release included her immediate family, her fianc√© (Luxembourg- based attorney Todd Barker), Cambridge University, Al Jazeera, and the Iranian government. With friends around the world, Parvaz's story was widely reported, with press freedom advocacy groups also taking up her cause. Other voices calling for her release included Amnesty International, the Doha Centre for Media Freedom, Al Karama for Human Rights, the Committee to Protect Journalists, Reporters Without Borders, and the U.S. State Department. It was reported on May 5, 2011, that Parvaz was being held by the Syrian government, which Syria confirmed. Her family and friends called for her release. Facebook and Twitter campaigns were also underway. It was further reported on May 7, 2011, that U.S. Ambassador Robert Ford met with a senior Syrian official in an attempt to obtain more information about Parvaz. The Iranian Foreign Ministry also asked for information about Parvaz. The family released the following additional statement: Syrian newspaper Al Watan reported that the Syrian government claimed Parvaz left Syria on May 1, 2011, after being denied entry to the country because she held a tourist visa instead of a journalist visa. This claim was unconfirmed, most notably by Parvaz herself. As of May 11, 2011, unsubstantiated reports had emerged indicating that the Syrian government handed Parvaz over to Iranian authorities and that she might be held in Tehran. On May 18, 2011, after disappearing on assignment in Syria for 19 days, Dorothy was released and sent back to Doha by Iranian authorities. By the end of the day, she had released an article detailing her experiences. Syria claimed she had entered Syria illegally with multiple passports, including an expired Iranian one. However, there was no issue with her passports. Her Iranian one was extended and stamped upon entry by Syrian immigration. Parvaz was named the 2013 recipient of the McGill Medal for Journalistic Courage from the Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication.

The elaborate building was designed by the architectural firm of Thomas Elworthy, responsible for many churches in late- Victorian era Sussex, and serves the residential hinterland of St Leonards-on- Sea‚Äîan area which grew rapidly after its early 19th-century founding by James Burton. English Heritage has listed the church at Grade II for its architectural and historical importance. History Hastings, an ancient seaside town on the Sussex coast, was an important settlement by the 12th century: it had its own castle and mint, and was the main Cinque Port. With seven churches, it was also a religious centre. To the west, an area of undeveloped land‚Äîpart of the Manor of Gensing‚Äîran down to the English Channel coast and offered excellent views. Consisting of a well-wooded valley leading to flat, sheltered land by a beach, it had the potential for residential development. Businessman and property developer James Burton, father of the architect Decimus Burton, exploited this potential in the early 19th century when he laid out the new town of St Leonards-on-Sea. Encouraged by a resurgence in Hastings' popularity in the late 18th century, he bought land from the Eversfield baronets, owners of Gensing Manor, in 1828 and built a residential town and seaside resort over the next few years. An Act of Parliament passed in 1832 changed the status of the town from a private speculation to a properly incorporated settlement which could be governed, taxed and further developed. Success was assured after the Duchess of Kent and her daughter Princess (later Queen) Victoria stayed in the town in 1834, and residential development northwards along the inland valley occurred after St Leonards Warrior Square railway station was built in 1851, making London and Brighton accessible by train. By that time, churches existed for Congregationalists, Anglicans and Roman Catholics. In 1882, architect Thomas Elworthy of the firm Elworthy and Sons was commissioned to design a church for the town's growing Baptist community. The chosen site was on Chapel Park Road, near the railway station. Elworthy was from St Leonards-on-Sea and was a prolific church architect, principally for the Congregationalists. His late 19th-century designs tended towards the Renaissance Revival and Classical styles, in reaction to the almost universal use of Gothic Revival forms earlier in the century. As an architect, he was \\"much maligned\\": his Congregational chapel of 1881 in Robertsbridge was described as \\"truly horrible\\" by Nikolaus Pevsner, for example. Two other Elworthy churches in the Hastings area, Congregational churches on The Croft and Mount Pleasant Road, were demolished in 1972. Construction work started in 1882 and continued until the next year, when the church opened. Some architectural work was also carried out by the firm of Stiff and Sons of Lambeth, London. Architecture The rear elevation, seen from the west, also shows the arched windows in the side walls. The church has an ornate, decorative fa√ßade which combines Classical elements with Thomas Elworthy's preferred Renaissance Revival style and some Italianate features. It is built of red brick, laid in the Flemish bond pattern, with terracotta window surrounds and dressings designed by the architectural firm of Stiff and Sons. The roof has been renewed with concrete tiles. Steps with terracotta-dressed cement walls and piers lead to three identical round-arched entrance doors with wood panelling, flanked by terracotta columns and set below a balustrade. This is supported on brackets with foliage decoration, and has four decorative terracotta urns corresponding with the top of each column. This forms the centre bay of a three-bay fa√ßade; the outer bays have paired round-arched windows. The balustrade spans the width of the fa√ßade between ground- and first-floor level, forming a kind of porch or portico. At first-floor level, Classical motifs include Composite/Corinthian pilasters and an intricately decorated pediment. The tall pilasters are arranged in pairs flanking the central bay and singly at the outer bays. The pediment is topped by another terracotta urn and is flanked by a stone balustrade on both sides. There are three arched windows to the centre bay, the centre one taller and wider and all featuring engaged columns (columns which are partially sunk into the wall to which they are attached). Paired round-arched windows light the outer bays. The side walls have five arched windows set below a cornice of moulded terracotta. The hall beneath the church includes a full-height single-bay brick extension with an arched window. An elaborate wooden gallery supported on iron columns survives inside. The church today Joint services are held with Wellington Square Baptist Church in central Hastings. St Leonard's Baptist Church was listed at Grade II by English Heritage on 10 January 1991. This defines it as a \\"nationally important\\" building of \\"special interest\\". As of February 2001, it was one of 521 Grade II listed buildings, and 535 listed buildings of all grades, in the borough of Hastings. It is one of several listed churches in St Leonards-on- Sea: the Anglican churches of Christ Church, St Peter's and St John the Evangelist's are classed at the higher Grade II*, while St Leonard's Anglican parish church, the Greek Orthodox St Mary Magdalene's Church and the Roman Catholic Church of St Thomas of Canterbury and English Martyrs, along with the former St Leonards-on-Sea Congregational Church, are also Grade II-listed. The church is one of four Baptist places of worship in the Borough of Hastings. The Grade II*-listed Wellington Square Baptist Church in the centre of Hastings, founded in 1838, is the oldest; 20th-century churches are found in the Halton and Silverhill suburbs. The latter is a Gospel Standard Baptist congregation. Ebenezer Particular Baptist Chapel served Strict Baptists from 1817 until the end of the 20th century. Administratively, the church belongs to the East Sussex Network of the South Eastern Baptist Association. Two of the three other churches in Hastings, two in Heathfield, three in Eastbourne and the Baptist churches in Battle, Bexhill, Lewes, Newhaven, Peacehaven, Pevensey Bay, Ringmer, Rye, Seaford, Sidley, Uckfield and Willingdon are also in this network. Services are held on Sunday mornings, and a joint service with the Wellington Square church in central Hastings takes place each Sunday evening at that church or at St Leonard's Church. The Chapel Park Community Centre, situated in the hall underneath the church, offers various facilities for community use. The church is licensed for worship in accordance with the Places of Worship Registration Act 1855 and has the registration number 27859.

The battle was a decisive Byzantine victory, the last in the Empire's naval history,. and led to the consolidation of the Peloponnese under the Byzantine Despotate of the Morea. Background In the early 15th century, the Peloponnese peninsula was divided between three powers: the Latin Principality of Achaea in the north and west, the Byzantine Greek Despotate of the Morea in the south and east, and Argos and Nauplia, Coron and Modon and some attendant forts, held by the Republic of Venice. The Byzantines were actively trying to conquer the ailing principality, all the while the menace of the ever- expanding Ottoman Empire threatened all of them.; . Carlo I Tocco, the ruler of the County palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos, of Lefkada and of the Despotate of Epirus, took advantage of the Byzantine-Achaean struggles to extend his domains into the Peloponnese: in 1407‚Äì1408 his brother Leonardo seized and plundered the fortress of Glarentza, in the northwestern Peloponnese, and in 1421 Carlo bought permanent possession of it from Oliverio Franco, who had seized it from the Achaean prince Centurione II Zaccaria three years earlier.; . In February 1423, a shaky truce was brokered between Zaccaria, Tocco, and the Byzantines by the Venetians, who were eager to establish a common front against the Ottomans,. but this did not prevent a major Ottoman raid into the peninsula by Turahan Bey in summer 1423, nor did it stop the aggressive Byzantine despot, Theodore II Palaiologos, from raiding Venetian territory and even capturing Centurione Zaccaria in June 1424.. The Byzantines initially seemed content to leave Tocco alone, as he too had open scores with Zaccaria, but war between the two powers was provoked in late 1426, when Tocco's forces seized the animals of Albanian herders during the latter's annual migration from the Byzantine-controlled central uplands to the plain of Elis.. Battle and aftermath The Byzantine emperor, John VIII Palaiologos, personally travelled to the Peloponnese, and the Byzantine forces laid siege to Glarentza by land and sea. Tocco assembled a fleet from his domains in the Ionian Islands and Epirus, augmented by ships from Marseilles, and placed it under the command of his illegitimate son, Torno. The Byzantine fleet, under a certain Leontarios (probably Demetrios Laskaris Leontares), met the Latin fleet at the Echinades and dealt it a crushing blow: most of Tocco's ships were captured, many of the crews were killed and over 150 men were taken prisoner. Torno himself was barely able to escape, but one of his nephews was captured... The victory was recorded in a lengthy anonymous panegyric to Manuel II Palaiologos and his son John VIII, which is also the main source of information about the battle.. This defeat ended Tocco's ambitions in the Peloponnese: in a negotiated settlement, John VIII's brother Constantine Palaiologos (later last Byzantine emperor as Constantine XI) married Maddalena Tocco, Carlo's niece, and received the Tocco family's Peloponnesian domains as her dowry. Based in Tocco's former domains, and under Constantine's leadership, the Byzantines went on to reduce the last remnants of the Achaean principality. Patras fell in May 1430, and by 1432, Constantine and his brothers had deposed the last Latin feudatories and restored the entire peninsula, with the exception of the Venetian possessions, to Byzantine control..

With the expansion of the Portuguese colonial possessions in the coastal areas, they built a fort in 1623 which was captured in 1639 by the Dutch. Known as Fort Fredrick it went through a phase of dismantling and reconstruction until was attacked and captured by the French in 1672. The French handed it back to the Dutch East India Company (VOC) at the Peace of Paris in 1784. In 1795 it was taken over by the British, and the British maintained a garrison till 1948. Trincomalee was the first land to be captured by the British who fought and defeated the Dutch, who did not want to surrender Ceylon as directed by the Prince of Orange, who took refuge in London after being defeated by the French republicans under Napoleon. The importance of Fort Fredrick was due to Trincomalee's natural harbour. Through Trincomalee, it was believed a strong naval force could secure control of India's Coromandel Coast. It is stated that Trincomalee was visited by Colonel Arthur Wellesley (later the 1st Duke of Wellington) and Midshipman Horatio Nelson (later the 1st Viscount Nelson) at different times during their service in India. Lord Nelson visited whilst serving as a midshipman on board and would called it the finest harbors in the world. Arthur Wellesley visited whilst a Colonel in the British East India Company, the bungalow he resided in is known as Wellesley Lodge which is inside Fort Fredrick and now is the officer's mess of the 2nd (Volunteer) battalion of the Gajaba Regiment.Lalin‚Äôs Column: Obrigado (Thank you) Portugal Prior to the Second World War, the British built the Royal Air Force base, RAF China Bay, as well as fuel oil storage and support facilities for the Royal Navy's shore establishment, . After the fall of Singapore, Trincomalee became the home port of the Eastern Fleet of the Royal Navy, and submarines and flying boats of the Dutch Navy. The harbour and airfield were attacked by a Japanese carrier fleet in April 1942 in the Indian Ocean Raid. Until 1957, Trincomalee was an important base for the Royal Navy and was home to many British people who were employed by the British Admiralty. In the early 1950s The British Government built groups of bungalows within the Fort specifically for their employees. These bungalows still exist and provide accommodation for soldiers of the Sri Lankan Army. One of the groups of bungalows was named Edinburgh Terrace. Children of the British residents attended a Royal Naval School which was part of the Naval Base. The naval and air bases were taken over by Sri Lanka in 1957, today SLNS Tissa and SLN Dockyard are used by the Sri Lankan Navy, while the Sri Lanka Air Force is based at SLAF China Bay. The Sri Lanka Army has its Security Forces Headquarters - East in Trincomalee. Trincomalee War Cemetery, is one of the six commonwealth war cemeteries in Sri Lanka, it is maintained by Sri Lankan Ministry of Defence on behalf of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. The Navy Base is home to a naval museum called The Hoods Tower Museum. The name of the museum refers to a watchtower built on a hill commanding a 360-degree view of the harbor and the bay.

It was one of the first semiautomatic pistols chambered in .38 Special with flush-seated, full wadcutter bullets. The shape of the rimmed cartridge limited the magazine capacity to five rounds. A variant, known as the Model 952, in 9 mm Parabellum, is still produced in limited quantities by Smith & Wesson's Performance Center. The Model 52 was discontinued in 1992 when the machinery to manufacture the pistol broke down and it was deemed too costly to replace. History In 1961 Smith & Wesson Model introduced the Model 52 as a match-grade target pistol derived from the Smith & Wesson Model 39. It was chambered in .38 Special Wadcutter for the sport of Bullseye shooting. The first version, known simply as the Model 52, retained the basic trigger mechanism of the Model 39, with the Double-Action function selectable via a simple frame-mounted setscrew, allowing the pistol to be fired in either single-action or double-action mode depending on the setscrew's adjustment. In 1963 the Model 52-1 was introduced with a separately developed single-action trigger system and was manufactured until 1970, when it was succeeded by the Model 52-2. Changes to the 52-2 included an improved extractor and this version was manufactured for 23 years. By 1992, the 30-year-old machinery used to make the Model 52 was showing signs of age and was starting to fail. Smith & Wesson decided against replacing it and the handgun was discontinued. The last model 52-2 was completed on July 23, 1993. The pistol's serial number was ‚ÄúTZW9149‚Äù and it was delivered to the company's private gun vault as an archive piece.  Model 952  The Smith & Wesson Model 952 was introduced in 2000 as a Performance Center pistol based on the Model 52 but chambered in 9mm. Enhancements included a 5‚Äù match-grade barrel, titanium-coated spherical barrel bushing, 9-round magazine, loaded chamber indicator and a slide-mounted decocking lever. An enhanced version was produced in 2004 and a long slide variant with a 6\\" barrel debuted in 2006.

During this period, the group also began its venture into event organization, starting with \\"Labels and Love\\", and also begun publishing the group's blog. Due to this expansion of focus, the group now refers to itself as a \\"queer youth community group\\" instead of the previous \\"queer youth support group\\". In May 2014, the group officially launched its official website. As of 2019, the group is inactive and they have ceased their activities. Their website is now no longer accessible. Support Groups=YOH Young Out Here's core program remains to be the closed support group for gay, lesbian, bisexual and queer youths who are 16 to 21 years old. The objective of the support group program is to provide gay, lesbian, bisexual and queer youths in Singapore a safe, secular, and inclusive environment for them to meet like-minded individuals, where they can build healthy relationships, build healthy self identities, and learn about the community at large. Each YOH run consists of 13 sessions, each covering various issues related to gay, lesbian, bisexual and queer youths. Each session is limited to 10 to 15 participants with balanced number of males and females to provide a gender neutral environment. Events=Labels and Love Labels and Love was a forum and workshop organized by Young Out Here in March 2009, with the help of Oogachaga. The workshop involved a personal sharing of the experiences of a mother and her gay son.

Project \\"We Are Not Afraid\\" In June 2013, YOH upped the ante by building and painting a 9.6m X 2.4m large wall mural. The mural was covered in ‚Äòbricks‚Äô that symbolised the fears of today's LGBTQ youths. By removing these individual bricks, the mural was slowly revealed to showcase the hopes and dreams penned down by event-goers from the previous ‚ÄúLight Up Your Dreams‚Äù Campaign in Pink Dot 2012. One may think of it as a Berlin Wall of sorts for the LGBTQ youth of Singapore. Project \\"Connecting Voices\\" For PinkDot 2014, YOH gave PinkDot participants a chance to post LGBT-related questions on a specially designed ‚ÄòFAQ‚Äô board and get responses in return from other participants at the event. Being inspired by the Japanese prayer structure, the project this year signifies a collective hope and support to each other. A lucky draw was also provided for 2 free tickets to the Laramie Project play at the Singapore Repertory Theatre. YOH 10th Anniversary Exhibition Pinkdot 2015 was held on 13 June 2015 at Hong Lim Park. It marks the 5th year of PinkDot celebrations in Singapore. Coincidentally it was also the 10 year anniversary of YOH since their inception. To commemorate this anniversary and at the same time, educate others about what YOH does, an exhibition of YOH history was put up. Suggestions were also canvassed from the public on how YOH can improve going forward. For this, goodie bags of neon-pink Sticky candy were given away in exchange for the ideas.

A young and daring white duck named Sean McDuck decides to slide down a hill and cross over to the other side of a stream, despite warnings from his young puffin friend, Puffy. When Sean reaches the other side, Puffy tells him about a fox, which Sean narrowly escapes. When Sean and his family migrate, he gets lost trying to chase some seagulls. Later he is hit by an airplane resulting in his being stranded with a broken wing. His family thinks he has been killed by the fox when Sean's mother sees her with her kits playing with white feathers. A kindly water vole named Voley is preparing for his winter hibernation but stops to help Sean get ready for the cold weather ahead. Voley also teaches Sean to play a blade of grass as a musical instrument and even does an Irish stepdance with Sean and a chorus line of sheep. Despite Sean's wishes for him to remain, Voley soon heads off to start his hibernation. After struggling through the first night of winter and having to take shelter in a wellington boot, Sean discovers that Puffy was also left behind. For the rest of the winter the two friends keep each other company. When spring comes, Sean and Puffy eagerly look for their families. The two friends are then cornered by the fox and eventually end up on a ship, but are rescued by Voley while Sean manages to drive away the fox, regaining his ability to fly in the process.

It is located on Cemetery Ridge, by The Angle and the copse of trees, where Union forces - including the 72nd Pennsylvania Infantry - beat back Confederate forces engaged in Pickett's Charge. The monument was the subject of a Pennsylvania Supreme Court case over control of the battlefield. It is depicted on the 2011 \\"Gettysburg\\" America the Beautiful quarter commemorative coin. The regiment erected an earlier monument in 1883. To avoid confusion, that is now usually referred to as the \\"Philadelphia Brigade\\" Monument. History Fire Zouave (1891), ____ Stephens, sculptor. The 72nd Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers, commanded by Colonel DeWitt Clinton Baxter and also called \\"Baxter's Philadelphia Fire Zouaves,\\" was recruited among firemen in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Their dress uniforms were modeled on those of the Zouaves, a North African Berber tribe famous for its ferocious fighting. The 72nd played an important role in beating back Pickett's Charge on July 3, 1863. At the beginning of the Confederate advance across the valley, the 72nd was posted in support and to the rear of the batteries upon Hancock's front. \\" the regiment was rushed to the front line, striking the assailants at the famous stone wall and the clump of trees.\\"Frank H. Taylor, Philadelphia in the Civil War, 1861-1865 (City of Philadelphia, 1913), p. 92. That morning, the Fire Zouaves had numbered 458 officers and men. After the fury of the conflict, there were but 266 of the 72nd left for further duty. First monument In 1864, Pennsylvania granted a charter to the Gettysburg Battlefield Memorial Association for promoting and protecting \\"memorial structures.\\" The GBMA subsequently asserted that it had exclusive authority to approve the design and location of all Gettysburg monuments, including on battlefield land not owned by the GBMA. In 1896, the GBMA's land holdings totalled ; Gettyburg National Military Park now totals . In 1883, the first \\"72nd PA Infty\\" monument was approved, and the GBMA placed it on the \\"Roberts Line ‚Ä¶ where their heavy losses were\\". This location seems to have been a \\"safe\\" choice by the GBMA, since there remained nagging questions about when - early or late in the battle - the 72nd had joined in the worst of the fighting. NOTE: Several sources identify the 72nd's advance was after the Union line had been breached, e.g., \\"Just as the Confederate resistance began to crumble, the 72nd lurched into battle. ( Isbell, 2006) Pennsylvania Supreme Court Members of the regiment vehemently disagreed with the placement of the monument. The GBMA-chosen location was nearly behind the Union front line, instead of right at it. Much of the battlefield land was still in private hands, and the 72nd bought a tract at the Union front line, on which to erect a second monument. Significantly, the regiment also bypassed the GBMA, obtaining approval for the second monument from a different Pennsylvania commission. (New York Times article) In July 1888, the GBMA denied permission for the 72nd to build the second monument - on its own land. On December 12, 1888, the GBMA had the 72nd's Captain John Reed arrested for trespassing, after \\"he had started men at work laying a foundation for the [second] monument of the Seventy-second Regiment\\".https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Cv8yAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=eQAGAAAAIBAJ&pg;=1649%2C2114130 The unit's 1889 history, The Seventy-second Regiment, Pennsylvania Volunteers, at Bloody Angle, published the unit's actions on July 3 of the Battle of Gettysburg. ;GBMA v. 72nd PA Regiment: In October 1889, Gettysburg Battlefield Memorial Association v. Seventy-second Pennsylvania Regiment heard testimony regarding the regiment's Pickett's Charge location(s). The Pennsylvania Supreme Court subsequently \\"reaffirmed\\" for the 72nd, finding that the authority of the state commission established by a state act superseded any GBMA organizational authority for monument locations (e.g., for US regulars and other states' units): \\"the Commonwealth ‚Ä¶ has the right to designate the position where any of her regiments specially distinguished themselves\\" (Justice Sterrett). Gettysburg's local newspaper, The Star and Sentinel, editorialized that the Commonwealth was \\"in the position of a cheat,\\" for ruling that Pennsylvania units were not required to follow GBMA decisions, as other states' units were. Second monument The approximately- monument consists of a two-part, stepped, polished-granite shaft set on a two-part, rough- and finish-cut stepped base, and topped by a lifesize bronze sculpture. The \\"Fire Zouave\\" figure is in close combat with the enemy, swinging his rifle as a club. The monument was designed by Captain John Reed (the 72nd veteran who was arrested), but only the last name of the sculptor is known: Stephens.This may have been sculptor Frank Stephens, instructor at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and former brother-in-law of Thomas Eakins. The sculpture was cast by the Bureau Brothers Foundry in Philadelphia.72nd Pennsylvania Infantry Monument from SIRIS. About 1000 people attended the July 4, 1891, monument's dedication, and Edward McPherson accepted it on behalf of the GBMA. The GBMA later had second thoughts - on August 25, its executive committee recommended a marker be placed to indicate the GBMA bore \\"no responsibility for the location of the monument as now placed.\\" The 72nd's ownership of its statuary tract proved crucial in preventing the Gettysburg Electric Railway from building a tourist trolley across the field of Pickett's Charge. The 72nd denied right-of-way across its tract, forcing the trolley company to find another route (behind the Union line). To reiterate that its tract remained private land, in June 1893, the 72nd marked the boundaries with stone markers, placed a no trespassing sign, and erected a flag pole with the Stars and Stripes (44 stars). The association held the statuary tract until March 20, 1911, when trustees for the survivors' association of the \\"Seventy-second Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers\\" deeded it to the War Department. cited by: ) The 2011 \\"Gettysburg\\" America the Beautiful Quarter was developed \\"in consultation with representatives of Gettysburg National Military Park.\\" The reverse of the coin features an image of the 72nd regiment's statuary monument.

Scoring and structure  The cantata in six movements is scored for tenor and bass soloists, a four-part choir, two oboes (No.s 1 & 6), two oboes d'amore (No.s 3 & 5), taille (tenor oboe), two violins, viola and basso continuo. # Chorus: # Recitative (tenor): # Aria (tenor): # Recitative (bass): # Aria (bass): # Chorale:  Music  Bach referred to the pastoral aspect of the text in his music. In the opening chorus, three oboes on the firm ground of extended pedal point create pastoral sounds, in triplets which are frequently associated with shepherds, such as in the Sinfonia opening Part II of Bach's Christmas Oratorio. The choir sings alternating homophonic calls, \\"h√∂re!\\" (listen!) and \\"erscheine!\\" (appear!), and two fugues on the image of Joseph leading his flocks. The fugue subject is the same in both fugues, but the second time the voices enter from the lowest voice to the highest, culminating in an ultimate third section of the calls. Different from the normal setting, the instrumental introduction is not repeated after this climax. The first recitative leads to an arioso part on the final Bible quotation \\"\\" (God is faithful). The tenor aria is accompanied by two oboes d'amore. In the bass aria, instrumentation, triplets and extended pedal points are reminiscent of the opening chorus. The closing choral is a four-part setting on the tune of \\"\\".  Recordings  * Les Grandes Cantates de J.S.

It was fought between the forces of Revolutionary France under the command of Jean Baptiste Jourdan and , versus those of Great Britain under the Frederick Augustus, Duke of York and Albany and the Dutch Republic under the Hereditary Prince of Orange. The action resulted in a coalition victory. The battle In the Autumn of 1793 the Allied forces of Prince Josias of Saxe- Coburg-Saalfeld were poised to invade France. The Hereditary Prince of Orange held Menin with 10,000 Dutch troops, with instructions to cover the movement of the corps of the Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany in his advance towards Dunkirk. To facilitate this and take advantage of York's nearby support Orange decided to lead a column against the French-held village of Lincelles, while another under the Friedrich Karl August, Prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont attacked La Blaton slightly to the north. News of the attack reached the French forces under command of Jean-Baptiste Jourdan and Antoine Anne Lecourt B√©ru, who were mustering to launch their own raid against Menin. Immediately Jourdan directed these forces, 5,000 strong, to retake the lost posts. This was achieved, B√©ru's column retaking Lincelles, whilst the brigade of Jacques MacDonald advanced from Quesnoy-sur-De√ªle, surprised the Dutch at Blaton and captured 7 cannon. Representative Jean Pierre Dellard, who came up after the action, later wrote, \\"The interior of the redoubts, which had just been taken, afforded a spectacle of fearful carnage\\". The Prince of Orange appealed to the Duke of York for reinforcements, and at around 2.00 pm the nearest troops, Gerard Lake's brigade consisting of three battalions of Foot Guards, were dispatched. Lake arrived on the field at 6.00 pm and attempted to rally some of the scattered Dutch, but it quickly became apparent they had no more stomach for fighting. So, despite being vastly outnumbered, he determined to attack alone with just 1,122 men. The Diary of Lieutenant Thomas Powell (14th Foot) records \\"It was about 1 of clock at night before we could get clear of the Dutch\\" The Diary of Lieu Thomas Powell 14th Foot, As Prepared for Publication in the White Rose, With Added Information on his Services etc. (National Army Museum Library MS), p11 On top of the hill in front of Lincelles the French held two large redoubts plus other works that covered the road, as well as their flanks being covered by woods and ditches. Lake deployed on the hill under a heavy artillery fire, the 1st Guards at the front, with the Coldstream Guards and 3rd Guards forming up on their left. The Guards delivered three or four musket volleys and charged the position, stormed the earthworks, chased the Republicans through the village and captured 10 guns. Lake then re-formed on the other side of the hill. B√©ru attempted another stand but was again charged and broken, his men fleeing to Bondues. Jourdan, who tried to stem the flight with a battalion in reserve, wrote, \\"It was not a retreat but a rout\\". Aftermath At Blaton to the left Macdonald heard the news of the rout and withdrew in good order to Quesnoy- sur-De√ªle. The French then retreated to Lille where they were reformed. Lake held the position until nightfall supported by two Dutch battalions,Journaal der Arm√©e onder de orders van zyne Doorlugtige Hoogheid den Heere Generaal Erfprince van Orange ['Journal of the army, commanded by his royal highness the hereditary Prince of Orange] until relieved by six battalions of Hessians and two British. He'd captured 12 guns (two of them Dutch pieces lost during the retreat of Orange's men), 70 prisoners and a colour, for the loss of 39 dead and 139 wounded men and officers, Captain-Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Bosville of the 2nd Guards being one of the dead.Brown (1795), p. 67 The Duke of York then continued his advance towards Ypres and Furnes, before opening the Siege of Dunkirk. Assessment Fortescue wrote of Lake's intervention, \\"The action was undoubtably most brilliant, and the conduct of the men beyond all praise... but it is a grave reflection on the Duke of York that he should so thoughtlessly have exposed some of his best troops to needless danger, leaving them isolated and unsupported for several hours\\". Alfred Burne disagreed, \\"Lake did indeed call for help, but on what seems inadequate grounds: he was in no real danger. To have diverted a bigger proportion of the British army from the march to Dunkirk merely to engage in a transient fight in order to oblige the Dutch would have been to infringe the principle of economy of force\\".

The sheriff had judicial, electoral, ceremonial and administrative functions and executed High Court Writs. In 1908, an Order in Council made the Lord-Lieutenant the Sovereign's prime representative in a county and reduced the High Sheriff's precedence. However the sheriff retained his responsibilities for the preservation of law and order in the county. The usual procedure for appointing the sheriff from 1660 onwards was that three persons were nominated at the beginning of each year from the county and the Lord Lieutenant then appointed his choice as High Sheriff for the remainder of the year. Often the other nominees were appointed as under-sheriffs. Sometimes a sheriff did not fulfil his entire term through death or other event and another sheriff was then appointed for the remainder of the year. The dates given hereunder are the dates of appointment. All addresses are in County Kerry unless stated otherwise.

It was first introduced by Mary Ellis in the film Paris in Spring. A version was also recorded by Ray Noble and His Orchestra (also in 1935). In 1960, Jo Stafford and her husband Paul Weston recorded a version for their comedy album Jonathan and Darlene Edwards in Paris in which they put their own unique interpretation on the song. Psychological test This song title is often used in an informal psychological test. \\"Paris in the Spring\\" is written with an extra \\"the\\". A subject is asked to read the text, and will often jump to conclusions and fail to notice the extra \\"the\\", especially when there is a line break between the two thes. The reason that the second ‚Äòthe‚Äô is skipped while reading that line is because of saccades. Saccades are jerky movements that eyes make when looking around. The brain counteracts these movements by steadying them and making everything appear smooth. While the brain is using saccadic movements to read, it searches for the most important words and skips over the less important ones, and fills them in using the words around it and what the brain sees when it quickly skips over it. For instance, in ‚ÄòParis in thethe Spring‚Äô, the eyes will read Paris and quickly move ahead to Spring, and just glance over ‚Äòin thethe‚Äô, leading the mind to completely disregard the second ‚Äòthe‚Äô. When speaking, the mind plans what will be said before it is said. Sometimes the mind isn‚Äôt able to plan in advance and the speech is rushed out. This is why there are errors like mispronunciation, stuttering, and unplanned pauses. The same thing happens when reading. The mind doesn‚Äôt always know what will come next. This is another reason that the second ‚Äòthe‚Äô can be missed. Drieghe, D., Rayner, K., & Pollatsek, A. (2005). Eye movements and word skipping during reading revisited.

Early life Woolf was born in London, the eldest (or 2nd eldest) of ten children to Marie (n√©e de Jongh) and a Jewish barrister Solomon Rees Sydney Woolf. Her father died in 1892. At the end of 1907 she travelled to Ceylon to visit her brother, Leonard Woolf, then a junior civil servant stationed in Kandy. First marriage In the following months she met Robert Heath Lock, Assistant Director of the Peradeniya Botanical Gardens, near Kandy. They were married in 1910. In August 1908, she went back to England with her brother, who was returning briefly before taking up a promotion as Assistant Government Agent of Hambantota. Robert Heath Lock died in 1915. Second marriage In 1921, aged around 44, she remarried, to Tom Southorn, whom she met in Ceylon through Leonard. In 1904 as a junior civil servant, Tom had met Leonard off the boat on his arrival in Ceylon. He served a long period in colonial service in Ceylon and rose to be colonial secretary of Hong Kong, Acting Administrator of Hong Kong on various occasions, and Governor of the Gambia. From this time she sometimes went by the name Bella Woolf Southorn, and occasionally used Bella Sidney Southorn. But she continued to publish as Bella Sidney Woolf. She greatly enjoyed her life as the wife of a colonial civil servant and was fascinated by all the places she lived, which informed her writing, both fiction and what we would now call 'tourist guides'.Bella Southorn's stories reflect the life she loved as the wife of a colonial civil servant, Out and about, SCMP Post Magazine, Jason Wordie, 24 April 2011 During her years in Hong Kong she was active in community work and was commissioner of the Girl Guides from 1926 to 1936. In 1935 she was appointed an OBE. Author Woolf wrote fiction and non-fiction. In both she drew on her experiences in her husbands' various colonial postings ‚Äì to write stories and to write guides to the localities, customs and people. She also authored and co-authored on current events and science Her How To See Ceylon was published in 1914, and incorporating her experience of car journeys with her husband \\"along the sunny roads of Ceylon\\" is considered the first pocket guidebook to the island. Three more editions followed in 1922, 1924 and 1929.‚ÄòHow To See Ceylon‚Äô By Bella Sidney Woolf, Infolanka ‚Äì History While Tom was Governor of the Gambia, from 1936, she wrote a detailed history of the tiny West African territory. Her approach was quite liberal for the day. She saw value in the cultures that the British Empire embraced and was concerned at what she perceived as their erosion. \\"It is unfortunate that so many natives are adopting English dress, blind to the fact that it destroys all their individuality and Oriental grace\\", she wrote, of Ceylon, and \\"Kandyan divorce laws are so enlightened that....\\". Her short propagandist booklet Right against might; the great war of 1914, published in 1914, has been reprinted by the original publisher in modern times. Much of Woolf's fictional writing was short stories drawn from her life as the wife of two colonial civil servants. Some of these were later compiled as Bits of Old China and Under the Mosquito Curtain.Letter in Daily News, Sri Lanka Woolf also wrote several children's books, all drawing on her various overseas experiences; The Twins in Ceylon and its sequels were very popular.

Peasant banana producers focus their attention on the popular Cavendish banana, as these are the fruit of choice on markets in Europe. In the Caribbean, and especially in Dominica where this sort of cultivation is widespread, holdings are in the 1-2 acre range. In many cases the farmer earns additional money from other crops, from engaging in labor outside the farm, and from a share of the earnings of relatives living overseas. This style of cultivation often was popular in the islands as bananas required little labor input and brought welcome extra income. Vulnerability to hurricanes in particular represented a problem.Peter Clegg, \\"The Development of the Windward Islands Banana Export Trade: Commercial Opportunity and Colonial Necessity,\\" Society for Caribbean Studies Annual Conference Papers 1 (2000). NAFTA After the signing of the NAFTA agreements in the 1990s, however, the tide turned against peasant producers. Their costs of production were relatively high and the ending of favorable tariff and other supports, especially in the European Economic Community, made it difficult for peasant producers to compete with the bananas grown on large plantations by the well capitalized firms like Chiquita and Dole. Not only did the large companies have access to cheap labor in the areas they worked, but they were better able to afford modern agronomic advances such as fertilization. The \\"dollar banana\\" produced by these concerns made the profit margins for peasant bananas unsustainable.Jay Mandel, \\"The Crisis in and Future of the Windward Island Banana Industry\\", 1999 http://www.unctad.org/infocomm/anglais/banana/doc/crisis.pdf Fair trade Caribbean countries have sought to redress this problem by providing government supported agronomic services and helping to organize producers' cooperatives. They have also been supporters of the Fair Trade movement which seeks to balance the inequities in the world trade in commodities.

It was staged for the first time 1667. It is characterized by the presence of actors bearing in their hands the symbols of Passion of the Christ, like the nails and Crown of Thorns. In addition, there are costumed actors representing Jesus carrying the cross, our Lady, the disciple John, the Holy women, the Centurion with his cohort of armed soldiers, Veronica and the angels. The ritual begins at dawn, to end at midday, after the city streets. Another notable feature of La Cercha is that it is a silent procession with participants expressing concepts, rather than a drama with spoken dialogue. The Mystery Play la \\"Cercha\\" started in Collesano in 1667 thanks to the cooperation of the SS. Crucifix Brotherhood that tried inspiration by the Holy Friday procession made in Palermo in 1590 and 1951 by the Trinitary Congregation helped by the Spanish and Genoensis authorities that had their representative in the capital of the Island of Sicily. The history of Disciplinantes brotherhood started in Perugia in 1260 thanks to Raniero Fasani who preached the rite of flagellation as penitence. From Perugia the phenomenon of the Disciplinantes reached Genoa thanks to Osvaldo Opizzoni from Tortona. The Disciplinantes of Osvaldo Opizzoni founded in a short time more than 10 brotherhoods who chose churches and oratories to prepare their rites. These places have been called Casazze. In 1306 a first Disciplinantes brotherhood, called the \\"Brotherhood of St. Nicol√≤ lo Reale\\", has been founded in Palermo. This brotherhood predicated also the flagellation as penitence and the adoration of the symbols of Jesus Christ Passion. Also in Spain appeared this Disciplinantes brotherhood in the 14th century thanks to predication of the Franciscans and the relationship between Genoa Republic,where the disciplinantes group were numerous, and Spain. In the 1521 in Sevilla has been held the first \\"Via Crucis\\" by the noble Fadrique Enriq√®z Af√†n de Ribera 1st marquis de Tarifa, starting from the St. Andrea's Palace called after \\"Pilatos Palace\\". As remarked in 1590 the Spanish Nation in Palermo organized officially its first Holy Week procession in which a Disciplinantes brotherhood brought the statue of the Nuestra Senora de la Soledad and the Jesus Christ Passion symbols who after the last diner started la \\"Cercha\\" or the \\"Search\\". The Collesano Holy Friday procession revivals that procession.

Among its other roles, memory functions to guide present behaviour and to predict future outcomes. Memory in childhood is qualitatively and quantitatively different from the memories formed and retrieved in late adolescence and the adult years. Childhood memory research is relatively recent in relation to the study of other types of cognitive processes underpinning behaviour. Understanding the mechanisms by which memories in childhood are encoded and later retrieved has important implications in many areas. Research into childhood memory includes topics such as childhood memory formation and retrieval mechanisms in relation to those in adults, controversies surrounding infantile amnesia and the fact that adults have relatively poor memories of early childhood, the ways in which school environment and family environment influence memory, and the ways in which memory can be improved in childhood to improve overall cognition, performance in school, and well-being, both in childhood and in adulthood.

The experimental psychologist and cognitive neuroscientist Endel Tulving refers to memory as ‚Äúmental time travel‚Äù, a process unique to humans. However, early memories are notoriously sparse from the perspective of an adult trying to recall his or her childhood in depth. Explicit knowledge of the world is a form of declarative memory, which can be broken down further into semantic memory, and episodic memory, which encompasses both autobiographical memory and event memory. Most people have no memory prior to three years of age, and few memories between three and six years of age, as verified by analysis of the forgetting curve in adults recalling childhood memories.Nelson, K. (1993). The Psychological and Social Origins of Autobiographical Memory. Psychological Science, 4(1), 7-14. Childhood memory research is relatively recent, having gained significant amounts of scientific interest within the last two decades. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the mechanisms underpinning childhood memory. Until relatively recently, it was thought that children have only a very general memory and that ‚Äúoverwrite mechanisms‚Äù prevented the later retrieval of early memories. Newer research suggests that very young children do remember novel events, and these events can be recalled in detail from as young as two and a half years old. Previous research presupposed that children remember pieces of information from specific events but generally do not keep episodic memories. Contrary to previous research, newer research has shown that children can recall specific episodic memories for up to two years prior to the onset of the earliest autobiographical memories reported by adults. The same research argues against the Freudian theory that early memories are repressed because of negative affective content. Another older hypothesis that has been thrown into question is that of the prominent psychologists Daniel Schacter (1974) and Ulrich Neisser (1962), who hypothesized that memories are forgotten because cognitive schemas change between childhood and adulthood, meaning that information is lost with an adult's reconstruction of childhood events because present (adult) schemas are not suitable. Schemas change drastically around age six due to socialization and language development. However, as highlighted by katherine Nelson this theory has received criticism. Recent data suggest that a preschooler's schemas are not dramatically different from the older child's or the adult's, meaning that the ways of representing and interpreting reality do not change markedly from childhood to adulthood. Tests of very young children and adults show that in all age groups, memory recall shows the same sequential cause-and-effect pattern. One interpretation is that childhood memories differ from adult memories mainly in what is noticed: an adult and a child experiencing an event both notice different aspects of the event, and will have different memories of the same event. For example, a child may not show remarkable memory for events that an adult would see as truly novel, such as the birth of a sibling, or a plane trip to visit relatives. Conversely, children show stronger memories for aspects of experiences that adults find unremarkable. Therefore, the schematic organization hypothesis of childhood amnesia may be inadequate to explain what is remembered and later recalled. Schoolchildren in Belgian painting by Eug√®ne-Fran√ßois de Block, 1866. Another theory that has gained attention is the social interaction model of autobiographical memory development, or the means by which social interaction influences ability to remember specific events in the context of a life narrative. The social interaction model describes the way in which a child develops the ability to construct memories as narratives when the child has the opportunity to discuss events with others, such as parents. Parenting style is highly relevant to this theory. For example, different parents will ask different numbers of memory-relevant questions, will try to elicit different types of memory, and will frame the discussions in different ways. Nelson (1992) describes two different parenting styles: pragmatic and elaborative. Pragmatic mothers use primarily instrumental instructions that are relevant to a task the child is performing, whereas elaborative mothers construct narratives with the child about what they and the child did together. An elaborative style yields more detailed memories of events. The same researcher who found these results also made reference to Tessler's studies (1986, 1991) of memory for events in childhood. In these studies, children were taken on a trip to a museum. A week later, aspects of the trip and items that were seen in the museum were only recalled if they had been discussed at the time of the trip. Items that were not talked about were not recalled. Although previous hypotheses have suggested that the role of the memory talk is active rehearsal, newer research suggests that its role might be reinstatement. In the context of infant memory studies, a learned response (example: playing with a mobile) that would otherwise be forgotten can be reinstated if the context is re-presented within a given time period. In this sense, verbal rehearsal of events between a child and a family member might serve to reinstate the cognitive context of the original event. Recall The types of childhood memories that an adult recalls may be linked to personality. Research on both children and adults reminiscing about childhood memories is not well-established. However, considerable attention has been devoted to assessing the validity of strategies that can be used to recall early memories, particularly in situations where the accuracy of recall is critical. Some people claim to have vivid memories from very early ages, while others remember life events beginning around age five. Variables that affect age of first childhood memory include early family environments. One such factor is maternal reminiscing style. There is a long-lasting improvement in autobiographical memory in children whose mothers used an elaborative style of conversation after experiencing an event with the child.Fiona, J., MacDonald, S., Reese, E., Hayne, H. (2009). Maternal Reminiscing Style During Early Childhood Predicts the Age of Adolescents' Earliest Memories. Child Development, 80(2), 496-505. Autobiographical memory improves with age along with semantic knowledge of the world and ability to construct a coherent life narrative, but age and gender may influence ability to recall early memories. One study found that older adolescents and females perform better on both episodic autobiographical memory and memory for everyday events, given that females tend to provide more emotional, accurate, vivid, and detailed recollections, although conditions of high retrieval support (probing questions) reduced this sex difference.Willoughby, K.A., Desrocher, M., Levine, B., Rovet, J.F. (2012). Episodic and Semantic Autobiographical Memory and Everyday Myemory during Late Childhood and Early Adolescence. Front Psychology, 3(53). The accuracy of recalled childhood memories in adulthood is the subject of extensive research and debate. Controversies exist surrounding the authenticity of recovered memories, particularly in the context of child abuse or trauma, such as the debatable accuracy of the spontaneous recovery of distressing memories that were previously forgotten due to inhibitory control. Because memory is reconstructive, false memories may be recalled. Errors might be made even with authentic memories when the adult has to infer missing details, is given inadequate retrieval cues, or recalls inaccurate details due to the power of suggestion from a therapist.Geraerts, E., Lindsay, D.S, Merckelbach, H., Jelicic, M., Raymaekers, L., Arnold, M.M., Schooler, J.W. (2009). Cognitive Mechanisms Underlying Recovered-Memory Experiences of Childhood Sexual Abuse. Psychological Science, 20(1), 92-98. Cognitive abilities, personality, interactions with the therapist, and genetic differences also play a role in the types of memories that an adult recalls and how accurate these memories are.Zhu, B., Chen, C., Loftus, E.F., Lin, C., He, Q., Li, H., Moyzis, R.K., Lessard, J., Dong, Q. (2010). Individual differences in false memory from misinformation: Personality characteristics and their interactions with cognitive abilities. Personality and Individual Differences, 48(8), 889-894. Neurobiology Different memory retrieval tasks involve different cognitive mechanisms. According to dual-coding theory, recognition of a memory stimulus can be studied via two cognitive mechanisms: recollection and familiarity. Familiarity is context-free, or independent of the context in which the stimulus was encoded, and concerns whether a person \\"knows\\" they have encountered a stimulus previously. Recollection is context-dependent on the details incidental to encoding of a target memory, and is related to the cognitive feeling of \\"remembering\\" something. Within the medial temporal lobe, familiarity tends to be associated with the perirhinal region while recollection is associated with the hippocampus. Cortical regions related to conscious recollections (feelings of \\"time travel\\" according to Tulving) include the frontal lobes, while unconscious feelings of \\"knowing\\" may be located elsewhere. Dissociation of recollection vs. familiarity has already been seen in 7-8 year-old children as they grow to adolescence. Familiarity processes Lateral prefrontal cortex, superior parietal cortices The contribution of the lateral prefrontal cortex to working memory has already been recognized in adults. Also, the superior parietal cortex is activated for individual items that have been encountered previously. It has only recently, however, been demonstrated that the LPFC is already active in children by the ages of 5 and 6. Tsujimoto, Satoshi, et al. \\"Prefrontal Cortical Activation Associated with Working Memory in Adults and Preschool Children: An Event- Related Optical Topography Study.\\" Cerebral Cortex 14.7 (2004): 703-12. ProQuest Psychology Journals. Web. 15 Mar. 2012. It is still not known whether the LPFC is active in preschool children during working memory tasks. Recollective processes Anterior medial prefrontal cortex, lateral parietal / temporal regions, hippocampus According to a study by Riggins et al.(2009), observations lend support to age-related increases in contextual memories. This is linked to maturation of frontal lobe structures and connectivity between the prefrontal cortex and medial temporal lobe. Recollection memory for details of individual objects is related to heightened activity in the anterior medial prefrontal cortex and lateral parietal/temporal regions. Recollection for details include the temporal order of events, and this is demonstrated to improve with age even between ages 3 and 4. Recollection and familiarity dissociation Assessment of childhood memory development shows a difference for familiarity of individual objects versus recollection of the details associated with these objects.Riggins, T., Miller, N.C., Bauer, P.J., Georgieff, M.K., & Nelson, C.A. (2009). Electrophysiological indices of memory for temporal order in early childhood: implications for the development of recollection. Developmental Science, 12(2), 209-219. Familiarity development tends to be more stable, while recollection continues to develop into adolescence. Methods used to assess these processes include behavioral, as well as electrophysiological (ERP), measures. Impact of school environment Understanding how memory functions in children and adolescents might lead to more effective teaching strategies in the classroom. Executive functioning skills are the cognitive skills a child or teenager can exert over other cognitive processes to direct attention and achieve goals. Working memory is one subset of executive functioning. Executive functioning skills are rarely taught in classrooms despite the fact that executive functioning is very important for academic achievement, possibly even more important than IQ or entry-level mathematics skills or reading skills.Diamond, A., Barnett, W.S., Thomas, J., Munro, S. (2007). Preschool Program Improves Cognitive Control. Science, 318(5855), 1387-1388. Kindergarten teachers often describe self-discipline and attentional control in children as even more valuable in the learning environment than knowledge of the school material. Working memory (mentally holding and manipulating information) and inhibitory control (the ability to resist distractions) can predict math and reading scores from preschool through to high school. Many children lack executive functioning skills. Because teachers rarely receive instruction in how to improve children's executive functioning skills, children as young as preschoolers are frequently removed from class for exhibiting poor self-control. Associated problems include attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, teacher burnout, student dropout rates, and increases in substance abuse and crime rates, particularly in children from low-income families. One way of mitigating executive control problems is to alter the learning environment by implementing smaller class sizes or relaxing settings, which will improve working memory performance. Another way is to promote play as an essential activity, not a frivolous activity. Some researchers have found that mature, dramatic play enhances executive function. The same researchers found that the more a task relies on executive functioning, the more it is positively correlated with accomplishment. A third method draws from a series of studies in 2004-2005 (Klingberg et al.) which demonstrated improvement in children with working memory deficits, using training via computer games. The studies emphasize the use of working memory training that incorporates activities children are naturally drawn to. Improving school performance by improving memory through natural activities might significantly reduce dropout rates and save money for school districts. Improving memory Techniques have been developed to improve memory by directing attention to internal and external experiences as they occur in the present.Fodor, I. E., & Hooker, K. E. (2008). Teaching mindfulness to children. Gestalt Review, 12(1), 75-91 This has been used in the health care industry to help individuals overcome anxiety and other problems that interfere with memory retrieval in adults. Success in this area has led researchers to propose mindfulness as a tool for working with children. Relaxation is a way to reduce the flow of stressful or uncontrolled thoughts. Children may show decreased symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and aggressive behaviour along with improved memory in classrooms and in sports settings. Caution is required because some children may be uncomfortable with meditation. Smaller class sizes might also be a means of improving memory by reducing stress. Long term memory Jean Piaget Operative training task to improve long term memory The renowned developmental psychologist Piaget thought that memory and intelligence are linked.Liben, L. S. (1977). The facilitation of long-term memory improvement and operative development. Developmental Psychology, 13(5), 501-508. In Piaget's theory of cognitive development, operative intelligence is the conceptual framework of a child's understanding of the world, and this framework changes as the child learns. Piaget and Inhelder (1973) proposed a link between operative intelligence and memory, specifically that a child's ability to accurately recall an event or an image corresponds with the child's operative level. Previous studies showed very little improvement in operative development with training. However, one study points to inadequacies in older test designs. A study was designed using an operative concept of ‚Äúverticality‚Äù, referring to a child's ability to accurately represent true vertical lines, such as drawing a chimney perpendicular to a slanted roof or perpendicular to the ground. Verticality is a test of the child's ability to comprehend and represent the three-dimensional environment. Children were presented with an array or pattern formed by sticks. Children reproduced the pattern more accurately after a longer intervening interval (6 months) than after a shorter interval (1 week). This has led to research to see if training such operative skills can improve long-term memory. The results by Liben et al. were inconclusive due to the test design. The initial presentation of the stimulus itself improved recall performance months later, possibly because presenting the stick array led children to pay more attention to vertical lines in their environment after leaving the testing room. However, the memory gains might have occurred during various phases of the testing, but not necessarily within the long-term retention interval itself. In addition, the memory improvement might not generalize to children who are not in operative concept development transition stages. Nonetheless, these memory gains were unexpected, and might lend credence to the idea that operative development can be facilitated by presenting a stimulus that the child can generalize to his or her environment. Short term memory Context-dependent memory cues improve learning Children reading at desks in a classroom at the \\"Robert Emmet School\\" in 1911. The school was located at 5500 West Madison Street in the Austin community area of Chicago, Illinois Emotion and memory are linked. The influence of the learning environment relates to both the encoding specificity principle and to the attention given to the test material.Cassaday, H. J., Bloomfield, R. E., & Hayward, N. (2002). Relaxed conditions can provide memory cues in both undergraduates and primary school children. British Journal of Educational Psychology, 72(4), 531-547. Arguably, a more relaxed school environment will improve memory and performance on tests. As hypothesized by Easterbrook (1959),Easterbrook, J.A. (1959). The effect of emotion on cue utilisation and the organisation of behaviour. Psychological Review, 66, 183‚Äì200. Emotionality can negatively affect attention towards retrieval cues. Relaxation can be induced with music and odors, which cue involuntary memory on both free recall and recognition tasks. An experiment by H.J. Cassaday specifically used lemon and lavender odors to induce a calm learning environment which was later reinstated for retrieval tasks. As well, tests have shown that two retrieval cues seem more effective than one A test conducted by Cassaday focused on environmental conditions deemed to be relaxing such as smaller rooms and a lavender scent. This was carefully chosen with the additional element of familiarity (classical music already associated with school assembly). This study specifically used more than one cue because memory is multi-modal and context-dependent. Mood itself is a modality. Children can benefit from consistent learning environments that support less anxious states for encoding and retrieval of test material. It was also noted that relaxed encoding conditions followed by relaxed retrieval conditions improved performance compared with neutral conditions. This suggests that neutral conditions offer impoverished context cues for memory and retrieval. Verbal memory Music shown to improve verbal memory Music training is known to improve mental performance and memory in certain domains in both children and adults.Ho, Y., Cheung, M., & Chan, A. S. (2003). Music training improves verbal but not visual memory: Cross-sectional and longitudinal explorations in children. Neuropsychology, 17(3), 439-450. It has been well publicized that music training can improve mental performance and memory and that this can be seen in children as well as adults. The effects have been documented in a study that compared the effects of music on verbal as well as visual memory. The results show no improvement for visual memory but measurable improvement for verbal memory. Even those who discontinued the study outperformed a control group on verbal memory tests. It was found that even one year of musical training improved verbal memory. Training on an instrument results in stronger development of the left temporal lobe, which is linked to verbal processing. This type of usage-based neuroplasticity guides the development of synapses and brain structures in children. Working memory Exercise improves working memory A study of school children in Germany has shown that moderate exercise can improve working memory. This has the most benefit for those children who have demonstrated prior learning problems.Exercise to enhance memory! (2010). Journal of Sport & Exercise Psychology, 32(2), 268-268 One neuroimaging study showed a relationship between fitness, hippocampal volume, and some types of memory tasks.Chaddock, L., Erickson, K.I., Prakash, R.S., Kim, J.S., Voss, M.W. (2010). A neuroimaging investigation of the association between aerobic fitness, hippocampal volume, and memory performance in preadolescent children. Brain Research, 1358, 172-183. Children with higher levels of fitness have larger hippocampi and perform better on a relational memory task. Another study found that exercise improves working memory in low-performing adolescents.Budde, H., Voelcker-rehage, C., Pietrassyk-kendziorra, S., Machado, S., Ribeiro, P. (2010). Steroid hormones in the saliva of adolescents after different exercise intensities and their influence on working memory in a school setting. Psychoneuroendocrinology, 35(3), 382-391. According to Baddeley's model of working memory, working memory involves integrating multiple sources of information concurrently to guide behaviour. Procedural memory requires the involvement of the central executive in following verbal instruction while staying visually aware of the environment, ignoring distraction. In one study, participation in sports was found to improve working memory through the co- activation of the motor and cognitive systems, specifically the cerebellum and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.Santos, Stacee. \\"Can Complex Motor Learning Enhance Cognitive Functioning? A New Approach to Understanding the Malleability of Working Memory.\\" Boston College, 2008. United States -- Massachusetts: ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I.; Web. 21 Mar. 2012. Environmental stimulation during either sensitive or critical periods is necessary in forming neural connections Improved motor skills correlate with increased activity in the cerebellum, enhancing memory and thus enhancing cognition. Memory training activities followed by reinforcement tasks View of brain showing hippocampus and amygdala. A study on reading activities has examined two conflicting hypotheses on the benefits of reading in either a context that does not offer repetition or discussion, or a discussion-based, usually family-oriented, repetition-of-facts context.Pretorius, E., Naud√©, H., & Pretorius, U. (2005). Training the hippocampus and amygdala of preschool children by means of priming tasks: Should parents rather focus on learning of facts than reading fairytales? Early Child Development and Care, 175(4), 303-312. It is commonly thought by educators that reading frequency on its own is essential to learning. However, without verbal or subverbal repetition, certain areas of the brain are not properly activated for remembering. These areas include the hippocampus and, possibly to a larger extent, the amygdala. The amygdala, specifically the basolateral amygdala, has a primary link with emotion and is thought to play a role in memory consolidation through emotionally stimulating reading of material facilitated by repetition. In addition, the CA3 area of the hippocampus \\"replays\\" story events through repetition, which promotes long-term memory. Discussion and review of storylines can be categorized as a form of environmental enrichment which aides in survival of granule cells and glial cells as the hippocampus develops. Finally, the use of pictures is an elaboration technique that enhances mental visual representations as a type of priming for later memory retrieval. Tests have shown improved memory in enriched storytelling environments. Memory in adolescence Prospective memory can be studied as one memory system which shows drastic changes in adolescence. One of the last forms of memory to mature, prospective memory places heavy demands on the frontal brain regions, which are also among the last to fully develop in human beings. Prospective memory involves remembering to carry out an action at a certain time in the future. Although it is possibly absent in preschoolers, prospective memory starts to develop and continues to develop after preschool.Wang, L., Kliegel, M., Yang, Z., Liu, W. (2006). Prospective Memory Performance Across Adolescence. The Journal of Genetic Psychology, 167(2), 179-88. Time-based prospective memory develops between 7 and 12 years of age as children make more efficient use of external reminders. In comparison with other types of memory development, time-based prospective memory requires greater executive functioning skills and is therefore mastered at a later age as neural networks become more sophisticated. Neural input streams from the frontal lobe become increasingly proficient as a child reaches adolescence and progresses into adulthood. Prospective memory is responsible for planning, inhibition, anticipation, self-initiation of actions, and self-monitoring. It leads to more successful retrieval of source information. Usually, it is studied using a dual-task paradigm where participants work on an ongoing task while remembering to act when a cue is presented. One study examined age differences in event-based prospective memory. Participants were given two tasks: an ongoing task involving math questions and a personality questionnaire, and an embedded task that required participants to respond whenever a cue was presented. Young adults showed an improved prospective memory performance relative to teenagers, likely because the executive functions associated with the prefrontal cortex are among the last to mature. The prefrontal cortex does not finish developing until the second decade of life. More research is required to determine the nature of the complex interactions between growth hormones, variables such as social environment, and memory development as neural development reaches its peak.

Possibly the most notable events which befell him took place during the war of 1532‚Äì55 against the Safavid Empire. In October 1532, he was ordered to accompany the Grand Vizier, Pargalƒ± Ibrahim Pasha, who was the general of the field army and was heading to the Safavid border from Istanbul. Until the campaign, Pargalƒ± Ibrahim Pasha had regarded ƒ∞skender √áelebi as a father figure who could provide him with valuable knowledge about his craft. ƒ∞skender √áelebi was in favour with the Sultan, who personally cautioned Pargalƒ± Ibrahim Pasha not to go against him. Because of this ƒ∞skender √áelebi became a dominant figure in the campaign. He was even able to order Pargalƒ± Ibrahim Pasha, who had been moving from Aleppo to Baghdad, to go to Azerbaijan instead. Although this act went against Pargalƒ± Ibrahim Pasha's wishes, he did not object, as ƒ∞skender √áelebi was appointed by the Sultan, but it led to the cooling of relations between the two. Pargalƒ± Ibrahim Pasha believed that he was being overruled when he himself was the supreme leader of the campaign (second only to the Sultan in his capacity as Grand Vizier). The second incident, which sealed ƒ∞skender √áelebi's fate, was in fact in Azerbaijan, where he overruled Pargalƒ± Ibrahim Pasha, saying \\"The army will stay put, it is the will of the Sultan\\". However, when Suleiman the Magnificent arrived in Tabriz, he was astounded to see the field army in the middle of enemy territory. He would not tolerate any behavior which could endanger the army and ultimately himself. ƒ∞skender √áelebi's response to this question was not satisfactory, and led to him falling out of favour with the Sultan and his ultimate execution in Baghdad, where he was hanged in March 1535.The Great Ottoman History Volume 2 Page 354 by Ord. Prof. Ismail Hakki Uzuncarsili Pargalƒ± Ibrahim Pasha would also fall out of favour with the Sultan soon afterwards, being executed as well in the next year. ƒ∞skender √áelebi was known for owning a large number of slaves, approximately 6,000‚Äì7,000, far outnumbering those of even his rival Pargalƒ± Ibrahim Pasha (despite the fact that the latter held the much more powerful office of Grand Vizier).

As a painter and commercial artist his works span two continents. Early life and training Percy Leason was born in the remote wheat farm district in the town of Lillimur just outside Kaniva, Victoria, Australia in 1889. His father was a wheat farmer and his uncle James was proprietor of a saddle shop in Kaniva. His parents had expected he would carry on the family tradition of wheat farming or saddlery making. In his adolescent years he demonstrated an early interest in drawing. His earliest works of 1900 were landscapes, still life studies, and portraits of himself and his mother and father. In 1906 he was apprenticed as a lithographer at Sands and McDougall Lithographers, in Melbourne. He soon transferred to the art department where he did illustrations for jam tin labels and department store advertisements. His first major illustration was a poster for Carlton Brewery in Melbourne of Sam Griffis,Wannan, Bill. A Dictionary of Australian Folklore (Viking O'Neil, 1970). an itinerant miner, standing at a bar with a full pint. The caption of the poster \\"I allus has wan at Eleven\\", became a famous trademark for Foster's Lager. During these years he studied at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School under the tutelage of Bernard Hall and Frederick McCubbin. Upon completing his apprenticeship he began a somewhat bohemian lifestyle and developed camaraderie with the Melbourne artists such as William Frater,Hal Guye, Frank R. Crozier and others Blake, L.J. Victorian Historical Magazine. and associated himself with the Victorian Artists Society. Paintings of this period included life figures for the Shakespeare tercentenary and portraits of fellow artists Richard McCann and Harry McClellan. Career= Australia  Leason's introduction to book illustration began in 1914 with illustrations for James.C. Hamilton, Pioneering Days in Western Victoria, followed by Here is Faery by Frank Wilmont in 1915. In 1916 he illustrated a booklet for the tercentenary celebrating William Shakespeare. The same year he painted a panoramic scene of the Australian & New Zealand Forces at Gallipoli, now in the War Memorial Museum in Canberra. In 1916 he painted a series of canvases of the Sturt expedition into the interior of Australia. The largest of these, Out of Food and Water, depicting the desperate situation of the expedition, is in the National Library of Australia in Canberra. In 1918 he illustrated for a book of poems by Henry Lawson, notable Australian poet. With additional book illustration his reputation as an illustrator secured him a position as chief designer with the commercial publishing firm of Sydney Ure Smith publishers and he moved to Sydney. Here he worked as a commercial artist and illustrated commercial advertisements, and also illustrated for Home magazine. He served on the staff of the Sydney Bulletin as political cartoonist, replacing David Low. He became interested in etchings and joined the Sydney Society of Artists and the Painters and Etchers Society and associated himself with Sydney's contemporary artists.Rees, Lloyd. Small Treasures of a Lifetime: Some Early Memories of Australian Art and Artists (Ure Smith. Sydney, 1968). In 1918 his paintings and etchings were purchased by The Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney. Julian Ashton praised Leason's work in the magazine Art In Australia, in an article on what he considered a good picture: His paintings up to this point showed the influence of the darker tonality of the National Gallery School. In 1923 he was also represented in an exhibition of Australian artists at the Royal Academy of Arts in London. This same year he was recruited by Keith Murdoch of the Melbourne Herald as chief staff artist. He returned to Melbourne and it was here that he developed the famous Wiregrass cartoon series. His illustrations also appeared in Melbourne Punch and Table Talk magazines. At that time he was the highest-paid commercial artist in Australia. Returning to Melbourne he settled in the town of Eltham and built a home and one of the first art studios in Eltham entirely devoted to painting. Teaching class and entertaining the society of Melbourne as well as his artist cronies, the town developed into an artist colony. Among its residents who later became notable was Justus Jorgensen of Montsalvat. In 1916 he had met Max Meldrum who had returned from France and expressed his ideas of tonal analysis. When Leason moved back to Melbourne from Sydney in 1924, the two men bonded their ideas and cemented the style of tonalism they both would follow for the rest of their lives. Leason's articles in the press against contemporary art in support of Meldrum's theory helped the cause. Participation in shows with Victorian Artists Society in Melbourne further advanced his career as a painter. In 1928, Leason contended some figures described by the ethnologist John Mathew in 1897 were merely natural stains in the rock, which caused some controversy. In 1934 at the suggestion of Donald Thomson and Professor Wood Jones he was commissioned by Melbourne University to paint a series of portraits of Australian Aborigines. These were presented in an exhibition at the Athenaeum Gallery, and were his first one-man major exhibition. These portraits demonstrated his understanding and control of the tonal technique. A great critical row developed and the portraits were questioned as to whether they were art or ethnographic studies. Critic Blamire Young effectively squashed the artist and the portraits. In his article he asked visitors \\"to decide whether the portraits could be classed as an exhibition of works of art or' as an ante-mortem analysis of a moribund race, painted more or less in expiation of our sins in something of the same spirit that in the past stirred ill-doers to undertake the laborious washing of pilgrim's feet.\\"Young, Blamire.Herald, 10 Sept. 1934, p. 8. The exchanges continued for a considerable time but eventually the paintings were included in the State Library of Victoria, Melbourne. An inquisitive and active mind led to his questioning of the origins of an artist's depiction of the visual image. He developed a keen interest in prehistoric cave art and advanced the theory that these artists made their drawings from sketches of dead beasts. This theory was published in the Journal of the Prehistoric Society of Great Britain England in 1939. Towards the end of the 1930s Leason became concerned with the dwindling prospects of continued employment as a commercial artist, the rivalry in the Melbourne art scene between modern art and members of the Meldrum group, and the impending World War.  United States  Faced with the responsibility of a family of six children, he decided that his chances for continued success were better in the United States. He emigrated in 1938 and began his career in New York doing commercial illustration with pen and ink illustration of murder mysteries and detective stories, for the New York Daily News, and Blue Book Magazine. His first major book illustration in 1938 was The Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum. He joined the illustrating complement of the Gilbert Thompkins studios in New York which led to illustrations in Collier's, Liberty, and Saturday Evening Post magazines. He consequently became a member of the Society of Illustrators of New York. In 1939 his family emigrated from Australia and settled on Staten Island, New York. Recognizing the opportunity to spread the word about tonal painting, he established his first painting school in New York City in 1941, and continued it on Staten Island until 1957. In 1942 he held his first exhibition at the Staten Island Institute of Arts and Sciences. In 1943 he became the chairman and president of the art section. He developed an interest in art on Staten Island with the first of the outdoor art shows that continue to be a borough wide event. He also arranged the first annual Artist Carnival and increased the interest in the art section with annual exhibitions. In the summer months of 1948 he taught painting and landscape at the Wayman Adams School in Elizabethtown, New York in the Adirondack Mountains and at his own school in Westport NY in 1949. He also served on the staff of the Westport, Connecticut School of Commercial Art under the direction of Albert Dorne. In 1944 M. Grumbacher published a time chart he had developed outlining the historical development of tonal analysis as it applied to artists from 1200 to the present. Titled \\"The Rise and Decline of Painting\\", it traced the development of artists representation of the visual image and placed modernism at the bottom the chart. It was distributed through the Scholastic awards program and caused some concern among educational circles as well as kudos from supporters. At this time, the New York art world was going through great changes with interest in Modernism and Expressionism. He vehemently opposed these ideas and contributed openly to the critics in New York newspapers and the Staten Island Advance. The only associations that were holdouts for realistic painting during this period were the Salmagundi Club, Allied Artists, and the American Artist Professional League. Leason became aligned with their members who felt the same way about the changing trends. He held lively painting demonstrations and lectures on realistic tonalism in defiance against the prevailing theories on art. During these years he painted many landscapes and studios studies, most of which are in the collection of the Castlemaine Art Gallery and Historical Museum in Australia. Associated with Portraits Incorporated, N.Y. he had the opportunity to paint some portraits of notoriety including Arlene Francis, TV personality, and Congressman Dewey Short from Missouri and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, which is in the collection of the House of Representatives, Washington, D.C. A large portrait of Michael Engel, publicity director for M. Grumbacker art supplies won the Hollander prize in 1945 at the exhibition of Audubon Artists. In 1957 he traveled with his wife Isabel to France and England. He painted several tonal studies of Paris and the countryside of the Dordogne region which he visited in particular to justify his theory of cave art. Percy Leason's last one-man exhibition was held at the Chase Galleries, New York, where many of these European studies were on exhibit. In view of what was happening in the art world at this time, the exhibition received poor reviews. Arts Magazine stated that his paintings appeared to be nothing more than \\"numbered picture scenes\\". He tried to sue the magazine but his failing health and lack of funds prevented this.  Death  In 1959 he died on Staten Island, New York City, practically penniless and very despondent at not having received adequate recognition for his labours.  Legacy  Two retrospective exhibitions were held at the Staten Island Institute and at the Salmagundi Club, New York. In tribute to his artistic genius, Staten Island Institute curator James Cogin, quoted in the exhibition catalog from Frank Moore Coolby: \\"Every man ought to be inquisitive every hour of his great adventure down to the day when he shall no longer cast a shadow in the sun. For if he dies without a question in his heart what excuse is there for his continuance?\\"\\"Frank Moore Colby.\\" BrainyQuote.com. Xplore Inc, 2011. 10 May. 2011. Percy Leason's constant questioning of tonal technique as an ideal and his works he left are his legacy and his continuance.

The program focuses on the mystery of the Permian extinction, which scientists believe killed over 90% of all life on earth at the end of the Permian, some 250 million years ago.Hoffmann J.H. (2000), ‚ÄúWhen life nearly came to an end‚Äù, National Geographic 198(3): p. 100-113. The program features scientists like Adrian Jones, Vincent Courtillot, Gregory Retallack, Peter Ward, Michael Benton, Michael R. Rampino and others. Synopsis The program features palaeontologists and other scientists as they try to find clues to the great extinction. In the program, it is argued that the Permian extinction came in 3 stages; the first was caused by volcanic activity in the great Siberian Traps. This is proposed to have caused global warming, which in turn killed much of the life on land. Second, it warmed up the sea, which killed much of the marine life. As the sea became warmer, the ocean floor released a massive amount of methane. As the methane reached the atmosphere, the earth became even warmer, which led to the extinction of even more lifeforms on land. In the program, the extinction is argued to have lasted less than 1 million years.The Day The Earth Nearly Died, www.bbc.co.uk.

A spray nozzle is the device used to generate a spray. The two main uses of sprays are to distribute material over a cross-section and to generate liquid surface area. There are thousands of applications in which sprays allow material to be used most efficiently. The spray characteristics required must be understood in order to select the most appropriate technology, optimal device and size.Lipp, Charles W. , Practical Spray Technology: Fundamentals and Practice , 2012, Spray formation Aerosol spray can Spray atomization can be formed by several methods. The most common method is through a spray nozzle which typically has a fluid passage that is acted upon by different mechanical forces that atomize the liquid.Lipp, Charles W. , Practical Spray Technology: Fundamentals and Practice , 2012, The first atomization nozzle was invented by Thomas A. DeVilbiss of Toledo, Ohio in the late 1800s His invention was bulb atomizer that used pressure to impinge upon a liquid, breaking the liquid into a fine mist. Spray formation has taken on several forms, the most common being, pressure sprayers, centrifugal, electrostatic and ultrasonic nozzle. Fuel sprays Sprays of hydrocarbon liquids (fossil fuels) are among the most economically significant applications of sprays. Examples include fuel injectors for gasoline and diesel engines, atomizers for jet engines (gas turbines),Lefebvre, A.H. Gas Turbine Combustion, 1999, atomizers for injecting heavy fuel oil into combustion air in steam boiler injectors, and rocket engine injectors. Drop size is critical because the large surface area of a finely atomized spray enhances fuel evaporation rate. Dispersion of the fuel into the combustion air is critical to maximize the efficiency of these systems and minimize emissions of pollutants (soot, NOx, CO).Reitz, Rolf D, Modeling atomization processes in high-pressure vaporizing sprays, Atomization and Spray Technology (ISSN 0266-3481), vol. 3, no. 4, 1987, p. 309-337.

Spray application of herbicides, insecticides, and pesticides is essential to distribute these materials over the intended target surface.Lipp, Charles W. , Practical Spray Technology: Fundamentals and Practice , 2012, Pre-emergent herbicides are sprayed onto soil, but many materials are applied to the plant leaf surface. Agricultural sprays include the spraying of cropland, forest, turf grass, and orchards. The sprayer may be a hand nozzle, on a ground vehicle, or on an aircraft. Herbicides, insecticides and pesticides are spray applied to soil or plant foliage to distribute and disperse these materials. See aerial application, pesticide application, sprayer. The control of spray characteristics is critical to provide the coverage of foliage and to minimize off target drifting of the spray to adjacent areas. (pesticide drift). Spray drift is managed by applying only in appropriate wind conditions and humidity, and by controlling drop size and drop size distribution. Minimizing the height of the spray boom above the crop reduces drift. The spray nozzle type and size and the operating pressure provide the correct application rate of the material and control the amount of driftable fines.

This type of investment fund is governed by the Luxembourg law of 13 February 2007 replacing the law of 1991 defining the legal framework for institutional funds and enlarging the distribution scope to ‚Äúwell-informed investors‚Äù. The SIF law significantly simplified the rules for setting up investment fund structures ranging from straightforward investment strategies investing in listed securities to hedge funds, real estate and private equity funds. On 12 July 2013, the SIF regime was amended by the law on alternative investment fund managers (AIFM law). Consequently, the SIF law has been divided into two parts: * General provisions applicable to all SIFs; * Specific provisions applicable to SIFs which qualify as Alternative Investment Fund (AIF) and which require to be managed by an authorized Alternative Investment Fund Manager (AIFM). Due to the broad definition of AIFs, most SIFs are qualified as SIF AIFs.  Characteristics = Legal structures  The SIF may be structured as a: * A common contractual fund (FCP- Fond commun de placement) which has no legal personality and must therefore be managed by a management company; * An investment company with variable capital (SICAV- soci√©t√© d‚Äô investissement √† capital variable) or fixed capital (SICAF- soci√©t√© d‚Äôinvestissement √† capital fixe) which can be self-managed or managed by anexternal management company. A SICAV or SICAF can be set up using different legal forms. It can be set up as a public limited company (SA), a partnership limited by shares (SCA), a private limited liability company (SARL), a cooperative in the form of a public limited company (SCoSA), a limited partnership (SCS) or a special limited partnership (SCSp). These different entities may create sub-funds each with a different investment policy. The rights of investors and of creditors concerning a sub-fund or which have arisen in connection with the creation, operation or liquidation of a sub-fund are limited to the assets of that sub-fund (i.e. Protected Cell Concept), unless a clause included in the constitutional documents provide otherwise.  Eligible investors  A fund created under the SIF law may be sold to ‚Äúwell-informed investors‚Äù. According to the SIF law a well-informed investor is: * An institutional investor; * A professional investor; * Any other investors who confirmed in writing that they are ‚Äúwell-informed investors‚Äù and either invest a minimum of ‚Ç¨125,000 in the SIF or have an appraisal by a credit institution, an investment firm or a management company.  Diversification  The Luxembourg regulator (CSSF) issued a circular letter 07/309 on the 3 August 2007 containing guidelines of the principle of risk spreading and investment restrictions for SIF vehicles: * In principle, a SIF may not invest more that 30% of its assets or commitments in securities of the same type issued by the same issuer. However, this restriction does not apply to investments in securities issued or guaranteed by an OECD Member State or its local authorities, supranational institutions or organizations Furthermore, it is not applicable to target UCIs, which are subject to risk diversification principles that are at least comparable to those relevant to SIFs. * Short sales may not, result in the SIF holding a short position in securities of the same type from the same issuer representing more that 30% of its assets * When using financial derivative instruments, the SIF must ensure through an appropriate diversification policy of the underlying assets a similar level of risk spreading. Similarly, the counterparty risk in an OTC transaction must, when applicable, be limited having regard to the quality and qualification of the counterparty.  Investment restrictions and leverage  The SIF regime offers a broad scope of eligible assets. There are no specified investment restrictions or leverage rules by the SIF Law. It is simply stated that a SIF should apply the principle of risk diversification. Therefore, assets may include equity bonds, derivatives, structured products, real estate and shareholdings in privately held companies. The CSSF may provide exemptions from these restrictions on a case-by-case basis. However, the CSSF may also request that additional restrictions are adhered to, in cases of funds with specific investment policies.  Minimum fund size and dividends  The SIF law sets a minimum fund size of ‚Ç¨1.25 million which must be reached within 12 months after inception. Issued shares of a SICAV must be fully subscribed, but only 5% of the amount of the subscription must be paid up in cash or by other means of contribution. There are no specific restrictions on the payment of dividends. Nevertheless, such payments may not result in the size of the SIF falling below the minimum level of ‚Ç¨1.25 million.  Valuation of the assets  Unless otherwise provided for in the issuing document, the valuation of the assets must be based on fair value, determined in accordance with the procedures laid down in the management regulations (FCP) or articles of incorporation (SICAV-SICAF).  Duties and taxes  The CSSF filing duty is fixed at ‚Ç¨2650 for a single compartment SIF and ‚Ç¨5000 for a multiple compartment SIF. The CSSF annual fee is fixed at ‚Ç¨2650 for a single compartment SIF and ‚Ç¨5000 for a multiple compartment SIF. An annual subscription tax of 0,01% on the net asset value (NAV) has to be paid to the Luxembourg government ('taxe d'abonnement').  Appointing a SIF- AIF  A SIF that is qualified as an alternative investment fund according to the AIFM law must be managed by an authorized alternative investment fund manager (AIFM)which may either be established in Luxembourg, in a Member State of the EU, or in a third country. Following the AIFM Law, a SIF-AIF can be managed in two different ways: * it can be managed externally through the calling of a separate AIFM responsible for managing the SIF AIF. In this case it is the governing body of the SIF AIF which is empowered to call an authorized AIFM; * it can be managed internally. In this case the SIF AIF will be considered as the AIFM itself and it will be required to comply with all of the AIFM Law obligations which apply to an AIFM and submit a request for authorization under the AIFM Law.  Depositary Functions  Depositaries of SIF AIFs must comply with the new depositary regime as provided for by the AIFM Law. This new depositary regime imposes specific duties, being the following: * the obligation to protect the SIF AIFs assets; * the obligation to monitor the SIF AIFs cash flow; * as well as specific oversight duties. In addition, the liability regime has been reviewed and strengthened by the AIFM Law. The depositary is strictly liable in the case of a loss of financial instruments it held in custody and it must, without delay, return financial instruments of an identical type or of corresponding amount to the SIF AIF or the AIFM acting for the SIF AIF. Avoiding the consequences of this liability regime is very limited. Any other losses caused by the depositary's negligent or intentional failure to properly fulfill its obligation under the AIFM Law lie under the depositary's liability.  Valuation Function  The valuation function (valuation of assets and calculation of NAV) has to be performed either by the AIFM itself or by an external company that will act under the responsibility of the AIFM and that is subject to a mandatory professional registration recognized by law. The NAV (net asset value) must be calculated at least once a year.  Content of annual Report  SIF AIFs have to disclose additional information in their annual reports compared to SIFs, being: * the total amount of remuneration it paid to its staff for the financial year; * the number of beneficiaries; * any carried interest paid by the SIF AIF. * the aggregate amount of remuneration, as broken down by senior management and by AIFM staff members whose actions have a material impact on the risk profile of the SIF AIF.  Risk Management  A SIF qualifying as an AIF must establish a risk management function separated hierarchically from that of the operating units. An adequate risk management system must be implemented in order to identify, measure, manage and monitor appropriately all investment risks arisen through the SIF AIF investment strategy.  3. Marketing  The exercisable marketing rules vary depending on whether the SIF is a SIF AIF:  SIF AIFs  Only SIF AIFs managed by an EU authorized AIFM benefit from a passport allowing the AIFM to market the SIFs within the EU.

He pitched all or part of five seasons in Major League Baseball between 1969 and 1974 for the Atlanta Braves and Cincinnati Reds. Career=Braves McQueen was drafted out of Spring Branch High School by the Braves in the fourth round of the 1968 Major League Baseball Draft. He began his professional career with the Magic Valley Cowboys of the Pioneer League, but was soon promoted to the Double-A Shreveport Braves. McQueen missed most of the 1969 season, appearing in just four games for Shreveport. Despite this, he was chosen to start on October 2, the last game of the regular season, for the major league Braves. He pitched just three innings, giving up one run on two hits, walking three batters and striking out three. At age 19, he was the youngest player to appear in the major leagues that year. The next season, McQueen started the year with the Triple-A Richmond Braves. He was again recalled to Atlanta in early June, where he was used out of the bullpen for most of the season. He was moved into the starting rotation in September, and his last appearance of the season was a complete game victory over the Reds. In 1971, McQueen opened the season with Atlanta, again pitching mostly out of the bullpen. That spring, Hank Aaron compared McQueen to Warren Spahn Unfortunately, McQueen missed large chunks of the season to injury, appearing in just 17 games, winning four of them. That would turn out to be his career high. McQueen suffered through another injury-plagued campaign in 1972, posting an 0‚Äì5 record in 23 games. Even worse, the pitcher, along with teammate Jim Breazeale, was in a serious automobile accident that December, and he missed the entire 1973 season.  Remaining career  Working on a comeback in 1974, McQueen was taken off the Braves' 40-man roster. He was selected in that offseason's Rule 5 draft by the Reds, and began the year in their bullpen. After appearing in 10 games and posting a 5.40 earned run average, McQueen was sent back to the Braves on July 1. He spent a month in Richmond, then was traded to the Baltimore Orioles on August 7 for a minor league pitcher. He appeared in just four more games that season. McQueen was let go by the Orioles, and he sat out both the 1975 and 1976 seasons. In 1977, he decided to give baseball another chance, and he signed with the Houston Astros. He started out in A-ball with the Cocoa Astros, where he posted a 1.93 ERA in 28.1 innings, earning a promotion to Double-A Columbus. Things went downhill quickly, as he posted an ERA of 6.50 in 14 games, at which point he left professional baseball. Overall, from 1969 to 1974 McQueen appeared in 73 games as a pitcher, making 19 starts for the Braves and Reds. McQueen died at age 67 in Batesville, Arkansas.

He taught at several institutions, including the Darul Uloom Deoband, which contains a gate named in his honor. He authored books on Islam published in Arabic and Persian. He was first Principal at Madrasa Aminia and served Darul Uloom Deoband as Principal for twelve years. Early life and education Anwar Shah Kashmiri was born in Kashmir on 27 Shawwal 1292 AH (1875) in a Sayyid family. Aged four, he started reading the Quran under the instruction of his father, Muazzam Ali Shah. In 1889, he relocated to Deoband, where he studied at the Darul Uloom for three years. In 1892, he moved to Darul Uloom Deoband where he studied with Mahmud Hasan Deobandi and others. Then, in 1896 (1314 AH), he went to Rashid Ahmad Gangohi and obtained a teaching certificate in Hadith (which he had been studying for two years) and esoteric knowledge. Career After graduating from Darul Uloom, he taught in Madrasa Aminia, Delhi, serving as its first Principal. In 1903 he went to Kashmir, where he established Faiz-e A'am Madrasah. In 1905 (1323 AH) he performed Hajj. Four years later, he returned to Deoband. Until 1333, he taught books of Hadith without taking a salary. He held the guardianship of Darul Uloom for nearly twelve years. He resigned in 1927 (1346 AH) and went to the Madrasah of Dabhel in western India, where, until 1932 (1351), he taught Hadith. He left his family in 1887 and moved into the Madrasah in India. He began his career teaching at Madrasa Aminia in Delhi in 1897 before returning to Kashmir when his mother died in 1901. There, he taught at the Madrasah Fay'm for three years before embarking on his Hajj to Mecca and Medina. He visited his Deoband instructor Mahmood Hasan, who persuaded him to take a position teaching in Deoband. When Mahmood Hasan himself subsequently relocated to Medina in 1908, Shah began teaching Hadith.He retained the position until 1927, when he departed after a disagreement with management. Kashmiri moved to Jamia Islamia Talimuddin along with Azizur Rahman Usmani in 1927 where he taught Hadith until 1932. Death and legacy In 1933, Shah became ill and traveled to Deoband for medical care. He continued addressing students there until he died on 28 May 1933. He was survived by his elder son Azhar Shah Qaiser and younger son Anzar Shah Kashmiri. Muhammad Iqbal arranged a condolence ceremony, at which he described Kashmiri as the greatest Islamic scholar of the last five hundred years. Jamia Imam Muhammad Anwar Shah, Deoband is an Islamic school named after Kashmiri. Syrian scholar Abd al-Fattah Abu Ghudda has written a biography of Kashmiri in Arabic. Yunoos Osman wrote his D.Phil thesis Life and Works of Allamah Muhammad Anwar Shah Kashmiri at the University of Durban-Westville. A book about Kashmiri entitled The Pride OF Kashmir was released in December 2015. During the release of the book, Engineer Rashid, then MLA of Langate renamed Student of the year award of Kupwara to \\"Moulana Anwar Shah Kashmiri Award for excellence\\". Literary works Between 1929 and 1946, the Majlis-i-·øölm educational academy in Delhi published Kashmiri‚Äòs writings on Islam. Among other topics, his books discussed Qur'an, metaphysics, the fundamental beliefs of Islam, jurisprudence, zoology, and politics. Kashmiri also wrote poetry and often put his scholarly writings in that form. Some of his articles and manuscripts remain unpublished. His works include: * Mushkilat al-Quran * Fayz al-Barii ala Sahih al-Bukhari * Anwar al-Baari (Urdu commentary of Sahih Bukhari, compiled by Kashmiri's son-in-law Ahmad Rida Bijnori) * al- øUrf al Shadhi Sharh Sunan Al-Tirmidhi Personal life In 1908, Kashmiri married a woman of Gangoh, with whom he had three sons and two daughters.

Betagh established a number of free schools in Dublin, which taught over 300 boys. These schools also provided clothing for the most destitute of the pupils, where a total of over three thousand boys had been educated. The schools were afterwards known as the Dr Betagh Schools. Life Betagh was descended from a branch of an old Roman catholic family in Meath, Ireland, which, through the Cromwellian confiscations, lost considerable estates.Gilbert, John Thomas. \\"Beltagh, Thomas\\", Dictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900, Vol. 4 He was born in Kells, County Meath. His father was a tanner. Betagh was attended John Austin's school in Saul's Court in Dublin. At an early age Beltagh was admitted to the seminary of the Society of Jesus at Pont-√†-Mousson in France. He spent most of his Jesuit years of spiritual and intellectual formation in France and was ordained a priest at Pont-√†-Mousson on 24 May 1766. He resided at Paris and Metz as a professor of languages before returning to Ireland in 1769. In Dublin he worked with Fathers Austin, James Mulcaile SJ, and Fullham in the old chapel at Rosemary Lane, and taught at the school in Saul's Court. With them, he also assisted the secular clergy for years. In 1773 the Jesuits was suppressed by pope Clement XIV, so Betagh had to seek incardination into a diocese. (The Order was restored only six months after his death.) He served as a curate, and succeeded the Rev. Field as parish priest of SS. Michael and John's on Exchange Street. The parish was located in one of the poorest areas of Dublin. Betagh established free schools in Schoolhouse Lane, off Cook Street, then in Skinner's Row, and finally in Smock Alley, catering for about 330 boys. Amongst his pupils were the future Archbishop of Dublin Daniel Murray, and the founder of Clongowes Wood Fr. Peter Kenney SJ who reestablished the Jesuits in Ireland, whose studies he sponsored. Betagh later became Vicar-General of the Archdiocese of Dublin. Until just before his death he taught each evening at these schools and provided clothing for the most destitute of the pupils, where a total of over three thousand boys had been educated. The schools were afterwards known as the Dr Betagh Schools. The chapel in Rosemary Lane was in a ruinous state, but before Betagh died the foundation-stone of the new Church of SS. Michael and John in Exchange Street was laid, which was partially opened on Christmas Day, 1813.A Compendium of Irish Biography, 1878 He died at his residence, 80 Cook Street. His funeral was attended by over 20,000 persons. His remains were interred in the Jesuits' vaults in Old St. Michan's, Church Street. About 1822 they were removed to the vault of his own church, SS. Michael and John, under the High Altar, where a monument to his memory was also erected.James Collins: Life in Old Dublin.

It was produced by Hulu and Jace Hall's HDFilms, streaming Monday through Friday. The show originally featured Brian Kimmet and Ginger Gonzaga as hosts. Later shows used a rotation of hosts including Alison Haislip, Dave Holmes, Damien Fahey, Bradley Hasemeyer, Haley Mancini, Paul Nyhart, and Rachel Perry. The series advertises itself as \\"a smart, daily shot of pop culture to help Hulu users stay up to date\\" and typically highlights notable moments from television shows and current news in an entertaining fashion. In keeping with its focus on pop culture, The Morning After will sometimes stream an episode featuring past pop culture titled \\"From the Archives,\\" such as its April Fools' Day episode.  History  While not the first original series to appear exclusively on Hulu, The Morning After is the company's first self-branded production. It was preceded by If I Can Dream, a reality series co-produced with 19 Entertainment and created by Simon Fuller. Hulu originated the idea in house, based on user feedback and observations from discussion boards hosted by the website. The concept was modeled after The Big Show with Olbermann and Patrick. The company sought out a production partner and ultimately chose Jace Hall and his team at HDFilms to executive produce. Initial stream of the series was held on January 17, 2011 and featured coverage of Piers Morgan, the Golden Globes, and The Bachelor. Senior VP of Content and Distribution Andy Forssell made the announcement for the show the same day. The show aired its last episode April 24, 2014.  Format  A typical episode usually begins with a cold open shared by the varying hosts listing the highlights to be covered. The topics focus on TV and Pop Culture Highlights from the previous night, with the intention of helping Hulu users digest hours of content in a matter of moments. The show has the hosts trade humorous remarks regarding the news and each other, taking turns reviewing the night's TV and injecting their own personality. The Morning After was named as an honoree by the Webbys on April 10, 2012 in the variety section of its online video category.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The church stands at the east side of the town, overlooking the River Thames. History An earlier church on the site was destroyed in 1646 during the siege of Wallingford in the Civil War. Building of the present church started in 1763, the contractors being William Toovey and Joseph Tuckwell. In 1767 the interior of the church was paved, pews were added, and the exterior was stuccoed under the supervision of Sir Robert Taylor. A spire designed by Taylor was added in 1776‚Äì77. A local resident, Sir William Blackstone, a lawyer and author of the Commentaries on the Laws of England, took an interest in the building of the spire and paid for the clock face visible from his house. The chancel was built in 1904, designed by Sydney Stephenson. The church was declared redundant on 1 May 1971, and was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust on 26 July 1972. For visitor access, a key can be obtained from the nearby Tourist Information Office. A series of chamber music concerts is held during the summer months. Architecture=Exterior The plan of the church consists of a four-bay nave, a chancel with an apse, and a west tower with a spire. The nave and chancel are constructed in ashlar stone, the nave standing on a flint plinth. The tower is built in knapped flint, with stone quoins and bands. The nave is roofed in Welsh slate and the chancel is tiled. At the top of the tower is a clock face on each side, except the north. Above this is an octagonal belfry surmounted by an openwork stone spire. The nave and tower are in Neoclassical style, and the chancel is Gothic Revival. The church is entered by a double door in a round-headed doorway on the west side of the tower. Above the doorway is a three-light window containing Y-tracery. The nave has a shaped cornice and a plain parapet, and contains four round-headed windows on each side. In the chancel are windows dating from the 20th century, the one on the north side being a rose window. Interior The nave has a shallow-arched coffered ceiling.

The alterations were minimal, though, and the building retains many of its original fittings and its \\"archaeologically correct Gothic\\" exterior which reflected architectural norms of the early Victorian era. English Heritage has listed the church at Grade II for its architectural and historical importance. History By the 12th century, Hastings on the English Channel coast was one of Sussex's largest and most important towns. The famous Battle of 1066 took place nearby; a castle was founded; the town operated its own mint; it was the leader of the Cinque Ports; and seven churches existed within its boundaries. The surrounding manors included Gensing, a large and attractive expanse of land running down from a forested valley on to flat agricultural land and a beach immediately west of the town. As Hastings recovered from an 18th-century slump and started to become fashionable and well patronised again in the early 19th century, speculative development was encouraged. James Burton, a builder and entrepreneur who later fathered the prominent architect Decimus Burton, saw the potential of the Gensing estate land, which was owned by the Eversfield baronets of Denne Park near Horsham, West Sussex. He bought a large section of this manor, including of seafront land, for ¬£7,800 in February 1828, and developed a carefully planned new town, St Leonards-on-Sea, on it. Residential, commercial and hotel development was rapid, especially after it was incorporated as a town by an Act of Parliament in 1832 (previously it had been run as a private enterprise by Burton), and the resort soon rivalled neighbouring Hastings in popularity. Burton provided the town with its first Anglican church, St Leonard's Church, in 1831. The 800-capacity seafront building was consecrated in 1834. After Burton's death in 1837, the town continued to grow in all directions, helped by the opening of St Leonards Warrior Square railway station in 1851. This was close to the square of that name, an early Victorian-era set piece (started in the early 1850s), which helped to push St Leonards-on-Sea's boundaries closer to those of Hastings. St Leonard's Church, the parish church, was in the western part of the resort, on the seafront road called Marina. This was the only Anglican place of worship in the town, and in 1848 a Roman Catholic place of worship was established near Warrior Square when Augustus Pugin's Convent of the Holy Child Jesus opened its chapel for public worship; so in June 1850 a group of promoters contacted the Incorporated Church Building Society and applied for money to build a new church to serve the eastern part of St Leonards-on-Sea. The church was built on a high, sloping site. The land Burton bought straddled two parish boundaries: St Leonard's and St Mary Magdalene's. St Leonard's was named in reference to one of Hastings' ancient parish churches which apparently vanished by the early 15th century. It belonged to an abbey in Rouen in France before that. St Mary Magdalene's parish, to the east, was first described in 1656, but there was no ancient church of that dedication in the area; instead there was a medieval Hospital of St Mary Magdalene, from which the name may have come. The new church then took the name of this ancient parish. Charles Eversfield of the Eversfield baronets gave the site for the church‚Äîa high, landmark site overlooking Warrior Square. Funding came from the Bishop of Chichester, the vicar of St Leonard's parish church and others. A building committee was assembled to administer the design and construction process. Sir Thomas Smith Marrable was a member, and his son Frederick was commissioned to design the church. Work on the Decorated Gothic-style building started in 1852, and the church opened in that year. It had a capacity of 822 worshippers, split approximately equally between free and paid-for pews. The ecclesiastical parish was officially reconstituted in 1870. The building cost ¬£12,000‚Äîexpensive for the time. The plans provided for a tower and a large spire. The latter was never added, but in 1872 a tower was built at the southwest corner. Other work carried out in this year included the addition of an organ chamber (in the form of an apse) and a vestry, and a new east window in the chancel. Stained glass windows by Morris & Co. were added in 1882. A church hall, a simple brick structure, was built on the northwest side in 1935. The Diocese of Chichester declared the church redundant in 1980. Soon afterwards, it was bought by the local Greek Orthodox community; various sources give 1981, 1982 or 1983 for the year. They installed an iconostasis in 1983 as the central feature of the church. Architecture The nave has a clerestory and five-bay aisles. St Mary Magdalene's Church is an expensively designed, \\"archaeologically correct\\" Decorated Gothic Revival church whose design was exactly in accordance with architectural norms of the mid-19th century. As a \\"large and imposing\\" building on a prominent, high corner site (a feature typical of the churches of St Leonards-on-Sea and Hastings), it makes a \\"handsome composition\\" within the townscape. Another characteristic feature, similar to other local churches, is the extensive use of locally quarried stone. The interior and exterior walls are of sandstone laid in ashlar blocks. The Decorated Gothic Revival design matches the typical style of a 14th-century church. The plan consists of a clerestoried nave with aisles on the north and south sides, a chancel at a lower level, a buttressed four- stage tower with a beacon-style turret, a porch and a vestry on the north side. The aisles have five bays each and are separated from the nave by arcades. The tower rises from the westernmost bay of the south aisle and has paired lancet windows on each face of its top (bell) stage. The chancel has a hammerbeam roof in a Perpendicular Gothic style. Writing in 1965, Ian Nairn and Nikolaus Pevsner stated that the interior was \\"not specially interesting\\", but several original features remain. Stained glass of the 19th century‚Äîsome of which was destroyed in bomb attacks in 1943‚Äîincluded examples by Marrable himself, Heaton, Butler and Bayne, William Miller, Clayton and Bell, Edward Burne-Jones and the Morris & Co. window in the south aisle. A three-seat sedilia and adjacent piscina, both with ogee-shaped heads, remain in the south wall, and there is a reredos with a carving of the Last Supper. An ogee- panelled porch and an octagonal font with carvings also survive. The church today St Mary Magdalene's Church was listed at Grade II by English Heritage on 14 September 1976. This defines it as a \\"nationally important\\" building of \\"special interest\\". As of February 2001, it was one of 521 Grade II listed buildings, and 535 listed buildings of all grades, in the borough of Hastings. It is one of several listed churches in St Leonards-on-Sea: the Anglican churches of Christ Church, St Peter's and St John the Evangelist's are classed at the higher Grade II*, while St Leonard's Anglican parish church, St Leonard's Baptist Church and the Roman Catholic Church of St Thomas of Canterbury and English Martyrs, along with the former St Leonards-on-Sea Congregational Church, are also Grade II-listed. The church is in the Hastings and St Leonards parish of the Archdiocese of Thyateira and Great Britain. It is served by two priests, one of whom also serves the Greek Orthodox Church of St Panteleimon and St Theodore in the nearby seaside resort of Eastbourne. This was converted from a Calvinistic Independent Baptist chapel built in 1857. Similarly, the Greek Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity in the Carlton Hill area of Brighton was converted from a redundant Anglican church in 1985. The church is licensed for worship in accordance with the Places of Worship Registration Act 1855 and has the registration number 79948.

Products include risk detection, fleet tracking, and driver safety programs that use artificial intelligence and analysts to identify risky driving behaviors and report real-time fleet information. The company's clients include waste management and sanitation companies, trucking and distribution, government and municipality vehicles, passenger transit, construction, utilities, telecom and field services. Lytx also provides compliance services for trucking fleets regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation. History= Founding  Lytx, formerly DriveCam, Inc., was founded in 1998 by Gary Rayner. Rayner wanted a version of a \\"black box recorder\\" that could identify the root cause of vehicle crashes, which could then provide clues about how to avoid such accidents in the future. Rayner developed a driver recording system that could gather data from incident and driving recordings to provide insight into driver behavior and other factors influencing crashes. In 1999, DriveCam received a grant from the Transportation Research Board (Administered by the National Academies of Sciences) to test the viability and utility of information captured by the DriveCam Video Event Data Recorder (VEDR). Also in 1999, Gary Rayner met Tom Lafleur at an engineering conference, and Lafleur became the lead investor for an angel investment group that made the initial outside investment in DriveCam. Lafleur joined the company as chief technology officer and ultimately served as a board member where he remained until the company's acquisition in 2016.  2000‚Äì2016  In early 2000, Ed Andrew joined as President while Gary Rayner managed the hardware and software product development teams. Rayner remained with the company as CEO and Chairman of the board until April 2003. By November 2002, the company received three patents for technology related to its DriveCam video event data recorder. In 2005, DriveCam was included on Inc. Magazine's list of the 500 fastest-growing, privately held companies in the U.S. and remained on this list for three consecutive years. In 2006, the company was listed as one of the top 200 contenders for the Red Herring 100 North America list. In 2007, DriveCam partnered with American Family Insurance to provide a video feedback program in which parents could review the driving actions of their teens. In 2010, the Teen Safe Driver Program was awarded the 2010 Teen Driving Safety Leadership Award by the National Safety Council. Scientists at the University of Iowa used the program to produce a 70% reduction in risky driving behavior. As of 2017, the company no longer offers the DriveCam for Families program. In September 2008, Brandon Nixon became the company's CEO. Also in 2008, the company introduced RiskPredict, a pattern-recognition software that could be used to help predict the riskiest drivers within a fleet. Through a process of scoring, prioritizing and tracking the results of individual driver behaviors, the model identifies those behaviors that would most likely lead to a collision. In 2009, the company launched DriveCam Online, a driver management portal. In 2010, DriveCam added new clients including Sysco, Masco and the Washington Metropolitan Transit Authority. The company also extended its contracts with AmeriGas and Waste Connections. Later in 2010, DriveCam was listed as No. 30 on the Wall Street Journal's List of Top 50 Venture-Backed Companies. Also in 2010, DriveCam released fuel management and real-time fleet tracking services. In April 2011, DriveCam was awarded a Blanket Purchase Agreement by the General Services Administration for the purchase of in- vehicle video recorders and driver feedback systems. In August 2011, DriveCam became an awarded National Joint Purchasing Alliance vendor. Also in 2011, ONEOK, Public Service Electric and Gas Co. (PSE&G;), Waste Industries, Linde and Pat Salmon & Sons joined as new clients. DriveCam also expanded its operations internationally with contracts in Canada and South Africa. In December 2011, DriveCam announced its acquisition of Rair Technologies, LLC, a provider of compliance services for commercial trucking fleets. Upon completion of the acquisition, Rair maintained its headquarters in Brookfield, WI. In February 2013, DriveCam added Greyhound Lines as a client. And on November 4, 2013, the company changed its corporate name from DriveCam Inc. to Lytx Inc. In 2014, Lytx added Con-way Freight as a client. The same year, Sentry Insurance and ARI Insurance announced they would provide their insured commercial clients with subsidies to defray the cost of adopting the DriveCam event recorder. Also in 2014, The Virginia Tech Transportation Institute (VTTI) conducted a study of heavy truck and bus collisions. They found that Lytx's video-based driver safety program has the potential to reduce fatalities, collisions and injuries. In 2015, Lytx launched its ActiveVision service at the American Trucking Associations' annual Management Conference and Exhibition in Philadelphia. The service uses machine vision technology to identify patterns that may be indicative of distracted and drowsy driving such as lane departures and following distances.  2017‚Äìpresent  In 2017, the company launched Lytx Video Services, adding access to near livestream video and continuous recording up to 100 hours. The company also added Walmart and U. S. Xpress as clients along with UK based tour coach company The Travellers Choice. At the start of 2018, the company announced it had products in more than 3,000 commercial and government fleets with more than 850,000 drivers. Also in 2018, Nationwide partnered with the company to add the DriveCam safety program to Nationwide's long-haul trucking fleets. Frost & Sullivan reported Lytx's market share at more than 60% of the video telematics market. Later that year, Mack Trucks announced an offer of a pre-wire option of DriveCam and Video Services in all Granite Class 8 vehicles. In February 2019, the company introduced a configurable product portfolio based on the Lytx Video Platform, with the Lytx DriveCam¬Æ Event Recorder as the foundational product. At this time, product names including Lytx Video Services and ActiveVision were retired and new program and service names were introduced: Risk Detection Service, Driver Safety Program and Fleet Tracking Service. The brand DriveCam was only used to refer to the hardware. Also in 2019, Lytx joined the Qualcomm Smart Cities Accelerator Program. The Accelerator Program plans to use the dataset compiled from more than 100 billion miles of driving data and over 1 million drivers to help smart cities improve traffic and transit flows. Also in 2019, the company added Hogan Transportation, The Caillier Group, and The Trucking Alliance as clients. In December 2019 the company changed the name of its compliance offering from RAIR Compliance Services to Lytx Compliance Services. Lytx was also awarded Company of the Year for Video Safety Solutions by industry analyst firm Frost & Sullivan. In February 2020, Lytx announced an expansion of its machine vision system and artificial intelligence technology. The new technology allows the Lytx DriveCam¬Æ Event Recorder to record inside- facing movement triggers along with road-facing movements. The event recorder will provide near real-time insight into potentially risky behaviors such as distracted driving, texting while driving, failure to stop at intersections, weaving between lanes, and following other vehicles at unsafe distances. Funding history In November 2011, Lytx received an $85-million investment from Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe to fund expansion and the acquisition of RAIR Technologies. The acquisition provided web-based safety and regulatory compliance solutions for DOT-regulated fleets. The acquisition also added patents to Lytx's existing patent portfolio. In February 2013, Volvo Group Venture Capital invested in Lytx and became a minority shareholder. On February 18, 2016, GCTR, a Chicago-based private equity firm, announced it had agreed to purchase Lytx for $500 million in an all cash transaction that closed the first quarter of 2016. Prior investors in the company included Insight Venture Partners, Integral Capital Partners, JMI Equity, Menlo Ventures, Triangle Peak Partners, Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe and Griffen LLC. In April 2018, Clearlake Capital Group announced it had invested an undisclosed amount in Lytx. Other investors in 2018 included HarbourVest Partners, Public Sector Pension Investment Board and Guggenheim Investments. In January of 2020, Lytx announced a majority investment from Permira making this the largest investment in video telematics to date. The investment puts the value of Lytx at over $2.5 billion. Product Lytx provides the following products: *Lytx Video Platform - In 2019, the company introduced Lytx Video Platform as its foundational product offering. It is available as a standalone product, with the Lytx DriveCam¬Æ Event Recorder, and is required to enable other products such as the Risk Detection Service, Fleet Tracking Service and the Driver Safety Program. The platform provides streaming access of up to 100 hours of continually recorded video. The Video Platform lets users plug additional cameras into the system, allowing for multiple views from the same vehicle, such as side and rear-facing views, along with a road- facing camera. It also allows managers to livestream video from the road. Users can access video from a few minutes to weeks in the past. *Lytx DriveCam¬Æ Event Recorder - A dash cam that powers the Lytx Video Platform by collecting and processing data and video. It uses two wide angle lenses to capture events in front of and behind a vehicle, covering a 360-degree view. The dash cam captures events generated by the recorder's g-force sensors while also providing real-time in-cab feedback to the driver. DriveCam uses machine vision and artificial intelligence with a video event recorder to identify and categorize moments on the road. It also includes a microphone and light and audio alerts. In 2020, Lytx upgraded the event recorder technology to monitor risky driving behavior by capturing inside-facing triggers. The dash cam now identifies potential distractions and risk factors such as cell phone use, seatbelt use, weaving between lanes, and failure to stop at intersections. *Driver Safety Program - Uses machine vision, artificial intelligence and professional review to identify and report risky driving behaviors to help clients coach their employees to change their behavior to minimize risky driving behaviors. In 2020, Lytx updated the machine vision and artificial intelligence technology to include four new triggers: handheld device, seatbelt use, food and beverages, and driver smoking. *Risk Detection Service - The service uses data pulled from video telematics and dash cams to identify and alert managers to risky driving events in real time. Risks are predicted using a combination of machine vision (MV), which recognizes objects and human behavior in images, and artificial intelligence (AI), which uses voice recognition, collision detection and risky driver behavior detection to anticipate events. *Fleet Tracking Service - The DriveCam Event Recorder has integrated GPS-based fleet tracking software that can provide real-time locations of drivers. The recorder also provides fuel and maintenance insights by measuring vehicle idling and speeding. *Lytx Compliance Services - The web- based tool allows carriers to track, document and manage driver logs required by the Department of Transportation and the Electronic Logging Device (ELD) mandates as required by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. The service includes alerts and reports along with audits of driver qualification files. Patents The company holds 93 patents for its video event recorder, automatic driver risk assessment, driver detection and warnings, and performance tracking technology. Lytx has an additional 64 registered trademarks and 54 pending patents as of March 19, 2018. Patents relate to operations in North America, Europe, Africa, Australia, the United States, Canada, Ireland, the United Kingdom, South Africa and the Philippines. In 2011, Lytx, then DriveCam, Inc., filed a lawsuit against SmartDrive Systems citing patent infringement. The two companies resolved their patent disputes in 2012.

Including both Korean and overseas branches, this organization was able to attract a total membership of between 30,000 ‚Äì 40,000 people. While internal strife between leftist and rightist factions was a consistent obstacle, the Singanhoe actively pursued several goals: *the abolishment of racial, political, and economic oppression *the attainment of freedoms of speech, organization, association, and publishing *the support of youth and women's equality movements *the overturning of factionalism and clan nepotism *the opposition to the East Asia Colonial Development Company *the propagation of the economic frugality movement. Background 1931 After the March 1st Movement, as the political awareness of the masses was greatly raised, the Korean nationalist movement of the 1920s developed rapidly and spread throughout Korea and beyond. This nationalistic consciousness was manifest in Manchuria through the armed struggle for independence, in areas under Chinese jurisdiction through the diplomatic efforts of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea, and within Korea through the efforts of the labor, farmer, and youth movements. In response, Imperial Japan used the deceptively labeled Cultural Rule developmental policy in an attempt to weaken and fragment the strength of this nationalist movement. In particular, during this period, Imperial Japan shifted attention from the widely propagated Practical Skills Development Movement to the Autonomy Movement. Yi Kwangsu‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Administration of a Nation‚Äù outlined the general precepts of the Autonomy Movement (known in English scholarship as the Cultural Nationalist movement), which stressed the development of Korean infrastructure from within Japanese colonial rule, rather than pushing for immediate independence. Immediately after the Cultural Nationalist Movement was proposed, writers from the Choson ilbo, including Yi Sangchae, An Chaehong, and Ch«índoist scholar Kw«ín Tongjin championed an uncompromising united nationalist front while harshly criticizing the Cultural Nationalist Movement. On the other hand, others like H«í H«ín and Hong My«ínghui from the newly popularized socialist camps searched for a means of cooperation. Solidarity within the Socialist Movement From the mid-1920s, there was a rising sentiment within the socialist camp regarding the need for a comprehensive umbrella organization. Even within the nascent socialist camp, which spread rapidly after the events of the March 1st Movement, activists began to recognize the necessity of a cooperative front with the nationalist camp. They drew much inspiration from the successful cooperation in China of the Communists and the Nationalists in forming a united movement against imperialism and towards national independence. Formation Even as the nationalist camp and socialist camps sought mutual cooperation, the socialists looked beyond the strict class ideology that marked the earlier movement, and from 1924 could be categorized into two camps: the cooperative nationalist camp and the revolutionary nationalist camp. As a result, from 1926, there started to be an organizational start to this search for an uncompromising movement. Although they were not successful in actualizing these plans, Kang Taly«íng, who was the second secretariat of the Korean Communist Party, made contact with Kw«ín Tongjin, An Chaehong, and Kim Chuny«ín, among others. The Korean National Party's desire to create an organized national front in response to the general trend towards the Autonomy Movement is a representative example of the situation at the time. The cooperation between recalcitrant nationalists and socialists progressed rapidly as the Ch«íng‚Äôuhoe (Ê≠£ÂèãÊúÉ) published the Ch«íng‚Äôuhoe Statement which advocated the establishment of a singular nationalist body that was a coalition between nationalist and socialist camps. The Ch«íng‚Äôuhoe Declaration Ch«íng‚Äôuhoe was a socialist ideological body made up of the Tuesday Club, the Pukpunghoe, the Chos«ín Communist Party, and the Proletariat Alliance. By 1926, socialism had grown to such a large scale extent that 338 ideological circles were active, but the aforementioned four groups constitute the principle influences of Korea's socialist movement. The Ch«íng‚Äôuhoe, which had been formed in April 1926, made their famous proclamation on November of the same year. The main crux of the proclamation, which criticized the previous activities of the socialist movement, were the advocacy of ‚Äúthe elimination of the factionalism and the unification of ideology,‚Äù ‚Äúa shift from the economic struggle to political struggle,‚Äù and ‚Äúthe development of a unified nationalistic body.‚Äù In other words, ‚Äúso that the influence of nationalism would not degrade, we must progressively support other groups and fight‚Äù became their mantra. Thus in line with their proclamation, once the Singanhoe was formed as a united nationalist body, the Ch«ínguhoe bravely dissolved their organization. Among the various organs established to promote understanding between the dual branches of socialism and nationalism, the Singanhoe was the first to advocate a thoroughly consolidated organization. In order to receive the imprimatur of the office of the Japanese Governor-General of Korea, the vice president of Chos«ín ilbo took action, and while he originally proposed the title of ‚ÄúSinhanhoe‚Äù (Êñ∞ÈüìÊúÉ) for the organization, the Governor-General did not approve so the name was revised to ‚ÄúSinganhoe‚Äù (Êñ∞ÂππÊúÉ).

It is the oldest restaurant in the city, housed in a three-story red brick Italianate building dating to the late 19th century. In 1987 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as \\"New Brick‚ÄìThe Brick Saloon\\", along with other historic properties in the city. It began as a saloon opened by an early city alderman; at one point its upper floors were reportedly home to a brothel. In its early years it was one of three dining establishments in Aspen. It retains much of its original interior, including a bullet hole in the bar. As the city became a popular ski resort, it hosted musical performances by, among others, Billie Holiday and John Denver. It continued operating under various owners for 115 years until closing for structural renovations for three years in the late 2000s. Building The Red Onion is located on the north side of East Cooper, midway between South Galena and South Mill streets. That block of the street is a pedestrian mall, with brick walkways on either side and mature trees on either side of a small tributary of the Roaring Fork River. Tables are often located in front of the restaurant in warmer months. Around the building, the surrounding neighborhood consists primarily of a mix of historic and modern commercial buildings, most one or two stories high. Rubey Park is to the west, a large open area between South Mill and South Monarch streets. The Wheeler Opera House, an Aspen landmark also listed on the Register, is around the corner at South Mill and East Hyman. A block to the southeast is the base station and gondola of the Aspen Mountain ski area. The building itself is a three-bay, two-and-a-half-story brick structure topped with a roof sloping gently to the north. Its south (front) facade has a three-section glass storefront with wooden dividers. The main entrance is at the east. Above each section is a rectangular transom, eight panes in the larger western section and four in the other two. It is topped with a wood dentilled and modillioned cornice. Three round-arched windows mark the second story. Their lower sections have one-over-one double-hung sash windows and black wooden sills. Projecting bricks form another modillioned cornice which serves as a springline for the arches, and goes around them. At the roofline is another modillioned and dentilled cornice with ornate brackets supporting a broad overhanging eave. In the center is a small pediment with scroll brackets on the side. \\"1892\\" in gold lettering is in the entablature, surrounded by more decorations, and \\"T. LATTA\\", for the original owner, is below. Finials with spherical tops are on either end. The side and rear facades are largely unfenestrated. Along the east side, \\"RED ONION\\" is written in golden vertical letters. The interior has its original pressed tin ceiling, bar and backbar, and clay tile floor. The latter is similar to that found at another Register- listed Aspen landmark, the Hotel Jerome at Main and Mill. It is believed that the two small Hungarian gypsy figurines over the bar, which still has the bullet hole left from an accidental discharge by a city policeman in 1899, are original as well. In the basement is the entrance to a tunnel that once led to a nearby bank building. History First settled in 1879, Aspen grew rapidly during the Colorado Silver Boom of the 1880s; by 1890, it had reached a population of around 10,000. Two years after that, alderman Tom Latta built the unnamed brick structure on East Cooper Avenue and opened a saloon (and possibly a brothel on the upper floors). At that time it was a standalone building, with vacant lots on either side. It quickly became popular. The early clientele were miners and other local men interested in then-popular sports such as bicycling, boxing and wrestling. It was one of only three places to buy a meal in the city. Known at first as just \\"the brick saloon\\" or \\"the new brick saloon\\", it was soon referred to as \\"the red onion\\", a contemporary colloquialism meaning something rare and unique, similar to what \\"white elephant\\" means today. Patrons were served Monongahela rye and Crab Orchard whiskey to accompany their billiards matches. After the repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act in response to the Panic of 1893, Aspen's prosperity rapidly faded. Many of its residents left town, and buildings from the boom era fell vacant. Many eventually succumbed to fire and neglect. The Red Onion remained open through a period now referred to as the city's \\"quiet years\\". In 1918 it was purchased by Tim Kelleher, who kept it open through Prohibition by serving sandwiches. Interest in Aspen as the site of a recreational Alpine skiing area began in the late 1930s but was put on hold during World War II. After the conflict, one veteran of the Army's Tenth Mountain Division, which had done some of its early training in the area, returned to Aspen and bought the building from Kelleher in 1946. By the next year it was the only building standing on Cooper Street. During those years, Ernest Schwiebert recalled later, \\"Aspen was still pretty much a ghost town ‚Ä¶ [and] the saloon was clearly the social fulcrum of the town.\\" The veteran, John Litchfield, made the Red Onion the building's formal name and remodeled it. It became a popular place in the growing resort's apr√®s-ski scene, and hosted musical performances as well. Billie Holiday gave a notable performance at the bar in the years after this. A new owner, Werner Kuster, built on this during the 1960s. He added a gourmet restaurant and performance space in a building next door. Many more musicians played the Red Onion during this time, as Aspen became a favored getaway of many Hollywood celebrities. John Denver, who would make Aspen his home and later wrote several songs about the area, was one performer. In the late 1970s East Cooper Avenue was closed to vehicles and converted into a pedestrian mall. Several different restaurants occupied the space in the early 1980s, including for a time an outlet of the Red Robin hamburger chain. (Kuster sold the Onion in 1979 and passed away in retirement in Tucson, AZ on January 21, 2019.https://www.aspentimes.com/obituaries/werner-f-kuster/) In the 1990s, its front space was converted to retail use, and an awning stood in front of its entrance. After several extensions, the building's owners terminated the restaurant's lease in 2006, and it closed early in the following year. At that time the Red Onion had been serving food and drink for 115 years continuously, making it the oldest such establishment in Aspen. Efforts to reopen it began soon afterwards. Scott DeGraff, another local restaurateur, assumed the lease and began renovating the interior of the closed building. That work stopped in late 2008, and the following year the lease was terminated as financial difficulties, including liens and lawsuits against DeGraff over unpaid debts, and the slow economy. Other operators were interested, and eventually Jennifer Colosi and her brother Thomas, formerly chef/owner of the Blue Maize, another Aspen restaurant, signed a 15-year lease and finished the renovations, which Jennifer Colosi called \\"The Red Onion on steroids.\\" It reopened in 2010. Jennifer Colosi said they had no plans to change the name or use of the building. \\"Why would we take 100 years of branding and change it?\\" The menu is a largely Southwestern fare of meat dishes and sandwiches for lunch and dinner, with closing scheduled for 1 a.m. nightly. Breakfast, including dishes the Red Onion had traditionally served such as steak and eggs and chicken and waffles, is available at any time. Thomas Colosi added some of his more successful dishes from the Blue Maize, such as jalape√±o poppers, steak diablo and ribeye and lobster rellenos. Late that year the Colosis resumed the Red Onion's musical traditions with a weekly open mike night built around scheduled performances by local musicians.

It was first reported in 1887 in a cotton mule spinner. In 1926, a British Home Office committee strongly favoured the view that this form of cancer was caused by the prolonged action of mineral oils on the skin of the scrotum, and of these oils, shale oil was deemed to be the most carcinogenic. From 1911 to 1938, there were 500 deaths amongst cotton mule-spinners from cancer of the scrotum, but only three amongst wool mule spinners. Piecing a mule with the right hand in 1892, showing where the faller bar is in regards to the 12-year-old piecer's groin Introduction About 1900, there was a high incidence of scrotal cancer detected in former mule spinners. The cancer was limited to cotton mule spinners and did not affect woollen or condenser mule spinners. The cause was attributed to the blend of vegetable and mineral oils used to lubricate the spindles. The spindles, when running, threw out a mist of oil at crotch height, that was captured by the clothing of anyone piecing an end. In the 1920s, much attention was given to this problem. Mules had used this mixture from the 1880s, and cotton mules ran faster and hotter than the other mules, and needed more frequent oiling. The solution was to make it a statutory requirement to only use vegetable oil or white mineral oils, which were believed to be non-carcinogens. But by then, cotton mules had been superseded by the ring frame and the industry was contracting, therefore it was never established if these measures were effective. Mule spinning A pair of long self-acting mules with 1320 spindles each would be tended by three employees: the minder or operative spinner, the big piecer, and the little piecer. The little piecer would start in the mulegate on his fourteenth birthday, and rise to the status of a minder. All these men worked barefoot, wearing white light cotton trousers. There were four basic tasks: creeling, doffing, cleaning and piecing. Creeling and piecing would both be done while the mule was in motion. Creeling was about replacing the bobbins in the creel while piecing the old disappearing thread with the new; it was done from behind the mule. Piecing was about joining any ends that had broken. The piecer would catch the snarled fuzzy broken end at the top of the spindle in his right hand and pull out some clean thread and wrap it around the left forefinger. This would be pressed into clean roving emerging from the attenuating rollers, pulling the hand away when the two had twisted together. All this was done while walking back and forth with the carriage, contact being made using the three of four seconds when the piecer was close enough to lean over the frame and reach the rollers. At this moment, left arm and leg forward, his crotch was adjacent to the base of the spindles. The cancer This cancer was a manifestation of scrotal squamous cell carcinoma which had first been noted in 1775 by Sir Percival Pott in climbing boys or chimney sweepers. It was the first industrially related cancer to be identified and was originally called soot wart, then chimney sweeps cancer. He describes it: > It is a disease which always makes it first attack on the inferior part of > the scrotum where it produces a superficial, painful ragged ill-looking sore > with hard rising edges ... in no great length of time it pervades the skin, > dartos and the membranes of the scrotum, and seizes the testicle, which it > inlarges, hardens and renders truly and thoroughly distempered. Whence it > makes its way up the spermatic process into the abdomen. He comments on the life of the boys: > The fate of these people seems peculiarly hard ... they are treated with > great brutality ... they are thrust up narrow and sometimes hot chimnies, > where they are bruised burned and almost suffocated; and when they get to > puberty they become ... liable to a most noisome, painful and fatal disease. The carcinogen was thought to be coal tar possibly containing some arsenic. When the first case of scrotal squamous cell carcinoma in a cotton worker in the Manchester Hospital records in 1887, shale oil had been used in the mills for 35 years. A heavier oil was used once a day on the carriage and wheels but a lighter oil was applied three to four times to the spindles. The heavier oil may come into contact with the minders' hands, but it was the lighter oil that was sprayed from the spindles and saturated the spinners' light cotton trousers at the level of the pubis and groins above the scrotum. Piecers would remove any heavy oil from their hands by wiping them on the trousers. Brockbank in his 1941 paper: > In most men the bar is on a level with the pubis and groins above the > scrotum. In a hot room the spinners in vest and overalls only perspire > freely, and this must tend to wash off the natural grease on the skin and > allow the oil to get onto it. In over 80% of the cases occur on the left > side, this may be due to one or more of the following causes: firstly the > left side hangs anatomically lower than the right, this will be more > pronounced when the spinner is bending forward to piece with his left hand; > perspiration from the lower part of the abdomen will then tend to run down > the left side and the left side and less often the middle of the scrotum > will come into contact with the left thigh and the oily trousers some > hundreds of times a day. Mineral oil and alternative theories Leitch reported, in 1922, that he had painted mineral oil from shale onto mice, inducing carcinomas, while Henry reported, in 1926, that shale oil was used on the rapidly rotating spindles, which, due to centrifugal force, sprayed out. There were, however, skeptics. Alternative theories included those such as the spinners were more susceptible to this cancer because they wore less clothing than wool spinners, and, notably, there was the issue of lack of underpants. Dr. Robertson argued the cancer was caused by stretching while piecing. In stretching, abrasion was caused by upward pull and consequent tightening of overalls dragging on the scrotum. Others blamed it on the want of bodily cleanliness. Home Office enquiry A Home Office enquiry was launched in March 1925 and reported back in 1926, with S. A. Henry of Manchester as secretary. It identified mineral oil as the prime cause and drew up a list of recommendations. Recommendations Firstly that guards should be fitted along the faller bar of all mules; and * Institution of experimental research into oils with a view to finding oils which are innocuous and at the same time suitable as lubricants * Development of a non-splash type of spindle bearing, more particularly for new mules * Prevention of oil splash from the spindles of existing mules by means of some form of guard, the type to be decided by a series of tests to be mutually agreed upon and arranged by the Masters' Federation and the operative spinners * Periodic medical examination of the workers *(a) To be tried at first on a voluntary basis, but, if unsuccessful in one year or at any subsequent period, to be made compulsory *(b) To be performed at the factory *(c) To take place at least every four months *(d) To include every worker in the mule-spinning room who is 30 years of age and over *(e) To be performed by three or four medical men appointed by the trade, with Home Office approval, for the whole area or failing this by special medical men appointed for suitable areas by the Home Office in conjunction with trade representatives, all workers in any given area to be examined by one man. * Education by periodic distribution of leaflets in order direct attention to the importance of cleanliness and to the dangers of delay in securing early treatment See also * Chimney sweeps' carcinoma References=NotesBibliography * * * * Category:Cotton industry in England Category:History of the textile industry Category:Spinning Category:Male genital neoplasia Category:Occupational diseases Category:Scrotum ","title":"Mule spinners' cancer"},{"id":"31656592","text":"Jean Perrot (1920 ‚Äì 24 December 2012) was a French archaeologist who specialised in the late prehistory of the Middle East and Near East.

He researched a number of ancient sites in Iran, Israel and Turkey, animating the research at international level. He first went to Iran in 1968, a year after the retirement of Roman Ghirshman, to head the Delegation Arch√©ologique Fran√ßais (DAFI) and excavations of the country's ancient sites. He headed a multidisciplinary team in conjunction with the Iranian Centre of Archaeological Research, including experts from France, Iran and the United States who continued studies until the revolution in 1979. He worked on sites such as Susa and Jafar Abad and took measures to safeguard the vestiges of the Achaemenid period (between the sixth and fourth century BC). His notable discoveries included ancient items such as the headless statue of Darius which is now housed in the National Museum of Iran in Tehran. In Israel Perrot excavated at Munhata, Ain Mallaha and the Chalcolithic sites at Abu Matar and Bir es-Safadi near Beersheba, belonging to the so-called Beer Sheva culture. In 1952, Perrot founded the \\"Mission arch√©ologique fran√ßaise\\", now called the French Research Center in Jerusalem; a joint research unit of the General Directorate for International Cooperation and Development and the CNRS. It is the CNRS's oldest foreign branch and became a permanent archaeological base in 1974. The current director since 1996 is Dominique Bourel. In 1973, Perrot founded the notable journal Pal√©orient with Bernard Vandermeersch along with the aid of the Wenner-Gren Foundation. In 1975, this became a publication of the CNRS. The journal is now published twice a year and distributed in twenty-two countries, it is recognized for presentations and discussions of research in all aspects of the prehistory and protohistory of the near and middle east. Perrot returned to France to become director of the CNRS, which he joined in 1946 and for which he was an honorary research director and correspondent.

Armada 2526 is an example of the space opera genre, and is the spiritual successor of the game Armada 2525, which was released by Interstel in 1991. Armada 2526 puts players in charge of a fledgling galactic empire, and they must attempt to explore the galaxy and expand their territory, while trying to destroy rival empires. The gameplay is a hybrid of turn-based and real-time time-keeping systems, and players can use military, diplomatic, economic and technological means to further their empires. The game received mixed reviews from critics. Ntronium also released an expansion pack for the game, titled Armada 2526: Supernova, which enabled online multiplayer play. Supernova includes two new alien races, new hazards, an updated trade mechanic, and more researchable technologies.  Gameplay  A squad of Dreadnought ships covers a landing zone The fundamental gameplay mechanic of Armada 2526 is 4X, an abbreviation of explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate. Players must explore the galaxy, expand their empire, exploit the various resources to be found, and exterminate their rivals. The game uses elements of both turn-based and real-time time-keeping systems, there are no set battles, and there are multiple paths that players can take to victory. Games last for an arbitrary amount of time, set at the beginning of the game; the galactic civilization with the most points at the end of the game is the winner. The conditions for victory vary depending on the race that players choose to play as. Some races focus on the happiness of their citizens, others focus on developing technology, and yet others focus on population. There are four different game scenarios that players can choose from, each with a different size of randomly generated game map. These game maps can contain anywhere from two to seventeen civilizations. Most of Armada 2526 takes place in 2D, with the main star map and battle sequences taking place on 2D planes. However, it is also possible to view the battles from a 3D perspective. Exploration is carried out on the main star map, and players can use an Ark Ship to travel to new worlds and colonize them. As well as colonization, players can expand their empires by contacting alien colonies, by making alliances with other empires, through building, and by military means. The spaceships that the player can use in battle include small scout ships, medium-sized corvettes, destroyers, and large dreadnoughts and carriers. Players are responsible for the economic upkeep of their colonies, and they can set the tax and migration policies for them. The population of colonies is also a concern for the player, and it is possible to supplement a colony's population by transporting more people from other worlds. These processes can also be automated. Diplomacy in Armada 2526 includes the ability to form offensive and defensive alliances; to trade in money, ships, colonies, technology, and information; and to threaten, give ultimatums or ask for favors. There are also some unusual technologies that players can research in the game. In addition to items such as spaceships, weapons, and shields, players can develop such technologies as bio-engineered squid hyperdrive ships, and psychic civilians that can detect enemy warships in space above their planets. Reception Armada 2526 received mixed reviews from critics, resulting in an accumulative average score of 66 out of 100 according to review aggregator Metacritic. Game Zone's Mike Splechta praised the game's accessibility and replay value, but criticised its graphics as \\"just not up to today's standards\\". Simon Priest's review in Strategy Informer was positive overall, but he criticized the game's user interface, calling it \\"the weak link in the chain\\". James Allen of Out of Eight, on the other hand, praised the \\"informative\\" user interface, as well as the size of the randomized maps, the computer control of colonies, the AI opponents, and the diversity of the victory conditions. However, he criticized the lack of online multiplayer play in the original version, and called the combat \\"bland\\", the diplomacy \\"generic\\", and said that Armada \\"lacks the 'hook' of more robust offerings\\". Adam Solo's review in Space Strategy Games Sector called Armada 2526 \\"a very solid game\\", but said that \\"it may not be for everybody\\", noting that this is in line with Ntronium's target of hardcore strategy fans. He also praised the developers for their continuous improvement of the game.

The film is a remake of Menon's own Tamil film Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa (2010) and features a reused soundtrack and film score composed by A. R. Rahman, while the cinematography and editing were handled by M. S. Prabhu and Anthony Gonsalves, respectively. Singer Chinmayi provided the talking voice of the female lead, reprising her role from the Tamil version and the Telugu simultaneously made version where she dubbed for actresses Trisha Krishnan and Samantha Ruth Prabhu respectively. While in production, the film was titled Prem Katha, but was renamed as Ekk Deewana Tha, as the director wanted an abstract title for the film, similar to the original. The film, produced by Fox Star Studios, a subsidiary of Hollywood studio 20th Century Fox, Photon Kathaas and RS Infotainment, was released on 17 February 2012 in two different versions with a number of endings to suit the taste of regional viewers. The film opened to universally mixed reviews and had a lukewarm reception at the box office. Plot Sachin Kulkarni is a student of mechanical engineering in Mumbai who aspires to become a filmmaker. His friend introduces him to cinematographer Anay. With Anay's help, Sachin becomes an assistant to director Ramesh Sippy. Sachin's family, who are Marathi Brahmins, rent Jessie Thekekuttu's house. Jessie is from a conservative Malayali Syrian Catholic \\"Nasrani\\" family from Alappuzha, Kerala, that lives upstairs. Sachin falls in love with Jessie the moment he meets her. Sachin tries to interact with Jessie, who is afraid of speaking to men around her strict father and ends up angering Jessie. Unable to hide his feelings for her any longer, Sachin confesses his love for her, to which she does not respond. A few days later, Sachin learns from his sister that Jessie has gone to Kerala to visit her grandmother. He, along with Anay, ends up in Kerala to look for her. After several days, he finds her, apologises and she introduces him to her family in Kerala as her \\"classmate\\". Jessie denies she has any feelings for him but agrees to be his friend. On the train journey back home, however, the two get closer and share a passionate kiss. Sachin is convinced Jessie loves him; the two meet several times and Jessie begins to admit that she also likes Sachin, but wants to refrain from any problems because she knows her father wouldn't give her hand in marriage to a Hindu. Consequently, due to various misunderstandings between Jessie's brother and Sachin, her parents learn of their supposed affair. They fix a match and schedule her wedding. The day arrives and midway through the ceremony, Jessie refuses to marry the groom, displeasing everyone in her family. Sachin, who had, without anyone's knowledge, come to Kerala to witness the wedding is ecstatic and secretly visits Jessie at her home. It is then that Jessie admits she has indeed fallen in love with him. Sachin and Jessie continue to love each other without the knowledge of their parents. At this point of time, Sachin goes to Goa on a 40-day shoot, where he gets busy. Meanwhile, the topic of Jessie's marriage comes up again at her home when the guy whom she refused to marry earlier pays them a visit. Panicking, Jessie calls Sachin and tells him that she wants to elope with him. Sachin, who he is travelling through less than ideal places, tells Jessie to stay in Mumbai for now, and that soon he would be back and they can discuss. Jessie stops taking Sachin's calls and so he goes back one night to check on Jessie. He comes to know that Jessie has decided to break up, as the relationship is not peaceful due to her parents' disapproval. She says she has agreed to marry a boy of her parents' choice. When Sachin pleads her not to do it, she tells him that a time had come when she was willing to elope, but the moment was gone. She doesn't want Sachin to wait for her, as he has his dreams to fulfill. Sachin later comes to know that she is married and settled abroad. Two years later, Sachin meets Samantha. She falls in love with him but is rejected by Sachin who hasn't yet gotten over Jessie. He then comes up with a script for his first film, which happens to be his very own love story. He calls upon an actor (Ashwin Kakumanu) as the film's protagonist, Samantha as the female lead and Anay as the film's cinematographer, and the film is eventually titled Jessie. While shooting for the film in Taj Mahal, he sees Jessie and she comes to speak with him. She admits that she is not married and is still in love with him, and he too says she is still in his heart. Sachin proposes yet again and they get married the same day. This is actually revealed to be the end scene in Sachin's film ‚Äì which Sachin and Jessie in real life are watching together in the theatre. After the film ends, Jessie praises Sachin for his efforts and the latter agrees to drop her home, implying that they are reunited.

Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa (Tamil) and Ye Maaya Chesave (Telugu) were considered to have changed the images of their lead actor pairs Silambarasan Rajendar-Trisha Krishnan and Naga Chaitanya-Samantha respectively. Though, the Hindi remake initially had Trisha Krishnan and Samantha Ruth Prabhu reprising their role, the actress was unceremoniously dropped from the project after a photo shoot and replaced by Amy Jackson, who shot to fame with the Tamil film Madrasapattinam. Gautham Menon was trying out a 'look shoot' at the same locations where he shot Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa and Ye Maaya Chesave, including a popular seaside restaurant on ECR, Chennai. A source close to the director said, \\"This shoot was just to get the 'feel' of the film. The actual shoot will take place in Mumbai from next month.\\" According to the sources, A R Rahman's original tunes will be retained for Ekk Deewana Tha as well, while the film also features Gautham Menon's regular technical team, consisting of art director Rajeevan and editor Anthony Gonsalves. Noted poet, story and screenplay specialist, Javed Akhtar recently was in Chennai, supervising the script and writing the lyrics for the film. A source close to the development said, \\"Javed saab and Gautham hit it off well. The lyricist's inputs will be taken into consideration as Gautham is particular that his film should not come across as a routine South Indian remake.\\" Amy Jackson, playing a Syrian Malabar Nasrani Christian in the film, said that, \\"I'm very kicked about working with Gautham Menon. I've seen VTV [Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa] at least 15 times. Ekk Deewana Tha is a perfect launch pad for me in Bollywood. He is a perfectionist and I know he will shape my character according to the needs and tastes of the Bollywood audience. I've begun the first schedule of the film and I'm planning to hire a Hindi tutor to help me sail through it.\\" Filming The shooting of the film was to start in late-2010 but Prateik Babbar was busy with the promotions of Dhobi Ghat. Finally, the shooting of the film commenced in April 2011, with the entire cast and crew of the film in Mumbai. The shooting of the film progressed in various localities in Mumbai and the Ekk Deewana Tha team went down to Kerala and began the second schedule there in May 2011. The crew later went to Chennai in June 2011 to shoot few important scenes in Amethyst, Chennai, while, some of the songs were shot in AVM Studios, Chennai. In July 2011, after the shooting of the film in Chennai was completed, the next schedule of the film was started at The Taj Mahal, Agra, while the shooting of the film was also held in Delhi. Soundtrack The soundtrack and film score for Ekk Deewana Tha is composed by A. R. Rahman, retaining the same tunes from Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa along with few additional tracks ‚Äì \\"Kya Hai Mohabbat\\" (A. R. Rahman), \\"Jessy's Driving Me Crazy\\" (Sanjeev Thomas & Timmy) and three instrumental tracks ‚Äì \\"Broken Promises\\" (Shreya Ghoshal), \\"Moments in Kerala\\" and \\"Jessy's Land\\". The track \\"Dost Hai (Girl I Loved You)\\" is a remixed version of its Tamil original Kannukkul Kannai. The soundtrack album consists of lyrics penned by Javed Akhtar, collaborating with Gautham Menon for the first time. The soundtrack album was released at a luxury hotel in Agra, by A. R. Rahman on 21 December 2011.  Release  The film was released on 17 February 2012, in a unique way with a number of different endings. Notably, in Tamil, Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa had the leads part ways whereas in Ye Maaya Chesave, the Telugu version of the film had the lovers united. The mainstream ending was released in across 500 screens in India, while the director's cut, with a different end, was released in 20 select theatres across the country. The director's cut showcased a coming-of-age love story while the ending for the mass release had a conventional feel-good ending. Controversies A month before the film's release, a group from the Christian Secular Forum (CSF) in Mumbai strongly objected to the song \\"Hosanna\\". According to them, Hosanna is a sacred term in the Bible that is used by both Jews and Christians while praying, while in the film, the same term was used in a romantic sense. They demanded removal of the song, as well as an \\"apology for disrespecting the word\\", and threatened to take legal action against the film if the song was not edited out of the film's final cut. To this, music director Rahman responded, \\"As with any film project I work on, I had spent several months researching before composing/writing all the songs for and had consulted friends who are Christian in particular about the use of the word 'Hosanna' in this song. The song was a sensation when it was released in the South a couple of years ago and it went on to win all possible music awards and was well received by all communities! Therefore I am deeply concerned about the sentiments of all those who appear to be hurt by this song.\\"  Critical reception  Ekk Deewana Tha received mixed reviews upon release. Avijit Ghosh of The Times of India gave the film 3 stars out of 5 saying, \\"Ekk Deewana Tha has its moments but it doesn't really put you in the mood for love.\\" Oneindia.in commented that \\"In a nutshell, Ek Deewana Tha is good romantic thriller and this can be good for this Valentine's season.\\" Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film 2 stars out of 5, and said, \\"On the whole, Ekk Deewana Tha has a few sparkling moments, that's about it. However, it lacks the fizz for the spectator to go deewana!\\" Shubhra Gupta from The Indian Express also gave the film 2 stars out of 5, saying, \\"Simbu's stubbly guy-next-door, helplessly in love with the feckless Trisha was the highlight, apart from its lovely songs, of VTV [Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa]: where did all the passion go in Ekk Deewana Tha?\\" Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN too gave the film 2 stars out of 5 saying, \\"This Hindi remake is a disappointing bore of a love story that tests your threshold for pain as it hobbles along indulgently for close to 2 hours and 40 minutes.\\" Zee News gave the film 2 stars out of 5, and concluded that, \\"All in all, Ekk Deewana Tha is a movie that seems to have been lost in translation. However, Prateik deserves praise for his efforts.\\" Blessy Chettiar of DNA gave the film 1.5 stars out of 5, concluding saying, \\"A simple and sweet story treated badly. Skip. Simple.\\" Komal Nahta for Koimoi.com gave the film a single star out of 5, blaming the routine story, the weak screenplay and lack of feeling of empathy for the two lead characters. Preeti Arora of Rediff.com feels that Ekk Deewana Tha, Gautham Menon's Hindi remake of his hit Tamil film Vinnaithaandi Varuvaaya, lost quite a bit in translation. She gave the film 1 star out of 5. Shubha Shetty-Saha of MiD DAY too gave the film 1 star out of 5 saying, \\"No, the story is not really as bad as it seems. With better direction and perhaps a little more sensitivity and with a faster pace, and better actors (oops, are they too many conditions?), it might have worked.\\" Mayank Shekhar of Hindustan Times again gave the film 1 star out of 5 saying, \\"We‚Äôre beyond midway through the movie: chuck chemistry, all you‚Äôre wondering is what the hell‚Äôs the story.\\" Kaveree Bamzai of India Today too gave the film 1 star out of 5, and said, \\"We are supposed to feel the longing he has for Amy. We only feel the irritation. Get on with it guys you want to say. Come to the point. By the time they do you are exhausted, and want to do what Prateik says Amy's character did to his feelings-showed him the middle finger. So there.\\" Kunal Guha of Yahoo! gave the film minus 1 rating, and said, \\"it is in fact the iceberg that makes this painful love story crash as we endure the burn.\\"  Box office  The film had a very poor opening day at the box office with only 5‚Äì10% occupancy in cinemas. On Saturday, the film collected just nett. The film on Sunday collected nett, taking its total first weekend collection to nett. Its gross collection for week one stood at nett. The film was declared as a \\"Flop\\" by the Box Office India.

It traces its history to before 1288. History Knabstrup is one of the oldest manor houses in Denmark. It is first mentioned in 1288 when it was confiscated from Niels Henriksen, a member of the Hvide dynasty, for his participation in the murder of Eric V in 1286. Nothing is known about the earliest building but in 1460 Iver Axelsen Thott, who then owned the property, began constructing a complex similar to Lil√∏ Manor in Scania which he also owned. The estate was acquired by Frederik Nielsen Parsberg after a fire had destroyed the main building in 1620 and he decided to rebuild it approximately 700 m from the location of the old site. In 1776, the estate was sold on foreclosure and acquired by Christian Ditlev Lunn, a theologian who had turned to farming. After his death in 1812, the property was taken over by his son, Willars Knudsen Lunn, but slowly fell into a state of disrepair. It was finally decided to build a new main building, a project which was carried out by his son, Carl Frederik August, who had taken over management of the estate in 1846. The project also included a brickyard and an oven was constructed from 1856 to 1859. The new main building was designed by Vilhelm Dahlerup, then a young, unknown architect but later a prominent figure in Danish architecture. Construction took place from 1861 to 1862. Buildings Knabstrup is a three-winged building in Historicist style. The east wing of the old building was incorporated in the new house but redesigned to fit the two other wings. Building materials were re-used as far as possible, and the main wing has Baroque doors in from the old manor house. The widow seat Dorotheaslyst was built from 1799 to 1802 by Philip Lange, the son of Philip de Lange, and is listed. Horse breeding The Danish horse breed Knabstrupper is named after the estate where it was bred by Major V. Lunn in the early 19th century.

Before the change to salicylic acid, the two active ingredients in Vosene were coal tar and sulphusuccinated undecylenic monoalkanolamide. These chemicals were discovered to be carcinogenic, leading to their replacement with salicylic acid; therefore, what's now marketed as \\"original formula\\" Is not the same product.

The genus name comes directly from the Latin cicada meaning \\"buzzer\\", while the species name orni possibly comes from Fraxinus ornus (Manna Ash or South European Flowering Ash), where this cicada often lay its eggs deep in branches.  Description  The adults of Cicada orni reach approximately in length, with a wingspan of about . The cryptic coloration of the body varies from brown to gray. The abdomen has reddish segments and a silky pubescence. The head shows large and prominent eyes far apart on the sides, three small eyes (ocelli) located on the top, very short antennae and a long proboscis used for feeding on sap. The membranous front wings are transparent, with well-drawn veins and several characteristic black spots.  Habit  Singing of Cicada orni Adult cicadas can be encountered in summer feeding on sap from trees or shrubs, with their mouthparts well adapted for piercing and sucking. Only males produce their well-known calling song, a clicking sound caused by the contraction and relaxation of abdominal membranes (tymbal). This song has the function of sexual attraction for females. Usually males sing in aggregations of many individuals on sunny tree branches. When the males are approached by the females, the courtship takes place, in which cicadas repeatedly hug and touch each other with their legs. At the end of this process they mate in the same place. The adult cicadas lay their eggs in the summer, which will hatch in late summer or autumn. While their lifespan as adults lasts only about a month and a half for breeding, the larvae will live for several years underground, feeding on juices of plant roots.  Distribution  This species is one of the most common in southern and central Europe, in the Near East and in North Africa.

He worked for the advancement of human rights, education, and literacy. Background and education Rapoport was born in San Antonio, Texas. His father, David Rapoport, and mother, Riva Feldman, immigrated to the United States from Russia in the early 1900s. Rapoport's upbringing was very modest, and his father peddled blankets on the streets of San Antonio. Rapoport grew up during the Great Depression, and times for his family proved to be very hard. When Rapoport was 6 years old, his family was evicted from their home, and they continued to face financial difficulties through the Depression. Yet, throughout his youth, Rapoport felt they had much to be grateful for, including books and music. Rapoport valued his education, and worked his way through college at a jewelry store. He graduated from The University of Texas at Austin with a Bachelor of Arts in 1939. Rapoport met Audre Newman in January 1942, and they soon married. The couple lived in Wichita Falls, Texas, where Rapoport continued his work in jewelry sales. Rapoport was also a founding father of the Gamma Deuteron Chapter of the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity in 1939 at the University of Texas at Austin, where he is an esteemed alumnus. Career In 1949, the couple moved to San Antonio, and Rapoport began his career selling insurance with Pioneer American Insurance. He realized that he had a talent for selling insurance. By the end of 1949, he had opened his own Pioneer American Agency in Waco. In 1951, Harold Goodman, Audre's uncle, was impressed with Rapoport's success and introduced him to the idea of running American Income. American Income Life Insurance Company (hereafter referred to as \\"American Income Life,\\" \\"AIL,\\" or \\"The Company\\") was chartered as a mutual assessment association in Indiana with $25,000 of borrowed capital. It was reinsured through American Standard as a new mutual reserve company in March 1951. The Company's home offices were located in Indianapolis, Indiana. American Income Life originally sold low- cost hospital insurance plans. During its first year, The Company took in about $95,000 worth of premium income. The Company reached $1 million worth of insurance premiums in 1953. By 1954, AIL was receiving 6,000 insurance policy applications per month. In September 1954, with $200,000 in capital and $100,000 of surplus, Goodman and Rapoport formed a new company called American Income Life Insurance Company (AIL). American Income Life reinsured the policies of the original company and was transformed from a mutual reserve company to a stock company. American Standard, The Company's original insurer, was merged with American Income, and The Company acquired about $400,000 worth of premiums. Between 1954 and 1955, AIL's assets had doubled, its net reserve had tripled, its capital and surplus more than doubled, and it had about $15 million of insurance in force. In 1956, Rapoport desired to take the Indiana- based company national. He obtained a license in Ohio and opened a central office in Columbus. By the close of 1956, American Income Life was operating in 13 states with 300 sales personnel in the field operating out of 96 General Agencies. In March 1958, The Company's home offices were moved from Indianapolis, Indiana, to Waco, Texas, where Rapoport lived until his death. Philanthropy and politics Rapoport used his success to help others in need. With $46 million of his own money, he established the Bernard and Audre Rapoport Foundation in 1987, benefiting childcare, education, the Waco community, and other enterprises. Rapoport was appointed to a six-year term on the Board of Regents of The University of Texas System by Governor Ann Richards in 1991, serving as Chairman from 1993 until 1997. Rapoport was named by Fortune magazine as one of America's \\"40 most generous philanthropists,\\" unstinting in his support for education, social justice, and liberal political causes. He has been praised by political and social dignitaries such as Chet Edwards, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Senator Hillary Clinton, President Bill Clinton, and Senators Tom Daschle and Ted Kennedy. He also provided substantial support to The Texas Observer, the leading progressive/populist political magazine in the state. Throughout his life, and still through his foundation, Rapoport was an avid donor to the University of Texas. Rapoport was appointed by former President Bill Clinton as a member of the Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations (ACTPN). He was a member of the Library of Congress Trust Fund Board, National Hispanic University Trustee Emeritus, Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans, Economic Policy Institute, National Jobs For All Coalition, and the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies.

Golubkov published by the Russian Socialist Federation in 1918. The Russian Socialist Federation was a semi-autonomous American political organization which was part of the Socialist Party of America from 1915 until the split of the national organization into rival socialist and communist organizations in the summer of 1919. Elements of the Russian Socialist Federation became key components of both the Communist Party of America and the rival Communist Labor Party of America as \\"Russian Federations\\" within these organizations. Following the unification of these two groups in 1921, the resulting unified Russian Communist Federation gradually evolved into the so-called Russian Bureau of the Communist Party, USA. Organizational history=Early years Following the failure of the Russian Revolution of 1905, a large number of members and active supporters of the Russian Socialist Revolutionary Party and the Bolshevik and Menshevik wings of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party elected to follow the course of political emigration to America.Archibald E. Stevenson (ed.), Revolutionary Radicalism: Its History, Purpose and Tactics ... : Part 1: Revolutionary and Subversive Movements Abroad and at Home, Volume 1. Albany: J.B. Lyon Company, 1920; pg. 627. Hereafter: \\"Lusk Committee Report.\\" These politically minded individuals sought to form a political organization within the so-called \\"Russian colony\\" in America, with the initial intent of assisting the revolutionary movement in Russia which was working to overthrow the Tsarist regime of Nikolai Romanov. To this end, various branches of Russian-speaking revolutionary socialists began to be formed in those areas of the country with a significant √©migr√© population. The national organization uniting these local groups was known as the Russian Socialist Federation. The Russian Socialist Federation maintained its own daily newspaper called Novyi Mir (New World), published in New York.Surviving copies of this publication have been microfilmed by New York Public Library. The \\"legal\\" paper is complete from July 1917 to July 1919, plus issues from 1926, on four reels of film, master negative ZZAN-1079; the \\"illegal\\" paper dated April 1920 to May 1921, on a fifth reel, master negative ZZAN-22315. This paper was for a time edited by Nikolai Bukharin, later one of the top leaders of Soviet Russia after the Russian Revolution of 1917.

The paper's office was located \\"in a dingy hole at the rear of the cellar\\" at 77 St. Mark's Place. Admission to the Socialist Party of America The \\"Federation of Russian Branches\\" was admitted to the Socialist Party of America in May 1915, with party records indicating that the group had an average of 113 dues-paying members in its first year of affiliation.\\"Membership Report by States,\\" The American Socialist [Chicago], January 22, 1916, pg. 3. Impact of the Russian Revolution The Russian Revolution of 1917, marking the downfall of the tsarist state and its replacement by a revolutionary Marxist government headed by V.I. Lenin exerted an enormous impact on the √©migr√© community in the United States. A political party which touted just 11,000 members in May 1917 had effectively seized control of a great state, demonstrating to many adherents of socialism that a slow process of building a political organization and winning the support of a majority of the population was not strictly necessary.Draper, The Roots of American Communism, pg. 101. In the words of historian Theodore Draper: > \\"The supreme lesson seemed to be that a small party could seize power if > only it had enough revolutionary zeal and purity of doctrine. No > revolutionary group could guarantee numbers, but zeal and doctrine could be > had for the asking. Such was the infinitely optimistic horizon that the > Bolshevik revolution appeared to open up.\\"Draper, The Roots of American > Communism, pg. 102. Only a few months before the leader of the Red Army himself, Leon Trotsky, had been among the Russian √©migr√© community as a journalist in New York City, writing for the newspaper of the Russian Federation. Now he sat next to Lenin at the head of a dramatic revolution of world-historical importance. The speed and proximity of the transformation was shocking and its impact electrifying.Draper, The Roots of American Communism, pp. 102-103. Efforts to construct a unified revolutionary organization proceeded apace. The Marxists of the Russian Socialist Federation attempted to join with its populist and anarchist comrades in a unified organization through a convention of the United Russian parties held in New York City from February 1 to 4, 1918.Stevenson (ed.), Lusk Committee Report, vol. 1, pg. 636. Socialist Gregory Weinstein ‚Äî editor of Novyi Mir and later a founding member of the Communist Labor Party of America ‚Äî was elected chairman of the session. The gathering sent a cable to the Council of People's Commissars in Moscow sending greetings to revolutionary Russia and indicating that they were \\"ready to organize Revolutionary Legions for Russia.\\" The Russian Federation was also instrumental in the formation of the American Bolshevik Bureau of Information early in 1918, uniting with four other Russian groups as well as the English- speaking Socialist Propaganda League.Draper, The Roots of American Communism, pg. 107. Nicholas Hourwich represented the Russian Federation on this body, being joined by Soviet Russian representative Ludwig Martens as the delegate of the \\"New York Section of Russian Bolsheviki\\" and S.J. Rutgers of the Socialist Propaganda League. The Bureau, which served as a forerunner of the official Russian Soviet Government Bureau, was headed by Louis C. Fraina. The Russian Socialist Federation held its 4th National Convention in New York City from September 28 through October 2, 1918. The gathering elected future Communist Party of America stalwarts Oscar Tyverovsky was elected Secretary of the Russian Federation and Alexander Stoklitsky as \\"Translator-Secretary,\\" a functionary of the national Socialist Party of America with an office at party headquarters in Chicago.Russian Socialist Federation, \\"Minutes of the 4th Convention of the Russian Socialist Federation: New York City ‚Äî Sept. 28 to Oct. 2, 1918.\\" Corvallis, OR: 1000 Flowers Publishing, 2007; pg. 5. The gathering also determined to convene a gathering of the various language groups associated with the former Russian empire ‚Äî Lithuanian, Latvian, Ukrainian, Jewish, and Polish, in addition to the Russian ‚Äî in order \\"to effect unity of action of all Russian Federations and organizations by one united center.\\"Russian Socialist Federation, \\"Minutes of the 4th Convention,\\" pg. 7. This unification of various language federations under the aegis of the Russian Socialist Federation was soon to have repercussions, accelerating development of a split of the Socialist Party between its revolutionary Left Wing and the electorally oriented individuals who had long dominated the party apparatus. The split of 1919 During the first two months of 1919 a concrete Left Wing Section established itself within the ranks of the Socialist Party of America (SPA). Inspired by the November 1917 Bolshevik Revolution in Russia and disgruntled over the largely ineffectual Socialist Party electoral campaign of 1918, this group began to unite around the February 1919 elections of members of the 15 member National Executive Committee which governed the SPA. A programmatic document called the Left Wing Manifesto, written by a committee in New York and thoroughly revised by Louis Fraina, began to be circulated among locals and branches of the Socialist Party for their approval. A new weekly publication called The Revolutionary Age, edited in Boston by Louis Fraina, was established to advance the Left Wing cause. In April 1919, the Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party of Local New York established yet another weekly newspaper called The New York Communist.The complete 10 issue run of The New York Communist was reissued in book form as well as microfilm by Greenwood Reprint Corp., Westport, CT, in 1970. Historian James Weinstein wrote the introduction for this reprint, a contribution which was included in Greenwood's two-volume The American Radical Press, 1880-1960, Joseph R. Conklin, ed., v. 1, pp. 145-154. The foreign language federations of the Socialist Labor Party, led in the first place by the Russian Federation, were among the leaders of this drive to \\"capture\\" the Socialist Party for revolutionary socialism. Language branches of the unified \\"Russian Federations\\" often delivered their votes en bloc for slates of candidates in each of the Socialist Party's five regional electoral districts, allowing the candidates approved by the Left Wing to garner sufficient votes for election to a majority of the 15 seats on the NEC. The outgoing National Executive Committee, dominated by older and more cautious adherents of the Socialist Party's traditional electoral approach to the winning of state power, were not about to surrender without a fight, however. A cry of election fraud was raised, culminating with the June 1919 suspension of seven of the party's language federations and the annulment of the 1919 election pending the decision of an August 1919 Emergency National Convention of the party.

It will consist of a weir, a lock, a small hydropower station and two fish ladders.  Purpose  The Dƒõƒç√≠n weir is part of Czech attempts to improve navigation on the Elbe by increasing the regulation of flow. The declared aim is a draught of at least 140 cm on ca. 345 days per year.  Controversy  Opponents of the project question whether a measurable economic benefit can be achieved, since the navigability of the Elbe is also limited below the site by weather-driven interruptions. Thus is also concern that the Dƒõƒç√≠n weir will raise the pressure on Germany to establish similar structures on its section of the Elbe. The project has also been criticised for its impact on the environment and on landscape and flood protection and, since 2000, there have been many objections, especially on the German side.aus einem Blog of 2001: ‚ÄûStaustufe ‚ÄöProst≈ôedn√≠ ≈Ωleb‚Äò bei km 99 ‚Äì inmitten des Landschaftsschutzgebietes ‚ÄûElbesandsteine‚Äú [...].

Epworth Rectory haunting The Epworth Rectory haunting also known as the \\"Wesley poltergeist\\" is one of the best-known English poltergeist claims. From December 1716 until January 1717, it is said to have been plagued by a series of regularly occurring mysterious loud noises and knockings, apparently caused by a ghost the eldest Wesley daughter Hetty nicknamed \\"Old Jeffrey\\", who made his presence known to all on Christmas Day 1716. In Mrs. Wesley's words, \\"there was such a noise in the room over our heads, as if several people were walking, then running up and down stairs that we thought the children would be frightened\\". According to the tale, as she and her husband searched the house in vain for the culprit, Old Jeffrey continued \\"rattling and thundering in every room, and even blowing an invisible horn at deafening decibels\\". \\"Old Jeffrey\\" supposedly disappeared in January 1717 just as suddenly as he had appeared. Addington Bruce (1908) noted that the earliest records that document the haunting have large discrepancies from later reports. According to Bruce the original records from the 18th century reduce the \\"haunting\\" to nothing more than some alleged creaking noises, knocks, footsteps or groaning sounds. Bruce commented that \\"we are, therefore, justified in believing that in this case, like so many others of its kind, the fallibility of human memory has played an overwhelming part in exaggerating the experiences actually undergone.\\" He suggested that Hetty had produced the phenomena fraudulently.Bruce, Addington.

Miner Like many members the Mistri community of Kutch to which he belonged, he owned coal mine named Rajapur Colliery near Jharia, which he held in partnership with Manji Jeram Rathod of Madhapar.Jagmal Raja Rai Bahadur (Rajapore Colliery) Jharia Indian export directory: with foreign section, Volume 4, 1965. Colliries and Coal Merchants Page 19 and 48 He entered into coal mining business purchasing the mines in 1913 from one Gujarati miner, Bhawan Kara of Balambha. His partner in coal mines, Manji Jeram died in 1954, however, he carried on his mining business till 1970, when he sold his mine just one year before nationalisation of coal mines in India. He owned Silica mines at Bargad in Shankargarh, the produce of which was used by the glass factories owned by him. Bus transport In 1945, Cutch State started its own passenger bus service. Jagmal Raja was quick to capitalise on this opportunity and took on contract the Bhuj- Anjar ‚Äì Mundra bus route, which he operated till 1948, when Cutch merged into Union of India. Banker He worked as a private banker from Jharia with his trusted partner Manji Jeram Rathod of Madhapar and used to give loans and funding especially for coal mines business. \` Insurance He was also one of the promoters and directors of an insurance company named Indian Globe Insurance Company started in 1929INDIAN GLOBE INSURANCE COMPANY LIMITED and he also owned a finance company Paper Mills & Other Ventures Among his other industrial venture were a paper board factory at Dahanu named Dahanu Straw Boards, an aromatics unit named Hindustan Aromatics, ice factory, cold storage & export business. He also ventured into packaged food and pickle export business.

He was the only person from any community of Kutch, who had the privilege of being ADC to Maharao Khengarji III. Sir Maharao Khengarji, as a mark of their friendship, honoured Jagmal Raja, by his presence, when Degree of Engineering was conferred upon him in London. He was among few persons, who was given permission by Khengarji III to hold a car in Cutch State. Apart from Maharao of Cutch, he held friendly relations with Viceroy Lord Irwin, Raja of Shankargarh, Jam of Rajkot, Jam Sahib of Jamnagar, Rana of Nepal and Raja of Rewa. He built numerous railway lines and railway bridges and was pioneer in glass & ceramic industry of India, for which he was given title of Rao Bahadur in 1924 at a function held in Shimla, summer Capital of British India by Viceroy of India, The Earl of Reading.

Background In the last decade, financial networks have attracted more attention from the research community. A study on company ownership based network showed a power law distribution with majority of companies controlled by small number of people. Another study focused on board of directors where the network was created between companies if represented by the same member on board. The board membership network thus created resulted in a power law with small number of board members representing large number of companies. Several studies have proposed network based models for studying the stock correlation network.Vandewalle, N. Brisbois, F. and Tordoir, X. (2001). Self-organized critical topology of stock markets. Quantit. Finan(1): 372‚Äì375 Stock correlation network has proven its efficacy in predicting market movements. Chakrabortia and Onella showed that the average distance between the stocks can be a significant indicator of market dynamics. Their work focused on stock market (1985‚Äì1990) that included the stock market crash of 1987 (Black Monday). Andrew Lo and Khandaniy worked on the network of different hedge funds and observed the patterns before the August 2007 stock market turbulence.Andrew W. Lo Amir E. Khandaniy. (2007). What happened to the quants in August 2007? Preprint. Methods The basic approach for building the stock correlation network involves two steps. The first step aims at finding the correlation between each pair of stock considering their corresponding time series. The second step applies a criterion to connect the stocks based on their correlation. The popular method for connecting two correlated stocks is the minimum spanning tree method. The other methods are, planar maximally filtered graph, and winner take all method. In all three methods, the procedure for finding correlation between stocks remains the same. Step 1: Select the desired time series data. The time series data can be daily closing prices, daily trading volumes, daily opening prices, and daily price returns. Step 2: For a particular time series selected from step 1, find the cross correlation for each pair of stocks using the cross correlation formula. Step 3: Compute the cross correlation for all the stocks and create a cross correlation matrix Cij. The cross correlation is between stock i and stock j and their time series data is free of time delays. Step 4: In case of the minimum spanning tree method a metric distance dij is calculated using the cross correlation matrix. dij= (2(1-Cij))^{0.5} Where dij is the edge distance between stock i and stock j. The minimum spanning tree and planar maximally filtered graph may cause loss of information, i.e., some high correlated nodes are discarded and low correlated nodes are retained because of the topological reduction criteria. Tse, et al. introduced the winner take all connection criterion where in the drawback of minimum spanning tree and planar maximally filtered graph are eliminated. In winner take all method, step 1-3 are retained. However in step 4 the nodes are linked based on a threshold. Cij Œª The threshold values (Œª) can be set between 0 and 1. Tse, et al. showed that for large values of threshold (0.7, 0.8, and 0.9) the stock correlation networks are scale free where the nodes linked in a manner that their degree distribution follows a power law. For small values of threshold, the network tends to be fully connected and does not exhibit scale free distribution.

Project background An Oral History of British Science is collecting 200 audio interviews, each 8 to 15 hours in length, with scientists, engineers and others linked with science and technology in Britain, as well as shorter on-location video recordings. The project is split into four themed strands: Made in Britain, A Changing Planet, Cosmologies and Biomedicine. Importantly, the project seeks to identify lesser-heard voices, for example women scientists, laboratory technicians, and engineers.Blyth, Tilly (2010), ‚ÄòIntroducing An Oral History of British Science‚Äô, Tilly Blyth, National Life Stories Review and Accounts 2009/2010, p.22' The project Advisory Committee, which meets at least three times a year to discuss progress and to advise on future direction, comprises Dr Jon Agar, Lord Alec Broers, Dr Tilly Blyth, Georgina Ferry, Professor Dame Julia Higgins, Dr Maja Kominko, Sir Harry Kroto, John Lynch, Professor Chris Rapley and Dr Simone Turchetti. An Oral History of British Science is conducted by National Life Stories at the British Library, and forms part of a wider institutional initiative to better document contemporary history of science and technology through the addition of audio visual sources as well as written sources.An Oral History of British Science project proposal, British Library, p.3 National Life Stories, a charitable trust and limited company within the British Library, was established by Paul Thompson (oral historian) and Jennifer Wingate in 1987 to capture the life stories of British people whose experiences would not otherwise be recorded. Since then NLS has recorded over 2,200 interviews totalling some 22,000 hours, all of them accessible at the British Library. Other NLS projects focus on the lives of visual artists, authors, craftspeople, architects, those involved in the UK water industry, and key individuals connected to social welfare, social policy and charity work. Previous NLS projects focused on the British fashion industry, the post office, the steel and oil industries, Jewish experiences in Britain, the British press, and those involved in the UK food industry, from production to consumption.National Life Stories  The case for the project  Despite a significant oral history tradition in science studies in other countries, the field in Britain is not well developed. In April 2005 NLS hosted an exploratory roundtable conference at the British Library. Chaired by Sir Nicholas Goodison, ‚ÄòPersonal Testimonies of Contemporary Science, Technology and Medicine‚Äô was attended by representatives of the UK‚Äôs leading history of science archives and libraries, and distinguished researchers. The meeting concluded that very few scientific testimonies were held collectively and that a major programme of recording needed to be initiated to capture rich personal memory not available in any printed or manuscript sources. Following this, NLS commissioned a mapping and scoping study, 'The Oral History of Science in Britain: A Scoping Study'. The study confirmed that there were currently very few oral history collections in Britain looking specifically at professionals working in science and technology; that those projects that were developed in the past were short-lived and narrow in scope; and that many of these recordings are not properly archived or publicly accessible. The scoping study found one exception, which was that the history of medicine seemed to be better documented through oral history than other fields of science and technology.'The Oral History of Science in Britain: A Scoping Study' (Dr Simone Turchetti, Centre for the History of Science, Technology and Medicine, University of Manchester for NLS, September 2007)  Methodology  An Oral History of British Science follows the biographical, or life story, oral history approach with each audio interview averaging 8 to 15 hours in length. This biographical approach is valuable for researchers seeking a more rounded view of an individual and their contribution. The interviews cover the individual‚Äôs career history, education, background and family. In addition to the life story audio interviews a number of supplementary, follow-up video interviews are being conducted; these focus on particular instrumentation, specific geographical settings or key turning points in a scientist‚Äôs career.

Two chief points are explored: how, when and why the Earth has become a subject of scientific investigation; and how this investigation has been pivotal to the rise of concerns about the impact of humans on the environments. Those interviewed for the strand are those involved in the earth sciences: climatologists, meteorologists, geologists, geophysicists, geochemists, ecologists, glaciologists and oceanographers. ‚ÄòMade in Britain‚Äô examines important discoveries in science and technology that have led to new industrial applications. The strand covers computing, aerospace engineering, some applied sciences (such as condensed matter physics) as well as engineering fields (chemical, electrical, civil and structural). The title refers to the fact that an analysis of these breakthroughs in science should also be looked at as something that has boosted national pride, while arising from research conducted by experts of different ethnic backgrounds. ‚ÄòBiomedicine‚Äô aims to investigate the transformations that have typified biomedicine, paying special attention to how new technologies have changed medical practices and provided a new understanding of biological objects. This strand investigates the industrialisation of the processes of treatment and cure, as well as the idea that these processes can be engineered. Advances in genetic engineering are central to this study, especially in relation to the rise of ‚Äòbig Pharma‚Äô.

It was originally a facility for timber rafting. There are boat rides on the reservoir today during the summer months. At the boat landing point the water depth is 1 metre; by the dam it is 4 metres. The water temperature rarely climbs above 8 ¬∞C in summer. In the winter months, during when there are no boat trips, the water is not impounded and the Kirnitzsch flows in its original river bed.  History  As early as the 16th century the Kirnitzsch was being used for the rafting of timber. The growing consumption of timber meant that the Kirnitzsch had to be upgraded into a timber rafting river. In order to ensure the necessary quantity of water was available, rafting ponds and barrages were built. These included the Obere and Niedere Schleuse (\\"Upper and Lower Locks\\"), which have the largest dams in Saxon Switzerland. In 1567, on the direction of Elector August of Saxony, a wooden dam was built. This served to collect logs from the hinterland of Saxon Switzerland and enable their assembly into rafts. In the years 1816/17 this wooden structure was replaced by a stone dam. By opening the gates in the dam wall a flume of water was released that enabled the rafting of logs up to 11 metres long down to the River Elbe. Using the rafter's footpath or Fl√∂√üersteig, which ran alongside the Kirnitzsch, rafters could accompany the logs. In 1931 a 7-metre-high dam was built that is protected nowadays as an industrial monument. The reservoir of the Obere Schleuse is between 80 centimetres (at the boat station) and 4 metres (at the dam) deep. The Obere Schleuse has been used by the Saxonia Mountain Club (Gebirgsverein Saxonia) for boating since 1879. On 25 May 1879, with the support of Senior Forester (Oberf√∂rster) Schlegel and the population of Hinterhermsdorf, the first boat was launched on the Obere Schleuse. It was a 16 hundredweight oak boat named the \\"Saxonia\\". With the advent of boating the number of visitors soared. The following year a second boat was added and, in 1881, the mountain club had a hut built and the boatman was able to offer summer-fresh (\\"Sommerfrischlern\\") food and drink. In 1894 boating attracted over 10,000 guests. During the First and Second World Wars, boating operations were cancelled. The mountain club were responsible for the dam and reservoir before the Second World War but this responsibility was taken over in 1952 by the parish of Hinterhermsdorf. But timber rafting on the Kirnitzsch continued until 1964. Only then did the Obere Schleuse become exclusively used for tourism. Boat trips, lasting roughly 20 minutes long, are possible every year from Easter to the end of October. Passengers learn about the Schleuse during the boat trip as well about local animals and plants. In 2009 these boat trips carried 55,000 passengers.S√§chsische Zeitung (Ausgabe Pirna) date 26 January 2010  Flora  The shady, cool and moist gorge is characterised by dark spruce forest and some of the spruce trees are very tall and old. One of Germany's tallest trees, a 59.30 m Norway spruce can be found there. In addition, numerous ferns, mosses and lichens grow here. By contrast, open heathland and pine forest grow on the dry, sunny heights above the valley.

She lived in Manchester when operating exclusively within Dubstar, but lives and works in London as of 2015. In Dubstar Formerly known as The Joans, Dubstar were initially a two-piece band, with Chris Wilkie playing guitar and Steve Hillier singing and playing keyboards. Sarah Blackwood was invited to join the band in August 1993. Blackwood replaced Hillier on vocals in early 1994, though Hillier remained a key member of the group. The band released three albums with Blackwood on vocals: Disgraceful (1995), Goodbye (1997) and Make It Better (2000). A compilation, Stars: The Best of Dubstar was released in 2004. \\"Stars\\" remains the best known single from the band.

A filter bubble, therefore, can cause users to get significantly less contact with contradicting viewpoints, causing the user to become intellectually isolated....\\" that allegedly can result from personalized searches when a website algorithm selectively guesses what information a user would like to see based on information about the user, such as location, past click-behavior and search history.Web bug (slang)Website visitor tracking As a result, users become separated from information that disagrees with their viewpoints, effectively isolating them in their own cultural or ideological bubbles.Huffington Post, The Huffington Post \\"Are Filter-bubbles Shrinking Our Minds?\\" The choices made by these algorithms are not transparent. Prime examples include Google Personalized Search results and Facebook's personalized news-stream. The bubble effect may have negative implications for civic discourse, according to Pariser, but contrasting views regard the effect as minimal and addressable. The results of the U.S. presidential election in 2016 have been associated with the influence of social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, and as a result have called into question the effects of the \\"filter bubble\\" phenomenon on user exposure to fake news and echo chambers, spurring new interest in the term, with many concerned that the phenomenon may harm democracy and well-being by making the effects of misinformation worse. Concept Social media, seeking to please users, can shunt information that they guess their users will like hearing, but inadvertently isolate what they know into their own filter bubbles, according to Pariser. The term was coined by internet activist Eli Pariser circa 2010 and discussed in his 2011 book of the same name; according to Pariser, users get less exposure to conflicting viewpoints and are isolated intellectually in their own informational bubble. He related an example in which one user searched Google for \\"BP\\" and got investment news about British Petroleum, while another searcher got information about the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and noted that the two search results pages were \\"strikingly different\\". Pariser defined his concept of a filter bubble in more formal terms as \\"that personal ecosystem of information that's been catered by these algorithms\\". An internet user's past browsing and search history is built up over time when they indicate interest in topics by \\"clicking links, viewing friends, putting movies in [their] queue, reading news stories\\", and so forth. An internet firm then uses this information to target advertising to the user, or make certain types of information appear more prominently in search results pages. This process is not random, as it operates under a three-step process, per Pariser, who states, \\"First, you figure out who people are and what they like. Then, you provide them with content and services that best fit them. Finally, you tune to get the fit just right. Your identity shapes your media.\\" Pariser also reports: Accessing the data of link clicks displayed through site traffic measurements determine that filter bubbles can be collective or individual. As of 2011, one engineer had told Pariser that Google looked at 57 different pieces of data to personally tailor a user's search results, including non-cookie data such as the type of computer being used and the user's physical location. Other terms have been used to describe this phenomenon, including \\"ideological frames\\" and \\"the figurative sphere surrounding you as you search the internet\\". A related term, \\"echo chamber\\", was originally applied to news media, but is now applied to social media as well. Pariser's idea of the filter bubble was popularized after the TED talk he gave in May 2011, in which he gives examples of how filter bubbles work and where they can be seen. In a test seeking to demonstrate the filter bubble effect, Pariser asked several friends to search for the word \\"Egypt\\" on Google and send him the results. Comparing two of the friends' first pages of results, while there was overlap between them on topics like news and travel, one friend's results prominently included links to information on the then- ongoing Egyptian revolution of 2011, while the other friend's first page of results did not include such links. In The Filter Bubble, Pariser warns that a potential downside to filtered searching is that it \\"closes us off to new ideas, subjects, and important information\\", and \\"creates the impression that our narrow self-interest is all that exists\\". It is potentially harmful to both individuals and society, in his view. He criticized Google and Facebook for offering users \\"too much candy, and not enough carrots\\". He warned that \\"invisible algorithmic editing of the web\\" may limit our exposure to new information and narrow our outlook. According to Pariser, the detrimental effects of filter bubbles include harm to the general society in the sense that they have the possibility of \\"undermining civic discourse\\" and making people more vulnerable to \\"propaganda and manipulation\\". He wrote: Many people are unaware that filter bubbles even exist. This can be seen in an article on The Guardian, which mentioned the fact that \\"more than 60% of Facebook users are entirely unaware of any curation on Facebook at all, believing instead that every single story from their friends and followed pages appeared in their news feed.\\" A brief explanation for how Facebook decides what goes on a user's news feed is through an algorithm which takes into account \\"how you have interacted with similar posts in the past.\\" A filter bubble has been described as exacerbating a phenomenon that has been called splinternet or cyberbalkanization,The term cyber-balkanization (sometimes with a hyphen) is a hybrid of cyber, relating to the internet, and Balkanization, referring to that region of Europe that was historically subdivided by languages, religions and cultures; the term was coined in a paper by MIT researchers Van Alstyne and Brynjolfsson. which happens when the internet becomes divided up into sub- groups of like-minded people who become insulated within their own online community and fail to get exposure to different views. This concern dates back to the early days of the publicly accessible internet, with the term \\"cyberbalkanization\\" being coined in 1996. Similar concepts In news media, echo chamber is a metaphorical description of a situation in which beliefs are amplified or reinforced by communication and repetition inside a closed system. By visiting an \\"echo chamber\\", people are able to seek out information which reinforces their existing views, potentially as an unconscious exercise of confirmation bias. This may increase political and social polarization and extremism. The term is a metaphor based on the acoustic echo chamber, where sounds reverberate in a hollow enclosure. \\"Echo chambers\\" reinforce an individuals beliefs without factual support. They are surrounded by those who acknowledge and follow the same viewpoints. Barack Obama's farewell address identified a similar concept to filter bubbles as a \\"threat to [Americans'] democracy\\", i.e., the \\"retreat into our own bubbles, ...especially our social media feeds, surrounded by people who look like us and share the same political outlook and never challenge our assumptions... And increasingly we become so secure in our bubbles that we start accepting only information, whether it's true or not, that fits our opinions, instead of basing our opinions on the evidence that is out there.\\" Reactions and studies= Media reactions  There are conflicting reports about the extent to which personalized filtering is happening and whether such activity is beneficial or harmful. Analyst Jacob Weisberg, writing in June 2011 for Slate, did a small non-scientific experiment to test Pariser's theory which involved five associates with different ideological backgrounds conducting a series of searches, \\"John Boehner\\", \\"Barney Frank\\", \\"Ryan plan\\", and \\"Obamacare\\", and sending Weisberg screenshots of their results. The results varied only in minor respects from person to person, and any differences did not appear to be ideology-related, leading Weisberg to conclude that a filter bubble was not in effect, and to write that the idea that most internet users were \\"feeding at the trough of a Daily Me\\" was overblown. Weisberg asked Google to comment, and a spokesperson stated that algorithms were in place to deliberately \\"limit personalization and promote variety\\". Book reviewer Paul Boutin did a similar experiment to Weisberg's among people with differing search histories, and again found that the different searchers received nearly identical search results. Interviewing programmers at Google off the record journalist Per Grankvist found that user data used to play a bigger role in determining search results but that Google, through testing, found that the search query is by far the best determinator on what results to display. There are reports that Google and other sites maintain vast \\"dossiers\\" of information on their users which might enable them to further personalize individual internet experiences if they chose to do so. For instance, the technology exists for Google to keep track of users' past histories even if they don't have a personal Google account or are not logged into one. One report stated that Google had collected \\"10 years' worth\\" of information amassed from varying sources, such as Gmail, Google Maps, and other services besides its search engine, although a contrary report was that trying to personalize the internet for each user was technically challenging for an internet firm to achieve despite the huge amounts of available data. Analyst Doug Gross of CNN suggested that filtered searching seemed to be more helpful for consumers than for citizens, and would help a consumer looking for \\"pizza\\" find local delivery options based on a personalized search and appropriately filter out distant pizza stores. Organizations such as the Washington Post, The New York Times, and others have experimented with creating new personalized information services, with the aim of tailoring search results to those that users are likely to like or agree with.  Academia studies and reactions  In 'The Big Data Public and Its Problems', Tauel Harper suggests that the loss of the editorial subsidy actually produces a more homogenised and normalised public sphere than traditional print media{Cite journallast=Harperfirst=Taueldate=2017title=The big data public and its problemsurl=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1461444816642167journal=New Media & Societyvolume=19issue=9https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444816642167}}. The process of salience selection, the law of large numbers and the power of pre-existing networks means that algorithmic selections tend to solidify norms and further marginalise difference in digital publics. A scientific study from Wharton that analyzed personalized recommendations also found that these filters can actually create commonality, not fragmentation, in online music taste. Consumers reportedly use the filters to expand their taste rather than to limit it. Harvard law professor Jonathan Zittrain disputed the extent to which personalization filters distort Google search results, saying that \\"the effects of search personalization have been light\\". Further, Google provides the ability for users to shut off personalization features if they choose, by deleting Google's record of their search history and setting Google to not remember their search keywords and visited links in the future. A study from Internet Policy Review addressed the lack of a clear and testable definition for filter bubbles across disciplines; this often results in researchers defining and studying filter bubbles in different ways. Subsequently, the study explained a lack of empirical data for the existence of filter bubbles across disciplines and suggested that the effects attributed to them may stem more from preexisting ideological biases than from algorithms. Similar views can be found in other academic projects which also address concerns with the definitions of filter bubbles and the relationships between ideological and technological factors associated with them. A study by researchers from Oxford, Stanford, and Microsoft examined the browsing histories of 1.2 million U.S. users of the Bing Toolbar add-on for Internet Explorer between March and May 2013. They selected 50,000 of those users who were active consumers of news, then classified whether the news outlets they visited were left- or right-leaning, based on whether the majority of voters in the counties associated with user IP addresses voted for Obama or Romney in the 2012 presidential election. They then identified whether news stories were read after accessing the publisher's site directly, via the Google News aggregation service, via web searches, or via social media. The researchers found that while web searches and social media do contribute to ideological segregation, the vast majority of online news consumption consisted of users directly visiting left- or right-leaning mainstream news sites, and consequently being exposed almost exclusively to views from a single side of the political spectrum. Limitations of the study included selection issues such as Internet Explorer users skewing higher in age than the general internet population; Bing Toolbar usage and the voluntary (or unknowing) sharing of browsing history selecting for users who are less concerned about privacy; the assumption that all stories in left-leaning publications are left-leaning, and the same for right-leaning; and the possibility that users who are not active news consumers may get most of their news via social media, and thus experience stronger effects of social or algorithmic bias than those users who essentially self-select their bias through their choice of news publications (assuming they are aware of the publications' biases).  Platform studies  While algorithms do limit political diversity, some of the filter bubble is the result of user choice. A study by data scientists at Facebook found that for every four Facebook friends that share ideology, users have one friend with contrasting views. No matter what Facebook's algorithm for its News Feed is, people are simply more likely to befriend/follow people who share similar beliefs. The nature of the algorithm is that it ranks stories based on a user's history, resulting in a reduction of the \\"politically cross- cutting content by 5 percent for conservatives and 8 percent for liberals\\". However, even when people are given the option to click on a link offering contrasting views, they still default to their most viewed sources. \\"[U]ser choice decreases the likelihood of clicking on a cross-cutting link by 17 percent for conservatives and 6 percent for liberals.\\" A cross-cutting link is one that introduces a different point of view than the user's presumed point of view, or what the website has pegged as the user's beliefs. A recent study from Levi Boxell, Matthew Gentzkow, and Jesse M. Shapiro suggests that online media isn't the driving force for political polarization. The paper argues that polarization has been driven by the demographic groups that spend the least time online. The greatest ideological divide is experienced amongst Americans older than 75, while only 20% reported using social media as of 2012. In contrast, 80% of Americans aged 18‚Äì39 reported using social media as of 2012. The data suggests that the younger demographic isn't any more polarized in 2012 than it had been when online media barely existed in 1996. The study highlights differences between age groups and how news consumption remains polarized as people seek information that appeals to their preconceptions. Older Americans usually remain stagnant in their political views as traditional media outlets continue to be a primary source of news while online media is the leading source for the younger demographic. Although algorithms and filter bubbles weaken content diversity, this study reveals that political polarization trends are primarily driven by pre-existing views and failure to recognize outside sources. A 2020 study from Germany utilized the Big Five Psychology model to test the effects of individual personality, demographics, and ideologies on user news consumption. Basing their study on the notion that the number of news sources that users consume impacts their likelihood to be caught in a filter bubble‚Äîwith higher media diversity lessening the chances‚Äîtheir results suggest that certain demographics (higher age and male) along with certain personality traits (high openness) correlate positively with number of news sources consumed by individuals. The study also found a negative ideological association between media diversity and the degree to which users align with right-wing authoritarianism. Beyond offering different individual user factors that may influence the role of user choice, this study also raises questions and associations between the likelihood of users being caught in filter bubbles and user voting behavior. The Facebook study found that it was \\"inconclusive\\" whether or not the algorithm played as big a role in filtering News Feeds as people assumed. The study also found that \\"individual choice\\", or confirmation bias, likewise affected what gets filtered out of News Feeds. Some social scientists criticized this conclusion though, because the point of protesting the filter bubble is that the algorithms and individual choice work together to filter out News Feeds. They also criticized Facebook's small sample size, which is about \\"9% of actual Facebook users\\", and the fact that the study results are \\"not reproducible\\" due to the fact that the study was conducted by \\"Facebook scientists\\" who had access to data that Facebook does not make available to outside researchers. Though the study found that only about 15‚Äì20% of the average user's Facebook friends subscribe to the opposite side of the political spectrum, Julia Kaman from Vox theorized that this could have potentially positive implications for viewpoint diversity. These \\"friends\\" are often acquaintances with whom we would not likely share our politics without the internet. Facebook may foster a unique environment where a user sees and possibly interacts with content posted or re-posted by these \\"second-tier\\" friends. The study found that \\"24 percent of the news items liberals saw were conservative-leaning and 38 percent of the news conservatives saw was liberal-leaning.\\" \\"Liberals tend to be connected to fewer friends who share information from the other side, compared with their conservative counterparts.\\" This interplay has the ability to provide diverse information and sources that could moderate users' views. Similarly, a study of Twitter's filter bubbles by New York University concluded that \\"Individuals now have access to a wider span of viewpoints about news events, and most of this information is not coming through the traditional channels, but either directly from political actors or through their friends and relatives. Furthermore, the interactive nature of social media creates opportunities for individuals to discuss political events with their peers, including those with whom they have weak social ties\\". According to these studies, social media may be diversifying information and opinions users come into contact with, though there is much speculation around filter bubbles and their ability to create deeper political polarization. Visualization of the process and growth of two social media bots used in the 2019 Weibo study. The diagrams represent two aspects of the structure of filter bubbles, according to the study: large concentrations of users around single topics and a uni-directional, star-like structure that impacts key information flows. Social bots have been utilized by different researchers to test polarization and related effects that are attributed to filter bubbles and echo chambers. A 2018 study used social bots on Twitter to test deliberate user exposure to partisan viewpoints. The study claimed it demonstrated partisan differences between exposure to differing views, although it warned that the findings should be limited to party-registered American Twitter users. One of the main findings was that after exposure to differing views (provided by the bots) self-registered republicans became more conservative, whereas self-registered liberals showed less ideological change, if none at all. A different study from The People's Republic of China utilized social bots on Weibo‚Äìthe largest social media platform in China‚Äìto examine the structure of filter bubbles in regards to their effects on polarization. The study draws a distinction between two conceptions of polarization. One being where people with similar views form groups, share similar opinions, and block themselves from differing viewpoints (opinion polarization) and the other being where people do not access diverse content and sources of information (information polarization). By utilizing social bots instead of human volunteers and focusing more on information polarization rather than opinion- based, the researchers concluded that there are two essential elements of a filter bubble: a large concentration of users around a single topic and a uni- directional, star-like structure that impacts key information flows. In June 2018, the platform DuckDuckGo conducted a research study on the Google Web Browser Platform. For this study, 87 adults in various locations around the continental United States googled three key words at the exact same time: immigration, gun control, and vaccinations. Even when in private browsing mode, most people saw results unique to them. Google included certain links for some that it did not include for other participants, and the News and Videos infoboxes showed significant variation. Google publicly disputed these results saying that Search Engine Results Page (SERP) personalization is mostly a myth. Google Search Liaison, Danny Sullivan, stated that ‚ÄúOver the years, a myth has developed that Google Search personalizes so much that for the same query, different people might get significantly different results from each other. This isn‚Äôt the case. Results can differ, but usually for non- personalized reasons.‚Äù When filter bubbles are in place they can create specific moments that scientists call 'Whoa' moments. A 'Whoa' moment is when an article, ad, post, etc. appears on your computer that is in relation to a current action or current use of an object. Scientists discovered this term after a young woman was performing her daily routine, which included drinking coffee, when she opened her computer and noticed an advertisement for the same brand of coffee that she was drinking. \\"Sat down and opened up Facebook this morning while having my coffee, and there they were two ads for Nespresso. Kind of a 'whoa' moment when the product you're drinking pops up on the screen in front of you.\\" \\"Whoa\\" moments occur when people are \\"found\\". Which means advertisement algorithms target specific users based on their \\"click behavior\\" in order to increase their sale revenue. \\"Whoa\\" moments can also ignite discipline in users to stick to a routine and commonality with a product. Several designers have developed tools to counteract the effects of filter bubbles (see ). Swiss radio station SRF voted the word filterblase (the German translation of filter bubble) word of the year 2016. Counter measures=By individuals In The Filter Bubble: What the Internet Is Hiding from You, internet activist Eli Pariser highlights how the increasing occurrence of filter bubbles further emphasizes the value of one's bridging social capital as defined by Robert Putman. Indeed, while bonding capital corresponds on the one hand to the establishment of strong ties between like-minded people, thus reinforcing some sense of social homogeneity, bridging social capital on the other hand represents the creation of weak ties between people with potentially diverging interests and viewpoints, hence introducing significantly more heterogeneity. In that sense, high bridging capital is much more likely to promote social inclusion by increasing our exposure to a space where we address the problems that transcend our niches and narrow self interests. Fostering one's bridging capital ‚Äì for example by connecting with more people in an informal setting ‚Äì can therefore be an effective way to reduce the influence of the filter bubble phenomenon. Users can in fact take many actions to burst through their filter bubbles, for example by making a conscious effort to evaluate what information they are exposing themselves to, and by thinking critically about whether they are engaging with a broad range of content. This view argues that users should change the psychology of how they approach media, rather than relying on technology to counteract their biases. Users can consciously avoid news sources that are unverifiable or weak. Chris Glushko, the VP of Marketing at IAB, advocates using fact-checking sites to identify fake news. Technology can also play a valuable role in combating filter bubbles. Websites such as allsides.com,theflipside.io, hifromtheotherside.com, and factualsearch.news aim to expose readers to different perspectives with diverse content. Some additional plug-ins, such as Media Bias Fact Check, aimed to help people step out of their filter bubbles and make them aware of their personal perspectives; thus, these media show content that contradicts with their beliefs and opinions. For instance, Escape Your Bubble asks users to indicate a specific political party they want to be more informed about. The plug-in will then suggest articles from well- established sources to read relating to that political party, encouraging users to become more educated about the other party. In addition to plug-ins, there are apps created with the mission of encouraging users to open their echo chambers. UnFound.news offers an AI (Artificial Intelligence) curated news app to readers presenting them news from diverse and distinct perspectives, helping them form rationale and informed opinion rather than succumbing to their own biases. It also nudges the readers to read different perspectives if their reading pattern is biased towards one side/ideology. Read Across the Aisle is a news app that reveals whether or not users are reading from diverse new sources that include multiple perspectives. Each source is color coordinated, representing the political leaning of each article. When users only read news from one perspective, the app communicates that to the user and encourages readers to explore other sources with opposing viewpoints. Although apps and plug-ins are tools humans can use, Eli Pariser stated \\"certainly, there is some individual responsibility here to really seek out new sources and people who aren't like you.\\" Since web-based advertising can further the effect of the filter bubbles by exposing users to more of the same content, users can block much advertising by deleting their search history, turning off targeted ads, and downloading browser extensions. Extensions such as Escape your Bubble for Google Chrome aim to help curate content and prevent users from only being exposed to biased information, while Mozilla Firefox extensions such as Lightbeam and Self-Destructing Cookies enable users to visualize how their data is being tracked, and lets them remove some of the tracking cookies. Some use anonymous or non-personalised search engines such as YaCy, DuckDuckGo, Qwant, Startpage.com, Disconnect, and Searx in order to prevent companies from gathering their web-search data. Swiss daily Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung is beta-testing a personalised news engine app which uses machine learning to guess what content a user is interested in, while \\"always including an element of surprise\\"; the idea is to mix in stories which a user is unlikely to have followed in the past. The European Union is taking measures to lessen the effect of the filter bubble. The European Parliament is sponsoring inquiries into how filter bubbles affect people's ability to access diverse news. Additionally, it introduced a program aimed to educate citizens about social media. In the U.S., the CSCW panel suggests the use of news aggregator apps to broaden media consumers news intake. News aggregator apps scan all current news articles and direct you to different viewpoints regarding a certain topic. Users can also use a diversely-aware news balancer which visually shows the media consumer if they are leaning left or right when it comes to reading the news, indicating right-leaning with a bigger red bar or left-leaning with a bigger blue bar. A study evaluating this news balancer found \\"a small but noticeable change in reading behavior, toward more balanced exposure, among users seeing the feedback, as compared to a control group\\". By media companies In light of recent concerns about information filtering on social media, Facebook acknowledged the presence of filter bubbles and has taken strides toward removing them. In January 2017, Facebook removed personalization from its Trending Topics list in response to problems with some users not seeing highly talked-about events there. Facebook's strategy is to reverse the Related Articles feature that it had implemented in 2013, which would post related news stories after the user read a shared article. Now, the revamped strategy would flip this process and post articles from different perspectives on the same topic. Facebook is also attempting to go through a vetting process whereby only articles from reputable sources will be shown. Along with the founder of Craigslist and a few others, Facebook has invested $14 million into efforts \\"to increase trust in journalism around the world, and to better inform the public conversation\\". The idea is that even if people are only reading posts shared from their friends, at least these posts will be credible. Similarly, Google, as of January 30, 2018, has also acknowledged the existence of a filter bubble difficulties within its platform. Because current Google searches pull algorithmically ranked results based upon \\"authoritativeness\\" and \\"relevancy\\" which show and hide certain search results, Google is seeking to combat this. By training its search engine to recognize the intent of a search inquiry rather than the literal syntax of the question, Google is attempting to limit the size of filter bubbles. As of now, the initial phase of this training will be introduced in the second quarter of 2018. Questions that involve bias and/or controversial opinions will not be addressed until a later time, prompting a larger problem that exists still: whether the search engine acts either as an arbiter of truth or as a knowledgeable guide by which to make decisions by. In April 2017 news surfaced that Facebook, Mozilla, and Craigslist contributed to the majority of a $14M donation to CUNY's \\"News Integrity Initiative,\\" poised at eliminating fake news and creating more honest news media. Later, in August, Mozilla, makers of the Firefox web browser, announced the formation of the Mozilla Information Trust Initiative (MITI). The +MITI would serve as a collective effort to develop products, research, and community-based solutions to combat the effects of filter bubbles and the proliferation of fake news. Mozilla's Open Innovation team leads the initiative, striving to combat misinformation, with a specific focus on the product with regards to literacy, research and creative interventions. Ethical implications As the popularity of cloud services increases, personalized algorithms used to construct filter bubbles are expected to become more widespread. Scholars have begun considering the effect of filter bubbles on the users of social media from an ethical standpoint, particularly concerning the areas of personal freedom, security, and information bias. Filter bubbles in popular social media and personalized search sites can determine the particular content seen by users, often without their direct consent or cognizance, due to the algorithms used to curate that content. Self-created content manifested from behavior patterns can lead to partial information blindness. Critics of the use of filter bubbles speculate that individuals may lose autonomy over their own social media experience and have their identities socially constructed as a result of the pervasiveness of filter bubbles. Technologists, social media engineers, and computer specialists have also examined the prevalence of filter bubbles. Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, and Eli Pariser, author of The Filter Bubble, have expressed concerns regarding the risks of privacy and information polarization. The information of the users of personalized search engines and social media platforms is not private, though some people believe it should be. The concern over privacy has resulted in a debate as to whether or not it is moral for information technologists to take users' online activity and manipulate future exposure to related information. Some scholars have expressed concerns regarding the effects of filter bubbles on individual and social well-being, i.e. the dissemination of health information to the general public and the potential effects of internet search engines to alter health- related behavior. A 2019 multi-disciplinary book reported research and perspectives on the roles filter bubbles play in regards to health misinformation. Drawing from various fields such as journalism, law, medicine, and health psychology, the book addresses different controversial health beliefs (e.g. alternative medicine and pseudoscience) as well as potential remedies to the negative effects of filter bubbles and echo chambers on different topics in health discourse. A 2016 study on the potential effects of filter bubbles on search engine results related to suicide found that algorithms play an important role in whether or not helplines and similar search results are displayed to users and discussed the implications their research may have for health policies. Another 2016 study from the Croatian Medical journal proposed some strategies for mitigating the potentially harmful effects of filter bubbles on health information, such as: informing the public more about filter bubbles and their associated effects, users choosing to try alternative [to Google] search engines, and more explanation of the processes search engines use to determine their displayed results. Since the content seen by individual social media users is influenced by algorithms that produce filter bubbles, users of social media platforms are more susceptible to confirmation bias, and may be exposed to biased, misleading information. Social sorting and other unintentional discriminatory practices are also anticipated as a result of personalized filtering. In light of the 2016 U.S. presidential election scholars have likewise expressed concerns about the effect of filter bubbles on democracy and democratic processes, as well as the rise of \\"ideological media\\". These scholars fear that users will be unable to \\"[think] beyond [their] narrow self-interest\\" as filter bubbles create personalized social feeds, isolating them from diverse points of view and their surrounding communities. For this reason, it is increasingly discussed the possibility to design social media with more serendipity, that is, to proactively recommend content that lies outside one's filter bubble, including challenging political information and, eventually, to provide empowering filters and tools to users. A related concern is in fact how filter bubbles contribute to the proliferation of \\"fake news\\" and how this may influence political leaning, including how users vote. Revelations in March 2018 of Cambridge Analytica's harvesting and use of user data for at least 87 million Facebook profiles during the 2016 presidential election highlight the ethical implications of filter bubbles. Co-Founder and whistleblower of Cambridge Analytica Christopher Wylie, detailed how the firm had the ability to develop \\"psychographic\\" profiles of those users and use the information to shape their voting behavior. Access to user data by third parties such as Cambridge Analytica can exasperate and amplify existing filter bubbles users have created, artificially increasing existing biases and further divide societies.  Dangers of filter bubbles  Filter bubbles have stemmed from a surge in media personalization, which can trap users. The use of AI to personalize offerings can lead to the user only viewing content that only reinforces their own viewpoints without challenging them. Social media websites like Facebook may also present content in a way that makes it difficult for the user to determine the source of the content, leading them to decide for themselves whether the source is reliable or fake. This can lead to people becoming used to hearing what they want to hear, which can cause them to react more radically when they see an opposing viewpoint. The filter bubble may cause the person to see any opposing viewpoints as incorrect and could allow the media to force views onto consumers.  Extensions of the concept  The concept of a filter bubble has been extended into other areas, to describe societies that self-segregate according to not just political views, but also according to economic, social, and cultural situations. This bubbling results in a loss of the broader community and creates the sense that, for example, children do not belong at social events unless those events were especially planned to be appealing for children and unappealing for adults without children.

Life He was born at Montauban in Languedoc, where his father, Peter Duncan, was professor of physics. He was orphaned when young, and he came under the guardianship of his maternal uncle, Daniel Paul, a Protestant, He was sent for his preliminary education to Puy Laurens. Here he made the acquaintance of Pierre Bayle, a fellow-student, two years his senior. Duncan then went to Montpellier to study medicine, and, after living for several years in the house of Charles Barbeyrac, took the degree of M.D. in 1673. Duncan went to Paris, where he became acquainted with the minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert, by whom he was appointed physician-general to the army before Saint-Omer, commanded by the Duke of Orl√©ans in 1677. After the peace of Nimeguen, he left the army, published in Paris his first medical work in 1678, and then passed two years in London, where he employed himself especially in collecting information about the great plague of 1666. In 1681 he was summoned back to Paris to attend his patron Colbert, after whose death in 1683 he returned to his native town of Montauban. After the revocation of the edict of Nantes in 1685 he decided to leave France and settle in England. In 1690 he went to Switzerland, where, in Geneva and afterwards for some years in Berne, he worked as a physician and for French emigrants. In 1699 Philip, Landgrave of Hesse- Philippsthal sent for him from Cassel, where his wife was seriously ill. Duncan was successful in his treatment of her case. He stayed for three years in the Landgrave's palace. His fame reached Berlin, and he was invited by Frederick I of Prussia, the newly created King in Prussia, and he went in 1702. But, though he was appointed professor of physic and also physician to the royal household, he found the habits of the court distasteful, and the cost of living excessive; in 1703 he passed on to The Hague, where he remained for about twelve years. In 1714, he settled in England. For the last sixteen years of his life would take no fees, although he lost money in the South Sea bubble in 1721. He died in London 30 April 1735, aged 86, leaving behind him an only son, of the same name. Works He published: *Explication nouvelle et m√©chanique des actions animales, o√π il est trait√© des fonctions de l'√¢me, Paris, 1678. *La Chymie naturelle, ou l'explication chymique et m√©chauique de la nourriture de l'animal, 1st part, Paris, 1681; 2nd and 3rd parts, de l'√©vacuation particuli√©re aux femmes, and de la formation et de la naissance de l'animal, Montauban, 1686.

History  The 1977 United Nations 'Water Conference' at Mar del Plata set up an International Drinking Water Decade, 1981-1990. Its aim was to make access to clean drinking water available across the world.International Decade for Clean Drinking Water, 1981-1990 The decade focussed on safe water and sanitation for everybody by 1990. Among the obstacles were the following: whether developing countries will give water and sanitary disposal high enough priority to get results; if an effective organization can be created within countries to carry out a water and waste programme; how manpower training and financing can be accomplished; and whether or not appropriate technology will be used. This first water decade, brought water to over 1.2 billion people and sanitation to almost 770 million. However, growth and rapid urbanization, together with the low level of public awareness about health, has drastically reduced many countries' abilities to keep up with need; and today, there are still almost 1.1 billion people who have inadequate access to water and 2.4 billion without appropriate sanitation. Since the decade ended in 1990, hopes for improvement are centred on the World Water Assessment Programme, a joint effort of the UN system and its member states, which includes a biennial assessment of the state of global freshwater resources. The launch of the second International Water Decade during 2005-2015 will also provide much needed impetus for the assessment program.

It runs from Niederrathen upstream to Rathewalde. The wild and romantic valley takes hikers through the Rathen rock basin with its bizarre rock formations. Its touristic high points are the lake of Amselsee and the Amsel Falls, that trickles over the grotto called the Amselloch. The valley bottom that is densely wooded is surrounded by a backdrop of rocks. To the west tower the rocks of the Gansfelsen, to the south the Feldsteine and the T√ºrkenkopf, and to the east rise the Honigsteine rocks with the striking Lokomotive. The middle of the valley bottom is dominated by the striking Talw√§chter. Whilst the character of the valley profile in its upper reaches is rather ravine-like, between its entrance to the Schwedenl√∂cher and Niederrathen it is a steep valley. On the stream bed ripple marks may be seen. Above the Amsel Falls, large, fallen sandstone boulders block the watercourse, so that the rather lower water quantities of the Gr√ºnbach have to find their way past them.

He specializes in the history and politics of the United States. As an expert on America, he is a frequent guest on television political talk shows. His public career started when he was asked to comment on the 1984 vice presidential elections. He still makes regular TV appearances and gives frequent public lectures. Early life Born in 1943 in Zeist, Van Rossem grew up in Wageningen (Netherlands). In his youth he became fascinated with the United States through a visit from his three American cousins. When they came to visit his parents, they each had their own photo camera with them. This led him to think all Americans were rich. He attended the grammar school in Wageningen, graduating in the exact sciences. Initially he studied pharmacy at Utrecht University, because of his high marks for chemistry. Because he disliked the subject, he secretly switched to studying history. His family opposed this decision, stating that this would only lead to unemployment. As a student in the 1960s, he was expected to be leftist and radical, but he chose not to go in that direction. He thought it would be very unlikely that there would be a revolutionary revolt against capitalism. Despite being brought up in a liberal environment, he joined the Labour Party in 1967. He continued to be intrigued by the United States, collecting newspaper clippings on Martin Luther King Jr., President Kennedy and the Chicago riots. After eight years he graduated cum laude. He wrote his senior thesis about the historiography of the Cold War with Hermann von der Dunk as his thesis advisor. Through his thesis he discovered the joy of writing: \\"You can say that at that point I became a historian\\". His PhD thesis on the Partisan Review was also counseled by Von der Dunk, who allowed him to change the subject twice. It took him 12 years to finish it. Career In 1984, he published his best selling book The United States in the 20th century (Dutch title: De Verenigde Staten in de Twintigste Eeuw). Due to the acclaim and success of the book, he became a regular guest on various Dutch television channels to comment on American presidential elections. Since then he is often asked to speak at events concerning Dutch- American relations. In 1996, he became a tenured professor occupying the endowed chair of modern history at the Utrecht University. This appointment allowed him to speak on a wider range of subjects. He was forced to retire from this position in 2008, in order to comply with the law as he had reached Dutch retirement age at the time. He derided this action, saying \\"Yesterday I had a normal working day; today my activities are seen as nothing more than occupational therapy for the elderly, focused on stimulating the brain, in order to prevent its precipitate decline after receiving the first state pension cheque\\", he said on his first day of retirement. He continues to give public lectures all around the country. The first issue of his own magazine, the Maarten!, was published in the summer of 2008. Initially a one time addition to the Historic Newspaper (Dutch: Historisch Nieuwsblad), the glossy magazine has since grown into its own, circulating on a bimonthly basis. Even though the format parodies personality magazines like Oprah Magazine, its content is serious, running editorials on current events and putting them against a historic background. In the summer of 2012 he toured the United States in preparation of a documentary series on the 2012 presidential elections. During the 2012 Dutch general elections he was a \\"lijstduwer\\" for the Labour Party, which earned them 5.929 votes, ranking him the 16th most popular candidate.

A woman consigns a family heirloom to a pair of unscrupulous art dealers in order to raise money to help her sick brother. This film is the second in the series of 14 Columbia Pictures Boston Blackie films, all starring Morris as the reformed crook. It was preceded by Meet Boston Blackie (1941) and followed by Alias Boston Blackie (1942). Plot Diane Parrish (Harriet Hilliard) is impatient for the sale of her statue of Augustus Caesar, as she needs the money to help her sick brother. Joe Buchanan, one of the art dealers handling the auction, asks her to stay away, claiming that an emotional attachment to the work might cause her to make a scene. She shows up anyway, and notices that the statue is not hers, but a fake. When Buchanan pulls out a gun to silence her, Boston Blackie (Chester Morris) spots him and fires his own pistol. Parrish is only grazed, but Buchanan accidentally kills his partner and the replica's sculptor, Eric Allison. When Police Inspector Farraday (Richard Lane) arrives, he automatically assumes that Blackie is guilty and takes him into custody. Buchanan hides in the hollow fake statue. Then when the coast is clear, he puts Allison's body (and the incriminating bullet) inside and makes his escape. The replica is purchased by Blackie's wealthy friend, Arthur Manleder (Lloyd Corrigan). Despite lacking a corpse, Farraday keeps Blackie in jail, but not for long. Blackie switches places with an ice cream man (William Benedict) and escapes. He goes to see Diane in the hospital to obtain information. To get in undetected, he once again appropriates the unlucky ice cream man's uniform and pretends to be Diane's doctor. When he learns why she needs the money so badly, he arranges for his assistant, the \\"Runt\\" (George E. Stone), to masquerade as an insurance adjuster to give her $6000 he borrowed from Manleder. The money had initially been intended to pay off a blackmailing Mona (Joan Woodbury), who claims she is Blackie's wife. When Mona shows up and demands the money, Diane realizes that Blackie is her benefactor. Buchanan arranges to buy the statue from an unsuspecting Manleder. Blackie learns about it, and sees a way to unravel the mystery. He follows the movers back to their lair. Sneaking inside, he overpowers Caulder (Kenneth MacDonald), one of Buchanan's henchmen. However, Buchanan returns, with Diane as his prisoner, resulting a Mexican standoff. Meanwhile, both Manleder and the Runt are picked up by the police. Farraday has them released, hoping they will lead him to their friend. The Runt is too experienced to be taken in, but Manleder does return to the crooks' secret underground workshop, where they copy artworks. In the ensuing gunfight, Buchanan is killed, but the shots destroy the electrical circuits controlling the only way in, trapping them all in the soundproof chamber. Blackie comes up with the idea to start a fire in the ventilation shaft, and firemen arrive to let them out.

According to Hephaestion it was known as the Ionicos because it was used by the Ionians of Asia Minor; and it was also known as the Persicos and was associated with Persian poetry.Quoted in Thiesen, Finn (1982). A Manual of Classical Persian Prosody, with chapters on Urdu, Karakhanidic and Ottoman prosody. Wiesbaden; pp. 132; 263‚Äì4. Like the choriamb, in Greek quantitative verse the ionic never appears in passages meant to be spoken rather than sung.James Halporn, Martin Ostwald, and Thomas Rosenmeyer, The Meters of Greek and Latin Poetry (Hackett, 1994, originally published 1963), pp. 29‚Äì31. \\"Ionics\\" may refer inclusively to poetry composed of the various metrical units of the same total quantitative length (six morae) that may be used in combination with ionics proper: ionics, choriambs, and anaclasts.Halporn et al., Meters, p. 125. Equivalent forms exist in English poetry and in classical Persian poetry.Thiesen, Finn (1982). A Manual of Classical Persian Prosody, with chapters on Urdu, Karakhanidic and Ottoman prosody. Wiesbaden; pp. 132‚Äì137. Examples of ionics Pure examples of Ionic metrical structures occur in verse by Alcman (frg. 46 PMG = 34 D), Sappho (frg. 134-135 LP), Alcaeus (frg. 10B LP), Anacreon, and the Greek dramatists,Halporn et al., Meters, p. 23. including the first choral song of Aeschylus' Persians and in Euripides' Bacchae.Graham Ley, The Theatricality of Greek Tragedy (University of Chicago Press, 2007), 139, citing the work of Dale (1969). Like dochmiacs, the ionic meter is characteristically experienced as expressing excitability.Ley, The Theatricality of Greek Tragedy, 171; Edwards, Sound, Sense, and Rhythm, p. 68, note 17. The form has been linked tentatively with the worship of Cybele and Dionysus.Ley, The Theatricality of Greek Tragedy, 139, citing the work of Dale (1969). An example of pure ionics in Latin poetry is found as a \\"metrical experiment\\" in the Odes of Horace, Book 3, poem 12, which draws on Archilochus and Sappho for its content and utilizes a metrical line that appears in a fragment of Alcaeus.Paul Shorey, Horace: Odes and Epodes (Boston, 1898), p. 346. The Horace poem begins as follows: : : : : u u ‚Äì ‚Äì  u u ‚Äì ‚Äì  u u ‚Äì ‚Äì  u u ‚Äì ‚Äì : u u ‚Äì ‚Äì  u u ‚Äì ‚Äì  u u ‚Äì ‚Äì : u u ‚Äì ‚Äì  u u ‚Äì ‚Äì  u u ‚Äì ‚Äì :\\"Those girls are wretched who do not play with love or use sweet : wine to wash away their sorrows, or who are terrified, : fearing the blows of an uncle's tongue.\\" In writing this 4-verse poem Horace tends to place a caesura (word-break) after every metrical foot, except occasionally in the last two feet of the line. Anacreontics The anacreontic  u u ‚Äì u ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì  is sometimes analyzed as a form of ionics which has undergone anaclasis (substitution of u ‚Äì for ‚Äì u in the 4th and 5th positions). The galliambic is a variation of this, with resolution (substitution of u u for ‚Äì ) and catalexis (omission of the final syllable) in the second half. Catullus used galliambic meter for his Carmen 63 on the mythological figure Attis, a portion of which is spoken in the person of Cybele. The poem begins: : : : : : The meter is: : u u ‚Äì u ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì  u u ‚Äì u u u u ‚Äì : u u ‚Äì u ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì  u u ‚Äì u u u u ‚Äì : u u ‚Äì u ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì  u u ‚Äì u u u u ‚Äì : u u ‚Äì u u u u ‚Äì ‚Äì  u u ‚Äì u u u u ‚Äì : ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì  u u ‚Äì u u u u ‚Äì :\\"Attis, having crossed the high seas in a swift ship, :as soon as he eagerly touched the Phrygian forest with swift foot :and approached the shady places, surrounded by woods, of the goddess, :excited there by raging madness, losing his mind, :he tore off the weights of his groin with a sharp flint.\\" In this poem Catullus leaves a caesura (word-break) at the mid-point of every line. Occasionally the 5th syllable is resolved into two shorts (as in line 4 above) or the first two shorts are replaced with a single long syllable (as in line 5, if the text is sound). Ionic a minore and a maiore The \\"ionic\\" almost invariably refers to the basic metron u u ‚Äî ‚Äî, but this metron is also known by the fuller name ionic a minore in distinction to the rarely used ionic a maiore (‚Äî ‚Äî u u). Modern metricians generally consider the term ionic a maiore to be of little analytic use, a vestige of Hephaestion's \\"misunderstanding of metre\\"Kiichiro Itsumi, \\"What's in a Line? Papyrus Formats and Hephaestionic Formulae,\\" in Hesperos: Studies in Ancient Greek Poetry Presented to M. L. West on his Seventieth Birthday, OUP, 2007, p. 317, in reference to Hephaestion's description of Book IV of the Sapphic corpus as \\"ionic a maiore acatalectic tetrameter.\\" and desire to balance metrical units with their mirror images.J. M. van Ophuijsen, Hephaestion on Metre, Leiden, 1987, p. 98. Polyschematist sequences The Ionic and Aeolic meters are closely related, as evidenced by the polyschematist unit x x ‚Äî x ‚Äî u u ‚Äî (with x representing an anceps position that may be heavy or light).Halporn et al., Meters, p. 25. The sotadeion, named for the Hellenistic poet Sotades, has been classified as ionic a maiore by Hephaestion and by M. L. West:Hephaestion on Metre, pp. 106f. : ‚Äì ‚Äì u u ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì ‚Äì u u ‚Äì ‚Äì It \\"enjoyed a considerable vogue for several centuries, being associated with low-class entertainment, especially of a salacious sort, though also used for moralizing and other serious verse.\\"West, Greek Metre, pp. 144f. Among those poets who adopted it was Ennius.Frances Muecke, \\"Rome's First 'Satirists': Themes and Genre in Ennius and Lucilius,\\" in The Cambridge Companion to Roman Satire (Cambridge University Press, 2005), p. 36. In English In English poetry, Edward Fitzgerald composed in a combination of anacreontics and ionics.Edwards, p. 79. An example of English ionics occurs in lines 4 and 5 of the following lyric stanza by Thomas Hardy: :The pair seemed lovers, yet absorbed :In mental scenes no longer orbed :By love's young rays. Each countenance :::√Äs √¨t sl√≥wl√Ω, √†s √¨t s√°dl√Ω :::Ca√πght th√® l√°mpl√≠ght's y√®ll√≤w gl√°nce, :Held in suspense a misery :At things which had been or might be.Thomas Hardy, \\"Beyond the Last Lamp\\" (1914), lines 8‚Äì14, as scanned by Edwards, Sound, Sense, and Rhythm, p. 80. The line \\"Held in suspense a misery\\" is a choriamb; the rest is iambic. Compare W. B. Yeats, \\"And the white breast of the dim sea\\" (\\"Who will go drive with Fergus now?\\" from The Countess Cathleen) and Tennyson, \\"In Memoriam,\\" \\"When the blood creeps and the nerves prick\\" (compare pyrrhic). Persian poetry The ionic rhythm is common in classical Persian poetry and exists in both trimeter and tetrameter versions. Nearly 10% of lyric poems are written in the following metre:L. P. Elwell-Sutton (1976), The Persian Metres, p. 162. : x u ‚Äì ‚Äì  u u ‚Äì ‚Äì  u u ‚Äì ‚Äì  _u u_ ‚Äì The acatalectic tetrameter is less common, but is also found: : x u ‚Äì ‚Äì  u u ‚Äì ‚Äì  u u ‚Äì ‚Äì  u u ‚Äì ‚Äì In these two metres the opening breve may become long, and (in the catalectic version) the final pair of shorts can be replaced by a long. Anaclastic versions of the metre also exist, resembling the Greek anacreontic, for example: : u u ‚Äì u ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì  u u ‚Äì u ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì ReferencesExternal links * Ionics, in Erling B.

Migration patterns and spawning areas are key life history traits in the management of many species. If a fish is migrating between two regions that are managed separately then it will be managed as two separate stocks unless this migration can be understood. If this migration is not discovered then overfishing of the stock may occur because managers assume there is double the amount of fish. In the past costly and inefficient tag and recapture studies were needed to discover such migration patterns. Today otolith microchemistry provides a simpler way to assess migration patterns of fish. Otolith microchemistry has been used to identify and delineate Atlantic cod stocks in Canadian waters.Campana, S. E., Fowler, A. J. and C. M. Jones. 1994. Otolith elemental fingerprinting for stock identification of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Canadian journal of fisheries and aquatic science 51: 1942-1950 It has also been used to determine the migratory patterns of anadromous whitefish.Halden, N.M. and L.A. Friedrich. 2008. Trace-element distribution in fish otoliths: natural markers of life histories, environmental conditions and exposure to tailings effluence. Mineralogical Magazine 73:593-605. Natal origin is equally critical to understand because areas where fish spawn and inhabit during their critical larval period must be identified and protected. Natal origin is also important in determining whether regions are sources or sinks for stocks of fish. In the past natal origin had to be assumed based upon collection on spawning grounds. In recent years otolith microchemistry has shown that this is not always the case. It has provided an accurate way to assess the natal origin of fish without collecting them on the spawning grounds. Otolith microchemistry has been used to accurately identify estuarine nursery areas of fish.Thorrold, S. R., Jones, C. M., Swart, P. K. and T. E. Targett. 1998. Accurate classification of juvenile weakfish Cyniscion regalis to estuarine nursery areas based on chemical signatures in otoliths. Marine ecology progress series 173: 253-265 Chemical Composition The otoliths begin to form shortly after the fish hatches. Otoliths are composed of a crystalline calcium carbonate structure, in the form of aragonite, on a protein matrix. Calcium carbonate is diffused through the endolymph cell membrane and the aragonite layers are permanently deposited in discrete increments. These increments are permanently stored in layers and their composition is not altered over time. Along with calcium carbonate, other chemicals are deposited in trace amounts. The most common trace elements found in otoliths are the alkaline earth metals Strontium (Sr), Barium (Ba), and Magnesium (Mg) because they are in the alkaline earth metal group like Calcium and therefore have the same bonding affinity. This allows these alkaline earth metals to substitute in for calcium in the aragonite without affecting the crystalline structure. Other elements and stable isotopes can be deposited in lower concentrations within the aragonite structure and in the protein matrix. The uptake of chemicals into the otolith is multi-stage and complex, but the chemical composition of the discrete layers are proportional to that of the ambient water in which the fish is inhabiting at the time of deposition.Campana, S. E. 1999. Chemistry and composition of fish otoliths: pathways, mechanisms and applications. Marine Ecology Progress Series 188: 263-297. These discrete layers create a temporal record of the water in which the fish has inhabited. There are 3 pairs of otoliths in bony fish, but only the largest, known as the saggita, is commonly used for microchemical analysis. The core of the otolith corresponds to the earliest larval period of the fish's life. Thus the microchemistry of the core of the otolith can be used as a means of inferring natal origin of fish. Analysis Methods=Water A recent advance in approach to otolith microchemical analyses involves water chemistry analysis in conjunction with otolith microchemical analysis. In order to standardize chemical concentrations, all elemental concentrations are recorded as proportion to Ca. The difference between fresh and salt (marine) water is the simplest to differentiate. Salt water has much higher concentrations of dissolved chemicals than freshwater. Despite numerous differences in chemical composition the two environments can be easily distinguished with just two elemental concentrations; Ba and Sr. Ba occurs in higher concentrations in freshwater and lower concentrations in marine waters. Inversely, Sr occurs in higher concentrations in marine waters and lower concentrations in freshwater. This relationship is clearly evident in otolith chemistry. While delineating fresh waters from marine is relatively straightforward, finer-scale resolution is required to examine spatial and temporal variation within biomes. In freshwater environments, examining Sr87/Sr86 isotope ratios is often employed to provide greater spatial resolution. Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES) are two common techniques that work by directing superheated plasma at the water sample and analyzing the gasses given off for trace amounts of different chemicals. Another Common technique is a beam based approach known as Proton-Induced X-ray Emission. In this technique a beam of protons is directed at the sample and the subsequent x-ray emissions are analyzed to determine chemical makeup of the sample. Otolith Once chemical signatures of regions of water are identified, the otoliths can be analyzed for comparison. Otoliths are examined and analyzed in one of two basic ways. The entire otolith can be sampled, or a portion of the otolith can be isolated through a targeted assay. Both approaches begin with careful cleaning and preparation of the otoliths to be analyzed. When data for fish movement over time or natal origin data is desired then a targeted portion approach is used. This approach is also known as a beam based approach because it uses a focused beam to analyze a small portion of the otolith at a time. All beam based techniques begin with cutting the otolith width wise through the core to reveal a cross section containing every layer from the origin outward. This section is placed in a polyester resin to hold it in position. A beam is then shot at the desired area and the chemical composition analyzed. For natal origin studies the core is analyzed. For temporal variation studies, a transect from the core through all the layers to the outer edge of the otolith is analyzed with the beam. Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) is the most accurate and versatile. LA-ICPMS has been used for numerous natal origin and temporal variation studies.Mohan, J.A. 2009. Habitat utilization of juvenile striped bass (Morone saxatili)s in Albemarle Sound inferred from otolith and water chemistries. MS Thesis. East Carolina University, Greenville, NC The technique uses an extremely fine beam laser to ablate, or burn away, a very shallow layer of the otolith. The emissions from this are then analyzed for chemical composition. Stable isotope values of otoliths have also been used to determine climate in the pastWilliam P. Patterson, Gerald R.

He served as the director of the University of Tennessee Anthropological Research Facility from 1998‚Äì2011 and he is the current Professor Emeritus of the Department of Anthropology at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. His research focuses primarily on forensic anthropology, skeletal biology, dermatoglyphics, anthropometry, anthropological genetics, and human variation, as well as developing computerized databases in these areas which aid in anthropological research. The author of over a hundred journal articles and other publications, his research has helped lead and shape the field of physical and forensic anthropology for many years. Among his students was Douglas W. Owsley.  Background  Jantz spent his childhood and received his early education in a small town in central Kansas. He attended a community college before attending Kansas University, where he took a class from noted anthropologist Dr. William M. Bass. He received a Bachelor of Arts in Anthropology in 1962, a Master of Arts in Anthropology in 1964, and a Ph.D. in Anthropology in 1970, all from the University of Kansas. He realized early on that his strengths lay in statistical analysis of measurements.  Research  Some of Jantz‚Äôs more current research involves quantitative osteometric and anthropometric variation among Native American populations, including an analysis of the work of Franz Boas. In the early 1900s, Boas conducted an anthropometric study showing the plasticity of the human body in response to environmental changes. Testing the skeletal measurements of children of immigrants to the US, he found that their measurements were closer to the American mean than to the mean of their home countries. Boas saw this as an argument that nutrition and environment was more important in determining body measurements than racial background, and his study was widely seen as discrediting racial anthropometry. In 2002, Jantz conducted a reassessment of Boas' study, the first time anyone had examined the validity of Boas‚Äô work. Specimens from Jantz‚Äôs research ranged in age from 10,000 years old to the modern period. In his reassessment, Jantz argued that Boas‚Äô original claims about the variations in skeletal plasticity between European and American born children was flawed, stating that he could find only insignificant differences between European and American born children. He also argued that exposure to the environment in America did not affect the children's crania. Jantz claims that his work discredited that of Boas although his own study has received criticism. Jonathan Marks - a well-known physical anthropologist and former president of the General Anthropology section of the American Anthropological Association - has remarked that this reassessment of Boas's work \\"has the ring of desperation to it (if not obfuscation), and has been quickly rebutted by more mainstream biological anthropology\\".Marks, Jonathan What it Means to be 98% Chimpanzee: Apes, People, and Their Genes, University of California Press, 2003 p. xviii In 2003, anthropologists Clarence C. Gravlee, H. Russell Bernard, and William R. Leonard reanalyzed Boas's data and concluded that most of Boas's original findings were correct. Moreover, they applied new statistical, computer-assisted methods to Boas's data and discovered more evidence for cranial plasticity. In a later publication, Gravlee, Bernard and Leonard reviewed Sparks and Jantz's analysis. They argue that Sparks and Jantz misrepresented Boas's claims, and that Sparks's and Jantz's data actually support Boas. For example, they point out that Sparks and Jantz look at changes in cranial size in relation to how long an individual has been in the United States in order to test the influence of the environment. Boas, however, looked at changes in cranial size in relation to how long the mother had been in the United States. They argue that Boas's method is more useful, because the prenatal environment is a crucial developmental factor. His other research also includes looking at microevolutionary forces acting on Aleut and Eskimo populations of the Bering Sea using anthropometrics. Databases are currently being developed and maintained for research purposes by Jantz for students and faculty, which include Boas anthropometrics which include body measurements on 15,000 BP Native Americans and 2,000 BP Siberians, Forensic- osteometric and other forensic data from 1,500 BP recent American skeletons, Heinz Brehme Dermatoglyphic Database which includes ridge-counts, pattern classifications on 50,000 BP people from most parts of the world, Plains osteometric cranial and postcranial morphometric data on 2,000 BP individuals from the Great Plains region, the Great Basin, the Southwest and Northwest. Other recent research includes looking at mtDNA of three Arikara sites in South Dakota that were occupied between AD 1600 and 1832. Analysis from this research shows similarities between these people and other Native American groups. This suggests an admixing of these groups in recent times. Another research project underway is the CT sexing project. This project‚Äôs goal is to improve the ability to estimate sex from cranial bones; in the absence of the pelvis, professionals consider the skull the second best indicator of sex. Currently, the accuracy lies between 85 and 90% for traditional sexing methods using cranial bones. The CT sexing project strives to increase this accuracy using CT scans of modern skeletal remains from the William Bass Donated Collection. Using these specimens, Jantz has examined sexual dimorphism in greater detail than what can be accomplished through external measurements and observations. This project is being funded by the National Institute of Justice and is being jointly conducted by the Department of Anthropology and the Department of Biomedical Engineering. Jantz has also played a role in the scientific examination and legal challenge associated with the discovery of Kennewick Man found in Washington on the Columbia River in 1996 and radiocarbon dated to ca. 9,000 years old. Jantz was one of eight anthropologists who sued the federal government to gain more access to Kennewick Man‚Äôs remains to study. Another project Jantz was involved with was the identification of crew from the Confederate submarine Hunley found off the coast of South Carolina using skeletal data and existing archaeological and genealogical records. Goals include determining the activities of the soldiers that took place on board, the length of time they were on the submarine, and any injuries, malnutrition, or illnesses they might have had. The crew‚Äôs skeletons were well preserved, making it possible for scientists to do facial reconstructions to show what they might have looked like. Jantz has also been involved in studies reviewing conclusions and reexamining forensic evidence related to the Nikumaroro bones and whether they may belong to the missing aviator Amelia Earhart.Forensic Anthropology Vol. 1, No. 2: 1‚Äì16  Awards  Dr. Jantz was named a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science for his distinguished contributions of database and software development to the field of biological anthropology. He received the Research and Creative Achievement Award from the University of Tennessee in 2003.

History The building that houses Robert's Western World was used as a warehouse, office space for river merchants, and a variety of other purposes until the late 1950s. Steel guitar players Shot Jackson and Buddy Emmons bought the venue and named it Sho-Bud Steel Guitar Company. The steel guitar shop manufactured and sold steel guitars and other musical instruments until the early 1980s. When lower Broadway hit on hard times the building was converted to a liquor store until Robert Moore bought and converted the building into a western apparel store named Robert's Rhinestone Western Wear. After the lower Broadway area rebounded, Mr. Moore added live entertainment, food, and alcohol. In the 90's, Robert's house band BR549 graced the stage and helped revitalize the lower broadway district. In 1999, Jesse Lee Jones bought Robert's from Robert Moore and has been dedicated to preserving the title \\"the home of traditional country music\\" on lower broadway. As of 2011 Jones's band Brazilbilly plays Friday and Saturday nights as the house band.

Early life and education Zwe Ohn Chein, born Ohn Chein, the ninth of ten siblings, was born in Mandalay, Burma to wealthy rice merchants. His parents lost their fortune during a storm. Zwe Ohn Chein then supported his parents by selling flowers. After his parents passing, he went to Rangoon (Yangon) on a bicycle and became a clerical assistant at age 20. As he was literate in English, he taught himself Pitman shorthand which he then used to invent his own Burmese shorthand technique in his later years. Marriage and family Zwe Ohn Chein married Daw Than Yi in 1939, and the couple had four children together. Career Zwe Ohn Chein started writing books on Burmese shorthand and typewriting in the 1950s after starting up Zwe Ohn Chein Shorthand College in 1946. By around 1956, he had successfully established the College, published books on Burmese shorthand and typewriting, and was the headmaster and the controller of the College. Around 1958, he won a contract with Remington typewriters for his typewriting books to accompany the sale of each Remington Burmese typewriter in Burma. As he had been unable to go to college due to his parents financial situation in his early years, even with the success of Zwe Ohn Chein Shorthand College, he felt unfulfilled and decided to study Burmese language at the University of Yangon. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1962, around the same time his eldest daughter was studying at the Medical School of Rangoon University. Legacy After Zwe Ohn Chein's death in 1979, his widow Daw Than Yi became the headmistress and the controller of Zwe Ohn Chein Shorthand College until her death in 1997.

The Mohawk Valley raid (February 1692) was conducted against three Mohawk villages located in the Mohawk River valley by French and Indian warriors under the overall command of Nicolas d'Ailleboust de Manthet. The action, part of a long-running French-Iroquois conflict and King William's War, which pitted the French against the Iroquois-allied English, resulted in the destruction of three villages, including critical stores of food. Many Mohawk were either killed or captured, with the latter intended to populate Christian Indian villages near Montreal. The raiders, burdened with their prisoners, were followed by a rapidly deployed English-Iroquois force led by Major Pieter Schuyler. The two forces engaged in skirmishing a few days after the raid. Because of the pursuit, the raiders were forced to release most of their prisoners, and were subjected to starvation due to the spoilage of some of their supply caches before they returned to Montreal. The Mohawk were seriously weakened as a military force within the Iroquois league, and the raid's effects contributed to the 1701 peace negotiated between the Iroquois, French, and many other tribes.

It is the fifth oldest public cemetery in the city. Despite its age, it is still open for ashes interment, Hebrew Congregational burials and if there is space in existing family plots. Opened in 1884, it has seen some 20,000 burials. The first burial, of the Sexton's wife, was held in July 1884 before the cemetery was opened. For some years, a tram line stopped within the cemetery before terminating on what is now Pages Road. The tram lines going into the cemetery are still visible under the tar-sealed road leading from the Butterfield Avenue car park. A tram hearse was built at some expense for the time by the Christchurch City Council but is believed to have never been used. The human remains from the Jewish Cemetery in Hereford Street were relocated to Linwood Cemetery after the Hebrew congregation sold the land of their earlier burial ground. A memorial to those re-interred was put in place but was badly damaged in the February 2011 earthquake. After the removal of the Sexton's house in the 1980s, the cemetery was subject to neglect and vandalism. The Friends of the Linwood Cemetery, a charitable trust, was formed to preserve and maintain the site and promote it as a valuable heritage site for the City. The Christchurch City Council produced a Conservation Plan for the cemetery in 2006. Linwood Cemetery is the resting place of a large number of notable residents. Those buried at Linwood Cemetery include 13 Christchurch mayors, several Members of Parliament, bishops and ministers, and the Peacock family whose philanthropy is associated with the iconic Peacock Fountain in the Botanic Gardens. Location Linwood Cemetery is located in Butterfield Avenue, behind Bromley Park (off Buckley's Road), Christchurch. It is connected to the city centre and New Brighton by bus routes. There are a number of other cemeteries in this area, including the Bromley Cemetery and Woodlawns (which includes Bromley Crematorium). Both are often incorrectly called Linwood Cemetery because of their locations off Linwood Avenue. History Faintly visible tram tracks in Linwood Cemetery The Linwood Cemetery hearse tram Linwood Cemetery is the fifth oldest surviving cemetery in Christchurch. It was opened in October 1884 as a response to concerns about the health implications of burying people in the inner city. The area where the cemetery was built was originally lupin-covered sand dunes well outside the city and near the Corporation rubbish dump. The land came under the jurisdiction of the Linwood Town Board which did not amalgamate with the City until 1903. The first person buried in the cemetery was Sarah Freeman (Block 2 Plot 1), which is all the more significant as she was the Sexton's wife, and died in July 1884 whilst the cemetery was still being prepared. The funeral on 10 July was attended by the Mayor of Christchurch, Charles Hulbert, and several councillors. After a lengthy debate, Linwood Cemetery was connected to the Christchurch tramway system. Approval for construction of the line was given in April 1885. Construction began on 26 November 1885 at Latimer Square and was completed by March 1886. The line was officially opened on 23 April 1886. Initially, it was the 'end of the line' from the city centre and people had to walk across or around the cemetery to connect with the tram line to New Brighton, which was run by a different company. By January 1887, the two lines had been connected. The city council had a tram hearse built for up to four coffins, with the intention of providing cheaper form of transport to the cemetery than what funeral directors would charge. The scheme was a failure and it is believed that the tram hearse was never used. In 1888, a council committee recommended that the rails into the cemetery be removed again and used elsewhere, but this was never acted on, and the rails, although sealed over, are still faintly visible. The tram hearse was bought by Samuel Paull Andrews for ¬£3 and used as an explosives store in his St Andrew's Hill quarry. It is possibly that Linwood Cemetery is the only one in the world to have had a tram line. Mausoleum of John Thomas Peacock Members of the Canterbury Hebrew Congregation had purchased land in Hereford Street (in the section between Fitzgerald Avenue and Stanmore Road) for a Jewish cemetery. Between 1865 and 1890, 34 burials took place. The new Linwood Cemetery had a Jewish section, and the Hereford Street cemetery fell into disuse. By 1924, it looked \\"unsightly\\" and the Jewish congregation decided to shift the human remains to the Linwood Cemetery and sell the land. A legal issue stopped a land sale from going ahead and it required the passing of the Canterbury Jewish Cemetery Empowering Act 1943 to progress the issue. The remains were re-interred at Linwood Cemetery and a memorial marks the location with the following words: \\"Here repose the remains of the following that were removed from the Hereford Street Jewish Cemetery\\" In 2005/06 a Conservation Plan was developed by the Christchurch City Council to evaluate the heritage value of Linwood Cemetery. As well as identifying Linwood Cemetery as of valuable heritage and green space value, the Conservation Plan describes the priorities and processes required to conserve the cemetery. The conservation plan is due to be revised in the near future. A Sexton lived in a house in Linwood Cemetery until the early 1980s. From the late 1980s through to 1999, the cemetery fell into disrepair and nobody was looking after it, and vandalism was occurring. Since then, following a public meeting, a small group of local volunteers keep Linwood Cemetery tidy and promote its value as a much needed green space and heritage site. The Friends of Linwood Cemetery Charitable Trust continue to research the history of Linwood Cemetery and undertake conservation work. The original research was carried out by local historian Richard Greenaway and can be found in Linwood Cemetery Tour. The cemetery is almost full, with further burials possible in the children's, ashes, and Jewish sections only. The Friends of the Linwood Cemetery The trompe l'oeil on the Peacock Mausoleum in Linwood Cemetery, Christchurch. Following recommendations in the Conservation Plan for Linwood Cemetery, local residents who had been tidying and gardening Linwood Cemetery as a Working Group since 1999 formed a charitable trust in November 2006. The trust's vision is to \\"conserve and maintain the heritage of the Linwood Cemetery for future generations.\\" The Friends of Linwood Cemetery Charitable Trust organise regular working bees at the cemetery, record the condition of graves, record information about the cemetery and those buried in it on its own website, publicise the cemetery through articles and events and raise funds for projects to help preserve valuable heritage aspects of the cemetery. In November 2011 Dulux donated paint to the Trust to paint a trompe l'oeil of the Peacock Mausolem to cover the graffiti on a 'temporary' protective covering. The artwork was carried out by Anne Holloway, the Chair at the time. The artwork was finished in August 2012. Bob Todd the Chair of the Hagley Ferrymead Community Board unveiled the artwork in a ceremony in May 2012 before the signwriting was completed by Digby Gemmel in the following months. Notable burials Those buried at Linwood Cemetery include at least thirteen Christchurch mayors (see below), several members of parliament, bishops and ministers, and the Peacock family whose philanthropy included the iconic Peacock Fountain in the Botanical Gardens. Many original settlers from the First Four Ships are buried here. 54 Commonwealth war graves (50 from World War I and 4 from World War II) CWGC Cemetery Report and memorials to over 300 ANZACs are found at Linwood Cemetery.

He is the son of Vere Bird, the former Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda, and brother of Lester Bird, who later held the same position. Bird entered politics in 1981. Three years later he was elected to the House of Representatives and became Minister of Aviation, Public Information and Public Utilities. As minister, Bird conducted a purchase deal for Dominican water before being made Minister of Public Works and Communications on 1 January 1987. In this role, he oversaw the reconstruction of V. C. Bird International Airport, which was the subject of controversy after it was discovered that he had granted a contract for the construction of a new runway to a company in which he was a shareholder. This led to conflict within the ALP, but Bird remained a minister. He was later fired after a scandal in which Israeli weapons, sold to Antigua and Barbuda, were found in the hands of the Medell√≠n Cartel of Colombian drug smugglers ‚Äì it was discovered that the weapons had been transferred at Bird's instruction, and a report by Sir Louis Blom-Cooper recommended that he be prohibited from holding public office again. Despite this decision, Bird returned to government on 15 May 1996 as Minister of Science, Technology and Communications, with a transfer to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Business Development following the 1999 general election. In 2000, he became Minister of Agriculture, Lands and Fisheries; in this role, he negotiated an end to the Antiguan boycott of agricultural goods from Trinidad and Tobago. The ALP lost the 2004 general election and were replaced by a United Progressive Party government under Baldwin Spencer. Bird remained involved in politics, and along with six other senior ALP members was arrested in 2009 after an unauthorised May Day rally. The seven politicians were found guilty of public order offences, although the trial was delayed following a seizure suffered by Bird. He suffered two more seizures in 2010, after the completion of the trial, and died on 31 March 2013 of heart failure. Early career Bird, the eldest son of Premier Vere Bird, first entered politics in 1981 when he served as an unelected security official during the general election. In the following election in 1984, Bird and his brother Lester were both elected to the House of Representatives after the Antigua Labour Party, led by their father, took 16 of the 17 House seats. Bird himself was victorious over George Walter, leader of the Progressive Labour Movement and former Premier of Antigua and Barbuda, gaining 912 votes to Walter's 358. Upon election, with his father as Prime Minister, he was given the Ministry of Aviation, Public Information and Public Utilities. As Minister he visited Dominica at the head of a four-person delegation that was dispatched to reach a deal on selling Antigua and Barbuda, a country lacking natural supplies, water. This business was concluded on 16 July 1984, when it was announced that Dominica would sell Antigua and Barbuda 2 million gallons of water every 10 days, at a cost of around 3 US dollars per thousand gallons. A cabinet reshuffle on 1 January 1987 saw Bird replaced by Robin Yearwood as Minister of Aviation, Public Information and Public Utilities and becoming instead Minister of Public Works and Communications. This followed controversy over Bird's construction of a new airport, which the opposition charged was \\"grossly inflated\\" in cost; retired Grenadian judge Sir Archibald Nedd was appointed to investigate the project and look for signs of wrongdoing. The independent investigation concluded that Bird had been incorrect in his funding of the project, particularly in granting the contract to build the runway to a company in which he was a shareholder. This scandal threatened to topple the government, with eight ministers, including Bird's brother Lester, arguing that the Prime Minister should fire him. This scandal led to the Labour Party splitting into two distinct factions, one led by the Prime Minister and one led by Lester Bird. Despite a general election not being due until 1989, there was widespread speculation that it would be called early. Despite this, no election was called until 9 March 1989, when the ALP were again victorious. With the Prime Minister delegating most of his work due to his advancing age, and instead spending time with his 27-year-old companion, the election was seen as a struggle for power between Bird and his brother Lester. Although Lester had long been the frontrunner with most powers delegated to him, Bird, described in The Guardian as \\"a more single-minded, figure, long resentful at being over-shadowed by his sibling\\", was still seen as a close competitor ‚Äì one with control of the nation's army. After the election, both Bird brothers retained their respective positions in the Cabinet, but with the Prime Minister's health getting worse, the struggle continued. Scandal and firing Bird's career in the Cabinet was ended by scandal in 1990 after a shipment of Israeli weapons to Antigua and Barbuda were received and then diverted to the Medell√≠n Cartel of Colombian drug dealers. The scandal broke after the Colombian government publicly complained about the use of Antigua and Barbuda as a trans-shipment point; a diplomatic note from the Israeli government revealed that the weapons had been shipped at the apparent express instruction of Bird, who had given assurances that they would not be passed on to any third parties. The guns were actually ordered as part of a conspiracy by Maurice Sarfati and Yair Klein, who forged documents showing that Sarfati was an authorised representative of the Antiguan government and that the purchase of weapons had been approved by the Antiguan Minister for National Security, though that position did not exist. The plan was to set up a mercenary training camp on Antigua in order to train and supply Gonzalo Rodr√≠guez Gacha's Medellin forces. The Prime Minister repeatedly refused to open an investigation, despite demands by community leaders and members of his own government, saying that \\"conclusive evidence\\" was needed. An investigation was finally ordered on 25 April, with Bird asking to be temporarily relieved of his position until the inquiry concluded. The inquiry was run by Sir Louis Blom-Cooper; Bird was formally fired as a Cabinet minister on 10 May, the day Blom-Cooper arrived on Antigua. Blom-Cooper began work on 4 June, with Bird retaining a team of six lawyers for his defence; the inquiry, concluded in November, recommended banning Bird from holding public office for the rest of his life. The report was acted on and Bird was banned from becoming a minister again, although he retained his seat in the House. The report did not, however, recommend that Bird be forced to resign from the House or prosecuted criminally; it was felt that the public ridicule the guilty parties had been subjected to was punishment enough. Bird was later re- hired by the government, not as a Minister but as a special advisor to the Prime Minister on the subject of Public Utilities. After the Prime Minister finally retired and Lester became Antigua and Barbuda's leader on 5 September 1995, Bird was made Chairman of the ALP. Reappointment Despite Blom- Cooper's recommendations that Bird never be allowed to hold public office again and strong opposition disapproval, he was made Minister of Science, Technology and Communications in a cabinet reshuffle on 15 May 1996. He soon found himself at odds with the Prime Minister; after the government announced plans to evict Thomas Bufton and his wife from Guiana Island, where they had lived for 32 years, in order to build a tourist resort, Bird began serving as the Buftons' lawyer. A dispute between Bufton and Bird led to a fight at Bird's law offices, during which he was shot in the mouth and taken to intensive care on 16 December 1997; this followed Bird speaking up for the Buftons' cause before voting in support of a motion to allow the police to evict them, using force if necessary. Bufton was later acquitted of attempted murder, but still evicted. Following the ALP's victory in the 1999 general election, Bird was again appointed to the Cabinet, this time as Minister of Trade, Industry and Business Development. By July 2000, he had become Minister of Agriculture, Lands and Fisheries; in this role, he held talks with fishermen over the dumping of dredged material in the ocean and signed a trade agreement with Trinidad and Tobago to end a year-long ban on the import of Trinidadian produce. Time in opposition The ALP government lost the 2004 election, with the United Progressive Party under Baldwin Spencer taking 14 of the 17 seats in House. A year later, Bird was ousted as Chairman of the ALP and replaced by Molwyn Joseph. Following an unauthorised ALP march on May Day in 2009 to protest the Spencer government, Bird and six other senior ALP figures, including the former Prime Minister, were arrested and charged with public order offences. They pleaded not guilty, but were convicted and fined. This followed severe delays after Bird suffered a seizure during the trial, his third since 2008. Two more seizures occurred in 2010, the second on 11 March 2010 in court, where Bird was defending an individual accused of grievous bodily harm. On 31 March 2013, Bird died of heart failure, a few days after being separately diagnosed with liver cancer. The Antiguan government confirmed that he was to receive a state funeral. Personal life Bird was the son of Vere Bird, the former Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda, who died on 28 June 1999. His siblings include Lester, also a former Prime Minister, Ivor, who owns a radio station, Curtis, a lawyer, Roswald, a teacher, and Lisette. Ivor was later found guilty of attempted drug smuggling after being caught with a 25-pound bag of cocaine at Antigua's main airport; he was fined 75,000 East Caribbean dollars. Bird's son, Vere Bird III, was convicted of driving offences in 2006.

Production history The Pleasure Man began as a rework of West‚Äôs short-lived play The Drag. West made the protagonist of The Pleasure Man to be heterosexual rather than homosexual, and refined the comedy and plot progression. However, the show still retained the Drag Ball spectacle that concluded the show. Initial rehearsals of the play began with West simply writing notes on scraps of paper and letting the actors improvise and find the scenes themselves. This piece opened outside of Manhattan at the Bronx Opera House September 16 and then showed in Queens, New York at the Boulevard Theatre (Queens). The play's Broadway debut was October 1, 1928 at the Biltmore Theatre.

The show was described as depicting backstage burlesque and one reviewer called it the \\"queerest show you've ever seen\\" and as having \\"all the Queens\\" in it. Another review noted the presence of \\"Harlem bacchanales\\". A couple of favorable reviews found it entertaining, but most reviewers gave it rather scornful criticism including description of it as \\"filth\\" and \\"foul exhibitionism\\". The Pleasure Man was put on trial 2 years after the premiere, charging the company for \\"sex, degeneracy, and sex perversion\\". The trial was riddled with homophobia, chastising the ‚Äúdegenerates‚Äù that they saw on the stage, and asking if their manners of female impersonation carried on off stage. The jury failed to reach a decision and the charges were dismissed. West never appeared in court and was fined $60,000 West later wrote an expanded, novelized version of the play, published in 1975.Pleasure Man, Mae West.

The scrubwomen are finishing up cleaning the theatre, looting scraps left from previous performances and gossiping. The crew comes in and begins to set up for a Vaudeville performance. Steve eagerly waits for the performers to arrive. Paradise arrives first with Edgar and their boys. Paradise describes their act and Edgar goes over music cues with The Leader. Terrill then arrives with his Japanese Valet and he begins to flirt with Bobby. Flo comes in as Bobby leaves and Terrill flirts with her as well and speaks of letters that he supposedly sent her in the past. Steve comes back in and warns Terrill to knock off his old ways or he will be thrown out. Steve then warns the dancers of Terrill and begins to assign dressing rooms. Randall and Dolores arrive and as Randall works out some issues with Steve, Terrill confesses his love to Dolores. Dolores worries that Randall will find out about them. Randall and Dolores find out that their electrician doesn't have a union card, which evolves into them arguing about the suspicion Randall has over Dolores and Terrill. The Otto brothers arrive and are missing one of their partners. Stanley agrees to help with their act as he used to be an acrobat himself. The act ends with Arnold fiddling with lights and Randall starting to rehearse with Dolores and the dancers. Act Two Scene one opens with Terrill practicing one of his songs while touching up his makeup. Boys dressed as girls return to their dressing rooms, Bunny and Peaches are gossiping, and Chuck and Joe are teasing each other. Stanley comes in and Chuck tells him of his suspicions of Joe, but Stanley notices nothing. Dolores and Randall enter the dressing rooms still arguing about Terrill, while Terrill eaves drops. Arnold calls for Randall and as Randall leaves, Terrill slips a love note into the dressing room for Dolores. Dolores finishes reading the note for a third time when Terrill taps on Dolores's door. They show each other affection through the door until Otto and Stanley interrupt Terrill infuriated with him. The girls then start gossiping about guys and they begin to talk about the struggles between Dolores and Randall. Stanley and Terrill have a conversation about how Terrill gets all these girls to like him. Dolores then writes a note but hides it as Randall enters. Randall speaks of not wanting to lose Dolores. Lester arrives inviting everyone to Toto's big after-party as Arnold leaves to get gelatins. Arnold comes back and runs into Stanley and Terrill talking about girls Terrill has wooed. Arnold notices a picture of a girl that Terrill has been with and asks about her, but Terrill hardly remembers her. Arnold speaks to Steve about technical things and a call boy arrives saying there is a girl who wants to see Terrill. Mary Ann then comes in and tells Terrill that he must marry her. Terrill shoves her and she hits the stairway, screams, and faints. Paradise runs in and tries to help Mary Ann. Arnold then runs in and states who she is and helps as well. The rest of the girls crowd around and the scene closes with Paradise warning Dolores that she could be next. Scene two opens with Stanley interrogating Paradise. She tells him what she saw and Stanley then moves on to interrogate the hoofers. Terrill arrives from the stage and Paradise confronts him. Terrill threatens her but she doesn't back down so he leaves for his dressing room. Stanley tells Terrill he found a letter addressed to him, but doesn't know who it's from. Terrill lies saying it's probably from Flo. He then reads the letter. Meanwhile, the girls are calming Paradise down as she is extremely angry. She has a suspicion that Terrill was involved in Mary Ann's rough past, but she isn't going to ask questions because she fears her safety will be in danger. Terrill then meets with Dolores and they embrace. Randall comes and catches them together. He threatens Terrill's life and the curtain falls. Act Three The first scene of the third act opens in Toto's apartment for the party. Some boys are making small talk and Stanley, Bill and Chuck talk about the party. Toto shows up and mentions how happy he is that everyone came to his party. Terrill and Dolores arrive together and Stanley greets them. He asks where Randall is, but Terrill quickly changes the subject. The doorbell then rings and Randall barges in drunk asking where Dolores is. Toto and Stanley insist that she isn't at the party and they get him to leave quietly ending scene one. Scene two opens with the chief of police interrogating Steve about the murder of Terrill. Steve mentions the confrontation between Randall and Terrill at the theatre when Randall caught Terrill with Dolores. The chief then asks Toto why he threw the party and if Terrill was around. Toto mentions that Terrill was with Dolores the whole time. The chief then interrogates Dolores about Terrill and where her husband was. She mentions that she couldn't help but fall for Terrill and she did not see her husband at the party. Paradise brings up the fact that he showed up drunk. Randall does not remember anything after he left the party and Stanley argues that Terrill deserved to be killed. The chief arrests Randall. Paradise states that Terrill deserved his death after he struck down Mary Ann, which is revealed to be Ted Arnold's sister. The chief asks who Arnold is. Stanley tells him and just as the chief states the report of Randall's arrest, an officer arrives with Arnold in handcuffs stating that they found the killer. Arnold then states that he saw his sister's picture in Terrill's dressing room and knew that Terrill had been using her and found out that Terrill was the one who struck her earlier. He says that he did not want to kill him, just torture him. He had attempted to perform a surgery on Terrill that they would do on rats and other creatures in college \\"so that they could never propagate their own kind\\", but this resulted in his death. The play ends with Arnold telling the cops to take him away, his is ready to go.

Early life  Erel Margalit was born in kibbutz Na'an, the eldest of three siblings. His father, Itzik Margalit, was an officer in the IDF Armored Corps and one of the founders of moshav Kfar Haim, and his mother, Mickey, was a founding member of moshav Avihayil. On his mother's side, he is descended from Jews who immigrated to what was then Ottoman Palestine from Bulgaria in the 19th century, prior to the beginning of the First Aliyah. He is a descendant of Shmuel Tagir, one of the founders of Tel Aviv. In 1969, when Margalit was eight years old, the family was sent on a mission to Detroit, Michigan where his father was head of a local Hebrew school.Meet the MK:Erel Margalit While in high school in Michigan, Erel became a point-guard on a local basketball team. After returning to Israel in 1971, the family settled in Karmiel before moving to Jerusalem. He attended Rene Cassin High School and continued to play basketball there.

Social entrepreneurship = In the Community (Bakehila)  In 2002, Marglit founded the social organization Bakehila (◊ë◊ß◊î◊ô◊ú◊î \\"In the Community\\" in Hebrew) as a means of reducing the socio-economic gap affecting disadvantaged children in Jerusalem. Bakehila runs educational programs in lower socioeconomic neighborhoods of Jerusalem with the goal of raising the students' academic achievements, and promoting the children's personal and interpersonal growth. Thousands of students from Jerusalem have attended the program during its first eight years. In 2012, Bakehila opened an educational enrichment center in the Arab neighborhood of Beit Safafa. In 2018, Bakehila began working in underprivileged neighborhoods in Kiryat Shmona.Beit Safafa education center dedicated  The Lab (Hama'abada)  Following the events of the Second Intifada and the massive departure of young artists from Jerusalem, Erel Margalit created The Lab (Hama'abada) to keep and attract young artists in Israel's capital. The Lab provides support and assistance to these artists, providing venues for young Israelis to create, perform, and receive feedback on their work. Today, The Lab is the Jerusalem music club and restaurant, Zappa.  Political career = 2005 elections  During the 2005 election campaign, Margalit was one of the first businessmen to support Amir Peretz in the general elections. He joined the Labor Party and expressed his support of Peretz's social agenda. Margalit promoted his vision of economic growth whereby the ultra-Orthodox and Arab populations would be integrated in the labor market in Israel, thus taking them out of poverty and alleviating pressure on the middle classes. In addition, Margalit presented a plan for bringing the communities of Israel's geographic periphery closer to the center of the country, both economically and socially.  Avoda Now Movement  Since his initial support of the Labor Party, Margalit grew disillusioned with the direction of the party and its leadership. On January 17, 2011, the Chairman of the Labor Party, Ehud Barak, announced his resignation from the Labor Party and the establishment of a new party ‚Äì \\"Atzmaut\\" (Independence Party). Two days after this announcement Margalit helped to found the \\"Avoda Now\\" movement together with prominent members of Israel's business, technology, and cultural community, calling for a revival of the Labor Party. The movement launched a public campaign calling the people to join the Labor party lines; with the aim of renewing its institutions, restoring its social values, and choosing a new, dynamic leadership. On April 27, 2011, saying he could \\"no longer watch from the sidelines as the political situation in Israel deteriorates\\", Margalit announced his intention to run for the chairmanship of Israel's Labor Party.  In the Knesset  On 5 February 2013 Margalit became a Member of the Israeli Knessethttp://www.erel.org.il/?p=2555 and currently serves as a member of the prestigious Finance Committee and the Science and Technology Committee. He has been called the richest member of the Knesset.Jerusalem Post, June 10, 2016 Margalit was especially active in the 2013 budget discussions criticizing its lack of economic growth engines (See ), and called to cancel the bi-yearly budget.http://www.themarker.com/news/politics/1.1938535 He also led the Opposition on the discussions of the \\"HARIKUZIUT\\" bill, aimed to target the over-concentration and centralization in the Israeli economy.http://www.themarker.com/news/politics/1.2047565http://www.themarker.com/news/politics/1.2049683 Margalit chairs the Parliamentary Task Forces for Economic Development in the North and the Negev,http://www.local.co.il/haifa/106691/article.htm Civilian Cyber Protection and Combating Living Costs in Israel, and co-chairs the Parliamentary Task Force for Small and Medium Businesses, Integrating the Ultra-Orthodox in the High-Tech Sector, Employment for the Arab-Israeli Sector, 40+ Employment , and the Task Force for the City of Jerusalem where he often criticizes the Israeli Government's policy of worrying about Jerusalem's borders but ignoring its content and neglecting its poor economic status.

Topley is a right-handed batsman who bowls left-arm medium-fast. Background He was born on 21 February 1994 in Ipswich. He was educated at the Royal Hospital School. His father, Don Topley, was a first-class cricketer for Essex and Surrey. His father was also one of his teachers at Royal Hospital School, where he is a master of cricket. His uncle, Peter Topley, was also a first-class cricketer. Domestic career In June 2009, aged 15, Topley made the headlines when he was injured bowling in the nets at Loughborough University to England batsman Kevin Pietersen. Pietersen flat drove a delivery, which ended up striking Topley on the side of the head, knocking him to the ground. He was taken to Leicester Royal Infirmary where he required stitches to his ear and was kept in hospital overnight. Following the incident, Pietersen, whom Topley cited as his favourite player, gave the youngster his cricket bat with his signature on. A product of the Essex youth cricket system, Topley made his first-class debut for Essex against Cambridge MCCU in the 2011 season. He impressed on County Championship debut against Kent, taking his maiden five wicket haul when he took figures of 5/46 in Kent's second-innings of the match. In the following championship match against Middlesex he his second five wicket haul, with figures of 5/64 in Middlesex's first-innings. In May 2011, he signed a one-year professional contract with Essex. That month also saw Topley make his List A debut against the Unicorns in the Clydesdale Bank 40, with Topley claiming his maiden wicket in that format, that of Robin Lett. Mid-season Topley took a break from county cricket to return to Royal Hospital School to revise for his summer exams. However, during his break he was called up to play for England Under-19s for their Youth One Day International series against South Africa Under-19s. He returned to action for Essex in August, to date he has played two List A matches and nine first-class matches. He has made a good start to his first- class career, taking to date 34 wickets at an average of 23.55. The start to his career drew praise from former England captain Michael Vaughan, who stated that Topley could become a future Test cricketer. On 1 September 2015, Hampshire County Cricket Club confirmed the signing of Topley from Essex at the end of the 2015 season. At the end of the 2018 season and yet another stress fracture, Topley underwent back surgery. International career He made his Twenty20 International debut against Australia on 31 August 2015 and his One Day International debut, also against Australia, on 13 September 2015, taking figures of 0-33. He kept his place in the ODI side for the series against Pakistan and played in all four matches. He picked up his first international wickets in the first match and finished with figures of 3-26, although it wasn't enough to prevent an England defeat. He had picked up one wicket in each of the next three matches, with England winning all three games. He played in the 1st T20 international between the two sides, and finished with figures of 3-24. He continued his role in the ODI side for the tour of South Africa, and again played every game in the series. He took figures of 1-43 in the first game, as England won by 39 runs on the DL Method. In the next game he took figures of 4-50 to help England to back to back wins. England lost the next three games of the series, although Topley performed well, taking figures of 2-39 in the fourth match of the series and 3-41 in the final match, which South Africa won by 5 wickets. He played in both T20 internationals, although he didn't take a wicket in either game. He kept his place in the England side for the T20 World Cup, but was expensive in the first game against the West Indies, taking figures of 1-22 in 2.1 overs. He was expensive in the next match against South Africa, bowling two overs for 33 runs. He was replaced in the side by Liam Plunkett and did not play in the tournament again. Topley was part of that successful T20 squad that was defeated in the World Cup Final in India, but upon returning home was found to have a stress fracture in his back. On 29 May 2020, Topley was named in a 55-man group of players to begin training ahead of international fixtures starting in England following the COVID-19 pandemic. On 9 July 2020, Topley was included in England's 24-man squad to start training behind closed doors for the ODI series against Ireland. On 27 July 2020, Topley was named in England's squad for the ODI series.

He served as an admiral in the Royal Danish Navy under King Christian IV of Denmark. He became a property owner in Sunnhordland now Hordaland, Norway. Biography Mowat's parentage is unclear. Most genealogical historians believe that Mowat's parents were Barbara Saint Clair and Bartholomew Mowat; there is no documentation to support this, however. Mowat's father may have been Macolm Mowat, although there is no documentation to support or dispute this claim either. A document has been reported to exist, allegedly written during the year 1572, stating that the \\"Lord of Hugoland\\" was the second son of an unknown Mowatt of Swinie (Swinzie) from Caithness, but unfortunately, the first name of his father is not visible. However, an assertion exists on the social network aggregator website, Spokeo, that Mowat is a \\"descendant of the Mowats of Mont Hout, as described by his families ancestral Coat of Arms at Northhouse.\\" The Spokeo web page proposes two women as possible aunts-Agnes Mowat, who married Bartholomew Strang of Voisgarth, and Barbara Mowat, the wife of Thomas Leask of Auchmad). Historical Document The first mention of Andrew Mowat in any known sources is from 1558. He was married to Ursula Tulloch, the daughter of William Tulloch of Skea in Northmavine and thus became an important figure in local affairs. Mowat was an estate owner in Shetland, and mentioned as the lord of Hugoland. Since no Mowats are found in earlier Shetland sources, Mowat probably came from the mainland of Scotland in the early 1550s, and was one of the first Mowats to settle in Shetland. In addition to his landed estates in Shetland, which he transferred to his three eldest sons in 1577, Andrew Mowat was also a businessman, owning a number of merchant ships and doing trade with Norway and England. An \\"Andrew Mowat\\" is mentioned in a precept of sasine contained in a charter granted by Francis Bothwell, treasurer of Orkney, and Vicar of Unst, in favour of Barthol Strang of Voesgarth, on 12 November 1572.Francis J. Grant W.S, The County Families of the Shetland Islands Fru Inger of Austr√•tt Inger Ottesdotter R√∏mer (c. 1475‚Äì1555) was a wealthy landowner and important figure in Norwegian aristocracy. Inger held Austr√•tt and claimed the Giske estates as well as some of the Mel√∏y estates in Norway. In addition, she held the Papa and Papaquids estates in Shetland. Inger was widowed in 1523 and as did not live in Shetland, she appointed Ursula Tulloch's father William Tulloch to manage the estates for her. Around 1543, William Tulloch acquired the lease of \\"Papa & Papaquids\\" from Fru Inger. On William Tulloch's death, prior to 1558, his daughter Ursula was his heiress; there seems to be an agreement that the lease would pass to her and her husband Andrew Mowat of Hugoland. Andrew was appointed \\"tutor\\" to Ursula's brother, John Tulloch, in 1558, which indicates John was too young to take on the lease. After the death of Fru Inger of Austr√•tt in 1555, Robert Cheyne came to an agreement with the Norwegian proprietor over the \\"Papa Property.\\" He ejected Andrew and Ursula from the island and overturned their right to assume control of the income produced by Papa and Papaquids. The evidence for this come from letters written by Mary, Queen of Scots herself, to one Jens Split as the chief proprietor and the Norwegian authorities on behalf of Andrew and Ursula in September 1566. These papers refer to Andrew and Ursula's rights of possession. Queen Mary's letter had the desired effect, as it confirmed Andrew and Ursula's right to the lands of Papa and Papaquids. The confirmations were granted at different times between 1570 and 1576 by all the different proprietors. These arrangements were then confirmed in the Scottish courts. The Mowatts were also given the Great Seal of the Realm insuring their firm legal right to the lands of Papa and Papaquids. One of the privileges granted to Andrew Mowatt in 1577 was a right to build a house and fortress on Papa. Mowatt descendants at some time did build a residence there called 'Northhouse,' with the Mowat coat of arms visible on the gateway entrance. However, Andrew and Ursula Mowatt did not take residence there themselves, living instead in Ollaberry on Northmavine. The Great Seal In the Register of the Great Seal, on 27 March 1577, there is a confirmation by King James VI of a charter granted by Anders Mowatt in favour of John his eldest son, who stood to inherit 207- 3/8 merks land in Delting, 34¬Ω¬Ω in Aithsting, 3 in Walls, 8 in Tingwall, 35 in Yell, and 18 in Unst. If he did not inherit, failing then to Malcolm, second son of the granter, whom failing Patrick, third son, reserving always his own life rent and a life rent on half of the said lands to Ursula Tulloch, his spouse. The charter of confirmation also permits Andrew and John to construct a fortress of stone to defend against possible invaders. Family with Ursula This document, dated 1577, only names three of Andrew and Ursula's known five sons. The implication is that Malcolm and Patrick were either minors at the time the document was drawn up or they were born after the document was drawn up. Andrew and Ursula's five known children 1\\\\.

Marriage to Else Rustung and becoming Admiral in the Kings Navy Andrew's first wife Ursula died sometime between 1580 and 1586; in 1586 he applied to King James VI of Scotland for permission to travel to Bergen, Norway to marry. In June 1587, Andrew received permission to move to Bergen and find a suitable wife. It's possible that James VI hoped to place one of his own middle-ranked gentlemen into foreign society, that he might prove useful to the House of Stuart at a later date. Once in Bergen, Andrew married the twice widowed Else Christoffersdatter Rustung, daughter of the Admiral of the Danish-Norwegian Navy Christoffer Trondsson Rustung, a.k.a. Kristoffer Throndsen. Else Rustung had been married previously to Jon Haard of Gjersvik and Axel Fredriksen, and was a landowner herself, holding lands in Sunnhordland. Andrew Mowat thereafter served as an admiral in Christian IV's service in the North Sea until his death around 1610, returning to his native Shetland on numerous occasions. Many of Andrew's and Else's sons and grandchildren becoming senior naval officers. Andrew became an important landowner in Norway centering on Hovland in Tysnes. He owned several other farms in Sunnm√∏re, while still holding his lands in Shetland. He was also a ship-owner, owning several ships he had captained, and a trader of imports in Norway, Scotland and England. Family with Else 1\\\\.

One such is the Mortgage or deed of pawn papers signed on 20 June 1597, by both Anders and Else Mowat as the landowners.

Description of Document The deed is written on a folio sheet of strong handmade paper, and is in an excellent state of preservation. The writing is in an ordinary Norwegian hand of the period, and any difficulties in its style have been cleared up by the scholar, Mr. Kristian Koren, of Trondhjem. This document is a Mortgage, or more strictly a deed of pawn, equivalent to the old Scottish instrument of Vadset, of certain properties in Shetland. By this instrument, subjects enumerated in the document were not merely mortgaged in security, but were made over in real and corporal possession to the lender, only to be returned by him on payment of the borrowed money. The granters of the deed are Andrew Mowat/Mouat of Hugoland in Shetland, and his spouse Else Trondsdatter, who is declared to be owner of the lands in her own right. 20 June 1597. Letter to Elizabeth I On 12 August 1586, Andrew Mowat's home in Shetland was robbed in cash and goods by Captain of the pirates William Beare and the crew of the \\"Black Lyon\\". Other Shetlanders and ships were being robbed and plunered along the Scotland and Shetland coastline. Andrew as well as others wrote letter directly to Queen Elizabeth advising her of this. Andrew Mowat was again targeted in upon his return to Shetland in 1590 in a second raid where he once more lost money and goods. Mowat again wrote directly to the queen. The queen answered by saying that Captain Beare was dead and without the name of the pirate in the second raid there was nothing she could do. However, Andrew Mowat had a great deal of social credit in two other European Courts. Andrew was a joint subject of King James VI of Scotland and King Christian IV of Denmark-Norway. James writ to his new brother-in-law Christian about the Mowat case proposing that the goods of Englishmen in Denmark be laid under embargo until the restitution was forthcoming. Christian himself wrote a letter on behalf of Andrew and sent it to Elizabeth. Furthermore, Mowat himself was serving in the Danish Navy so could quite easily enforce this decision. A letter written by the Christian IV of Denmark on behalf of Andrew Mowat to Elizabeth I of England regarding pirate attacks on Andrew's ships and his home in Ollaberry. > \\"It pleasethe your heighnes to understand that I, Andres Motte, esqueyer, > retayner, and subjecte under the Kynges majestie of Denmarcke, and, for > carten causes which God hathe appoynted, dwellinge at this present in his > majestie realme of Norway, which am of layte yeres come oute of Shottland, > in which place my landes, goodes, and inheritance doth lye and remayn which > God hath geyven me to enierett of my progeniteis, gevinge your most excelent > heighnes my greatte sorowe and heavei complaynt to understande that I have > benne two seaverall tymes spoyled and robede with Inglysh men dwelling > within your majestie realme of Ingland, unto my greate heyndrance and lose > of manie houndrthe dolleris.

The battle was waged in Hankou and Hanyang, which along with Wuchang collectively form the tri-cities of Wuhan in central China. Though outnumbered by the Qing armies and possessing inferior arms, the revolutionaries fought valiantly in defense of Hankou and Hanyang. After heavy and bloody fighting, the stronger loyalist forces eventually prevailed by taking over both cities, but 41 days of determined resistance by the Revolutionary Army allowed the revolution to strengthen elsewhere as other provinces defied the Qing Dynasty. The fighting ended after the commander-in-chief of the Qing forces, Gen. Yuan Shikai, agreed to a cease-fire and sent envoys to peace talks with the revolutionaries. Political negotiations eventually led to the abdication of the Last Emperor, the end of the Qing Dynasty and the formation of a unity government for the newly established Republic of China. Background 1915 Map of the tri-cities of Wuhan, with Hankou (Hankow) to the upper left, Hanyang to lower left and Wuchang, across the Yangtze River to the right. Hankou and Hanyang are divided by the Han River. Dazhimen (Ta-tche-men) Station is on the Beijing-Hankou (Peking-Hankow) Railway in Hankou. The green patch just south of the Han River represents the Guishan (Kwei-shan) Heights of Hanyang. On October 10, 1911, revolutionaries in Wuchang launched an uprising against the Qing Dynasty. They quickly seized Hankou and Hanyang, on the north bank of the Yangtze River, and made Li Yuanhong their commander. On October 14, the Qing court in Beijing ordered Yinchang and Feng Guozhang to lead the Beiyang Army, the strongest military unit of the regime, against the uprising in Wuhan. Sa Zhenbing, commander of the Qing Navy, was ordered to sail from Qinhuangdao to Shanghai and then up the Yangtze River to Wuhan to assist with military operations. The Qing court also recalled Yuan Shikai, the founder of the Beiyang Army, from retirement and made him the Viceroy of Huguang, but did not initially vest him with formal powers. Yuan had been forced into retirement in 1908 because the court feared that he wielded undue influence. The Battle of Hankou The Imperial Beiyang Army traveling by rail to recapture Hankou. Soldiers of the Revolutionary Army marching past residents in Wuchang. Yinchang, a Manchu noble, reached Hankou by rail and attempted to seize control of the city's northern suburbs. On October 18 more than 1,000 revolutionary fighters attacked Liujiamiao, a train station guarding the northern approach to Hankou, but were driven back and retreated to Dazhimen.(Chinese) Chen Guangyuan, \\"Ê≠¶ÊòåËµ∑‰πâÂíåÈò≥Â§èÊàòÂΩπËø∞ËØÑ (3)\\" „ÄäÂÜõ‰∫ãÂéÜÂè≤„Äã 2011-03-19 In the afternoon the revolutionaries regrouped and, with the help of railway workers, ambushed a train carrying Qing troops heading south. The train derailed and sent the Qing troops fleeing, and more than 400 were killed by revolutionaries. The following day the revolutionary forces, supplemented by enthusiastic volunteers, grew to more than 5,000 and captured Liujiamiao. The revolutionaries on October 20 tried to press on to Wushengguan further north but were driven back with serious losses. Nevertheless, their victory at Liujiamiao boosted the morale of the revolutionary movement. On October 22 Hunan and Shaanxi Province both declared their independence from the Qing regime. Following the setback at Liujiamiao, the Qing court removed Yinchang from command and handed formal power to Yuan Shikai, whose lieutenants in the Beiyang Army, Feng Guozhang and Duan Qirui, headed the 1st and 2nd Armies moving on Wuhan, respectively. On October 26, the Beiyang Army moved swiftly south by rail and attacked the northern suburbs of Hankou with heavy artillery and machine guns. The revolutionaries suffered over 500 killed in action and were also hampered by indecisive leadership from Zhang Jingliang, who was suspected of collaborating with the Qing government. The revolutionaries lost and then regained Liujiamiao, only to lose it to Qing troops for good on October 27. The Qing armies pressed into the city and the two sides engaged in fierce house-to-house fighting. On October 28 Huang Xing and Song Jiaoren, two leaders of the Tongmenghui or Revolutionary Alliance, arrived in Hankou from Shanghai to support the revolutionaries. On the 29th Huang led over 1,000 reinforcements to Wuchang, which had 6,000 revolutionaries holding out against superior Qing forces. Due to inferior arms the revolutionaries suffered heavy casualties, but were supported by local residents. In retaliation, Feng Guozhang ordered the razing of Hankou.(Chinese) \\"Èò≥Â§èÊàò‰∫âÔºöÊîπÂèò‰∏≠ÂõΩÂëΩËøêÁöÑË°ÄÊàò‰πã‰∏Ä[Âõæ]\\" 2010-07-15 The fire burned for three days and destroyed much of the city.

The Qing Navy had also defected, sending some ships to assist the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Revolutionary Army's siege of Nanjing and other ships to support the revolutionaries in Wuhan. In Hanyang the revolutionaries had 13,000 soldiers arrayed against 30,000 Qing troops across the Han River in Hankou. Huang Xing, against the advice of Sun Wu and others who favored defending Hanyang, attempted to retake Hankou. Yuan Shikai, on the other side of the river, was determined to press the Qing military's local advantage to halt the momentum of the revolution nationwide. On November 17 the revolutionaries shelled Hankou from the Guishan heights in Hanyang and crossed the Han River in a two-pronged attack. The revolutionaries' artillery was inaccurate and their right flank was halted by an artillery barrage from the Qing army. The left flank crossed the river alone, met stiff resistance from superior Qing forces, and was forced to retreat on the evening of the 18th, having suffered over 800 casualties. The Battle of Hanyang The Revolutionary Army firing from entrenched positions at Shilipu in Hanyang. On November 21 the Qing armies launched their invasion of Hanyang. One force bypassed the revolutionaries' defense by striking from Xiaogan further to the west. The two sides clashed at Sanyanqiao. On November 22 another Qing force managed to cross the Han River from Hankou and eventually captured the strategic heights in Hanyang. The revolutionaries twice sent reinforcements from Wuchang across the Yangtze River to Hanyang but suffered heavy casualties en route. Another group of revolutionaries in Wuchang planned to cross the Yangtze River to Hankou and then attack Liujiamiao behind Qing lines, but the commander of this group was drunk and did not join the assault force, which faced heavy Qing artillery barrages from the opposite bank and could not land. The Hunan reinforcements were so disgusted by what they perceived as efforts by the Hubei revolutionaries to preserve their strength, that they left the front lines and returned to Hunan, despite efforts by Li Yuanhong to clarify the misunderstanding. After seven days and nights of fierce house-to-house combat, the Qing forces gradually fought their way into the city center, capturing the Hanyang munitions factory and the revolutionaries' artillery positions on Guishan. On November 27, the revolutionaries retreated from Hanyang. Over 3,300 revolutionary fighters and residents died defending Hanyang. Cease-fire The Revolutionary Army with the 19-Point Army Flag, outside the headquarters of the Republic of China Military Government in Wuchang in 1911. At the end of November Feng Guozhang and Duan Qirui prepared and submitted plans to Yuan Shikai to take Wuchang.(Chinese) Chen Guangyuan \\"Ê≠¶ÊòåËµ∑‰πâÂíåÈò≥Â§èÊàòÂΩπËø∞ËØÑ (4)\\" „ÄäÂÜõ‰∫ãÂéÜÂè≤„Äã 2011-03-19 \\"Centenary of China's 1911 Revolution\\" Accessed 2010-05-03 By then, despite Qing advantages in Wuchang, Sichuan had seceded from the Qing regime and revolutionaries were threatening to take Nanjing and Shanxi. On the evening of December 1 Yuan Shikai agreed to a three-day cease-fire and began talks with the revolutionaries in Hankou. The cease-fire was extended by another three days, then by 15 days, and finally to the end of December. On December 18 Yuan sent envoys on behalf of the Qing court to negotiations in Shanghai. On December 25, 1911, Sun Yat-Sen returned to Shanghai from exile, and founded the Republic of China on January 1, 1912. He agreed to hand over the presidency of the provisional government to Yuan Shikai in exchange for the latter's assistance in securing the abdication of the last Qing Emperor. When this was done on February 12, 1912, the Qing Dynasty formally ended its 267-year reign in China. With the cease-fire of December 1, 1911, the conflict moved from the military arena to the political one. This was a politically calculated decision of Yuan Shikai, who understood that if the revolution, which had him indispensable to the regime, were to be fully suppressed, he would again be destined to retirement. At the same time, at the Battle of Yangxia, he had demonstrated that his Beiyang Army was the most powerful in China. With his personal power at its height, he chose to maneuver politically to place himself at the top of the new political regime. Significance & aftermath Li Yuanhong and Sun Yat-sen in Wuchang in April 1912 after the Xinhai Revolution had succeeded in toppling the Qing Dynasty. During the 41-day battle, 13 other Chinese provinces joined the revolution and declared their independence from the Qing Dynasty. Peace talks were held in the British concession of Hankou and then moved to Shanghai in late December. The political negotiations eventually led to the abdication of the last Qing Emperor, Puyi, and the formation of a united provisional government of the Republic of China led by former loyalist Yuan Shikai and revolutionaries Sun Yat-sen, Li Yuanhong and Huang Xing. In October 1912 Yuan conferred honors to commanders on both sides of the battle for their contribution to the founding of the Republic. A memorial in Wuhan was built to commemorate those who lost their lives, including 4,300 unknown soldiers, in the battle.(Chinese) \\"ÁôæÂπ¥Á∫™Âøµ 60‰ΩôÂÆ∂Ëæõ‰∫•ÂêéË£î‰ª£Ë°®Ê≠¶Ê±âÂÖ¨Á•≠Ëæõ‰∫•ÁÉàÂ£´\\" 2011-03-29 Gallery The Japanese wartime artist T.
