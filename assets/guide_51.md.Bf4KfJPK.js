Based on autobiographical elements which constitute a kind of encyclopaedic view of Bernhard's world, this book gives a rare insight into the birth of a remarkable literary oeuvre paralleling that of Kafka and of Beckett. In fact, Sophie Wilkins, in her Afterword, compares it to Kafka's short story \\"Description of a Struggle\\". Written as one sentence, it is a monologue delivered by a court reporter who meets a variety of characters, among whom are a secondary school teacher ‚Äì the only intellectual ‚Äì an innkeeper, and various ladies who afford him favours or bully and humiliate him. His only true attachment is to his filthy dog. The dog is a dirty, smelly body detested by the housekeeper who wants him and his owner out, but it's precisely this indubitable physical reality of him that makes him indispensable; without it, there's no real life in his life, and therewith no ideas, no literature that means anything. On the Mountain is a special kind of prose: relieved of its function as a carrier of common information, it presents itself as some such medium as poetry, music, painting, sculpture. The seemingly random notes of this book, its disjunct, diffuse mutterings are the vehicle for a dramatic conflict between an embattled life force intent upon self-creation, self-definition, saying \\"All this is only a preparation for becoming me,\\" and its equally determined opposition, threatening to make nonsense of all that. A real sickness-unto-death is made into a fulcrum for survival in an arena which is the human condition understood as a condition of immitigable deadlock.Cf. Sophie Wilkins' Afterword, pp. 135-140, where she gives an in-depth appraisal of Bernhard's writing style. Criticism On its publication soon after Bernhard's death, On the Mountain was hailed as a \\"self-portrait of the artist as a young man\\" cast in the Schopenhauerian vein, and its high misanthropic tone and desolate humour do indeed anticipate all his subsequent work. Reviews described it as a \\"mighty prose poem,\\" a masterly \\"debut and valedictory in one,\\" an \\"early testament,\\" full of pessimism and comical bleakness‚ÄîBernhard's case against intellectualised irrelevance, gripping and humane, where the nihilism of the 20th century found its most uncompromising expression.Cf. Wilkins, p. 139. The critical importance of this work to Bernhard's development as a writer is precisely captured by Wilkins' Afterword: \\"The new-fledged court reporter of On the Mountain has been writing hundreds of poems but now begins to work on his first book as it comes to him, jotting down notes, splinters of ideas, observations, encounters, characters, feelings, out of these data making a loose net in which to catch the realities of his life. In the process he discovers the power of words, infinite combinations and permutations of words such as the German language, with its many-plied nouns, is uniquely capable of. He discovers words for their own sake. He can't stop for structured paragraphs or sentences, life is literally too short (what with his lung disease being aggravated by bunglers whom he sometimes has to instruct in the procedures, any treatment could mean the end of him). His writing has become synonymous with his breathing: it is his rescue attempt, trying to save his life, even if it is nonsense to keep struggling against the inevitable, nonsense to record the nonsense of life in the face of death.\\" Excerpt (punctuation and linebreaks as per original) \\"...frozen ponds: the dog, the damp bread, my heart is freezing: my streets, my woods, the things I've left undone: which fling me onto my bed: my restlessness: which drives me outside and into one Gasthaus after another, cold and restlessness are working against me and hurting me with their blows, so that some morning it will collapse, kill me, time has passed through me and distorted my abilities: devalued this notebook: my sorrow, as though I had said something that presupposes that I know what the soul is: without this discovery something much greater: there are only three: all of them are destroying me...\\" (p. 113) ~ * ~ \\"...the city of Salzburg has a child's face and an old man's face, so you don't spit in it, you don't spit in the child's face and you don't spit in the old man's face, senseless seasons, formalities, slanders: these infernal piles of documents against everything, my dog knows I'm going to kill him, nobody else knows it: nobody's going to have my dog.\\" (p. 116) Notes References *The Nihilism of Thomas Bernhard, by Charles W.

They were procured for duties between Frankfurt and Wiesbaden between 1909 and 1912. This long route between the two termini was to be worked without turning the locomotive. Because the engine tended to derail, in practice it was turned whenever possible. On these engines, supplied by Borsig, the boiler from the Prussian P 6 and the running gear and drive from the Prussian P 8 were used. The boiler had to be positioned further forward than was usual on other locomotives in order to even out the distribution of weight, because the design omitted any trailing wheels. The first trial runs took place on 30 June 1909. The Reichsbahn took over 11 machines of this class as their DRG Class 76, the engines were given numbers 76 001‚Äì011. The other locomotive (7404) was given to the Chemins de fer du Nord under the terms of the Versailles Treaty. Eight engines were taken over by the Deutsche Bundesbahn. Between 1945 and 1948 they were either retired or sold to private railways. In 1964 there were still six units on duty with the East Hanoverian Railway (OHE).

Lussenburg was a self-taught painter. Originally he was a professional musician: he was a music teacher at several music schools, played the violin, and was conductor of several choirs. Private life Lussenburg was born in Enkhuizen, a small fishing village at the west-coast of the former Zuiderzee, currently the IJsselmeer. After his marriage in 1917 to Jantje Langendijk, he moved to Meerssen in Limburg. The couple had three children: a girl, Baukje (born in 1918), and two boys, Hans and Loek, (born in 1920 and 1926, respectively). In 1918, Lussenburg's parents moved to Nunspeet, a village near the Zuiderzee south-coast and, after a family visit, Jos gave up his job as a teacher in the South to move with his family to Nunspeet because he loved it as a place to paint. Lussenburg's grandfather was a professional fisherman from Enkhuizen and he loved the romance of the rough live as fisher. He made many friends among the many fishermen in the villages and ports around the Zuiderzee. Due to the construction of the Afsluitdijk, completed in 1932, the Zuiderzee changed into a fresh-water lake: the IJsselmeer. The fishing industry fell into decline in all villages and towns around the new lake. Career When Lussenburg hurt his hand in 1923, an infection of a finger on his left hand ended his career as violin player and on advice of his wife he took up painting. But he never lost his love for the music and remained active as director of several choirs in villages near Nunspeet. Many of Lussenburg's paintings show the rough waves of the shallow Zuiderzee with one or more fishing sailing boats in action. Beside his paintings of fishing vessels at sea, he also painted portraits of old fishermen, farmers, beggars, and some self-portraits. His work was part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics. In 1963, he published a book called De stervende zee (The dying sea) about the end of the fishing industry in the former Zuiderzee. Later, in 1975, a book De stervende Zuiderzee (The dying Zuiderzee) dealt with the same problem. In the books, pictures of his paintings together with several stories about the life of the fishers. Exhibitions The paintings of Lussenburg have found their way into several museums about the Zuiderzee or IJsselmeer and there are two virtual expositions of his work on the internet.On-line exposition Lussenburg on Museum Nunspeet.nlDigital Exposition Jos Lussenburg References Category:1898 births Category:1975 deaths Category:People from Enkhuizen Category:20th-century Dutch painters Category:Dutch male painters Category:Olympic competitors in art competitions ","title":"Jos Lussenburg"},{"id":"20099854","text":"Il Sole 24 Ore Radiocor is an Italian business and financial news agency owned by the newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore with five offices in Rome, Milan, Turin, New York City and Brussels.

C. S. Trahair p326 established in 1896 at Cock Clarks, was a Tolstoyan anarchist colony that grew out of the Croydon Brotherhood Church. Initially based on a 10-acre plot, as the group grew the colony began to rent local cottages with land attached. The colony ran a printing press, publishing translations of Tolstoy and for a while The New Order magazine. For a time the colony sheltered some of the Doukhobors, forced to leave Russia to avoid political persecution. The colony was always a fissile mix, and began to break down towards the end of 1900; some colonists moves with the Doukhobors to Canada, while others went on to form the Whiteway Colony in Gloucestershire.

Stanciu and F. Hansteen and published in Physical Review Letters,C. D. Stanciu, Ph.D. Thesis, (2008) this effect is generally called all-optical magnetization reversal. This magnetization reversal technique refers to a method of reversing magnetization in a magnet simply by circularly polarized light and where the magnetization direction is controlled by the light helicity. In particular, the direction of the angular momentum of the photons would set the magnetization direction without the need of an external magnetic field. In fact, this process could be seen as similar to magnetization reversal by spin injection (see also spintronics). The only difference is that now, the angular momentum is supplied by the circularly polarized photons instead of the polarized electrons. Although experimentally demonstrated, the mechanism responsible for this all-optical magnetization reversal is not clear yet and remains a subject of debate. Thus, it is not yet clear whether an Inverse Einstein‚Äìde Haas effect is responsible for this switching or a stimulated Raman-like coherent optical scattering process. However, because phenomenologically is the inverse effect of the magneto-optical Faraday effect, magnetization reversal by circularly polarized light is referred to as the inverse Faraday effect. Early studies in plasmas, paramagnetic solids, dielectric magnetic materials and ferromagnetic semiconductors demonstrated that excitation of a medium with a circularly polarized laser pulse corresponds to the action of an effective magnetic field. Yet, before the experiments of Stanciu and Hansteen, all- optical controllable magnetization reversal in a stable magnetic state was considered impossible. In quantum field theory and quantum chemistry the effect where the angular momentum associated to the circular motion of the photons induces an angular momentum in the electrons is called photomagneton. This axial magnetic field with the origins in the angular momentum of the photons has been sometimes referred in the literature as the field B. M. W. Evans and J. P. Vigier, The Enigmatic Photon (Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1994) Magnetization reversal by circularly polarized light is the fastest known way to reverse magnetization, and therefore to store data: magnetization reversal is induced on the femtosecond time scale - that translates to a potential of about 100 TBit/s data storage speeds.

It superseded the earlier Reffye cannon (1870/73) and the Lahitolle 95 mm cannon (1875). Characteristics The cannon was breech loading and used the original mushroom-shaped obturator system developed by de Bange, allowing to properly seal the breech during each firing.Field Artillery and Firepower by Jonathan B. A. Bailey, p.208 The cannon lacked a recoil system, meaning that the entire carriage moved backward when fired. Before firing again, the cannon had to be moved back into position and re-aimed, which greatly slowed the effective rate of fire. This would remain a problem with all artillery pieces until the development of the Canon de 75 in 1897. Replacement The de Bange 90 mm was used during World War I, although it was obsolete by then, as there were important stockpiles of ammunition and French industry fell short of producing enough modern cannons for the war.\\"The French responded to the ammunition crisis in early 1915 by reequipping one hundred batteries with the obsolete '90 de Bange' for which there were large reserve stocks of ammunition\\" in Field Artillery and Firepower by Jonathan B. A. Bailey, p.245 It was superseded by the Canon de 75. =British service= A number of these weapons were issued to some third- line British Territorial Force batteries at the start of World War I, for training and home defence duties, because of a shortage of more modern field guns. They were replaced in these units by Ordnance BLC 15 pounder guns, when second-line units were re-equipped with Ordnance QF 18 pounders.J D Sainsbury, The Hertfordshire Batteries of the Royal Field Artillery, Hart Books, Welwyn, 1996 (p.93)Appendix 3 in Maj A.F.

Only 24 guns arrived before the end of the war and rest during the Interim Peace. When Continuation War begun 84 guns were issued to fortification and coastal units. Finnish troops fired more than 174 000 shots with these cannons during Continuation War and last shots in battle were fired as late as in June 1944. =Naval service= In addition to its land role the de Bange 90 mm was converted to arm DEMS (Defensively Equipped Merchant Ships) against the U-boat threat during WWI. Conversion began in 1916 and a total of 1,740 guns were given naval mounts of which 1,430 were installed aboard French ships. The British were also offered 400 guns and 300 were converted by EOC for British naval use, with another 200 supplied to the French. The EOC modifications included mounting the gun on a U shaped gun cradle on an elastic mount similar to the type used by the 6-pounder. The muzzle of the gun was given a counterweight and a hydro-pneumatic recoil mechanism was fitted above the barrel. For aiming a shoulder pad was provided and the gun could be elevated between -10¬∞ to +35¬∞ with 360¬∞ traverse. Photo gallery File:De Bange 90 mm Sotamuseo 2.JPGDe Bange 90 mm cannon.

Bazhanov was the personal secretary of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin from August 1923 to 1925 and held several prominent secretarial positions in the Politburo until defecting from the Soviet Union in 1928. Bazhanov was granted French citizenship and survived subsequent Soviet assassination attempts, writing and publishing memoirs and books from 1930 about Stalin and the secrets behind the Stalin regime. Bazhanov was the only member of Stalin's Secretariat to defect, and one of the first major defectors from the Eastern Bloc.  Early life  Boris Georgiyevich Bazhanov was born on 9 August 1900, in Mogilev-Podolskiy, Russian Empire (present-day Vinnytsia Oblast, Ukraine). He was the son of a physician. Bazhanov was 16 years old upon the beginning of the Russian Revolution in March 1917. Bazhanov's native Ukraine witnessed some of the worst splintering of power, and the Ukrainian territory was fought over continuously by various ideological factions during the Ukrainian Civil War. In 1918 Bazhanov graduated from high school, and that September entered the University of Kiev despite the political situation. However, the university was closed shortly after his arrival, and during a student protest of the closure, Bazhanov was shot and returned home to recover.  Communist Party membership  Bazhanov joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) in 1919, recalling later that he'd had to choose between Ukrainian nationalism and communism. He later wrote he had rejected Ukrainian nationalism because he had been raised with the Russian culture. He was elected district secretary and climbed the CPSU ranks in Ukraine. In November 1920, Bazhanov went to Moscow and studied engineering. The Ukraine's political disputes ended in a victory for the communists and the territory split among the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Romania. In 1922, the Ukrainian SSR joined the Soviet Union as one of its constituent republics. Bazhanov applied to the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the highest policy-making authority within the CPSU, for a technical position. Bazhanov's application was accepted by Ivan Ksenofontov, a prominent member of the Soviet Union's state security apparatus. On 9 August 1923, Bazhanov was appointed as the personal secretary and assistant to Joseph Stalin, the General Secretary of the CPSU. The decision read: \\"Comrade Bazhanov is named assistant to Joseph Stalin and a secretary of the CC.\\" Stalin's assistant As General Secretary Stalin's assistant, Bazhanov became Secretary of the Politburo and was responsible for taking notes of the meetings.Bajanov 2003: 2‚Äì3 On 26 October 1923, Bazhanov took notes at a Central Committee meeting attended by Stalin, Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin, and Leon Trotsky, at a time when Lenin was very ill and just three months before his death. During the meeting, Lenin offered to appoint Trotsky as his \\"heir.\\" According to Bazhanov's notes, Trotsky refused the position of deputy leader because he was Jewish, reasoning \\"We should not give our enemies the opportunity to say that our country was being ruled by a Jew. ... It would be far better if there was not a single Jew in the first Soviet revolutionary government.\\" Bazhanov's notes were discovered in early 1990 by Soviet historian Victor Danilov and were seen as providing the answer to a long-asked question about the Bolshevik Revolution: why Trotsky refused Lenin's offer to name him heir-apparent. After Lenin's death in January 1924, Stalin, Lev Kamenev, and Grigory Zinoviev together governed the CPSU as a triumvirate, placing themselves ideologically between Trotsky (on the left wing of the party) and Nikolay Bukharin (on the right). Bazhanov was Stalin's personal secretary at the beginning of his power struggle with Trotsky and rise to becoming the undisputed leader of the Soviet Union. Trotsky was eventually forced into exile in Mexico, where he was later assassinated in 1940 by Ramon Mercader, a pro-Stalin agent. From 1923 to 1924, Bazhanov attended all of the Politburo meetings, working in Stalin's Secretariat of the CPSU Central Committee and for the Politburo until the end of 1925.Kun 2003: 93Bajanov 2003: 4‚Äì5 In the early 1920s, Bazhanov's role in Stalin's inner circle was smaller than that of the \\"group of five\\" composed of Yakov Brezanovsky, Ivan Tovstukha, Amayak Nazaretyan, Georgy Kanner, and Lev Mekhlis, but his influence with Stalin increased after Brezanovsky and Nazaretyan left the secretariat, and he held various positions at the Politburo from 1925 until 1928.Kun 2003: 285‚Äì286Kun 2003: 93, 286  Defection  On 1 January 1928, Bazhanov defected from the Soviet Union after becoming disillusioned with communism and dissatisfied with working under Stalin. Bazhanov scheduled a business trip to the Soviet Union's territory in Central Asia and crossed the border into Iran. Bazhanov defected the same year that the first of Stalin's Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union was accepted, avoiding the first purges that led up to the Great Purge in the mid-to-late 1930s. Bazhanov was the only member of Stalin's Secretariat who would turn against the Soviet regime, and subsequently he was granted asylum in France.Kun 2003: 296, writing \\"Bazhanov, the only assistant at Stalin's secretariat who later turned against the Soviet regime, mentions a number of such cases ...\\" Bazhanov became an enemy of Stalin and an enemy of the state through his defection, and was subject to numerous assassination attempts during the remainder of his life. Soviet security agencies immediately launched a manhunt for Bazhanov led by Georges Agabekov, the chief Soviet spy in the Near East at that time, until Agabekov himself defected to France shortly afterwards in June 1930. The Iranian authorities protected Bazhanov from the Joint State Political Directorate, the Soviet secret police, who had sent agents from Moscow to assassinate him. However, Bazhanov learned that an agreement was reached between Iran and the Soviet Union through diplomatic channels to extradite him back. Bazhanov left his detention and illegally crossed the Iranian-Indian border, from where he moved to France with the help of the British authorities. In October 1929, Stalin ordered assassin Yakov Blumkin to travel via Paris to kill Bazhanov before travelling to the island of B√ºy√ºkada in Istanbul, Turkey to assassinate Trotsky, who had been deported from the Soviet Union in February 1929. With the help of his cousin and GPU informer Arkady Maximov, Blumkin staged a car accident to kill Bazhanov, however the plot failed. Bazhanov also recalled a later assassination attempt in 1937, stating that a \\"Spaniard, doubtless an anarchist or communist, tried to stab me as I was returning home, as I did each evening, after having left the car in the garage.\\"  Later life and death  Allegedly, upon the outbreak of World War II, Bazhanov had attempted to organize a legion of anti-communist Russian √©migr√©s and Soviet prisoners of war to fight with the Finnish Army in the Winter War against the Soviet Union, but the plan never became reality as the war ended before it was properly organized. On the eve of Operation Barbarossa, Bazhanov visited Berlin and met with Alfred Rosenberg, the head of the Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories of Nazi Germany, and his deputy Georg Leibbrandt. Rosenberg was studying the possibility of using Bazhanov to form a new government in the Soviet Union's territory, but Bazhanov was skeptical of Germany's plans and returned to Paris. In the conclusion of the 1978 book The Storm Petrels: The Flight of the First Soviet Defectors, Bazhanov remarked on \\"the twisted path of Marxism\\": > You know, as I do, that our civilization stands on the edge of an abyss ... > Those who seek to destroy it put forth an ideal. This ideal [of communism] > has been proven false by the experience of the last sixty years ... the > problem of bringing freedom back to Russia is not insoluble ... the youth of > Russia no longer believe in the system, despite the fact that they have > known nothing else. If the West [develops its] confidence and unity, [it] > can win the battle for our civilization and set humanity on the true path to > progress, not the twisted path of Marxism. Bazhanov published an edition of his memoirs in France in 1980, entitled Memoirs of a Secretary of Stalin's. He died in the 4th arrondissement of Paris on 30 December 1982, and is buried at Pere Lachaise cemetery.  Criticism  Candidate of history Yuri Emelyanov (:ru:–Æ—Ä–∏–π –í–∞—Å–∏–ª—å–µ–≤–∏—á –ï–º–µ–ª—å—è–Ω–æ–≤) in his book \\"Stalin before the pygmy court\\" analyzes in detail the second edition of Bazhanov's memoirs, eventually coming to the conclusion that it is a gross forgery, \\"unabashed lies\\" and contains many historical distortions, assuming the version that it was not written by Bazhanov, fabricated in Soviet circles in the United States or great Britain and badly translated from English, while at the same time noting the authenticity of the publication of Bazhanov's original memoirs of the 20s. Editions of Bazhanov's memoirs =Retracted parts of the first edition= The 1930 edition of Bazhanov's memoir had him becoming an anti-communist well before he came to Moscow and took up positions with the Central Committee. In later editions, Bazhanov retracted these statements, explaining that in reality he soured on the communist ideology during 1923 to 1924, while working at the Central Committee. However, he was bound to protect his closet-dissident friends remaining behind in the USSR, by casting himself as a \\"lone avenger\\" figure. =List of editions=     See also * List of Soviet and Eastern Bloc defectors Notes References * (As translated and/or interpreted by ) * Category:1900 births Category:1983 deaths Category:People from Mohyliv-Podilskyi Category:People from Mogilyovsky Uyezd (Podolian Governorate) Category:Bolsheviks Category:Comintern people Category:Joseph Stalin Category:People of the Russian Civil War Category:Soviet defectors Category:Volunteers in the Winter War Category:Burials at P√®re Lachaise Cemetery Category:Russian whistleblowers ","title":"Boris Bazhanov"},{"id":"20100167","text":"The Triumph TSX was a British motorcycle credited by the factory as being designed in 1981‚Äì1982 by Triumph Motorcycles America (TMA), the factory's American arm. Steve Wilson's British Motorcycles Since 1950 and Lindsay Brooke and David Gaylin's Triumph Motorcycles In America specifically credit Wayne Moulton, TMA's president, as the designer as he was responsible for the earlier, successful and similarly styled 'LTD' series of motorcycles for his previous employers, Kawasaki. But factory correspondence shows Brenda Price, Moulton's predecessor, had earlier persuaded Brian Jones, Meriden's engineering director, to come up with a low rider-styled Triumph for the USA market, her having observed their US dealers' success at independently marketing such models. John Barclay of the factory had earlier designed a prototype low rider, the Phoenix, exhibited on the factory stand at the 1980 London Earls Court motorcycle show. This model with its rectangular headlamp and unusual instrument console was not produced.  Specification  Essentially a re-styled Triumph Bonneville, the \\"West Coast\\" styled TSX was distinguished by its lowered chassis and rear wheel with the engine offset in the frame to accommodate this. Other changes, whilst unique to the model, were cosmetic including stepped seat, black finished engine with polished fins, re- styled passenger grabrail, shortened front and rear painted mudguards, the latter having a black plastic extension for the larger UK vehicle numberplate, chromed shorty megaphone exhausts with the crossover pipe hidden between them under the bike and flowing thru 1.75\\" pipes, Morris alloy wheels (then made by Performance Machine) and 'retro' red/orange/yellow stripes outlined in the usual gold hand pinstriping. The stripes at first were adhesive-backed transfers, later in the run reverting back to being painted. Paioli rear suspension units, with black top shrouds, were sited at a more acute angle further back on the swinging arm to lower the seat height. A slightly lower rise and wider USA style handlebar was fitted and chromed Lucas turn indicators returned in place of the black plastic ULO items that had replaced them on other Triumph models from 1981. A chromed wire mounted Lucas headlamp with sealed beam was changed to the Lucas H4 later in the production run. A Brembo rear brake master cylinder was fitted in place of the usual Automotive Products (AP) Lockheed item which remained for the front, as well as supplying both calipers. Dual front discs were an option. Whilst the 1982‚Äì1983 brochure showed Goodyear Eagle tyres fitted, an Avon Roadrunner rear and Speedmaster front tyre went on production models, the tyres' lettering picked out in white. Although the German magazine Motorad road-tested a kick start-only version, the kickstart was an optional extra on the production TSX. The standard TSX engine was a T140ES (electric start) with two 32-mm Bing carburettors and electronic ignition. The engine was offset to accommodate the fatter rear tyre within the frame which also necessitated a unique swingarm and abbreviated chromed chainguard. The engine also benefitted from an updated crankshaft with more careful machining of the side areas of the bobweights; the result being greatly reduced vibration. The TSX fuel tank was a unique design for the model having only one Paioli left hand petrol tap situated ahead to accommodate the larger Bing carburettors. This tank also had a centralised filler hole with optional locking cap and a balance pipe situated on the front of the tank's underside. 1982 TSX at the London Motorcycle Museum with non-standard LH rear brake assembly fitted  Production  According to Triumph's records held by the Vintage Motor Cycle Club (VMCC), the first TSX was made on 18 June 1981. A total of 371 were produced with 200 shipped to the USA, 100 remaining in the UK and 71 to the rest of the world. Of these 371 units, approximately two-thirds were Gypsy Red in color, and the remaining one-third were Midnight Black. The factory, upon request, produced TSX with a pre-1975 right foot gear change/left foot rear brake assembly and an example of this can be seen at the London Motorcycle Museum. From the records as held by the VMCC, the last TSX was made on 21 December 1982.  Epilogue  From Triumph's brochures, the TSX, unchanged, was to have been included in the factory's unrealised 1984 range as the TSX4 with a similarly styled TSX8 with the eight valve engine from the Triumph T140W TSS alongside. Side panel badges added a '4' or '8' to reflect the new designations. Wayne Moulton who designed the TSX, had originally done so with the 8-valve TSS engine in mind. Although not fitted to the 1982‚Äì1983 production models, Dunlop tyres, of their 'Qualifier' design this time, were again shown on all USA -styled brochure models, the tyres' lettering again picked out in white. The TSX4 and TSX8 both retained the Avon tyres, fore and aft, as before. Production ceased with the closure of the Meriden works on August 23, 1983.

Due to this, the music critic Eduard Hanslick was highly critical of the waltz, saying that \\"with their lengthy eight-bar motifs, their groaning diminished seventh and ninth chords, [and] the thundering noise of their trombones and timpani, [they] are no longer appropriate for dancing.

Her story is set in the future on a post-apocalyptic Earth, where Nausica√§ is the princess of the Valley of the Wind, a minor kingdom. She assumes the responsibilities of her ill father and succeeds him to the throne over the course of the story. Fueled by her love for others and for life itself, Nausica√§ studies the ecology of her world to understand the Sea of Corruption, a system of flora and fauna which came into being after the Seven Days of Fire. Nausica√§'s abilities include determination and commitment. Her magnetic personality attracts admiration and adoration from nearly all those who meet her. Her empathy allows her to communicate with many animals. Nausica√§ joins a war between adjacent territories of the remaining inhabitable land. Assuming command of the Valley's small force sets her off on a journey that will alter the course of human existence. Many experts and manga enthusiasts have interpreted the character. Nausica√§ won the seventh Animage Grand Prix, and the June 1987 Grand Prix, coming second in May 1991, and again coming first in December 1992. In 2014, IGN ranked her as the ninth greatest anime character of all time, saying that \\"She is a genuine, charismatic character who is loved and respected by her people. But she's also a capable, though reluctant, warrior.\\" Character outline Although a skillful fighter, Miyazaki's Nausica√§ is humane and peace-loving. She has an unusual gift for communicating with the giant insects and is noted for her empathy toward animals, humans, as well as other beings. As an intelligent girl, Nausica√§ frequently explores the toxic wasteland, which surrounds the realms and conducts scientific experiments in an attempt to define the true nature and origins of the toxic world in which she lives. Her explorations are facilitated by her skill at \\"windriding\\": flying with an advanced glider-like craft called Mehve, equipped with a jet-assist. Development Nausica√§ has her origins in Miyazaki's aborted anime adaption of Richard Corben's Rowlf, a comic book about princess Maryara of the Land of Canis and her dog Rowlf. Miyazaki found similarities with Beauty and the Beast. The similarities inspired in him the desire to create a character to highlight the theme of \\"devotion, self-giving\\". Finding Corben's princess \\"bland\\", Miyazaki imagined \\"a young girl with character, brimming with sensitivity, to contrast her with an incapable father\\". Named by Miyazaki, short for Corben's Maryara, this character was a young princess left \\"bearing the crushing weight of her destiny\\" when her sick father abdicated, bestowing the burden of the kingdom on her and forcing her to bridle her personal aspirations. Miyazaki's Yara is initially portrayed with a dog \\"which always accompanied her from a young age and especially cared for his mistress\\". This pet dog is found in many design sketches of Yara but is omitted when the story develops. Canis valley eventually becomes Valley of the Wind and the pet dog is replaced with a fictional fox squirrel. Miyazaki intended Yara to wear short pants and moccasins, exposing her bare legs \\"to effectively show vigorous movements and a dynamic character\\", but he had to abandon that idea as it did not make sense to expose her legs in the harsh environment that began to evolve as he developed the setting for the story. The transition from Yara to Nausica√§ came when Miyazaki began to develop his own character, after the project to adapt Corben's comic fell through. The character went through a few intermediate phases in which the name was retained. Miyazaki had taken a liking to the name \\"Nausica√§\\" and he used it to rename his main character. The name comes from the Phaeacian princess Nausicaa of the Odyssey, who assisted Odysseus. The Nausicaa of the Odyssey was \\"renowned for her love of nature and music, her fervid imagination and disregard for material possessions\\", traits which Dani Cavallaro sees in Miyazaki's Nausica√§.Cavallaro, Dani (2006) \\"Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind\\" in The Anim√© Art of Hayao Miyazaki McFarland & Company p. 48 Miyazaki has written that he identified particularly with Bernard Evslin's description of the character in Gods, Demigods and Demons, translated into Japanese by Minoru Kobayashi. Miyazaki expressed disappointment, about not finding the same splendor in the character he had found in Evlin's book, when he read Homer's original poem. Hayao Miyazaki, the creator of Nausica√§ Another inspiration is the main character from The Princess Who Loved Insects, a Japanese tale from the Heian period, one of the short stories collected in the Tsutsumi Ch≈´nagon Monogatari. It tells the story of a young princess who is considered to be rather eccentric by her peers because, although of marriageable age, she prefers to spend her time outdoors studying insects, rather than grooming herself in accordance with the rules and expectations of the society of her era. The princess questions why other people see only the beauty of the butterfly and do not recognise the beauty and usefulness of the caterpillar from which it must grow. Miyazaki notes that the lady would not be perceived the same way in our own time as in the Heian period. He wonders about her ultimate fate, which isn't explained in the surviving fragments of the incomplete texts. Miyazaki has said that Evslin's Nausicaa reminds him of this princess, stating that the two characters \\"became fused into one and created the story\\". Miyazaki also said that Nausica√§ is \\"governed by a kind of animism\\". Miyazaki felt that it was important to make Nausica√§ a female because he felt that this allowed him to create more complex villains, saying, \\"If we try to make an adventure story with a male lead, we have no choice but to do Indiana Jones, with a Nazi or someone else who is a villain in everyone's eyes.\\" Miyazaki said of Nausica√§ that \\"[She] is not a protagonist who defeats an opponent, but a protagonist who understands, or accepts. She is someone who lives in a different dimension. That kind of person should be female, not male.\\" When asked about Nausica√§'s \\"vision and intellect far greater than other people's,\\" her \\"distinguished fighting skills,\\" as well as her leadership, including taking \\"the role of legendary savior,\\" Miyazaki said that he wanted to create a heroine who was not a \\"consummately normal\\" person, \\"just like you or everyone else around you.\\" Nausica√§'s affinity with the wind was inspired by translations of European geography books from the Middle Ages, where mastery of the wind was described as \\"witchcraft\\" and was feared and respected. Mills were described in these books as being used for \\"pushing sand dunes or grinding grain,\\" which left an impression on Miyazaki. Inspired by the Earthsea cycle of Ursula K. Le Guin, Miyazaki coined the term as an alternative to Guin's \\"Master Windkey\\", which was translated into Japanese as . Miyazaki had intended to make Yara more pulpy than his other female characters, a feature of sketches of her created between 1980 and 1982. However, he realised that he could not draw Nausica√§ nude without feeling like he should apologise, changing his idea of the story to be more \\"spiritual.\\" When Miyazaki draws Nausica√§ in poses which are a little \\"sexy\\", like the cover of Animage in March 1993, where Nausica√§ smiles while wearing a torn tank top, he cautions that \\"Nausica√§ never takes such a pose,\\" however this does not prevent him from drawing her like this, saying, \\"Well, if I hadn't drawn her as beautiful, there would have been some problems. I thought that I should settle down and draw her consistently, but every time I drew her, her face changed-even I was overpowered.\\" He felt that over the 14-year run of the manga, rather than Nausica√§ changing as a character, instead Miyazaki felt that he understood her better. When Miyazaki is obligated to draw Nausica√§ smiling for covers or character posters, he finds it difficult because \\"it does not match the character of [my] heroine.\\" He does not like \\"representing Nausica√§ as too radiant or with the attitudes typical of a heroine,\\" and imagines that instead of this, when she is alone, she has a \\"serious [...] calm and collected\\" (but \\"not surly\\") attitude. He regards her \\"sombre and reserved\\" nature to be offset by her femininity. Miyazaki believes that characters like this, \\"far from being fulfilled [...] are the most altruistic.\\" The kana Miyazaki chose to write Nausica√§'s name in, „Éä„Ç¶„Ç∑„Ç´ (nau Éika), follows the spelling used by Kobayashi for the translations of Evslin's work. Miyazaki prefers it to other transcriptions of Nausica√§ also in use, „Éé„Ç∑„Ç´ (no Éika) and „Éé„Ç∏„Ç´ (no íika). In English, the Greek name is normally pronounced , but in the soundtrack for the film it is . Helen McCarthy considers Shuna from Journey of Shuna to be prototypical to Nausica√§, and Dani Cavallaro feels Lana from Future Boy Conan and Clarisse of Castle of Cagliostro are also prototypical to Nausica√§. Plot overview The story of the manga, refined by Miyazaki over 13 years between February 1982 and March 1994, was published in the magazine Animage and collected into seven volumes. It is much more complex than the story told by the film. The film was developed in 1983, when Tokuma Shoten, the publisher of Animage, felt that the manga was successful enough to make \\"a gamble\\" at a film being economically viable. The film takes the context and characters, but the scenario is radically different from that of the manga, although many scenes from the manga (corresponding roughly to the first two volumes) were used with only slight changes. In the summary below, parts of the manga where Nausica√§ is absent have been omitted to focus on the character. =In the manga= Nausica√§ is the princess of the Valley of the Wind, a very small nation with fewer than 500 inhabitants (and steadily declining in population). She is the eleventh child of King Jihl and the only one to live to maturity. She is rarely seen without her Mehve or her companion, Teto the fox-squirrel. At the beginning of the manga, Nausica√§, the princess of the Valley of the Wind, is set to succeed her ill father, who can no longer go to war to honour an old alliance. Under the command of the princess of Tolmekia, Kushana, Nausica√§ needs to go to war against the Dorok Empire in a suicide mission across the Sea of Corruption. Delayed in the forest by the attack of Asbel, where she saves the insects, she encounters a tribe of Dorok and learns of their plans to destroy the Tolmekian army. She helps the baby Ohmu which was tortured by the Dorok to attract the insects to the Tolmekian army and her dress is stained blue with its blood. She is recognised as \\"The Blue Clad One\\", a figure in the Dorok mythos who is fated to cause a revolution in the world. Having awakened the old heretical legends, Nausica√§ becomes a mortal enemy of Miralupa, the younger of the two brothers who rule the Dorok Empire, who uses his mental powers to try to infiltrate her mind when she is weak. Miralupa is betrayed and murdered by his older brother, Namulith and at the doors of death, finds his redemption in the spirit of Nausica√§. Nausica√§ discovers that the Dorok are using a new fungus of the forest as a biological weapon to extend their reach. She arrives at an understanding of the role of the Sea of Corruption and its inhabitants in the process of purifying the Earth. When Namulith decided to forcefully marry Kushana to form a single empire under his rule she initially feigns acceptance but later rejects him and his proposal. His grand designs start to unravel. In a confrontation with Nausica√§, Namulith spitefully foists a rediscovered god-warrior off on Nausica√§ in revenge and shoulders her with the burden of taking care of the reactivated creature and the responsibility for saving the world. The god-warrior is a living weapon, an artifact from the ancient world which led to the Seven Days of Fire. Not knowing what to do with this immeasurably dangerous and uncontrollable creature who takes her for its mother, found at Pejite, then stolen by the Tolmekians and finally by the Dorok, Nausica√§ names the god-warrior Ohma. She decides to go with Ohma to the Crypt of Shuwa to seal all the technologies of the ancient world behind its doors. However, Ohma is damaged and crash lands near some ruins. Hidden within these ruins Nausica√§ discovers the Garden of Shuwa, a repository of seeds, animals, as well as cultural knowledge from previous ages. She goes through a test of character, as the Master of the Garden imitates her mother to tempt her to stay. She outwits the Master and learns the secrets of the Sea of Corruption and the Crypt. Meanwhile, Ohma, controlled by the Tolmekian Emperor Vuh, fights the Master of the Crypt. After cracking the crypt, Ohma dies of his wounds. Nausica√§ finally joins in destroying the foundations of the building, sealing the old technology inside. =In the film= After finding the shell of an Ohmu while collecting spores in the Toxic Forest, Nausica√§ rescues Master Yupa from an Ohmu that she pacifies. Lord Yupa gives Nausicaa a fox squirrel she names Teto. Upon returning to the Valley of the Wind, Obaba tells the legend of the Blue Clad One, who will walk in a field of gold and renew the lost link with the Earth. The next night, a Tolmekian airship is attacked by insects and crashes in the Valley of the Wind and Nausica√§ hears the last words of Lastel, a princess of the city of Pejite who wants the ship's cargo to be destroyed. When the people of the Valley of the Wind try to destroy the airborne spores of the Toxic Jungle, they note that a wounded insect that Nausica√§ reassured retreated back to the Toxic Jungle. The cargo of the Tolmekian ship, a hibernating god- warrior, is retrieved by the people of the Valley of the Wind and they are immediately visited by many Tolmekian ships and tanks who kill Nausica√§'s father King Jihl. The Tolmekians, led by Princess Kushana, intend to retrieve and awaken the god-warrior and use it to burn the Toxic Jungle. Obaba opposes this idea, saying that all who have tried to destroy the forest have been killed by the angry Ohmu and the jungle grew over their towns and bodies. However, to avoid a slaughter, Nausica√§ agrees to become Kushana's hostage and accompany her to rejoin the main Tolmekian army at the city of Pejite, which the Tolmekians have already conquered. During the journey, they are attacked by Lastel's brother Asbel, who almost destroys the entire fleet and is apparently killed. Mito, Nausica√§ and Kushana escape using the gunship and land in the jungle. Nausica√§ communicates with the Ohmu and discovers that Asbel is alive and she uses her glider to rescue him. They sink into the sands of the jungle and discover a non-toxic world beneath the jungle. Nausica√§ realizes that the plants of the jungle are purifying the soil and producing clean water and air.Sumi Shimamoto, the Japanese voice of Nausica√§ Actors Nausica√§ is voiced in Japanese by Sumi Shimamoto, who won the role after impressing Hayao Miyazaki with her performance of Clarisse in Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro. Patrick Drazen praised Shimamoto's acting in a scene where Nausica√§ stops an insect from diving into an acidic pool by getting in its way. She is burned by the acid and she screams. Drazen described this scream as being one which \\"tears at the listener and raises the bar for cartoon voices\\". In Walt Disney Pictures' English dub of the movie, Nausica√§'s voice was performed by Alison Lohman. Reception In a chapter dealing with \\"Female masculinity and fantasy spaces\\", Nausica√§ is described as being a \\"strong young female lead drawn strongly from the shoujo tradition\\", relating the story of a Takarazuka Revue playwright called Ogita who compares his work with Miyazaki's. For Ogita, it is most important that the heroines of Miyazaki are pure and asexual, to emphasise themes of purity and strength. who \\"takes charge\\" of her own life, Nausica√§ has also been said to have a \\"brave and wholesome\\" mind, and as \\"one of the best examples of a truly \\"empowered\\" female.\\" Stig H√∏gset found the too-perfect portrayal of Nausica√§ to be unrealistic. Susan J. Napier argues that as Nausicaa is the heroine of an epic, her competence, powers, and presentation as a messiah are not part of Nausicaa being an unrealistic character, but instead, she is real as a character inside the epic genre. In the beginning of the film, Nausica√§ is presented as \\"a mix of precocity and fairy-tale innocence\\", her innocence coming not from naivety but from scientific wonder. Early in the story, she kills the warriors who killed her father, which Susan J. Napier described as \\"genuinely shocking,\\" and Kaori Yoshida points to as evidence of Nausica√§ representing \\"traditional masculinity rather than femininity\\". When she avenges her father's death, the scene is \\"ambivalent\\" in its message, suggesting both \\"a masculine rite-of-passage\\" and \\"a moral object lesson\\", which makes Nausica√§ afraid of her own power. Nausica√§ later \\"comes to regret her vengeance\\" and becomes a diplomat to prevent further wars between the different states. Although Nausica√§ is a warrior, Nausica√§ acts \\"reassuringly cute\\" such as taming Teto and calling things \\"pretty\\", which contrasts her with San of Princess Mononoke. Inaga Shimegi feels that Teto's taming is the first glimpse of Nausica√§'s \\"supernatural ability of communication\\".http://shinku.nichibun.ac.jp/jpub/pdf/jr/IJ1106.pdf Thomas Zoth regards Nausica√§ as \\"Miyazaki's archetypal heroine\\" and notes shades of her in Ashitaka, San and Lady Eboshi of Princess Mononoke. A cosplayer donning on the character's costume for Lucca Comics & Games 2013. Opinion is divided as to whether Nausica√§ is sexualised or not - Napier notes that Nausica√§'s relationship with Asbel is \\"potentially erotic\\", but Kaori Yoshida says that Nausica√§'s body \\"is not the typical kind designed to stimulate\\" the male gaze. The quality of tapes on early fansubs lead to the rumor that Nausica√§ does not wear any pants. Yoshida presents Hiromi Murase's theory that Nausica√§ represents a post-oedipal mother figure. Susan J. Napier and Patrick Drazen note a parallel between the character of Kushana, the rival warrior princess, and that of Nausica√§: Napier describes Kushana as Nausica√§'s \\"shadow\\", noting that Kushana is not shown with any \\"alleviating, feminine\\" virtues as Nausica√§ is, but that they share the same tactical brilliance. Drazen describes this as a \\"feminine duality\\". Miyazaki has described the two characters as being \\"two sides of the same coin\\", but Kushana has \\"deep, physical wounds\\". Nausica√§ is presented as a messiah and also acts on an ideology of how to interact with the natural world. Her powers are presented as proof of the \\"rightness\\" of her \\"mode of thought\\". Unlike other characters who avoid or try to ignore the forest, Nausica√§ is scientifically and beatifically interested in the forest. Lucy Wright believes that Nausicaa's world-view reflects a Shinto worldview, as expressed by Motoori Norinaga: \\"this heaven and earth and all things therein are without exception strange and marvelous when examined carefully.\\" Wright believes that Nausicaa is presented as a \\"healing deity\\", as she is concerned with the space between purity and corruption, as well as atones for the wrongs of other people. In the manga, Nausicaa faces an old monk who says \\"the death of the world is inescapable\\" because of the folly of men, Nausicaa retorts: \\"Our God of the Winds teaches us that life is above all! And I love life! The light, the sky, the men, the insects, I love them all more than anything!!\\"Hayao Miyazaki ( trans. Olivier Huet), Nausica√§ de la vall√©e du Vent , vol. 4, Gl√©nat , coll. ¬´ Ghibli / NAUSICA√Ñ ¬ª, June 13, 2001, page 85 ( and 978-2-7234-3392-1 ) Later, she responds to the Guardian of the tomb of Shuwa who tries to tell her she is selfish for refusing the purification program of the old Earth and allowing the sacrifice of all the lives of the ancient world: \\"We can know the beauty and the cruelty of the world without the help of a giant tomb and its retinue of servants. Because our god, he lives in the smallest leaf and the smallest insect.\\"Hayao Miyazaki ( trans. Olivier Huet), Nausica√§ de la vall√©e du Vent , vol. 7, Gl√©nat , coll. ¬´ Ghibli / NAUSICA√Ñ ¬ª, March 20, 2002, page 208 ( et 978-2-7234-3395-2 ) Rapha√´l Colson and Ga√´l R√©gner see in these tirades a \\"world view which clearly calls to mind the spirit of Shinto\\".Rapha√´l Colson and Ga√´l R√©gner, (November 1, 2010) Hayao Miyazaki : Cartographie d'un univers, Les Moutons √©lectriques, p.297 When the god soldier is activated, he chooses Nausica√§ to be his \\"mother\\" and asks her who she wants him to kill. Marc Hairston considers this to be a recurring theme throughout the manga: Nausica√§ is given power and is told to make difficult decisions. In 2000, Nausica√§ placed eleventh in an Animax poll of favourite anime characters. The first daughter of Jean Giraud is named after the character. The character Nakiami from Xam'd: Lost Memories has been noted to bear many similarities to Nausica√§. Frederik L. Schodt believes that in the film, Nausica√§'s character became \\"slightly sweeter, almost sappy\\" and suggests that her \\"high voice\\" and the low camera angles which show the bottom of her skirt to be due to \\"an emphasis on 'prepubescent female cuteness' in commercial animation.\\" Marc Hairston reads the 1995 music video \\"On Your Mark\\" as being Miyazaki's \\"symbolic release\\" of Nausica√§. Rapha√´l Colson and Ga√´l R√©gner feel that Nausicaa had \\"to grow up faster than her age\\" because of her responsibilities, but that she acts with maturity, diplomacy, attention and resolve. They see her as \\"the princess of an idealised feudal system ... loved and respected by her subjects, ... feared and admired by her enemies.\\"Rapha√´l Colson and Ga√´l R√©gner, (November 1, 2010) Hayao Miyazaki : Cartographie d'un univers, Les Moutons √©lectriques, p.226 The character Rey from the 2015 film Star Wars: The Force Awakens has been compared to Nausicaa, with both having generally similar personalities and strikingly similar headwear.

It is listed in the Wagner-Werk-Verzeichnis as WWV82. Background Wagner was motivated by his enthusiasm for the Romeo and Juliet symphony of Hector Berlioz to create a libretto which might serve for a production at the Paris Op√©ra, with music perhaps to be written by Berlioz Warrack (1979), p. 112 or by himself. The draft, which is mostly in prose, was written between December 1849 and March 1850.Millington (1992), p. 322 It was published as an appendix to Wagner's essay The Art-Work of the Future as an example of the ideals to which such art-works should aspire - \\"a glorious Saga which long ago the raw, uncultured Folk of old-time Germany indited for no other reason than that of inner, free, Necessity\\".Wagner (1993), p. 210 The libretto contains many elements which are found in other of Wagner's operas (a swan, a wound, a spear, a ring, smithying, an absent mysterious father, a forbidden question), and one biographer calls it 'one of Wagner's most frankly autobiographic libretti'.Gutman (1990), p. 131 Nevertheless, Wagner decided to abandon it, presumably because he realised its subject matter was not to French taste. He offered the libretto to Franz Liszt who also declined it. The libretto was eventually adapted by O. Schlemm for the composer J√°n Levoslav Bella who composed an opera on it between 1880 and 1890. (See Wieland der Schmied (opera).) This was eventually produced in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia in 1926. Revivals were produced in Slovak, under the title Kov√°ƒç Wieland.Elschek (2003), p. 265 The composer Siegmund von Hausegger wrote the symphonic elaboration of the unperformed opera libretto in 1904, which he refers to as the \\"allegory of the attainment of creative powers\\". Story Swanhilde is the daughter of a marriage between a mortal woman and a fairy king, who forbids his wife to ask about his origins; on her asking him he vanishes. Swanhilde and her sisters are however able to fly as swans. But wounded by a spear, Swanhilde falls to earth and is rescued by the master-craftsman Wieland, and marries him, putting aside her wings and her magic ring of power. Wieland's enemies, the Neidings, under Princess Bathilde, steal the ring, kidnap Swanhilde and destroy Wieland's home. When Wieland searches for Swanhilde, they entrap and cripple him. However he fashions wings for himself and escapes with Swanhilde as the house of the Neidings is destroyed.

After the Reformation, it became an Anglican Church. The original church was replaced around 1750 by a new one, closed in 1912 and now in ruins. Both churches were dedicated to Kevin of Glendalough. There is also a Catholic St. Kevin's Church a short distance away on Harrington Street. Church The church was first mentioned in historical annals in 1226.Notice board It was situated some distance from the walls of Dublin, in the Irish part of the city, but close to a monastic settlement in the region of present-day Aungier Street. From the 13th century it formed part of the Manor of St. Sepulchre, which was directly under the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Dublin.Ball, Introduction An archaeological excavation carried out in 1967 uncovered some medieval graves and coins. The present ruined church, built on the foundation of the medieval one, dates to around 1750. The church is the burial place of Archbishop Dermot O'Hurley (), who was interred here after his execution on 20 June 1584 at Hoggen Green. O'Hurley, ordained Archbishop of Cashel in 1581, was imprisoned and tortured by government authorities upon his return from Rome in 1583. His grave became a place of veneration for Roman Catholics for several hundred years. In 1609, in view of the throngs of pilgrims coming to his grave, the church was rebuilt and a new entrance was made.Casey (2005), p. 625 In the early years of the Irish Confederate Wars (1641-1649) incursions were made into the church lands surrounding St. Kevin's by bands of Confederate soldiers stationed in Wicklow. Trenches were dug near the church to help protect the city, but the marauders were able to make off with cattle, horses and the occasional merchant who was unlucky enough to find himself in the wrong place at the wrong time, all of which they transported into the \\"wilds of Wicklow\\". Despite cease-fires being arranged, this situation continued until the Battle of Rathmines sealed the fate of the Irish and Royalist forces.Ball, p. 102 In 1698, the time of the Penal Laws, the church was offered to the Huguenot community as a place of worship and cemetery. The graveyard continued to be used by Catholics until the end of the 19th century. Parish After the Reformation the parish of St. Kevin was administered by the Church of Ireland; it stretched as far south as present-day Rathmines and Harold's Cross. The parish was taken over by that of St. Peter's when that parish was set up in 1680. This was due to the shortage of clergymen in Dublin at the time. St. Kevin's church became a chapel of ease to St. Peter's in Aungier St., and a parish school was set up nearby on Camden Row. The civil parish of St. Peter (which corresponded to the United Parish of St. Peter and St. Kevin) had a population of 73,000 in 1901, and 43,000 in 1971.Census returns The last rector was Thomas Chatterton Hammond (1877‚Äì1961), who took over the post in 1910. His name can be seen on Wedding certificates dated October and December 1909.https://civilrecords.irishgenealogy.ie/churchrecords/images/marriage_returns/marriages_1909/10036/5650478.pdf Cemetery Moore family plot in St. Kevin's Park. During the 17th and 18th centuries many notable people resident in the suburbs south of the city were interred here. After the Reformation, although a Protestant cemetery, it had come by custom to be used by Catholics and the Quakers. People buried here include: *Rev John Austin S.J. (1717-1784),Wright a pioneer of Catholic education in Ireland, whose tomb was restored by Rev. Dr. John T. Laphen, of St. Catherines, Meath St. *Jean Jasper Joly (1740-9 November 1823), captain of the Irish Volunteers in 1798. *John Keogh (1740-1817), intimate friend of Theobald Wolfe Tone, who once owned the land where Mount Jerome Cemetery now stands. *Hugh Leeson, brewer, whose gravestone lies against the south wall of the church and whose family gave its name to Leeson Street and became Earls of Milltown and owners of Russborough House, county Wicklow. *The Moore Family (of Thomas Moore). In 1825 John D'Arcy, owner of Anchor Breweries, the second largest porter company in Dublin at the time, was to be buried in St. Kevin's cemetery, having died suddenly after falling from his horse.History of Dublin Brewers When his funeral procession from Francis St. reached St. Kevin's cemetery the sexton, under the authority of the Protestant Archbishop of Dublin, Dr. Magee, met it at the gate and forbade Catholic prayers being recited at the grave-side; they had to be said on the roadway. The mourners retreated peacefully, but a huge outcry erupted as soon as the facts became known, which reached the ears of the Lord Lieutenant, The Marquess Wellesley (brother of the Duke of Wellington, and himself married to a Catholic). He expressed disapproval of Dr. Magee's order, and despite much opposition (cemeteries were a valuable source of income to their owners) tried to alleviate Catholic grievances. Daniel O'Connell used the scandal provoked by this to such effect that he was able to get through the legislation in establishing Golden Bridge (1829) and Prospect (1831) cemeteries, which led to the establishment of Glasnevin Cemetery.Fitzpatrick, Chapter 1 At the start of the 19th century the cemetery, like many others in Dublin, became a target of the body-snatchers, although it was surrounded by high walls (changed to railings in the 1960s). In February 1830 a Frenchman named Nagles and his friend were attacked by a group of \\"sack-em-ups\\" lying in wait near the cemetery. The criminals' attention was diverted by the arrival of a cart-load of dead bodies, giving Nagles the opportunity to escape and notify the police at Arran Quay, who apprehended the culprits.Fleetwood, p. 53 On one occasion a body-snatcher was chased as far as Thomas Street, where he finally dropped his booty--the body of a young girl. In June 1961 the body of a local five-year- old boy Tommy Powell from Cuffe Street was found in the graveyard. Blood- stained stones found nearby indicated that he had been murdered, but despite an intensive investigation, the murderer was never discovered. Notable parishioners Field Marshal The 1st Duke of Wellington, of Battle of Waterloo fame, was baptized in this church. The font that was used was given to Taney parish in Dundrum in 1912, when St. Kevin's was closed, and is now in St. Nahi's Church there. The Reverend Stephen Jerome, who in 1639 was vicar of the parish, was a noted preacher and writer. After 1649 he was appointed a special preacher at St Patrick's Cathedral but was criticized for his Puritan views.Ball, 1903, Chapter 14 See also *Portobello *St. Peter's Church, Aungier Street, Dublin References and sources ;Notes ;Sources *George Newenham Wright An Historical Guide to the City of Dublin *Notice board in St. Kevin's Park. *John Fleetwood, The Irish Body Snatchers, Tomar Publishing, Dublin, 1988. *F.

Personal life Odd Isaachsen Willoch was born in Larvik, the son of chief engineer Einar Isaachsen and his wife Hannah (n√©e Isaachsen). Willoch's grandfather was politician Isaach Isaachsen. He was a nephew of painter Olaf Isaachsen, and a cousin of painter Herman Willoch, physicist Daniel Isaachsen and scientist Haakon Isaachsen. He was the father of businessman Finn Isaachsen Willoch, and through him the grandfather of politician Ingrid I. Willoch. In addition, Odd Isaachsen Willoch was the uncle of national aviation director Erik I. Willoch and Prime Minister 1981-1986 K√•re I. Willoch. In 1911 Willoch married Marie Kristine (\\"Maja\\") Foss (born 1888 in Mosj√∏en), fathering three children with her. They lived in Horten. Career Odd Isaachsen Willoch made a career in the Royal Norwegian Navy, attending the Norwegian Military Academy and studying radio technology in the United Kingdom. Before the Second World War he commanded the offshore patrol vessels Fridtjof Nansen and Michael Sars. In 1928 Willoch took part in the search for the Latham 47 flying boat that had disappeared over the Barents Sea while carrying the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen. By 1940 he had reached the rank of Captain (kommand√∏rkaptein) and commanded the coastal defence ship HNoMS Eidsvold. =Second World War= On 9 April 1940 Norway was invaded by German forces as part of the Operation Weser√ºbung. The northern port of Narvik, defended amongst other sea and land units by HNoMS Eidsvold and her sister ship HNoMS Norge, was one of their most important targets due its role as an all-year export port of Swedish iron ore. As part of the Royal Norwegian Navy's efforts to protect and defend Norway's neutrality in the Second World War Norge and Eidsvold, the largest and most heavily armed Norwegian warships in service, had been based in Narvik. The 4,000 ton vessels and their commanders and crews were under orders to fire at any intruder, Narvik was under any and all circumstances to be defended by force. During the night of 8/9 April 1940 reports started coming in of German attacks further south in Norway, in the Oslofjord, at Bergen and at Trondheim. It was still, however, unclear of who would reach Narvik first, the Germans or the British.Kristiansen 2006: 32 It was known to the Norwegian commanders that the Royal Navy operated with a large force just off Northern Norway and it was therefore anticipated that these naval forces might attack Narvik to destroy the numerous German cargo ships in the port.Kristiansen 2006: 32-33 In all there were 25 civilian ships of various nationalities in the port of Narvik in the morning of 9 April 1940.Kristiansen 2006: 33 For several weeks the Norwegian coastal defence ships had been preparing for war, carrying out intense gunnery exercises with live ammunition. The situation had been steadily become more and more tense since the Altmark Incident on 16 February 1940.Kristiansen 2006: 34 In the early hours of 9 April Willoch moved his warship out of Narvik Harbour to a position north of the Framnesodden peninsula.H√∏gevold 1984: 53 Soon after radio messages were received from the patrol boat Kelt further out in the Ofotfjord, relayed from Norge,Kristiansen 2006: 35 that nine German destroyers were sailing towards Narvik. The tenth destroyer had been delayed and was lagging behind the rest of the German force. By 0400hrs visibility was so poor that the crew of the Eidsvold could not see land although they were only around from shore, at which point Willoch ordered that his ship was to raise anchor. At 0415hrs the first two German ships were spotted.H√∏gevold 1984: 54 As the German naval force of 10 destroyers attempted to enter Narvik Harbour Willoch challenged them, signalling the lead destroyer. When the intruding ships failed to reply to the light signals Eidsvold fired a warning shotHauge 1995: 184 from one of her 76 mm (3 inch) guns.Kristiansen 2006: 37 In response to the warning shot the German flotilla commander, Kapit√§n zur See Friedrich Bonte, despatched an emissary to the Eidsvold. The German officer told Willoch that the Germans were \\"coming as friends\\", but that the Norwegians had to hand over their warships to the German armed forces. Captain Willoch asked for time to consult his commander, Captain Per Askim, the commander of Norge. This request was refused by the Germans, but while Willoch had been talking to the German officer the radio officer on board the Eidsvold had communicated the events to Askim. Askim's response to the German demands and order to Willoch came immediately; Willoch and the Eidsvold was to open fire.Bj√∏rnsen 1977: 95 Willoch responded to Askim; \\"I am attacking\\". While this was going on the German destroyer Wilhelm Heidkamp had positioned herself off the port side of Eidsvold and trained her torpedo launchers on the Norwegian ship. When the order came from Askim the German officer was about to leave to Eidsvold to return to his own vessel, but he was called back by the Norwegians and informed that the demands were not going to be met and that the Norwegian warship was to resist the German encroachment. The German officer did not reply to the Norwegian statements, but when the German launch set off away from the Eidsvold the people on board fired a red signal flare. As the Germans moved away in their launch Willoch commanded his port battery to open fire and a drum signal was initiated.Bj√∏rnsen 1977: 96 Willoch shouted to the crewmen around him: (). Seconds later, as Eidsvold had closed the distance to Wilhelm Heidkamp to ,Hauge 1995: 186 but before the large-calibre guns of the Eidsvold could open fire, three torpedoes struck her. Just before the torpedoes hit the ship's battery commander had given the order; \\"Port battery, salvo\\". One of the German torpedoes hit the main ammunition hold, tearing apart Eidsvold, killing many crewmen and leaving the initial survivors swimming in water only just above freezing. Eidsvold broke in two and sank in 15 seconds, the stern disappearing last at 0437hrs. Only six seamen survived the sinking of Eidsvold;Bj√∏rnsen 1977: 118 Willoch was not among the survivors. Honours Willoch was awarded with the Haakon VII Coronation Medal, he was a Knight of the Icelandic Order of the Falcon and a Chevalier of the French L√©gion d'honneur.

Plot An ant is stranded on an island; since he can't swim, the ant asks a turtle for help. The turtle selfishly refuses (because he's already had his swim for the day); shortly thereafter, he falls on his back and can't right himself. So he asks a hornbill for help; she selfishly refuses (\\"This will teach you not to be so clumsy,\\" she says), and then her egg falls out of its nest. It's too heavy for her to carry, so she asks a giraffe for help, but the giraffe is too proud to assist her. Then the giraffe's legs get hopelessly ensnarled in some vines; he asks a lion for help, but the lion just laughs and strolls on. Then a boulder rolls onto the lion's tail, trapping him. He asks a rhino for help, but when he can't think of any way to return the favor, the rhino strolls on...until he gets his horn embedded in a stump. Then an elephant notices and helps each of the animals in turn, starting with the ant - the only one who bothers to thank the elephant. Shortly after the elephant has assisted everyone, he himself falls into a ravine. When he can't get out, the elephant resigns himself to his plight.

The appearance is that of a typical \\"little brown mushroom\\"‚Äîwith a small, brown cap and a straight, thin stipe, growing separately or in clumps with others. Taxonomy Psilocybe montana was formerly the type species of the mushroom genus Psilocybe.Singer, R. (1975). The Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy. J. Cramer, Vaduz. 912 p. Because it does not contain hallucinogenic tryptamine derivatives like psilocybin or psilocin, it does not stain blue when handled, unlike other typical hallucinogenic members of this genus. Molecular studies in the late 2000s revealed that the genus was polyphyletic and consisted of two distinct clades separating the blueing species from the non-blueing species. However, dividing the genus would be problematic as the name Psilocybe was attached to P. montana and consequently to the non-blueing clade, leaving the hallucinogenic species without a generic name. Because the name is widely associated with the hallucinogenic species and considering the potential legal ramifications of changing their generic name, a proposal was made to conserve the name Psilocybe with P. semilanceata as the type. This left Deconica available as a name for the non-blueing species. The proposal was unanimously accepted by the Nomenclature Committee for Fungi in 2009.  Description  The cap is 0.5‚Äì1.5 cm in diameter, initially convex in shape but flattening in age, sometimes with a broad umbo. The cap is moist, glabrous, hygrophanous, and has radial striations to the center; the color is brown to dark-brown. The gills are adnate to broadly adnate or sometimes very shortly decurrent, and of the same color as the cap. The stipe is 1.5‚Äì4 cm long, 1‚Äì2 mm thick, smooth, the same color as the cap, and brittle. Spores are typically 7.5‚Äì10 √ó 6‚Äì8 √ó 5‚Äì5.5 ¬µm and ovate‚Äìlentiform in shape with a thickened wall. A large spored variety (spore dimensions of 8.5‚Äì11 √ó 6.0‚Äì8.5 √ó 5.0‚Äì7.0 ¬µm), Psilocybe montana var. macrospora Noordel. & Verduin (1999), has also been reported from the Netherlands. The spore print is dark greyish brown. It is listed as inedible.  Habitat  Deconica montana is saprobic, possibly also parasitic. It is often associated with mosses such as Brachythecium albicans, B. mutabulum, Campylopus introflexus, Ceratodon purpureus, Dicranum scoparium, Eurhynchium hians, E. praelongum, E. speciosum, Rhacomitrium canescens, Pohlia species or Polytrichum piliferum. It is commonly found in exposed situations such as dune-meadows, heaths and tree-less tundra, and open Pinus forests, usually on nutrient-poor, well-drained soil.http://www.entoloma.nl/html/psmontananed.html Image:Psilocybe montana.jpgDeconica montana on moss.

Social security policy between 1987 and 1994 was heavily influenced by the findings of the CSW. The final report of the Commission recommended raising social welfare payments. For social welfare payments to be adequate, they \\"must prevent poverty, and in our view poverty must be judged in the light of actual living standards,\\" the report concluded. Background A social welfare provision refers to any program which seeks to provide a minimum level of income, service or other support for many marginalized groups such as the poor, elderly, and disabled people. Social welfare programs are undertaken by governments as well as non- governmental organizations (NGO's). Social welfare payments and services are typically provided at the expense of taxpayers generally, funded by benefactors, or by compulsory enrollment of the poor themselves. Establishment In 1982 the National Social Services Board in its pre-budget submission called for the establishment of a commission to carry out a fundamental review of the social welfare system. A commitment to establish such a commission was part of the program of the Fine Gael/Labour coalition government that came into office in December 1982. The Commission on Social Welfare was established in 1983. Commission report The Commission's report was published in 1986. The reforms recommended were within the existing system rather than replacing the system and creating a new one. The four key reforms proposed by the Commission concerned the payment structure, social insurance, social assistance and financing. The adequacy of payments was the most important issue the Commission considered. By using a number of indicators, the Commission estimated that a minimally adequate income for a single person in 1985 was 50 to 60 pounds per week. The Commission favored keeping the social insurance system. It recommended that all income earners should contribute to and benefit where appropriate from social insurance and favored a widening of coverage for insurance. The Commission recommended that there should be a comprehensive social assistance scheme for those who, for whatever reason, do not qualify for social insurance. The main condition would be the establishment of an income. On the grounds of redistribution the Commission concluded that the income ceiling on contributions should be gradually abolished.

Stackpole was involved in the art and causes of social realism, especially during the Great Depression, when he was part of the Public Works of Art Project, Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Administration, and the Treasury Department's Section of Painting and Sculpture. Stackpole was responsible for recommending that architect Timothy L. Pflueger bring Mexican muralist Diego Rivera to San Francisco to work on the San Francisco Stock Exchange and its attached office tower in 1930‚Äì31. His son Peter Stackpole became a well-known photojournalist. Early career Stackpole worked as a laborer early in life to support himself and his mother following the death of his father in a lumber mill circular saw accident. At sixteen, he came to San Francisco to study at the California School of Design (now San Francisco Art Institute) beginning in 1903; he was influenced strongly by Arthur Frank Mathews, muralist and painter at the school. He met painter Helen Arnstein (later Helen Salz) while both were teenagers, and she became his first girlfriend. Arnstein, the daughter of wealthy Jewish art lovers and one year Stackpole's senior, described him as \\"a remarkable draftsman\\" who painted and sketched constantly. She was less impressed with his sense of color than with his precision in line. Stackpole polished his craft by working with artists at the Montgomery Block, playfully called \\"Monkey Block\\", a bohemian hangout which included studios for painting and sculpture. After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, he used a grant of 200 ($ in current value) to travel to France to attend the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in the class of Antonin Merci√© in 1906‚Äì1908, exhibiting at the Salon in 1910. It was in Paris that he became friends with painter Diego Rivera Rivera, Diego ‚Äò‚ÄôPortrait of America: With an explanatory text by Bertram Wolfe‚Äô‚Äô, Covici Friede, Publishers, New York, 1934 p. 12. He painted under Robert Henri in New York in 1911. San Francisco Stackpole returned to San Francisco in 1912 and married Adele Barnes, two months younger than he, an art student of Xavier Martinez and one of the first graduates of the California Academy of Arts and Crafts. Adele Stackpole was a perfectionist in many ways, including the precision of her bookplate engravings and the demands she placed on her relationships. On June 15, 1913, the Stackpoles' son Peter was born in San Francisco. Stackpole was part of the foursome that founded, early in 1913, the California Society of Etchers (CSE). The other founders were Robert B. Harshe, an etcher and art professor at Stanford University, etcher and educator Pedro Lemos, who taught at the San Francisco Institute of Art, and Gottardo Piazzoni, an Italian-American painter and muralist who was Stackpole's master in France. The CSE exhibited twice in 1913, and grew to 78 artist members and five associate after two years. In 1926, the annual publication listed 46 artist members and 156 associate members: Stackpole was still a member. Decades later, the CSE merged with another group to become the California Society of Printmakers. =Panama- Pacific International Exposition= \\"Tympanum group of Varied Industries\\" (1915) Around the same time, Stackpole was commissioned to sculpt architectural features for the 1915 Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition, a major assignment that was to take two years to complete, even with the aid of assistants. To give a grand entrance portal to the Palace of Varied Industries, he completed a copy of the main entrance to the Hospice of Santa Cruz, built in Toledo, Spain in the 16th century. Stackpole's design replaced the original figures of Catholic saints with figures of industry. His works for the Palace of Varied Industries included \\"Man with a pick\\", \\"Tympanum group of Varied Industries\\", \\"New World Receiving Burdens of Old\\", \\"Keystone figure\\", and \\"Power of Industry\\". Stackpole also sculpted figures of \\"Thought\\" on the columns flanking the half domes of the west facade of the Palace Group. At the Palace of Fine Arts, Stackpole produced a kneeling \\"Venus\\" on the Altar of Inspiration. Visitors wishing to view \\"Venus\\" were kept some away by a man- made lagoon. =Modern trends= With Piazzoni, Stackpole went to France again in 1922, taking his family; he enrolled his nine-year-old son in the √âcole Alsacienne, a private school in Paris. The two artists wished to investigate the most modern trends in Europe, and they encountered Diego Rivera. While there, Stackpole's marriage unraveled, and he returned to the Bay Area in 1923 with a 24-year-old French still life artist and model named Francine Mazen, nicknamed \\"Ginette\\"; his wife and son returned after the school year to take up residence across the bay in Oakland. Stackpole obtained a divorce, and then married Ginette in Mexico. In late 1923, Stackpole organized a major art exhibit, in partnership with Piazzoni. This was the first large-scale art show in San Francisco since 1915; there had been no expected rush of artists after the Panama-Pacific International Exposition. The exhibit, held in Polk Hall in the Civic Auditorium, was companion to a nearby print exhibit which included Gauguin and Matisse works. Critic and author Laura Bride Powers felt that the event was a disappointment‚Äîit displayed \\"inconspicuous examples\\" of leading artists, and failed to show any Picasso, avant-garde or Dadaist works. In 1926, Stackpole delivered the William A. Coleman Fountain to the city of Sacramento, a Moderne work (centrally located in what is now known as Cesar Chavez Park) which celebrated the city's completion of a difficult water filtration project. That same year, Stackpole traveled to Mexico City to see Rivera working on some of his 124 frescoes in the courtyard of the Secretariat of Public Education. Returning with a small Rivera painting, Stackpole gave it to San Francisco Arts Commission president William Gerstle (who was initially unimpressed), and began a several-year effort to bring Rivera to work in California. Stackpole accepted an offer to teach at his former school, its name having changed to the California School of Fine Arts (CSFA) [now San Francisco Art Institute]. For a stretch of almost twenty years, he taught a number of subjects. Dorr Bothwell studied sculpture under Stackpole, then the head of the Sculpture Department, and thought him to be sexist‚Äîshe said he told the women in the class that \\"the place they really belonged was in bed.\\" Site placement of Industry (1932) shows its position at the right of the former San Francisco Stock Exchange building. Kenneth Rexroth wrote of Stackpole in 1929 that \\"He knew everybody in town from top to bottom ... and he took us everywhere.\\" Stackpole's sizable San Francisco studio at 716 Montgomery (adjacent to Montgomery Block) served as a social center for San Francisco's artist community. Photographer Dorothea Lange rented upstairs studio space there in 1926, and Helen Clark and Otis Oldfield, both artists, married there the same year. Lange's husband Maynard Dixon had his studio next door, and the Stackpole and Dixon families were close‚Äîboth men were members of the Bohemian Club. Throughout the 1930s, Stackpole worked frequently with architect Timothy Pflueger on various commissions. Beginning in 1929 when the two men first met, Stackpole was given responsibility for selecting the artists who worked to execute and augment Pflueger's basic design scheme for the San Francisco Stock Exchange and its associated Tower, especially the Luncheon Club occupying the top floors of the Tower.Poletti, 2008, pp. 90‚Äì91. Stackpole said later of the experience, \\"the artists were in from the first. They were called in conference and assumed responsibility and personal pride in the building.\\" At the Sansome Street tower entrance, Stackpole worked on a scaffolding with a crew of assistants to direct carve heroic figures in stone.Poletti, 2008, pp. 92‚Äì93. After the building was completed, Stackpole was finally successful in winning a commission for Rivera; Pflueger became convinced that Rivera would be the perfect muralist for decorating the staircase wall and ceiling of the Stock Exchange Club. This was a controversial selection considering Rivera's leftist political beliefs in contradiction to the Stock Exchange's capitalist foundation. Into the mural, Rivera painted a figure of Stackpole's son Peter holding a model airplane. During his stay, Rivera and his wife Frida Kahlo lived and worked at the studio, becoming in the process lifelong friends with Stackpole and Ginette. They met tennis champion Helen Wills Moody, an avid painter-hobbyist, who soon agreed to model for Rivera at the studio. Neighbor Dixon saw the attention, and the American money being given to Rivera, and with etcher Frank Van Sloun organized a short-lived protest against the Communist artist. However, both Dixon and Van Sloun quickly realized that the San Francisco art world \\"oligarchy\\" who were obviously smitten with Rivera, including Stackpole's well-connected patrons, were the same group that they themselves would need to support their own art aspirations. For much of 1931, Stackpole partnered with other artists to decorate Pflueger's Paramount Theatre in Oakland, an Art Deco masterpiece. A bas-relief scene of horses, waves and a central winged figure was placed over the stage's proscenium arch, finished in gold-toned metal leaf‚Äîthe work jointly designed by Stackpole and Robert Boardman Howard.Poletti, 2008, p. 118. The design worked into Pflueger's metal grille ceiling grid likely came unattributed from Stackpole's sketches. Pflueger was an able project leader; Stackpole later described his involvement: \\"He was the boss alright, as an architect should be ... He would call the plays just as a symphony conductor does ... There wasn't a lock, molding, or window that he did not inspect in the drawings and in the actual building with the utmost thoroughness and care.\\"Poletti, 2008, p. 128. Stackpole worked through ten months of 1932 on a monumental pair of sculptures flanking the grand entrance of the Stock Exchange: a male and a female grouping showing the polarity of agriculture and industry, showing in their rounded human shapes the influence of Rivera. Chiseling into of Yosemite granite, he wore goggles and a mask. The unveiling ceremony took place in the cold of New Year's Eve, with Mayor Angelo Rossi joining Stackpole, Pflueger and artisans in smocks. Stackpole took his son Peter to visit their photographer friend Edward Weston in Carmel in the early 1930s, and the two older men spent the day discussing photography, \\"the difference between making and taking a photograph, between the intended and the random\\". This conversation, and the 1932 exhibit by Group f/64, a collection of innovative photographers such as Weston and Ansel Adams, was later seen as foundational to Peter Stackpole's conception of photography. In July 1933, Stackpole completed a model of a design to be incorporated into the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge's central anchorage on the western side. The anchorage, to be constructed of concrete rising above the water, was to display over much of its height a bare-chested male figure standing solidly between the two suspension spans. However, Arthur Brown, Jr., Pflueger's colleague on the Bay Bridge project, did not like the scale of the figure, which belittled the bridge. Engineer Ralph Modjeski agreed, writing \\"The gigantic figure which is proposed for the centre anchorage is out of place for a structure of this kind and would not harmonize with the end anchorage.\\"Poletti, 2008, pp. 164‚Äì166. Stackpole's design was abandoned in favor of a largely flat expanse of poured concrete. In 1933 and 1934, Stackpole took part in the Public Works of Art Project assignment to paint murals for Coit Tower. Many of the murals were executed in styles reminiscent of Rivera, and Stackpole himself was portrayed in five of them;Johnson, 2003, p. 20. in one he is shown reading a newspaper announcing the destruction of a Rivera mural in New York. In 1937, Stackpole received a commission to sculpt his interpretation of Colorado River explorer John Wesley Powell, for display in the Main Interior Building of the U.S. Department of Interior. It was to be a companion piece to Heinz Warneke's portrayal of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Warneke learned that Stackpole intended a water scene, so he changed his portrayal of Lewis and Clark to be one of them on land. Stackpole and Warneke delivered their stone reliefs in 1940, and the two panels were mounted on either side of the stage of the building's auditorium. Another work of Stockpole's, \\"Dispossessed,\\" one of his most notable canvases and a painting of great power and (unfortunately but apparently) permanent relevance, is also in Washington, D.C., at the Smithsonian. A notable feature of Stackpole's work in the 30s and after is his West Coast integration of elements from the artistic traditions of Mexico, Native America, the Pacific Islands, and Asia. =\\"Reverence\\"= original 1915 version of Reverence In 1938 Stackpole was contacted by the President of the United States, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. As an ensign at the 1915 fair in San Francisco, FDR had seen Stackpole's figure of Reverence, also known as Worship, on the long-gone altar at the Palace of Fine Arts. It had stuck in his mind somehow. He wanted one. Stackpole responded that the original had deteriorated, and was lost, but that he would be happy to undertake another version in travertine as a commission. FDR agreed, with regular inquiries on the progress of the piece over the next five years. In April 1943 Stackpole explained the result about to be revealed: :The changes of 28 years, in the world, in you, and in me, made the exact copying or reproduction of the first statue unattractive... So I did the job as I would do it now... here are a few things I thought of when I was working. Big mass movements in thinking and labor naturally reflect in art. The slender and graceful belong less to us now. I‚Äôve tried to make heavy and strong forms. She is more bent and the burden heavier. This was not what the President had remembered or wanted. He ordered it to a secluded area of Hyde Park, where it was re-discovered in 1987, identified, then concealed all over again within a new ring of trees according to FDR's wishes. =Golden Gate International Exposition= Pacifica was the central spirit of the Golden Gate International Exposition. Pflueger made certain that Stackpole was given a major commission for art in preparation for the Golden Gate International Exposition, also called the Pacific Pageant, a world's fair to be held on Treasure Island between San Francisco and Oakland. Stackpole worked to create an tall frame-and-stucco embodiment of Pacifica, the theme of the exposition. By November 1938, when Life photographer Alfred Eisenstaedt was capturing images to promote the event, Pacifica was ready for his camera. The magazine carried the image of this, Stackpole's most monumental work, \\"a peaceful, contemplative, almost prayer-like female figure\\" intended only for temporary placement. The heroic sculpture stood in front of a tall \\"prayer curtain\\" of regular star-shaped steel bangles that rippled in the wind. Vivid orange and blue lights washed the curtain at night, while Pacifica, the image of Peace, was brilliant in white. Over two years, 16 million visitors came to the exposition.James, 1941, p. 166. When it was over, Stackpole proposed that the sculpture be recast in a more permanent form‚Äîsteel, stone or concrete‚Äîand positioned prominently on an island in the San Francisco Bay, perhaps Alcatraz or Angel Island, in a manner similar to the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor.The plan was not seriously considered by civic leaders whose attention was on the gathering war clouds in Asia and Europe. The sculpture and most of the exposition buildings were dynamited in 1942, and the U.S. Navy took ownership of the island as a base in World War II. Later life Artist Louise Gilbert rendered this flyer advertising a sculpture class Stackpole was to give in 1945 at the California Labor School. In the early 1940s, Stackpole left the CSFA to teach privately. In April 1945, he led a sculpting class at the California Labor School, a leftist organization advocating equal rights for workers. From 1941 to 1945, he served on the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, the first commission member from the West Coast.Thomas E. Luebke, ed., Civic Art: A Centennial History of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, 2013): Appendix B, p. 555. In 1949, Stackpole moved to Chauriat in the Puy-de-D√¥me area of central France, returning with his second wife Ginette to her birthplace. There, his art became less figurative and more abstract, both in sculpture and in painting. He kept a flow of correspondence with his old friends in San Francisco, including Helen Salz, who described his letters as devoid of any mention of sculpture or painting, or any project that Stackpole might have been working on‚Äîinstead, he wrote of musicians and music, and of his encounters with people. Salz bought a Stackpole bust of poet George Sterling and donated it to the University of California in 1955‚Äì56, to be displayed in Dwinelle Hall. In early 1964, Stackpole visited San Francisco to see his family, and he called up his old friend Kenneth Rexroth. In his San Francisco Examiner newspaper column, Rexroth wrote of having lunch with the Stackpole family, and reminded his readers that the man had been known \\"for 20 years or more [as] San Francisco's leading artist.\\" Stackpole died in France in 1973, his wife in 1978. Some of Stackpole's sculptures, paintings and drawings were destroyed in the Oakland firestorm of 1991, a blaze which leveled the home of Peter Stackpole.

Early life and career In the 1960s, Feldmann studied painting at the University of Arts and Industrial Design Linz in Austria. He began working in 1968, producing the first of the small handmade books that would become a signature part of his work. These modest books, simply entitled Bilde (Picture) or Bilder (Pictures), would include one or more reproductions from a certain type‚Äîknees of women, shoes, chairs, film stars, etc.--their subjects isolated in their ubiquity and presented without captions. In 1979 Feldmann decided to pull out of the art world and just make books and pictures for himself. In 1989 the curator Kasper K√∂nig persuaded Feldmann to exhibit in a gallery again.Elizabeth Jobey (April 7, 2012), Vernacular spectacular Financial Times.

Feldmann's approach to art-making is one of collecting, ordering and re-presenting amateur snapshots, print photographic reproductions, toys and trivial works of art. Feldmann reproduces and recontextualizes our reading of them in books, postcards, posters or multiples.Elizabeth Jobey (April 7, 2012), Vernacular spectacular Financial Times. Feldmann made his first series of books between 1968 and 1971. Works from the early 1970s include 70 snapshots depicting All the Clothes of a Woman and four Time Series projects including, for example, a row of 36 pictures of a ship moving along a river. Feldmann's series Photographs Taken From Hotel Room Windows While Traveling clusters 108 nondescript, unframed snapshots of buildings, streets and parking lots.

Bed With Photograph simulates part of a hotel room with a slept-in bed, a side table and a framed photograph of a woman in leopard-print pants. Feldman's photographic essays might have a more intimate singularity in book form. His book Secret Picturebook (1973) is a thick, densely printed, scholarly tome with little pictures of women's torsos in sexy underwear inserted at intervals.

The term \\"inline\\" is used somewhat differently for aircraft engines than automotive engines. For automotive engines, the term ‚Äòinline‚Äô refers only to straight engines (those with a single bank of cylinders). But for aircraft, ‚Äòinline‚Äô can also refer to engines which are not of the straight configuration, such as v, w, or horizontally opposed. Inline engine configurations ;Straight or Inline: Engines with a single bank of cylinders which can be arranged at any angle but typically upright or inverted, (e.g. upright ADC Cirrus, inverted de Havilland Gipsy Major). ;V:Engines with two banks of cylinders with less than 180¬∞ between them driving a common crankshaft, typically arranged upright or inverted (e.g. upright Liberty L-12, inverted Argus As 410). W-12 Napier Lion engine ;O or Horizontally Opposed: Engines with two banks of cylinders arranged at 180¬∞ to each other driving a common crankshaft, almost universally mounted with banks horizontal for aircraft use, or with crankshaft vertical for helicopter use, (e.g. horizontally mounted Continental O-190, vertically mounted Franklin 6ACV-245). H-24 Napier Dagger engine on display at the Royal Air Force Museum Hendon. ;W:Engines with three banks driving a common crankshaft, arranged so that first and last banks are 180¬∞or less apart, (e.g. upright Lorraine 12Eb, inverted Napier Lioness). ;X: Multiple bank engines with four banks arranged around a common crankshaft, usually spaced evenly, (e.g. evenly spaced Rolls- Royce Vulture, unevenly spaced Napier Cub). A cutaway Jumo 205 2-stroke opposed piston diesel engine ;Fan: Engines with more than three banks with 180¬∞ or less between first and last bank, akin to W engines. Note: Fan engines with single cylinder banks, typically from Anzani, are usually regarded as variants of the Radial engine. A Bugatti U-16 engine ;U:Engines with two banks of cylinders side by side driving separate crankshafts geared to a single output, (e.g. Bugatti U-16). ;H:Engines with four banks of cylinders driving two crankshafts geared to a single output, in effect, two Opposed engines coupled together and mounted either horizontally or vertically, (e.g. horizontally Napier Sabre, vertically Napier Dagger). ;Opposed piston:Two- stroke engines, typically compression ignition/Diesel, with a single bank of cylinders driving two crankshafts where the pistons travel towards each other forming single combustion chambers, (e.g. Jumo 207). :Deltic: Engines with three banks of opposed piston cylinders arranged in a triangle with three crankshafts geared to drive a single output,(e.g. Napier Deltic) :Rhomboidal: Engines with four or more banks of opposed piston cylinders arranged in a square with four crankshafts geared to drive a single output,(e.g. Jumo 223) Note: There is no theoretical limit to the number banks in an opposed piston engine, limitations include cost, complexity and reliability. ;Multiple bank:Engines with more than two banks, arranged around a common axis and/or crankshaft with more than 180¬∞ between first and last banks. :Star: Multiple bank engines with an even number of banks (more than four) arranged around a common axis and/or driving a common crankshaft with more than 180¬∞ between first and last banks, (e.g. Jumo 222, Dobrynin VD-4K). A Junkers Jumo 222 multibank aviation engine, four cylinders per bank. :Inline Radial: Multiple bank engines, usually liquid-cooled, with an odd number of banks (three or more) arranged around a common axis and/or driving a common crankshaft with more than 180¬∞ between first and last banks, (e.g. air-cooled Armstrong Siddeley Deerhound, liquid-cooled BMW 803). Note The BMW 803 is not only an inline radial engine but is also a coupled engine with two engines arranged back to back on a common axis driving separate co-axial propellers through a common gearbox. Inverted engine Argus As 10 inverted air-cooled V8 engine Some inline aircraft engines, including the de Havilland Gipsy Major used in the de Havilland Tiger Moth, and the Daimler-Benz DB 601 used in the Messerschmitt Bf 109, were designed to be installed in airframes inverted, such that the crankshaft was at the top of the engine and the cylinder heads were at the bottom. The advantages of inverted engines included improved visibility for the pilot, improved access to cylinder heads and manifolds for the ground crew, having the centre of mass of a multi-bank engine lower in the engine, and having the widest part of a multi-bank engine being closer to the midline of the fuselage, which is also generally wide.

Founded in 1894, P.S. 6 is regarded as one of the top elementary schools in New York City. Overview P.S. 6 has about 800 students in grades K-5. Average class sizes are 23-28. The school's student body is 78% Caucasian, which is somewhat unusual for a public school in NYC. The school is popular with families on the Upper East Side who often choose to send their children there rather than to private school. The school's former Principal, Carmen Fari√±a, claimed that the acceptance rate for out of district students was 1/7, lower than that of many top-tier Universities. History P.S. 6 was founded in 1894 and named after the feminist author and reformer Lillie Devereaux Blake. The school was originally located several blocks to the north on 85th Street. The current red brick building on Madison Avenue between 81st and 82nd Streets was constructed in 1953. The school's first principal Katherine Blake, the daughter of the school's namesake, served in that capacity for 34 years and demanded that the pacifist hymn I Didn't Raise My Boy to Be a Soldier be sung at every assembly. Academics P.S. 6 is a Teacher's College \\"Mentor School.\\" It offers a particularly strong writing program based on the principles of Lucy Calkins. Students are expected to write plays, poetry, essays and short fiction by the time they graduate. The school also places a special emphasis on Art education. Its location, two blocks from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, allows the students particularly good access to view the works of famous artists. P.S. 6 was also the recipient of a grant from the Annenberg Foundation to help fund art projects in the school. Special events Peter Yarrow has played a special benefit concert in the school's auditorium for many years to raise money for the school. In popular culture The school is featured in the 1979 film Kramer vs. Kramer, which won five Academy Awards.http://www.movietrip.me/scenes/view/1939/kramer- vs.-kramer(1979)-ps-6-the-lillie-devereaux-blake-school Notable alumni *Richard Avedon, Photographer *Phoebe Cates, Actress *Chevy Chase, Actor *Peter Cincotti, Jazz Singer/Songwriter *Miguel Cond√©, Artist *Damon Dash, Hip Hop Mogul *Jose Feliciano, Guitarist *William Hurt, Actor *Jonathan Katz, Actor/Comedian *Lenny Kravitz, Musician *Michael Kurland, Author *Lorna Luft, Actress, Singer, Daughter of Judy Garland *Erin Moriarty, Actress *Tony Roberts (actor), Actor *J.D.

It is endemic to Ecuador and is known from the Cordillera Oriental in the Napo Province and more provisionally, in the Chimborazo Province. The specific name petersi honors James A. Peters, an American zoologist who collected the first specimens of this species in 1962 and provided a description under the name Atelopus pachydermus. Common names Peters' stubfoot toad and Peters' jambato toad have been coined for it. Description Adult males measure and adult females in snout‚Äìvent length. The snout is acuminate. The tympanic membrane, annulus, and stapes are absent. The fingers have lateral fringes but no webbing whereas the toes are webbed. The dorsum has a yellow to orange pattern on black background, and may be almost entirely black. Warts and pustules may have white tops. The flanks are white. The venter is white and may have black marks, or is uniform orange to reddish orange. Habitat and conservation Atelopus petersi occurs in montane cloud forests and high montane evergreen forests at elevations of above sea level. Individuals have been found under rocks at the edge of a stream, in a streambed by day, under logs on a grassy hillside, on a cushion plant in paramo, on a trail, and along the border of a river. Atelopus petersi was extremely common near Papallacta at the time Peters observed them. Last confirmed record of the species is from 1996 and is based on a dead animal. However, local people in Oyacachi claimed in 2003 to see single specimens from time to time. It is feared that the species might now be extinct. The precise reasons for this dramatic decline are not known, but climate abnormalities and chytridiomycosis are possible factors. References *Amphibiaweb.

He was drafted by the Cowboys in the first round of the 1972 NFL Draft. He played college football at Boston College. Early years Thomas attended Peekskill High School, before accepting a football scholarship from Boston College. In April 1970, he dislocated his left shoulder playing basketball, so he had to wear a harness during the football season, until he was forced to have surgery and miss one game. In 1971, he helped the school achieve their best record (9-2) in a season since 1954, while posting 119 carries for 598 yards and 2 touchdowns. His versatility running and blocking was valued by the team, so he spent his playing time between the halfback and fullback positions. Fighting through injuries for most of his college career, he recorded a total of 931 career rushing yards (4.5-yard average), 2 touchdowns and was never the leading rusher on his team. He also lettered in track and ran the 200 metres. Professional career =Dallas Cowboys= Coming off their Super Bowl VI win, the Dallas Cowboys entered the 1972 NFL Draft worried about the future of Duane Thomas and the injury history of Calvin Hill, so they focused on their running back depth. With their first round draft choice the team selected Thomas, who was ranked sixth overall on their draft board and with their second draft choice they selected Robert Newhouse. He never fully recovered from the left shoulder injury he suffered in college and re-injured it during a dummy blocking drill in training camp. He went through surgery to repair the staple pin that was used to secure the shoulder in the original operation and was placed on injured reserve. He was activated for the eighth game of the 1972 season, touching the ball only twice as a rookie during kickoff returns. On September 28, 1973, he was waived due to his lack of progress and his injury history and to make room for running back Cyril Pinder. =Houston Oilers= On October 1, 1973, the Houston Oilers claimed him off waivers and played a reserve role during the season. On August 16, 1974, he was traded to the Kansas City Chiefs in exchange for a seventh-round draft choice (#162-Mike Biehle). =Kansas City Chiefs= In 1974, he experienced some success playing special teams for the Kansas City Chiefs, returning 25 kickoffs for 571 yards. He was waived on August 2, 1975. Personal life Thomas was a teacher for more than 27 years, while also serving as coach and administrator at Madison Park High School and Gavin Middle School. He also had a stint with the football coaching staff of Northeastern University.

It was recorded in the Kaura Recording's Studio Garza, under the executive production of Francisco Lobo and assistance in recording by Adrian \\"Rojo\\" Trevi√±o.

History NDP was founded in 1994 by paramedics Edward Murray and Robert Latimer and was New York State's first licensed, stand alone advanced life support first response service.http://ndpems.com/index.htm NDP History Since then the company expanded to advanced life support services, as well as basic life support services and ambulance and inter-facility transport. Outside of the response mode, NDP offers EMS continuing education, first aid and safety training for the community and classes for allied health professionals.http://alamoems.com/showPage.asp?pagename=News_HealthGrades Ambulance Companies Propose Joint Merger Two NDP Ambulances; 84-75 & 84-82 on standby at the Beekman Community Day. =Alamo/NDP merger= On December 14, 2007, NDP announced a proposed merger with Alamo EMS, whose parent company is Health Quest, the largest health care system in the Hudson Valley. Health Quest System The application was the first step in the regulatory process toward creating an organization which was aimed at better serving the Hudson Valley community in providing emergency and ambulance services. The joint venture also required approval from the New York State Attorney General‚Äôs Office and the New York State Supreme Court. Health Quest and Northern Dutchess Paramedics anticipated that the regulatory process would take approximately six to twelve months. However, on December 17, 2008, the two companies announced that the merger had fallen through, and would not be completed. The companies claimed they had differences that could not be settled. If merged, it would have been the largest independent ambulance provider in the Hudson Valley Region. =Loss of contracts= On November 21, 2008, at 5:30 pm, NDP officially lost its ALS contract for the towns of Beekman and Pawling, for failure to have an official Certificate of Need (CON). Alamo EMS resumed operations in the two towns. NDP claims the loss of the CON was no fault of theirs and that the responsibility lies with the town boards of Pawling and Beekman.http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/article/20081122/NEWS01/811252372&referrer;=FRONTPAGECAROUSEL NDP loses ambulance contract for Beekman & Pawling In mid-November, it had been discovered that the New York State Department of Health had never issued NDP a CON for Southern Dutchess County and NDP should never have been allowed to operate in that area without the CON. = Ambulette Division = NDP operated an ambulette division consisting of 6 multipassenger wheelchair vans. This division was formed in 1998 to meet the needs of facilities served by the agency. In 2016, shortly after the loss of a major contract, the division was disbanded due to decreased revenue.

At the top of the pass, at the intersection with the R62, the N9 and N12 split, with the N12 being cosigned with the R62 northwards towards Oudtshoorn while the N9 turns east, cosigned with the R62, to run along the northern side of the Outeniqua Mountains and over Potjiesberg Pass. After 71 kilometres, the N9 and the R62 split, with the R62 becoming its own road eastwards while the N9 turns northwards and enters the town of Uniondale, before proceeding onwards to Willowmore in the Eastern Cape. From Willowmore, the N9 travels across the Eastern Cape Karoo through Aberdeen to Graaf-Reinet. At Aberdeen, the N9 is joined by the R61 and they are concurrent through Graaf-Reinet (where they meet the R63) and for the next 46 kilometers before the R61 becomes its own road eastwards. From Graaf-Reinet it crosses the Sneeuberge through Naudesberg Pass and Lootsberg Pass to Middelburg, where it meets the N10.

It has been published in Paris since 1921 and targets upper-income, educated women aged from 25 to 49. In 2006, it had a circulation of 101,719. A men's edition of L'Officiel, L'Officiel Hommes, and many foreign editions are also published. The complete name of the magazine is \\"L'Officiel de la couture et de la mode de Paris\\". History L'Officiel was first published in 1921, the same year as Vogue. It was the official publication of the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne, a trade body representing all Paris couturiers, and took over the role of Les El√©gances Parisiennes, a joint publication of a group of about twenty-five couturiers which became defunct in 1922. L'Officiel was a professional trade magazine, directed principally at international buyers of high fashion, both corporate and individual, and at those working in the fashion industry. The director was Max Bruhne, and the chief editor Yves- Georges Prade. Georges Jalou joined the magazine as artistic director in 1932. Within a short time it had helped to start the careers of designers such as Pierre Balmain, Crist√≥bal Balenciaga, Christian Dior, and Yves St. Laurent, and came to be known as \\"the Bible of fashion and of high society\\".\\"la bible de la mode et des √©l√©gantes\\" Jalou became general director of the publication, and later bought it. He transferred it to his three children in 1986: Laurent Jalou became the president of Editions Jalou, Marie-Jos√© Susskind-Jalou directed its editorial content, and Maxime Jalou was responsible for publication. After the death of Laurent Jalou in 2003, his daughter Marie-Jos√© Susskind-Jalou became president of the company, and restructured the magazine's content to targert a younger market than it did in its early years.

The stacks are composed of: * Linux, the operating system; * Yaws, the web server; * Mnesia or CouchDB, the database; * Erlang, the functional programming language. The LYME and LYCE bundles can be and are combined with many other free and open-source software packages such as e.g. netsniff-ng for security testing and hardening, Snort, an intrusion detection (IDS) and intrusion prevention system (IPS), RRDtool for diagrams, or Nagios, Collectd, or Cacti, for monitoring.  Details  Both databases Mnesia and CouchDB as well as Yaws (and also Mochiweb, Misultin, and Cowboy) are written in Erlang, so web applications developed for LYME/LYCE may be run entirely in one Erlang virtual machine. This is in contrast to LAMP where the web server (Apache) and the application (written in PHP, Perl or Python) might be in the same process, but the database is always a separate process. As a result of using Erlang, LYME and LYCE applications perform well under high load and if distribution and fault tolerance is needed. The query and data manipulation language of Mnesia is also Erlang (rather than SQL), therefore a web- application for LYME is developed using only a single programming language. Interest in LYME as a stack had begun by August 2005, as was soon cited as a high-performance web application platform that used a single development language throughout. Favorable comparisons to other popular stacks such as Ruby on Rails were soon forthcoming. Comparisons to LAMP have also been favourable, although some have highlighted the difficulties of porting \\"SQL thinking\\" to the very different context of Mnesia.  Adoption  A successful user of LYME is the Swedish internet payment-processing company Klarna, who have built their whole architecture on LYME. This is seen as a successful project that demonstrates virtues of both LYME and functional programming in general. LYME was also covered in the Erlang session at the Software Practice Advancement (SPA) 2008. Besides Yaws, there are several other web servers written in Erlang, e.g. Mochiweb, Misultin, and Cowboy. Besides Mnesia and CouchDB, there are a couple of other databases written in Erlang, e.g., Cloudant, Couchbase Server (born as Membase), database management system optimized for storing data behind interactive web applications, Riak, and SimpleDB (part of Amazon Web ServicesWhat You Need To Know About Amazon SimpleDB).

The Gompertz distribution is often applied to describe the distribution of adult lifespans by demographers and actuaries. Related fields of science such as biology and gerontology also considered the Gompertz distribution for the analysis of survival. More recently, computer scientists have also started to model the failure rates of computer code by the Gompertz distribution. In Marketing Science, it has been used as an individual-level simulation for customer lifetime value modeling. In network theory, particularly the Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi model, the walk length of a random self-avoiding walk (SAW) is distributed according to the Gompertz distribution.Tishby, Biham, Katzav (2016), The distribution of path lengths of self avoiding walks on Erd≈ës-R√©nyi networks, .  Specification  =Probability density function= The probability density function of the Gompertz distribution is: :f\\\\left(x;\\\\eta, b\\\\right)=b\\\\eta \\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\eta + b x -\\\\eta e^{bx} \\\\right)\\\\text{for }x \\\\geq 0, \\\\, where b > 0\\\\,! is the scale parameter and \\\\eta > 0\\\\,! is the shape parameter of the Gompertz distribution. In the actuarial and biological sciences and in demography, the Gompertz distribution is parametrized slightly differently (Gompertz‚ÄìMakeham law of mortality). =Cumulative distribution function= The cumulative distribution function of the Gompertz distribution is: :F\\\\left(x;\\\\eta, b\\\\right)= 1-\\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\eta\\\\left(e^{bx}-1 \\\\right)\\\\right) , where \\\\eta, b>0, and x \\\\geq 0 \\\\, . =Moment generating function= The moment generating function is: :\\\\text{E}\\\\left(e^{-t X}\\\\right)=\\\\eta e^{\\\\eta}\\\\text{E}_{t/b}\\\\left(\\\\eta\\\\right) where :\\\\text{E}_{t/b}\\\\left(\\\\eta\\\\right)=\\\\int_1^\\\\infin e^{-\\\\eta v} v^{-t/b}dv,\\\\ t>0.  Properties  The Gompertz distribution is a flexible distribution that can be skewed to the right and to the left. Its hazard function h(x)=\\\\eta b e^{bx} is a convex function of F\\\\left(x;\\\\eta, b\\\\right). The model can be fitted into the innovation-imitation paradigm with p = \\\\eta b as the coefficient of innovation and b as the coefficient of imitation. When t becomes large, z(t) approaches \\\\infty . The model can also belong to the propensity-to- adopt paradigm with \\\\eta as the propensity to adopt and b as the overall appeal of the new offering. =Shapes= The Gompertz density function can take on different shapes depending on the values of the shape parameter \\\\eta\\\\,!: * When \\\\eta \\\\geq 1,\\\\, the probability density function has its mode at 0. * When 0 < \\\\eta < 1,\\\\, the probability density function has its mode at ::x^*=\\\\left(1/b\\\\right)\\\\ln \\\\left(1/\\\\eta\\\\right)\\\\text {with }0 < F\\\\left(x^*\\\\right)<1-e^{-1} = 0.632121 =Kullback-Leibler divergence= If f_1 and f_2 are the probability density functions of two Gompertz distributions, then their Kullback-Leibler divergence is given by : \\\\begin{align} D_{KL} (f_1 \\\\parallel f_2) & = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} f_1(x; b_1, \\\\eta_1) \\\\, \\\\ln \\\\frac{f_1(x; b_1, \\\\eta_1)}{f_2(x; b_2, \\\\eta_2)} dx \\\\ & = \\\\ln \\\\frac{e^{\\\\eta_1} \\\\, b_1 \\\\, \\\\eta_1}{e^{\\\\eta_2} \\\\, b_2 \\\\, \\\\eta_2} \\\\+ e^{\\\\eta_1} \\\\left[ \\\\left(\\\\frac{b_2}{b_1} - 1 \\\\right) \\\\, \\\\operatorname{Ei}(- \\\\eta_1) \\\\+ \\\\frac{\\\\eta_2}{\\\\eta_1^{\\\\frac{b_2}{b_1}}} \\\\, \\\\Gamma \\\\left(\\\\frac{b_2}{b_1}+1, \\\\eta_1 \\\\right) \\\\right] \\\\- (\\\\eta_1 + 1) \\\\end{align} where \\\\operatorname{Ei}(\\\\cdot) denotes the exponential integral and \\\\Gamma(\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot) is the upper incomplete gamma function.Bauckhage, C.

He was a scientist in the fledgling field of synthetic biology, particularly in relation to diffusion and osmosis. He was a professor at the √âcole de M√©decine de Nantes and worked on osmotic crystallisation and the physiological effects of electric current. He was an Officier de la L√©gion d'honneur. Leduc believed that it is necessary to appreciate biological processes from a physical perspective and constructed models from physics and chemistry to try to explain development and growth; these would typically involve ingenious combinations of chemicals to produce systems which mimicked the appearance of living processes such as karyokinesis and \\"remarkable fungus-like forms\\". He \\"[repudiated] extra-physical forces in the phenomena of life\\".

Rocky had been in the pool, mostly alone, for 17 years, after being captured off the coast of Florida in 1971. Broughton and the others intended to move the dolphin, who weighed 650 lbs, 200 yards from the pool to the sea, using a ladder, a net, a home-made dolphin stretcher, and a hired Mini Metro.\\"Animal rights man dies on hunger strike\\", Lancashire Evening Telegraph, 8 November 2001.\\"Barry's life\\", Arkangel, undated. On the night of the action, they realised the logistics of the operation were beyond them, and decided to abandon their plans, but were arrested when the police found them with the dolphin stretcher in the back of the car. Broughton, Horne, Jim O'Donnell, and Jim Buckner were fined ¬£500, while Broughton and Horne were also given six- month suspended sentences.Mann, Keith. From Dusk 'til Dawn: An insider's view of the growth of the Animal Liberation Movement, Puppy Pincher Press, 2007, p. 165. The management of Marineland eventually agreed to give Rocky to campaigners in response to Broughton and others picketing the facility. In 1991, Rocky was transferred to a lagoon reserve in the Turks and Caicos Islands, then released.Mann, Keith. From Dusk 'til Dawn: An insider's view of the growth of the Animal Liberation Movement, Puppy Pincher Press, 2007, p. 167. Peter Hughes of the University of Sunderland cites the campaign as an example of how promoting an animal rights perspective created a paradigm shift toward seeing dolphins as individuals, as a result of which, he wrote, there are now no captive dolphins in the UK.Hughes, Peter. \\"Animals, values and tourism ‚Äì structural shifts in UK dolphin tourism provision,\\" Tourism Management, Volume 22, Issue 4, August 2001, pp. 321‚Äì329. =1999 possession and conspiracy charges= Broughton was first jailed in 1999 after police found a bomb in the boot of his car.Animal activist 'behind bombings', BBC News, 28 October 2008, retrieved 11 November 2008 He was convicted of conspiracy to cause an explosion likely to endanger life.

The Stop Primate Experiments at Cambridge (SPEAC) campaign succeeded in persuading the university to abandon its plans in January 2004.Primate Research Facility at 307 Huntingdon Road: Notice, Cambridge University Reporter, 28 January 2004. Shortly thereafter, SPEAC learned that Oxford University planned to build a new animal research laboratory, including a non-human primate lab, in the university's science area. The activists said that talks between Oxford and Cambridge had resulted in Oxford agreeing to conduct the brain experiments that were lost with the abandonment of Cambridge's plans.The New Primate Laboratory , SPEAK, retrieved 21 July 2006.

Judge Patrick Eccles QC accused Broughton of being part of a \\"ruthless conspiracy\\" against the Oxford Biomedical Facility. In March 2010, Mel Broughton had his conviction overturned due to the 'unsafe' way in which the trial judge summed up the conviction, with Broughton arguing the DNA evidence in the case had been unreliable.

It aired on November 25, 2008. This episode is an \\"extended episode\\" as it runs for an extra seven minutes (excluding ads), taking the total episode's length without ads to 50 minutes. Plot A gun- wielding man named Jason takes House, Thirteen, a nurse, and several patients hostage in Cuddy's office. The man claims to be sick with a long undiagnosed illness and demands medical attention from the best doctor in the hospital. With a room full of already sick patients, House must use them as guinea pigs to assure the hostage-taker that the medications he is administering to him are legitimate. As Cuddy and the rest of House's team communicate with House over the phone to run tests and offer possible diagnoses, they ponder the possibility that everyone in Cuddy's office could wind up dead. With one hostage already shot, Thirteen wagers her own already diminished health as she simultaneously receives the experimental treatments the hostage-taker patient is receiving as he wants to make sure they are not sedatives. At one point, House gets the gun in order to do a CT scan, but gives it back afterwards in order to continue the standoff and the search. After receiving medicine for Cushing's syndrome, Thirteen develops kidney failure. This gives House a clue as Jason's kidneys are not failing and the team realizes that some of the drugs he had previously been given must be protecting his kidneys. Next the team believes that it is melioidosis, but Jason's medical history says he has not been to tropical climates. When pressed, he says he's never traveled farther south than Florida. House calls him an idiot, as Florida's climate does in fact qualify as a tropical one, and sends for a drug to treat the disease. Jason sends House out in exchange for the drug and demands that Thirteen take the injection first. Thirteen's suicidally reckless behavior comes to a head as she is faced with taking a drug that certainly will kill her due to her kidney failure. She breaks down, pleading that she doesn't want to die, and at the last second, Jason grabs the syringe and injects himself as the SWAT team blows the wall down and storms the room. Outside, as Jason is arrested, House signals him to take a deep breath and let it out, and as he is able to do it, the diagnosis of melioidosis is confirmed. After nearly dying, Thirteen asks Foreman to admit her into a clinical trial for a potential Huntington's treatment, after having turned down his offer to get her in at the beginning of the episode. At the end of the episode, Cuddy is looking around at her destroyed office when House enters. They argue over who is to blame, him for being so obsessed with solving the case that he gave the man back the gun, or her for doing everything he told her.

Macrae was the author of Winston Churchill's Toyshop, a memoir detailing his experiences at MD1.  Early career  Macrae had been a trainee engineer and late in the First World War worked on a device for dropping grenades as an early form of cluster bomb. The war ended before the device was used or he received any commission for his work. Macrae was an editor of Armchair Science magazine during the period leading up to the Second World War. He was approached by Millis Jefferis who was after strong magnets for a secret explosive project. Already security cleared from his previous work, Macrae was able to join in the project.  Second World War  Macrae was called up as a second lieutenant on the Special List of the Territorial Army on 1 September 1939. with the effect that he had to give up editing Armchair Science and a gardening magazine at the same publisher. One of Macrae's first weapons inventions was a limpet mine. The mine was developed by Macrae and Cecil Vandepeer Clarke in 1939 using improvised development techniques. Macrae was the administrator of MD1, but also able to continue to be involved in developing weapons and devices. By the end of the war he was a war substantive lieutenant colonel. His promotion to full colonel, as a result of MD1 being upgraded to a Grade A Establishment, was halted by the end of the war. He remained in the TA after the war, transferring to the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) as a substantive major on 9 October 1947 (with seniority from 6 October 1942).  Later career  In 1947, Macrae applied to the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors with regards to his part in the development of the Sticky Bomb. His application was actively opposed on the basis that he was provided with the concept \\"on a plate\\" - the basic concept had been devised by Millis Jefferis. Macrae did not contradict this, but emphasised his part in the development of the weapon. He was awarded ¬£500 [equivalent to ¬£ in .] for his contribution.Sticky Bomb Awards . The Times newspaper, 6 March 1951 p3 column B. He was promoted to substantive lieutenant colonel on 1 July 1950, and awarded the Territorial Efficiency Decoration, with clasp on 15 June 1951. In 1953, Macrae was questioned about his possession of certain documents originating from his time at MD1. Matters came to light as he again applied to the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors for his wartime work on a variety of gadgets. Some of the documents were secret or top secret. He explained that he had taken the papers home for safe keeping when The Firs closed in 1947 because no one else would take them away and they were left lying on the workshop floorColonel Questioned on Secret Documents ‚Äì Took Them Home For Safety.

Macrae shared a number of awards from the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors: ¬£600 [equivalent to ¬£ in ] jointly for the L-delay Switch; ¬£400 [¬£] for the limpet mine, ¬£300 [¬£] for an air-pressure switch and ¬£200 [¬£] for igniters, detonators and signal flashes.Award To Limpet Bomb Inventors. The Times newspaper, 12 December 1953 p3 column G. He retired from army service on 1 January 1955, and was granted the honorary rank of colonel. Between 1956 and 1970, Macrae took out a number of patents relating to reflecting road studs. In 1971, Macrae published the book \\"Winston Churchill's Toyshop,\\" detailing his work at MD1, one of the most famous and successful of all the British secret \\"back rooms\\" of World War II. Macrae's book traces his work at the \\"toyshop,\\" from the limpet mine, a delayed action mine, to the sticky bomb and the Blacker Bombard, to giant, bridge-carrying assault tanks (the Great Eastern). The workshop operated initially out of a tiny basement workshop and later from a country mansion. It produced an astonishing variety of ingenious and secret weapons that destroyed innumerable German tanks, aircraft and ships.

The last Lynn of that Ilk died in Irvine, Ayrshire in 1670, and the last remnants of the family simply vanished, some say to Sweden. It has been claimed, though not proven, that Jenny Lind the \\"Swedish Nightingale\\" is descended from that family.

Dunbar, Esq., Advocate, Henry Beveridge, Esq., Advocate, and John Wadlaw, Esq., Advocate, Edinburgh (1841), the trial occurred in 1576, Jack's full name was Andrew Jack, and he and Bessie lived in Lynn. They were not members of the family of Lynn. By this time, in fact, the Lynn property was referred to as \\"the town and territory of Lyne in the bailliary of Cunningham and sheriffdom of Ayr,\\" as found in a 1522 charter at the National Archives of Scotland and abstracted at the NAS website [Reference No. GD3/1/8/11/1].

The Lyne family had a tradition of such premonitions and on this occasions she was in the glen when all of a sudden she espied a company of huntsmen on horseback; her son in the lead with the dogs, who were in full cry after a stag. As she watched this vivid scene they vanished like a dream. She hurried back to urgently find and warn her son. Lord Lyne listened and accepted his fate, for what could he do if it was indeed God's will. The next day he was up and about, bright and early, but never to return. His anxious mother had sent out all the servants to search the glen for him, eventually finding her son in a pool at the foot of Lynn Spout, seemingly having fallen and then drowned. It has been said that Lady Lyne believed to her dying day that her son had encountered death himself that morning in Lynn Glen and that her vision was that of her son hard on the heals of a ghostly stag and the wild dogs of hell.

The ballad was collected and published by Thomas Percy in London in 1765 in his \\"Reliques of Ancient English Poetry: Consisting of Old Heroic Ballads, Songs, and Other Pieces of Our Earlier Poets\\" (Vol. II, pp. 309-18). There, Percy described the ballad as being \\"originally composed beyond the Tweed,\\" understood to mean in the Scottish Borders. The association with Ayrshire likely came about because Timothy Pont, about 1600, assumed that the ballad must have been a tale of the Ayrshire family since he wrongly believed that \\"no other race of the same name and designation [was] ever known to have existed in the country ...\\" Pont admits, however, that local [Ayrshire] tradition was silent on the subject. Pont's account was written about 1600 and was published by The Maitland Club in 1820 as the \\"Topographical Account of the District of Cunningham, Ayrshire. Compiled About the Year 1600 by Mr. Timothy Pont. With Notes and an Appendix.\\" What Pont apparently did not know was that a David de Lyne lived in Peeble-shire in 1270 and was described in a volume of \\"The Scots Peerage\\" (Vol. IX, p. 199) as being the \\"quondam Domini [late Lord] of Locherworth.\\" Nearly a century earlier, David de Lyne, son of Robert de Lyne, and David's uncle Walter de Lyne held rights to the Chapel of Lyne in Peebles-shire, as reported in \\"The Book of Stobo Church. Being the First Volume of a Series of 'Books of the Church',\\" p. 6, Dr. Gunn, Peebles (1907). The gist of the ballad is as follows ... The Laird of Lynn despaired of his naive and foolish son, generous to a fault and giving trust were none was deserved. On his death bed he called for his son and one last time warned him of the perils that a rich man faced in this world. With his last breath he told his son that if he lost everything he should go to a ruinous old cottage which would be his last hope for shelter. As the months went by the young laird entertained his many new friends and indeed his gamekeepers son, known as Jock O' the Scales, was especially helpful and supportive. Shortly the young Lord found that all his money was spent and eagerly accepted an offer from Jock who purchased the barony and promptly threw the laird out his home and exiled him from his lands. Full of self-importance, upon his successful betrayal, Jock offered to sell the whole property back for a fraction of its value, knowing that such a young fool would never be capable of gaining even such a relatively small sum. The Laird of Lynn remembered his father's death bed advice and the small key he had been given, so in his despair sought out his last resort, the dilapidated cottage in the woods at Coal-heuch-glen. After much searching he found and entered the building, only to be greeted by the sight of a hangman's noose dangling from the ceiling. Convinced of his father's apparent message from the dead he put the rope around his neck, only to find himself falling to the floor and being rained upon by plaster. He saw a letter in his father's hand and this directed him to a corner of the cottage where behind two loose stones he found a chest full of silver and gold. A new wisdom, from an almost fatal lesson, guided the Laird of Linn for the rest of his days, living quietly, with many real friends to enjoy; dwelling in his ancestral home and upon his lands, bought back from that despairing traitor, Jock O' the Scales.Service, John (Editor) (1887).

It is the second oldest continuously functioning club on the Bowdoin campus, second only to the Bowdoin Orient. History The Quill was the successor to The Escritoir, which was published only during the 1826-27 school year. According to the founders of The Quill, \\"while there was no lack of verses in The Escritoir, there was a lack of poetry.\\" So, a group of students headed by Percival Proctor Baxter set out to revive Bowdoin's literary life and, in January 1897 the first issue of The Quill was published. It was originally published on the fifteenth of each month. In 1929, it was published four times a year; in 1932, three times a year; and in 1956, two times each year. Since 1993 the Quill has been published once a year. Notably, several of Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Robert P.T. Coffin's poems were published in the magazine while he was a student in the early 1900s. Current activity In recent years, though the final literary magazine is only published once a year, The Quill has remained active throughout the school year by putting out poetry pamphlets - folded brochures featuring about four poems each - roughly every month. Other activities hosted by the group include occasional coffeehouse events, the semi-annual creation of an \\"Insta-Pamphlet\\" by encouraging passersby in the Bowdoin Student Union to write a poem on the spot, and the \\"Day Long Poem,\\" composed of single lines written by students in passing throughout a day. The Quill has also been known to print April Fool's editions of pamphlets, featuring joking statements such as \\"The Quill owns Baxter State Park,\\" due to the club's connection with Percival Proctor Baxter (the club's first chairman), and containing poems that function as inside jokes written by club members. The Quill has recently seen a resurgence in activity on campus, and over the last four years the membership has doubled in size and the final magazine has been expanded by 20 pages.

The reason that the \\"mid-1990s\\" is stated is due to the sharp increase in activity in the field at that time: the publication of the first systematic study of the topic, the founding of the first academic journal devoted to the topic, and an American Academy of Religion panel (Philadelphia, 20 November 1995) devoted to \\"Revisioning Buddhist Ethics\\". Before this short span, there were ventures into Buddhist ethics, but no period marks such a dramatic \\"burst\\" in academic activity as the mid-1990s. Much like Critical Buddhism and Buddhist modernism, it is a result of recent exchanges of Eastern and Western thought. While generally thought of as a sub-field of Buddhist studies, the discipline of Buddhist ethics draws together history, philosophy, religious studies, anthropology, and more in an attempt to understand what may be the fundamental question of Buddhism: how ought man live?Keown, Damien (1992). The Nature of Buddhist Ethics, p. 1. Specific work has been produced on Buddhist ethics dating back to the 1920s. Early descriptive accounts of Buddhist ethics include Tachibana's Ethics of Buddhism (1926), focused on TheravƒÅdin ethics, and Poussin's La Morale Bouddhique (1927), based on MahƒÅyƒÅna texts. Other early authors that expressed interest in Buddhist ethics include Caroline Augusta Foley Rhys Davids and Isaline Blew Horner. In 1979 the Journal of Religious Studies featured a section devoted to the study of TheravƒÅdin ethics. featuring four prominent scholars in Buddhist studies.(1979 Vol. 7 (1) pp.1-64)  History  Buddhist ethics emerged as an academic discipline in 1992, with the publication of Damien Keown's book The Nature of Buddhist Ethics. His subsequent co-founding of the Journal of Buddhist Ethics in 1994 further solidified the birth of a new field in the discipline of Buddhist studies. Prior to Keown's book, only a handful of books and articles existed that attempted to delve into the questions of a specifically Buddhist ethic. Even more daunting, however, has been the separation of 'ethics' from the rest of Buddhism. Buddhism has been called an eminently ethical religion. It has also been argued, by Keown and others, that the very question the Buddha sought to answer was a purely ethical one, namely, \\"the perennial problem of the best kind of life for man to lead.\\"Keown, Damien (1992). The Nature of Buddhist Ethics, p. 1. In October 2011 Columbia University hosted the first conference dedicated solely to Buddhist ethics entitled Contemporary Perspectives on Buddhist Ethics.  Trends  Arguably the most fruitful attempt to define Buddhist ethics has been in terms of Western theories from Aristotle (virtue), Kant (deontological), and Bentham and James Mill (utilitarian). However, others‚Äîmainly non-Western scholars‚Äîhave sought to present Buddhist ethics in a more direct or traditional form. =Aristotle / virtue= In Buddhist Ethics as Virtue Ethics, Nick Gier compares Buddha's ethical teachings to Aristotle's, \\"Like Greek virtue ethics, Buddhist ethics is also humanistic and thoroughly personalist.\\"Buddhist Ethics as Virtue Ethics Damien Keown devotes a great deal of his work to debunking claims that Buddhism is utilitarian in nature. His work then goes on to examine the structure of Buddhist ethics, focusing specifically on morality (Pali: siila). His conclusion is that Buddhist ethics most closely resembles the ancient Greek virtue ethics found in Aristotle. James Whitehill, in Buddhist Ethics in Western Context: The Virtues Approach, says, \\"Buddhism's legitimation in the West can be partially met by demonstrating that Buddhist morality is a virtue- oriented, character-based, community-focused ethics, commensurate with the Western 'ethics of virtue' tradition.\\"Buddhist Ethics in Western Context: The Virtues Approach =Kant / Deontological= A handful of pioneering works have sought to examine similarities between Kantian and Buddhist ethics. One such is Bradford Cokelet's \\"Reflections on Kant and Karma\\". > \\"I would argue that, given the recent popularity of claiming that Buddhist > ethics is a type of virtue ethics, Buddhist ethicists should respond to > criticisms that Kant and Kantians have made of western versions of virtue > ethics and to claims that most virtue-ethical criticisms of Kantianism rest > on misunderstandings of Kant and Kantianism. See for example, J.B. > Schneewind, \\"The Misfortunes of Virtue\\", in Ethics, Volume 101, 1990, p. > 42-63, Barbara Herman, \\"Making Room for Character\\", and Allen W. Wood, > \\"Self-love, Self-benevolence, and Self-conceit\\", both in Kant, Aristotle, > and the Stoics, ed. Jennifer Whiting and Stephen Engstrom, Cambridge : > Cambridge University Press, 1996, and Onora O‚ÄôNeill, Towards Justice and > Virtue, Cambridge : Cambridge University Press, 1996.\\" fn. 20, p.13.\\" =Bentham/Mill - utilitarian= Mark Siderits suggests that the doctrine of anatta provides the grounding for an \\"aretaic consequentialism\\"Siderits, \\"Buddhist Reductionism...\\" p.293 in which the goal is the alleviation of suffering for all beings (realizing that there is no \\"self\\" to be freed apart from others). He follows a long line of thinkers in Buddhist ethics. =Traditional Buddhist ethics= Two key teachers of traditional Buddhist ethics are Hammalawa Saddhatissa and Padmasiri De Silva. Saddhatissa was a Sri Lankan Buddhist monk who wrote Buddhist Ethics in 1970 (reprinted in 1987, 1997 & 2003). De Silva has a similar work, Buddhism, Ethics and Society: The Conflicts and Dilemmas of Our Times (2002). A third, and less notable work is The Way to Social Harmony (1989, available online) by Venerable U Pyinnyathiha. These works can be invaluable as an introduction into key Buddhist canonical texts such as the Sigalovada Sutta.http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.31.0.nara.html  Further reading  *Aitken, Robert.

It is best known as a nesting location for herons and other wading birds.\\"Lake Renwick Heron Rookery\\", Forest Preserve District of Will County (FPDWC), accessed November 6, 2008. Features Lake Renwick is an artificial lake created through the adaptive reuse of a network of former quarries from which aggregates were mined for concrete used by the Chicago metropolitan area. After the quarries were closed in 1983, the areas of below-water-table elevation filled with water, and the resulting lakes were sold to the county forest preserve district and the Illinois Department of Natural Resources in 1990 for use as open space.\\"Into the Wild: Lake Renwick Heron Rookery\\", Chicago Wilderness (Spring 1998), accessed November 6, 2008. Lake Renwick, because of its location, depth, and the fertility of its fishery, is especially adapted to serve as a breeding location for wading birds. Unlike many Illinois lakes, this body of water has a gravel bottom, not mud. According to the Illinois Audubon Society, the heron rookery located within the lake is \\"by far the most valuable rookery in all of Illinois . . . a site of outstanding statewide significance.\\" Bird lovers have constructed a series of artificial nesting structures on a network of small islets within one of the lakes. The lake complex draws great blue herons, great egrets, black-crowned night herons, double-crested cormorants, and cattle egrets.\\"Lake Renwick Heron Rookery Nature Preserve\\", Illinois Department of Natural Resources, accessed November 6, 2008. The park today Lake Renwick Preserve is located southeast of Plainfield, Illinois, on U.S. Highway 30. Unsupervised visitation by the public to most of the preserve is banned from March until mid-August to prevent disturbance to nesting birds. The public is welcomed to a dedicated birdwatching area, the Copley Nature Park, year around, and is welcomed to the entire preserve from mid-August until the end of February. During the non- nesting months, the public often uses a 2.9-mile (4.6 km) system of trailways throughout the preserve area, the Lake Renwick Bikeway. The Bikeway reuses a system of railroad spur-line-rights of ways, lake isthmuses, and truck paths once used to remove and haul out the aggregates quarried from the lake basins. The Bikeway provides access to various spots used for bank fishing.\\"Lake Renwick Preserve - Turtle Lake\\", FPDWC, accessed November 6, 2008. During the nesting months, those interested in supervised birdwatching are urged to make prior arrangements with the Forest Preserve District and its guides. Nesting activities are described as reaching their peak in June, as the wading birds teach their young how to catch fish. A parcel of the Lake Renwick Preserve, comprising most of Lake Renwick itself, was listed in 1992 as an official nature preserve of the state of Illinois.

Alternatively, it is also known as the photonic time-stretch (PTS) digitizer,J. Capmany and D. Novak, \\"Microwave photonics combines two worlds,\\" Nature Photonics 1, 319-330 (2007). since it uses an optical frontend. It relies on the process of time-stretch, which effectively slows down the analog signal in time (or compresses its bandwidth) before it can be digitized by a standard electronic ADC.  Background  There is a huge demand for very high-speed analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), as they are needed for test and measurement equipment in laboratories and in high speed data communications systems. Most of the ADCs are based purely on electronic circuits, which have limited speeds and add a lot of impairments, limiting the bandwidth of the signals that can be digitized and the achievable signal-to-noise ratio. In the TS-ADC, this limitation is overcome by time-stretching the analog signal, which effectively slows down the signal in time prior to digitization. By doing so, the bandwidth (and carrier frequency) of the signal is compressed. Electronic ADCs that would have been too slow to digitize the original signal, can now be used to capture this slowed down signal.  Operation principle A time-stretch analog-to- digital converter (with a stretch factor of 4) is shown. The original analog signal is time-stretched and segmented with the help of a time-stretch preprocessor (generally on optical frontend). Slowed down segments are captured by conventional electronic ADCs. The digitized samples are rearranged to obtain the digital representation of the original signal. Optical frontend for a time-stretch analog-to-digital converter is shown. The original analog signal is modulated over a chirped optical pulse (obtained by dispersing an ultra-short supercontinuum pulse from a mode-locked laser, MLL). Second dispersive medium stretches the optical pulse further. At the photodetector (PD) output, stretched replica of original signal is obtained. The time- stretch processor, which is generally an optical frontend, stretches the signal in time. It also divides the signal into multiple segments using a filter, for example, a wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) filter, to ensure that the stretched replica of the original analog signal segments do not overlap each other in time after stretching. The time-stretched and slowed down signal segments are then converted into digital samples by slow electronic ADCs. Finally, these samples are collected by a digital signal processor (DSP) and rearranged in a manner such that output data is the digital representation of the original analog signal. Any distortion added to the signal by the time-stretch preprocessor is also removed by the DSP. An optical front-end is commonly used to accomplish this process of time- stretching. An ultrashort optical pulse (typically 100 to 200 femtoseconds long), also called a supercontinuum pulse, which has a broad optical bandwidth, is time-stretched by dispersing it in a highly dispersive medium (such as a dispersion compensating fiber). This process results in (an almost) linear time-to-wavelength mapping in the stretched pulse, because different wavelengths travel at different speeds in the dispersive medium. The obtained pulse is called a chirped pulse as its frequency is changing with time, and it is typically a few nanoseconds long. The analog signal is modulated onto this chirped pulse using an electro-optic intensity modulator. Subsequently, the modulated pulse is stretched further in the second dispersive medium which has much higher dispersion value. Finally, this obtained optical pulse is converted to the electrical domain by a photodetector, giving the stretched replica of the original analog signal. For continuous operation, a train of supercontinuum pulses is used. The chirped pulses arriving at the electro- optic modulator should be wide enough (in time) such that the trailing edge of one pulse overlaps the leading edge of the next pulse. For segmentation, optical filters separate the signal into multiple wavelength channels at the output of the second dispersive medium. For each channel, a separate photodetector and backend electronic ADC is used. Finally the output of these ADCs are passed on to the DSP which generates the desired digital output. Impulse response of the photonic time-stretch (PTS) system The PTS processor is based on specialized analog optical (or microwave photonic) fiber links such as those used in cable TV distribution. While the dispersion of fiber is a nuisance in conventional analog optical links, time-stretch technique exploits it to slow down the electrical waveform in the optical domain. In the cable TV link, the light source is a continuous-wave (CW) laser. In PTS, the source is a chirped pulse laser. Capture of a 95 GHz RF tone using the photonic time-stretch digitizer. The signal is captured at an effective sample rate of 10 terasamples per second. In a conventional analog optical link, dispersion causes the upper and lower modulation sidebands, foptical ¬± felectrical, to slip in relative phase. At certain frequencies, their beats with the optical carrier interfere destructively, creating nulls in the frequency response of the system. For practical systems the first null is at tens of GHz, which is sufficient for handling most electrical signals of interest. Although it may seem that the dispersion penalty places a fundamental limit on the impulse response (or the bandwidth) of the time- stretch system, it can be eliminated. The dispersion penalty vanishes with single-sideband modulation. Alternatively, one can use the modulator's secondary (inverse) output port to eliminate the dispersion penalty, in much the same way as two antennas can eliminate spatial nulls in wireless communication (hence the two antennas on top of a WiFi access point). This configuration is termed phase-diversity.Yan Han, Ozdal Boyraz, Bahram Jalali, \\"Ultrawide-Band Photonic Time-Stretch A/D Converter Employing Phase Diversity,\\" \\"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MICROWAVE THEORY AND TECHNIQUES\\" VOL. 53, NO. 4, APRIL 2005 Combining the complementary outputs using a maximal ratio combining (MRC) algorithm results in a transfer function with a flat response in the frequency domain. Thus, the impulse response (bandwidth) of a time- stretch system is limited only by the bandwidth of the electro-optic modulator, which is about 120 GHz‚Äîa value that is adequate for capturing most electrical waveforms of interest. Extremely large stretch factors can be obtained using long lengths of fiber, but at the cost of larger loss‚Äîa problem that has been overcome by employing Raman amplification within the dispersive fiber itself, leading to the world's fastest real-time digitizer.J. Chou, O. Boyraz, D. Solli, and B. Jalali, \\"Femtosecond real-time single-shot digitizer,\\" Applied Physics Letters 91, 161105 (2007). Also, using PTS, capture of very high-frequency signals with a world record resolution in 10-GHz bandwidth range has been achieved.S. Gupta and B. Jalali, \\"Time-warp correction and calibration in photonic time-stretch analog-to-digital converter,\\" Optics Letters 33, 2674‚Äì2676 (2008). Comparison with time lens imaging Another technique, temporal imaging using a time lens, can also be used to slow down (mostly optical) signals in time. The time-lens concept relies on the mathematical equivalence between spatial diffraction and temporal dispersion, the so-called space-time duality.B. H. Kolner and M. Nazarathy, \\"Temporal imaging with a time lens,\\" Optics Letters 14, 630-632 (1989) A lens held at fixed distance from an object produces a magnified visible image. The lens imparts a quadratic phase shift to the spatial frequency components of the optical waves; in conjunction with the free space propagation (object to lens, lens to eye), this generates a magnified image. Owing to the mathematical equivalence between paraxial diffraction and temporal dispersion, an optical waveform can be temporally imaged by a three- step process of dispersing it in time, subjecting it to a phase shift that is quadratic in time (the time lens itself), and dispersing it again. Theoretically, a focused aberration-free image is obtained under a specific condition when the two dispersive elements and the phase shift satisfy the temporal equivalent of the classic lens equation. Alternatively, the time lens can be used without the second dispersive element to transfer the waveform's temporal profile to the spectral domain, analogous to the property that an ordinary lens produces the spatial Fourier transform of an object at its focal points.J. W. Goodman, \\"Introduction to Fourier Optics,\\" McGraw-Hill (1968). In contrast to the time-lens approach, PTS is not based on the space-time duality ‚Äì there is no lens equation that needs to be satisfied to obtain an error-free slowed-down version of the input waveform. Time-stretch technique also offers continuous-time acquisition performance, a feature needed for mainstream applications of oscilloscopes. Another important difference between the two techniques is that the time lens requires the input signal to be subjected to high amount of dispersion before further processing. For electrical waveforms, the electronic devices that have the required characteristics: (1) high dispersion to loss ratio, (2) uniform dispersion, and (3) broad bandwidths, do not exist. This renders time lens not suitable for slowing down wideband electrical waveforms. In contrast, PTS does not have such a requirement. It was developed specifically for slowing down electrical waveforms and enable high speed digitizers.  Relation to phase stretch transform  The phase stretch transform or PST is a computational approach to signal and image processing. One of its utilities is for feature detection and classification. phase stretch transform is a spin-off from research on the time stretch dispersive Fourier transform. It transforms the image by emulating propagation through a diffractive medium with engineered 3D dispersive property (refractive index). Application to imaging and spectroscopy In addition to wideband A/D conversion, photonic time-stretch (PTS) is also an enabling technology for high-throughput real-time instrumentation such as imagingK. Goda, K.K. Tsia, and B. Jalali, \\"Serial time-encoded amplified imaging for real-time observation of fast dynamic phenomena,\\" Nature 458, 1145‚Äì1149, 2009. and spectroscopy.D. R. Solli, J. Chou, and B. Jalali, \\"Amplified wavelength‚Äìtime transformation for real-time spectroscopy,\\" Nature Photonics 2, 48-51, 2008. J. Chou, D. Solli, and B. Jalali, \\"Real-time spectroscopy with subgigahertz resolution using amplified dispersive Fourier transformation,\\" Applied Physics Letters 92, 111102, 2008. The first artificial intelligence facilitated high-speed phase microscopy is demonstrated to improve the diagnosis accuracy of cancer cells out of blood cells by simultaneous measurement of phase and intensity spatial profiles.C. Chen, A. Mahjoubfar, & B. Jalali, \\"Deep Learning in Label-free Cell Classification,\\" Scientific Reports 6, 21471 (2016) . The world's fastest optical imaging method called serial time-encoded amplified microscopy (STEAM) makes use of the PTS technology to acquire image using a single-pixel photodetector and commercial ADC. Wavelength-time spectroscopy, which also relies on photonic time-stretch technique, permits real-time single-shot measurements of rapidly evolving or fluctuating spectra. Time stretch quantitative phase imaging (TS-QPI) is an imaging technique based on time-stretch technology for simultaneous measurement of phase and intensity spatial profiles. In time stretched imaging, the object's spatial information is encoded in the spectrum of laser pulses within a pulse duration of sub-nanoseconds. Each pulse representing one frame of the camera is then stretched in time so that it can be digitized in real-time by an electronic analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The ultra-fast pulse illumination freezes the motion of high-speed cells or particles in flow to achieve blur-free imaging. published under CC BY 4.0 licensing References   Further reading  *G. C.

Nancy and Rocco Palese had lived most of their adult lives in Turin, Italy, before immigrating with their three children to the United States in 1969. After 18 months in Chicago, Nancy and Rocco opened their first pizza parlor, Guy's Pizza, featuring a popular thin crust pizza. In 1971 friends tried to get the Paleses to experiment with pan pizza. Rather than imitate others, Rocco decided to invent his own pizza, modeled after his family‚Äôs recipe for \\"scarciedda,\\" an Easter specialty cake and called his new invention Stuffed Pizza.About Nancy's Pizza In 1974, Rocco and Nancy opened the first Nancy's location in Harwood Heights, Illinois, which could seat only 35 people. Three years later, they opened the first location in Chicago. In 1990, the Palese family sold the name Nancy‚Äôs Pizza and all development rights to Dave Howey, the president of Chicago Franchise Systems, Inc., who had been a licensee of the Paleses since 1977. Today, there are 20 Nancy's locations in Illinois, as well as six locations in the Atlanta, Georgia, area, one location in O'Fallon, Missouri, and one location in Raleigh, North Carolina. Al's Beef In 1938 Al Ferreri and his sister and brother-in-law, Frances and Chris Pacelli, Sr. developed the original Italian Beef sandwich, served at Al's Beef locations. The original idea for the Italian beef sandwich was formed out of necessity. In the great depression era, meat was scarce. Chris and Al would go to family weddings and in order to make the meat go around, the family sliced it thinly and made sandwiches. The first official Al's Beef stand began as a small, curbside, outdoor, wooden neighborhood food stand with countertop service located on Laflin and Harrison Streets, in Chicago‚Äôs ‚ÄúLittle Italy‚Äù neighborhood. The beef stand gradually grew and moved to its present location at 1079 W. Taylor Street, still in Chicago‚Äôs \\"Little Italy.\\" It was here that they added Chicago hot dogs, fresh, homemade, hand-cut French fries, and Polish sausage to the menu. In 1999, Chicago Franchise Systems bought the rights to Al's #1 Italian Beef Restaurants. The first Al's franchised location opened in 2001 in Tinley Park, Illinois. Al's retail locations are positioned to compete with local independent beef stands as well as larger corporate entities such as Portillo's and Buona Beef. On season 1 of Man v. Food, Adam Richman visited Al's Beef in Chicago and learned the official \\"Italian stance\\" for eating such a juicy sandwich. Then in 2012, Richman returned to Al's on another show, Best Sandwich in America, where the Italian beef sandwich was chosen as best sandwich in the Midwest.

He was elected as one of two delegates from Christianssand to the Eidsvoll Assembly in 1814. He represented the unionist side, and came very well prepared to Eidsvoll, bringing his own constitution draft. Along with him from Christiansand came wholesaler Ole Clausen M√∏rch. Family Wergeland's family hailed from Brekke in Sogn. His father was Halvor Lassesen, a teacher and parish clerk in Hosanger. Feminist writer Camilla Collett, drawn by her father Nicolai Wergeland Wergeland's daughter Camilla Collett, author of the novel Amtmandens d√∏ttre (\\"The Governor's Daughters\\", 1854, anonymously), is regarded as Norway's first feminist writer. Poet Henrik Wergeland, drawn by his father Nicolai Wergeland The son Henrik Wergeland is often characterized as Norway's national poet, and a symbol of the country's independence. Wergeland was also father of military officer Oscar Wergeland, and proprietor Harald Titus Alexis Wergeland. His nephew, mountaineer, lieutenant general and government minister Harald Nicolai Storm Wergeland grew up with the family, when the young mother, Wergeland's sister, became a widow. Career Wergeland studied theology in Copenhagen. As he did not come from a wealthy family, his economic conditions were so difficult that he considered enlisting as a soldier. He became a cand.theol. in 1803, served as a curate in Christianssand from 1812, a vicar to Eidsvold from 1816, and rural dean in Eidsvold from 1822. He became well known for winning a contest arranged by the Norwegian Society for Development (Selskabet for Norges Vel) in 1811, coming up with the best writing arguing for a separate Norwegian university in Christiania, with Mnemosyne (published in Historisk- philosophiske Samlinger in 1811). In Christianssand he was an active participant at Det Dramatiske Selskab, which had been founded by his father- in-law. He was elected delegate to the Eidsvoll Assembly in 1814, where he was a member of the constitution committee. He participated actively also in the plenary sessions, with long and well-prepared speeches. His unionist and anti- Danish point of view made him less popular among delegates with a different opininon. Throughout his life Wergeland participated actively in political and cultural debates, published several works, experimented with drawing and painting, and composed music.

This privately held company is headquartered in Portland, Oregon. The company has 3 stores in Oregon. They specialize in plumbing and electrical supplies, but they also have a mix of products similar to a neighborhood hardware store. The largest A-Boy store is the Barbur Boulevard location and it also has a seasonal plant nursery, and lumber. They also sell a limited selection of their product line, mostly faucets, via their website. History Tigard A-Boy A-Boy Supply was founded by John Dolan in 1960 in a former grocery store in southeast Portland, Oregon. They first sold plumbing fixtures, electrical supplies and appliances. Lighting products and lighting supplies were added later. In 1962 he opened a second store in Milton-Freewater, Oregon- 300 miles away from the first store in Portland, Oregon. Although the store did well, distance made management difficult and, in 1969, John sold it. The family then directed focus on developing stores in the Portland metro area beginning with a store in Tigard, Oregon. In November 1975, 2 stores were opened. One in Beaverton, Oregon, and one in the Northeast Portland Hollywood neighborhood. The Vancouver, Washington store opened just in time for the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. The Hillsboro, Oregon store was opened in 1984 and the Portland Northwest Vaughn Street store in 1996. In July 2009, two months after announcing plans to liquidate their stores, the president of A-Boy Supply Co. bought out his family members and reopened 5 of the company's 6 stores, all of the Oregon locations.  Supreme Court Case: Dolan v. City of Tigard  A 1991 application to the City of Tigard to redevelop the Tigard A-Boy store site was halted due to a dispute with the city of Tigard. After John Dolan died in 1993, his wife Florence Dolan pursued the case to the US Supreme Court. In June 1994, she won the Supreme Court decision Dolan v. City of Tigard, that found the City of Tigard in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. After the court victory, and a delay in collecting restitution from the city, the new store was completed in 1999.

Rithet was a sternwheel steamer that operated in British Columbia from 1882 to 1917. The common name for this vessel was the Rithet. After 1909 this vessel was known as the Baramba. Design and Construction R.P. Rithet at Victoria, BC 1882 R.P.Rithet was designed to replace the recently burned Elizabeth J. Irving. The engines from Elizabeth J. Irving were salvaged and installed in the Rithet, which was intended to the most luxurious riverboat ever launched up to that time in British Columbia. The vessel was built by master shipwright Alexander Watson for Captain (sometimes called \\"Commodore\\") John Irving, one of the most famous steamboat captains in the history of British Columbia. The Irving family was strongly connected with development on the east side of Portland, Oregon, and it was reported in the contemporary press that they had sold some of their land in East Portland for $65,000, some of which may have been applied to pay for the new steamer. The new vessel was named after Robert Paterson Rithet, a businessman who was married to the sister of Captain Irving's wife. He was a partner in the firm of Welsh, Rithet, and Co., which had offices in San Francisco and Victoria, BC, and also major sugar holdings in the Hawaiian Islands. Rithet was a close business associate of and adviser to Captain Irving.Hacking, Norman R., and Lamb, W.

The steamer was launched on April 20, 1882, at Victoria. The steamer was to join the Irving family's fleet of other vessels, then known as the Pioneer Line. About six weeks after the vessel was launched, Captain Irving took Rithet on her first voyage to the mainland, arriving at New Westminster, BC on June 10, 1882. Arriving on a Saturday night, the vessel's electric lights shown brilliantly across the water, earning the praise of the local press. A military band had been embarked, which played stirring tunes as crowds of people swarmed on the docks to welcome Captain Irving's new steamer. Formation of the Canadian Pacific Navigation Company By 1882, the Pioneer Line had vanquished most of its competitors on the run up the Fraser River from New Westminster. Irving's major rival at the time of the launch of Rithet was Captain William Moore, who ran Western Slope under contract with the Hudson's Bay Company (\\"HBC\\") across the Strait of Georgia from New Westminster to Victoria. Moore went into bankruptcy, and Irving and Rithet then joined with Alexandro Munro, HBC chief factor and other prominent businessmen to incorporate the Canadian Pacific Navigation Company (\\"C.P.N.\\"). HBC contributed three of its vessels, and Irving contributed four, including R.P. Rithet. Dispute over seaworthiness In early 1883, Moore, thinking he was still in legal control of Western Slope, launched a legal complaint with the inspector of steamboats claiming that Rithet was not sufficiently seaworthy to cross the Strait of Georgia. The witnesses in support of the complaint were all officers or crew of, or persons interested in Western Slope. Despite this biased evidence the steamboat inspector concurred and forbade Rithet from crossing the Strait until such time as her seaworthiness was established. In response, Alexander Watson, builder of R.P. Rithet defended the vessel's design and construction in a letter to the Victoria Colonist published January 13, 1883. Irving himself went back to Ottawa, Ontario where he was able to persuade the Ministry of Marine to reverse the steamboat inspector, and by February 27, 1883 Rithet was clear again to run across the strait. Operations on Fraser River R.P. Rithet at Yale, BC, 1882 Rithet also ran up the Fraser River and occasionally was taken on holiday excursions, such as on July 4, 1883. The American holiday was widely celebrated in British Columbia in those days, due to the large numbers of Americans in the province. On this occasion, Rithet departed Victoria at 1:00 p.m. on July 3, and was due to arrive at Hope the next day. Onboard sports and other diversions with cash prizes were offered. Excursionists could then ride a special Canadian Pacific Railway train to the end of the line at Yale, British Columbia. Once the rail excursions returned to Hope, the steamer then went back down river and across the Strait of Georgia, returning to Victoria on July 6, 1883. The entire excursion would have cost a participant $11, with meals and berth included. Competition with Teaser By 1884, Captain Moore was back again in competition with Captain Irving on the Strait of Georgia route. This time Moore had launched a new propeller steamer Teaser, which he registered in the name of one of his sons, apparently in an attempted to stall the numerous creditors that seemed to be constantly pursuing Captain Moore. Teaser however could make little progress against the C.P.N., which was running not only the Rithet on the Strait route, but also the enormous sidewheeler Yosemite, recently brought up from operations in California. Moore was soon forced off the run, and like his Western Slope, Teaser was sold to satisfy the claims of his creditors, later being known as Rainbow. Collision with sidewheeler Enterprise Wreck of Enterprise after collision with R.P. Rithet, late July 1885 On the afternoon of July 28, 1885, Rithet and another vessel, the sidewheeler Enterprise were both bound for Victoria out of New Westminster. Rithet was under the command of Capt. Asbury Insley, and Enterprise was under Captain George Rudlin. The weather was clear and visibility was excellent on that summer day. At about 2:25 p.m. near Victoria, at Ten Mile Point (now known as Cadburo Point) at the entrance to Cadburo Bay, they collided. Rithet's crew claimed Enterprise ignored a whistle blast directly her to put her helm over to port. A minute before the collision, both vessels were proceeding at full speed, although there had been a last-minute attempt to reverse the engines on Rithet just before the impact, and the engines on Enterprise had been stopped. Rithet struck Enterprise bow-on, about eight feet forward of the wheelhouse. Enterprise started sinking immediately and panic broke out among the passengers. The force of the blow knocked Captain Rudlin off Enterprise and on to the Rithet. Cattle being transported on Enterprise started swimming around in the water, and passengers and crew grabbed on for anything that would float. Most of the passengers of Enterprise were rescued, either by Rithet or by Western Slope which happened to be in the area and assisted in the rescue. Two passengers were drowned however. This was the first fatal accident involving the C.P.N. A later inquest found Captain Insley of Rithet was responsible for the accident, and that all the officers of both vessels, save only the mate of Enterprise, who was seriously hurt, deserved censure for not acting to quell the panic of the passengers aboard Enterprise. Captain Insley's license was suspended for 12 months and he was never employed by C.P.N. or any other company on the coast again, although he was able to find work as a master of inland steamers. His fault was that he had left a green hand at the helm while he left the wheelhouse to eat dinner.Downs, Art, Paddlewheels on the Frontier‚ÄîThe Story of British Columbia and Yukon Sternwheel Steamers, at 21-22, Superior Publishing, Seattle WA 1972 Captain Rudlin was faulted for not reboarding Enterprise from Rithet to take action to manage the evacuation of the vessel, but unlike Insley, he continued to receive command assignments from C.P.N. Loss of the William Irving On June 28, 1894, Rithet broke her paddlewheel shaft at Maria Slough, near Ruby Creek on the Fraser River, which disabled the vessel because her sternwheel could not be turned. Upriver another C.P.N. vessel the William Irving was loading freight and cattle at Katz Landing. Captain Irving himself took command of William Irving with a plan to bring Rithet downriver for repair. He proceeded downriver to where Rithet lay disabled and lashed up Rithet next to Irving, so that both vessels could proceed downriver side-by-side. Things went well until they reached Farr's Bluff, where the strong current swung both vessels around, and Irving's bow smashed into a rock. Some of the crew of Irving began to panic, and jumped onto Rithet. Captain Irving, who was at the wheel, ordered the lines to Rithet cut so that both vessels might not sink. Free of Rithet, Irving kept going downstream, gradually sinking, and eventually hit a sandbar, which caused her to become a total wreck, an uninsured loss of a vessel worth $50,000. Takeover by Canadian Pacific Railway In early 1901, the Canadian Pacific Railway took over the Canadian Pacific Navigation Company and its fleet of steamships, including Rithet. The name of the C.P.N. continued for a time, as there was not an immediate dissolution of the company's structure. The new superintendent was Capt. James W. Troup, a friend of Captain Irving, but who nevertheless had his own ideas of how things should be run. Among other things, Troup wanted to replace the motley C.P.N. collection of wooden coasting vessels, some very old, with some newer vessels, preferably built of steel. Changing travel patterns In the late 1890s, changing travel patterns decreased the importance of the Strait of Georgia run from Victoria to New Westminster. Steamers on this route had picked up cargo and passengers in the Gulf Islands along the route, but regular steamers assigned to the Gulf Island routes took away this business. The cannery business used to require that salmon be canned and crated at the Fraser River then transshipped to Victoria to be loaded on ocean-going vessels. By the late 1890s ocean-going vessels were going directly to the canneries on the Fraser River, eliminating the need for steamers to carry the packed salmon to Victoria. Also, when the transcontinental Canadian Pacific Railway was completed with its terminus at Vancouver, BC, steamship traffic shifted over to Vancouver as the preferred point to disembark passengers and unload inland bound cargo. Rithet stayed on the route until 1907, although by 1901 Rithet was only crossing the strait in the summer. Last years of service On October 16, 1906, the CPR steamer Princess Victoria ran aground in bad weather near Victoria. The next day the passengers and crew were taken off by Rithet.Turner, Robert D., The Pacific Princesses‚ÄîAn Illustrated History of Canadian Pacific Railway's Princess Fleet on the Northwest Coast, at 60, Sono Nis Press, Victoria, BC 1977 After the summer of 1907, Ripthet was withdrawn from regular service. In April 1909, C.P.R. sold Rithet to the Terminal Steam Navigation Company, which refitted the vessel to serve points between Vancouver and Howe Sound, and renamed the vessel Baramba. In 1917 all machinery was removed from Baramba and the vessel was converted to a barge.

It is a -story Federal house, three bays wide by two deep, constructed of Flemish bond brick on the front facade and common bond elsewhere. Outbuildings on the property include an original brick dairy house and a mid-19th century one-room Gothic Revival frame doctor's office which was moved to the site for use as a museum. The house was constructed in 1815. It serves as the headquarters of the Montgomery County Historical Society which maintains the house as an early 19th-century period historic house museum. The house also include indoor slave quarters, and two rooms with changing exhibits of local history. The Beall‚ÄìDawson House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The property also includes the Stonestreet Museum of 19th Century Medicine, a one-room doctor's office with medical and pharmaceutical tools, furniture, and books from the 19th and early 20th centuries. History The Beall‚ÄìDawson House was built circa 1815 for Upton Beall and his wife and daughters. Beall, from a prominent Georgetown family, was Clerk of the Court for the county, and he wanted a home that would reflect his wealth and status. In 1815 Rockville was a small rural community, despite being the county seat and an important cross-roads town. Beall's large brick Federal-style home, built overlooking Commerce Lane (now West Montgomery Avenue), was designed to impress both inside and out. After Beall's death in 1827, ownership of the house moved to his wife, Jane, and three surviving daughters, Mathilda, Jane Elizabeth, and Margaret. Jane Beall never remarried, and her three daughters never married. The daughters lived in the house their entire lives. After Mathilda and Jane Elizabeth died, Margaret Beall invited a cousin, Amelia Somervell, to live in the house with her. Somervell married John L. Dawson, a local farmer and landowner, and lived at the house with her husband and nine children (eight of whom survived to adulthood). When the last of Beall's daughters died in the late 1800s, she left the house to three of Somervell-Dawson's daughters, continuing the tradition of three sisters being owners of the house. As money grew tight, the Dawsons turned to the house to provide an income, starting a restaurant that ran out of the front yard, teaching dancing lessons to neighborhood children, and taking on boarders. Despite the Dawsons' best efforts, however, the house began to suffer from neglect. After the last of the Dawson sisters died, the house was sold to the Davis family in 1946. The Davises, who had been looking to take on a fixer- upper, set to restoring the house to its former grandeur. The family returned much of the house to how it would have looked while under the Beall's family care along with adding an addition to the side of what used to be the servants/slave quarters that housed a modern kitchen and dressing the original kitchen as the family's dining room. After Edwin Davis's death, Mrs. Davis's passion for their project waned and she sold the house to the City of Rockville, and it became the Montgomery County Historical Society's headquarters.

Aladdin Industries Aladdin Industries was a vendor of lunchboxes, kerosene lamps, stoves and thermal food storage containers. It was founded in Chicago in 1908 by Victor Samuel Johnson, Sr. and incorporated as the Mantle Lamp Company. Aladdin Industries was created as a subsidiary of Mantle Lamp Company in 1914, specifically to manufacture vacuum bottles. The company was further diversified under former president Johnson's leadership. It was the maker of the first character lunchbox, using images of Hopalong Cassidy, in 1950. In 1908, Johnson Sr., a Chicago soap salesman, became interested in kerosene mantle burners. Dissatisfied with the available kerosene lamps of the time, Johnson began selling U.S.-made mantle lamps. He incorporated his lamp sales business and called the company the Mantle Lamp Company of America. In 1912, the company began manufacturing mantle lamps that gave off a steady white light without smoke. They called these lamps Aladdin lamps after the magical lamp and wish-granting genie in the children's story. In 1917, Johnson Sr. diversified the company's offerings and began producing insulated cooking dishes, known at the time as Aladdin Thermalware jars. These Thermalware jars were the company's first venture into heat and cold retaining dishes and are early cousins of the products in use today. In 1919, Johnson moved these jars into a new subsidiary he called Aladdin Industries. This subsidiary offered thermalware jars and vacuum ware and successfully sold and manufactured these products from 1919-1943. In 1943, Johnson Sr. died and his son Victor S. Johnson, Jr. took over as president of Aladdin Industries, Inc. In 1949, in an effort to centralize operations, Johnson Jr. moved Aladdin's offices and manufacturing facilities to Nashville, TN. Under Johnson Jr.'s management, Aladdin began producing metal lunch boxes in the 1940s. By the 1950s Aladdin was an industry leader in this category and would remain so for the next 30 years. Aladdin's dominance in lunch products resulted from a strategic move in the early 50s to license popular character images on its products. Hopalong Cassidy was the first character licensed product and in its first year, sales went from 50,000 units to 600,000 units. Subsequent branding included Superman, Mickey Mouse and The Jetsons. In 1965 Aladdin Industries expanded their product line through the acquisition of the Stanley Bottle operation. This move helped solidify the company's position in the food and beverage container category by deepening their line of steel offerings. In 1968, Aladdin introduced the insulated thermal tray, which revolutionized meal distribution for airlines, and then hospitals and other mass-feeding institutions which could, at last, keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold for long periods of time. Aladdin Industries incorporated Aladdin Synergetics as a new division for healthcare foodservice products. In 1998, this subsidiary was sold to Welbilt Corporation and was renamed Aladdin Temp-Rite. In 2002, Aladdin Temp-Rite was acquired by the Ali Group. =1980s ‚Äì 2002= During the 1980s and 1990s Aladdin continued to grow and by the mid 1990s its Nashville operation grew to employ 1100 employees. At this time, foam insulated mugs grew in popularity and Aladdin's products were sold in grocery chains nationwide. Aladdin opened their Nashville factory on Murfreesboro Road, producing its first thermal products in July 2002. Seattle-based company Pacific Market International, LLC purchased the Aladdin brand in 2002.

Description The BMH property includes the 1850 meeting house itself, the mid-late 19th century parsonage to the south, and the associated cemetery. The church is a large, wood-frame structure built in the Greek Revival \\"temple\\" form, although it features Gothic-style windows throughout. To the south of the church is a two-story frame Victorian parsonage built on a cruciform plan, with some Queen Anne-style embellishments. History The church was constructed on the foundation of an 1820 Presbyterian church which burned down in 1849. It served as the Bethesda Presbyterian Church from 1850 until 1925 when the congregation decided to erect a new church on Wilson Lane, farther south in Bethesda. When the church moved to its new location in 1925, the trustees sold the building and of land to Mrs. May Fitch Kelley. The Presbyterian congregation, however, retained ownership of the cemetery. Mrs. Kelley lived in the church building for many years. In 1945, the property was sold to a French Algerian Catholic missionary group called the Missionaries of Africa, commonly known as the White Fathers. In the 1950s, the property was transferred again, this time to the trustees of the Temple Hill Baptist Church.

The M12 combined elements from two of McLaren's previous efforts, the M6 series and the M8 series. One of the more notable owners of an M12 was Chaparral Cars, who used the McLaren in the early 1969 Can-Am season while their own model's development had been delayed. Development Per Geoge Eaton, who bought a M12 from McLaren, McLaren told him \\"the M12's were originally to be built for an assault on LeMans\\". The cars were developed to take the M6GT Coupe bodywork. Parts on the M12's had M6GT cast directly into the uprights. Unfortunatlely, the FIA did not accept the M12 under homoligation rules so McLaren was forced to abandon the project. Since they had many monocoque chassis' already built, the plans were changed for the M12 to be a roadster and sell them as customer cars for the CanAm series. M12s were intended as McLaren's first customer cars based on the M8As which the team had successfully used to win the 1968 Can-Am season, as well as the M8Bs which the team were developing for 1969. However, the M12s did not share everything from the M8 series. Instead, the monocoque chassis were actually based on the early M6 series initially developed in 1967. On top of this chassis, the aerodynamic bodywork of the M8A was added. The engine bays were specifically designed to house a Chevrolet V8 engine, but several customers opted for other manufacturers. All M12s were built by Trojan, rather than at McLaren's racing headquarters Several M12s were later modified by customers in order to cope with necessary demands. Many Can-Am M12 customers added larger rear wings for better downforce, in an attempt to keep up with competitors which had already done the same. Two M12s were imported to Japan by LeMans Co one going to Toyota which received revised bodywork to allow better results at Japanese circuits as well as to fit company's own V8 engine. M12 owner Phil Scragg modified his car with smaller M6 bodywork for use in hillclimb events. One final M12 was used by Trojan to develop a street legal coup√© for Canadian Andr√© Fournier. Racing history As the 1969 season began, several teams had already purchased the M12. United States McLaren distributor Lothar Motschenbacher entered an M12 for himself, while Canadian George Eaton received an M12 the same week as the first event of the season. John Surtees, unhappy with the visibility on Chaparral's new 2H model, demanded the team buy him a McLaren until the 2H could be modified to suit him. Team owner Jim Hall reluctantly bought Surtees an M12, and the team used it in the beginning of the season until the 2H met Surtees satisfaction. Surtees M12 was able to lead several laps at the opening event at Mosport and finished on the podium. When Surtees became ill mid-season Italian Formula 5000 driver Andrea de Adamich was given a chance to drive the M12 at Michigan. Eaton was the only other driver able to finish on the podium in an M12 over the rest of the season, finishing third at Edmonton and second at Texas. In Japan, Toyota made the decision to purchase an M12 imported by LeMans Co. Toyota was in the midst of racing against Nissan, Isuzu, and Porsche in several Japanese Group 7 races, but Nissan had so far been unmatched. Toyota was already developing their own model, the 7, but the company also chose to install their V8 engine into the M12 chassis. The M12 was unable to match the Nissans, and following several accidents and deaths of test drivers in developments of the 7 in 1969 and 1970, Toyota withdrew from motorsports and their M12 was retired. Other Japanese teams imported the M12,Kurosawa Racing but opted instead for the standard Chevrolet powerplant. The M12s continued to be used by customer teams into the 1970s, both in Can-Am and the new European Interserie championship, but newer M8-based cars became available each year and eventually replaced the M12s in the field.

He was hanged for the murder of a police officer after a burglary in Bath, Maine. In the early morning hours of September 4, 1883, Wilkinson and his accomplice John Ewitt were caught attempting to break into the D.C. Gould Ship Chandlery and Provision Store in Bath. As Wilkinson and Ewitt were running away from one police officer, they collided with Constable William Lawrence. Wilkinson immediately shot Lawrence in the head with a .32 caliber revolver. Wilkinson was arrested in Bangor, Maine less than a week after the incident and was charged with murder on September 11, 1883. It was discovered that Wilkinson was an escapee from the Maine State Prison. Ewitt had travelled to England; his extradition was never sought by Maine. Wilkinson's trial began in the Bath Superior Court on January 4, 1884. He was convicted by the jury of first degree murder on January 7, 1884 and was sentenced by the judge to death by hanging. The death sentence was carried out at the Maine State Prison in Thomaston on November 21, 1885. Wilkinson did not die instantly from the hanging but slowly died of strangulation. The nature of Wilkinson's death, which was similar to the executions of two other inmates the previous April, was used by anti-death penalty activists to argue that Maine should abolish the death penalty, which it did in 1887.

It contains hiking trails, natural land area, a visitor center, multiple habitats, abundant wildlife and a manmade lake. \\"The Reserve was created to protect and restore native ecological communities, serve as an outdoor classroom for students and teachers, and provide recreational opportunities to all visitors.\\" Schmeeckle Reserve website History Before 1956 the current Schmeeckle Reserve was farmland (corn and grain) and grazing (dairy cattle) land. This land, however was not fertile enough to support a large plant population for agriculture due to bedrock close to the surface, making some areas too wet or dry to support crops.Schmeeckle Reserve website History By the 1950s several farmers had abandoned their efforts to make the ground agriculturally productive (abandoned machinery and building foundations are still visible onsite). The University began purchasing this land, which is located north and east of campus, in 1956, and initially used it as a picnic area. Students from the University's Conservation DepartmentSchmeeckle Reserve website, History were called out to fight fires many times, and their furrows which they dug to help stop the fires can still be seen weaving through the reserve. see Website History. By 1969 the University owned a total of of land, and there was debate on whether to use it for residence halls, housing for married students, athletic fields, or other options. In 1974 the University proposed to use this land for a natural area and hiking trails, with an arboretum.Schmeeckle Reserve website, History At that time the area presently covered by Lake Joanis was not part of the University's holdings. Creation of Lake Joanis At about the same time that the University was proposing its natural area plan, Sentry Insurance, a nationwide company headquartered in Stevens Point, proposed building a new office building on the next major street north of the University campus. MapQuest, 1800 North Point Drive, Stevens Point WI The company's environmental impact statement found that the building would significantly increase vehicle traffic on Reserve Street, which ran through the campus at that time. To reduce the danger that this increase would pose to the University's students, the company proposed closing that street and extending Michigan Avenue through the proposed natural area to replace Reserve Street. At first this proposal brought heated resistance, since it would split the natural area, so a compromise was reached: the construction would require significant soil, which was to be excavated from a 50-acre tract east of the University's acreage. The company would leave that excavation open (it would eventually fill with groundwater, creating an artificial lake), and would deed the tract to the University to be added to the proposed nature holdings. The University agreed with this proposal, and public opposition was calmed. The road extension was completed in 1975. The resulting lake, which covered 24 of the site's 50 acres, was officially named Lake Joanis in 1994, after Sentry Insurance President John Joanis, who paid for its excavation.Schmeeckle Reserve website, History Creation Schmeeckle Reserve was established in 1976 with a $250,000 Land and Water Conservation (LAWCON) Grant. The with Lake Joanis was included within the reserve at this time. The Reserve's first Director was Ron Zimmerman (1977). One of his first acts was to work for the purchase of an adjacent (20 acres) farm, that was once owned by the Edward Wojcik family. The Wojcik's ranch home was converted into the Visitor Center by students from the University over a three-year period, finishing by 1979. By 1981 the LAWCON funds had paid for over five miles of trails and boardwalks, fitness trails and the shelter buildingSchmeeckle Reserve website, History Expansion Over the years, Schmeeckle Reserve has continued to expand its facilities and resources. When the Wisconsin Conservation Hall of Fame was created in 1984, Schmeeckle Reserve became its new home. In 1990, the Hall of Fame constructed a new addition to the Visitor Center with funding from the city's Motel Room tax and more LAWCON funding. Included in the addition was a walk-through exhibit area, formal Hall of Fame gallery, meeting room and sign-making workshop. With the 1998 acquisition of the 75-acre Berard Oaks area at the northeast corner of the Reserve, Schmeeckle has grown to 280 acres. The Reserve continues to evolve, as new trails are developed, further land acquisitions are sought, and prairie and oak savannah habitats are restored. Fred Schmeeckle Fred Schmeeckle, the namesake of the reserve, was a professor from Nebraska who taught at the Stevens Point Normal School beginning in 1923. He taught agriculture but was also a supporter of conservation education, \\"the destruction of forests, pollution of water, and misuse of wildlife areas are factors that started me thinking something should be done to educate people in the wise use of resources.\\"Schmeeckle Reserve website, Fred Schmeeckle In the early 1930s Schmeeckle began teaching conservation courses. This program is now the largest undergraduate natural resources program of its kind in the nation. Schmeeckle took his classes on walks and on bird watching trips to the natural area north of the campus, which is now where the reserve is located. In 1954 Schmeeckle said, \\"Some day this area will serve as an island of green in the city of Stevens Point.\\"Schmeeckle Reserve website, Fred Schmeeckle He had it right and his island of green is now named for him.

Features and typical concepts  = Basic concepts = A program in a non-structured language uses unstructured jumps to labels or instruction addresses.

Background  General Edouard Ferdinand Jamont (1831‚Äì1918), the first commander of the Tonkin occupation division Following their conquest of Cochinchina (southern Vietnam) in the 1860s, the French attempted to extend their influence into Tonkin (northern Vietnam). A first, abortive attempt to intervene in Tonkin was made by Francis Garnier in 1873. Nine years later, in April 1882, Henri Rivi√®re seized the citadel of Hanoi, inaugurating the second French intervention. Although Rivi√®re's career ended in disaster a year later, with his defeat and death at the hands of the Black Flag Army at the Battle of Paper Bridge (19 May 1883), Jules Ferry's expansionist government in France sent strong reinforcements to Tonkin to avenge this defeat. Although it would take many years before Tonkin was truly pacified, the second French attempt to subdue Tonkin was ultimately successful. In August 1883, in the wake of Admiral Am√©d√©e Courbet's victory at the Battle of Thu·∫≠n An, the Vietnamese court at Hu·∫ø was forced to recognise a French protectorate over both Annam (French protectorate) and Tonkin.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 166 Efforts by the French to entrench their protectorate in Tonkin were complicated by the outbreak of the Sino-French War in August 1884, which tied down large French forces around H∆∞ng H√≥a and L·∫°ng S∆°n, and later by the C·∫ßn V∆∞∆°ng uprising in southern Vietnam in July 1885, which required the diversion of French forces from Tonkin to Annam. When the Sino-French War ended in April 1885, there were 35,000 French troops in Tonkin, but the area of French control was restricted to the Red River Delta. Between April 1885 and April 1886 French troops closed up to the Chinese border, raising the tricolour and establishing customs posts at L√†o Cai and other frontier crossings into Yunnan and Guangxi provinces, but large swathes of Tonkinese territory remained under the control of insurgent groups. The Tonkin campaign, a struggle by France since June 1883 against various opponents, including Vietnamese forces under the command of Prince Ho√†ng K·∫ø Vi√™m, Liu Yongfu's Black Flag Army, and finally the Chinese Yunnan and Guangxi Armies, officially came to an end in early 1886. On the recommendation of General Charles-Auguste-Louis Warnet (1828‚Äì1913), the commander-in-chief of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps, Tonkin was declared 'pacified' in April 1886, and this achievement was symbolised by the formal downgrading of the expeditionary corps into a division of occupation under the command of General Ferdinand Jamont (1831‚Äì1918). This declaration, made for domestic consumption in France, where opposition to French adventures in Tonkin was growing, was purely cosmetic, and concealed the reality of a continuing, low-level insurgency in Tonkin.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 275‚Äì7, Histoire militaire, 125  Character of the Tonkin insurgency  The C·∫ßn V∆∞∆°ng insurgency against the French launched in Annam in July 1885 after H√†m Nghi's flight from Hu·∫ø was portrayed by the insurgents as a patriotic, anti-French, struggle to 'aid the king'. The insurgency in Tonkin was rather more complex. Many of the insurgents fought for patriotic motives, but others simply wanted to exploit the anarchy that prevailed in much of Tonkin at the end of the Sino-French War. The Chinese armies that had fought the Sino-French War dutifully withdrew from Tonkin in May and June 1885, but their ranks were by then full of Vietnamese volunteers or conscripts, and these men, unpaid for months, were simply disbanded on Tonkinese soil and left to fend for themselves. They kept their weapons and supported themselves by brigandage, in many cases sheltering behind the patriotic rhetoric of the C·∫ßn V∆∞∆°ng insurgency. The French, although reluctant to admit that any of the 'brigands', 'bandits' and 'pirates' in arms against them had noble motives, were well aware that they were fighting a range of enemies in Tonkin: > Throughout Tonkin hard-working law-abiding cultivators had always been left > defenceless in the face of the exactions of the mandarins and the Chinese > and Annamese pirates. The reign of the mandarins was now ended, but force > would be needed to deal with the pirates, whose number had increased in the > past two years. The ranks of the Black Flags and the other professional > brigands who had been fighting us were swollen by discharged Chinese > soldiers, other soldiers who had deserted with their arms and equipment > because they had not been paid, Annamese ne‚Äôer-do-wells who preferred > pillage to agriculture, and sometimes law-abiding peasants who had been > forcibly conscripted.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 284‚Äì5 Liu Yongfu's Black Flag forces continued to harass and fight the French in Tonkin after the end of the Sino-French War. With support from China, Vietnamese and Chinese freebooters fought against the French in L·∫°ng S∆°n in the 1890s. They were labelled \\"pirates\\" by the French. The Black Flags and Liu Yongfu in China received requests for assistance from Vietnamese anti-French forces.http://www.ebay.com/itm/1898-ATM7-INDOCHINE-TONKIN-DE-THAM-PIRATES-YEN- THE-ANNAMITES-NHA-GUE-/141694734051 Pirate Vietnamese and Chinese were supported by China against the French in Tonkin. Women from Tonkin were sold by pirates. Dealers of opium and pirates of Vietnamese and Chinese origin in Tonkin fought against the French Foreign Legion. The bandits and pirates included Nung among their ranks. By adopting their clothing and hairstyle, it was possible to change identity to Nung for pirate and exile Chinese men. Pirate Chinese and Nung fought against the Meo. The flag pirates who fought the French were located among the Tay. In 1891 \\"Goldthwaite's Geographical Magazine, Volumes 1-2\\" said \\"FOUR months ago, a band of 500 pirates attacked the French residency at Chobo, in 'l‚Äòonkin. They beheaded the French resident, ransacked and burned the town, and killed many of the people.\\" In 1906 the \\"Decennial Reports on the Trade, Navigation, Industries, Etc., of the Ports Open to Foreign Commerce in China and Corea, and on the Condition and Development of the Treaty Port Provinces ..., Volume 2\\" said \\"Piracy on the Tonkin border was very prevalent in the early years of the decade. Fortified frontier posts were established in 1893 by the Tonkin Customs at the most dangerous passes into China, for the purpose of repressing contraband, the importation of arms and ammunition, and specially the illicit traflic of women, children, and cattle, which the pirates raided in Tonkin and carried beyond the Chinese mountains with impunity. These posts were eventually handed over to the military authorities.\\" In 1894 \\"Around Tonkin and Siam\\" said \\"This, in my view, is too pessimist an estimate of the situation, a remark which also applies to the objection that these new roads facilitate the circulation of pirates. Defective as they may be, these roads must, it seems to me, be of service to cultivation and trade, and, therefore, in the long run to the pacification of the country.\\" In 1893 \\"The Medical World, Volume 11\\" said \\"Captain Hugot, of the Zouaves, was inclose pursuit of the fnmous Thuyet, one of the most redoubtable, ferocious, and cunning of the Black Flag (Annamite pirates) leaders, the man who prepared and executed the ambuscade at Hue. The captain was just about to seize the person of the young pretender Ham-Nghi, whom the Black Flags had recently proclaimed sovereign of Armani, when he was struck by reveral ar rows, discharged by the body-guard of HamNghi. The wounds were all light, scarcely more than scratches, and no evil effect was feared at the time. After a few days, however, in spite of every care, the captain grew weaker, and it became apparent that he was suffering from the effects of arrow poison. He was removed as quickly and as tenderly as possible to Tanh-Hoa, where he died in horrible agony a few days later, in spite of the most scientific treatment and the most assiduous attention.\\"‚Äî National Druggist. The 1892 \\"The Imperial and Asiatic Quarterly Review and Oriental and Colonial Record\\" said \\"The French port of Yen Long was surprised by Chinese and Annamite pirates and the troops driven out with loss.\\" The 1892 \\"A REVUE SOCIALISTE\\" said \\"La v√©rit√© c'est que la piraterie est organis√©e syst√©matiquement, c'est qu'elle se produit dans des conditions qu'il suffit d'√©noncer, m√™me rapidement, pour convaincre chacun de l'inefficacit√© des mesures r√©pressives don't nous pouvons disposer l√†-bas √† son √©gard. Il convient d'abord d'√©tablir une distinction, car selon qu'elle est chinoise ou annamite, la piraterie change de caract√®re, d'organisation, de puissance. Les pirates chinois sont group√©s en bandes permanentes, arm√©es de fusils √† tir rapide, solidement √©quip√©es. aguerries ‚Äì ce qui n'a rien de surprenant, l'√©tiquette de pirates d√©signant ordinairement dans ce cas des recrues chinoises qui passent continuellement la fronti√®re.- Si l'on conservait le moindre doute √† cet √©gard, il suffirait de consid√©rer ‚Äì leur ≈ìuvre, qui est √† peu pr√®s exclusivement militaire. Ces bandes r√©sident dans les r√©gions montagneuses, dans les d√©fil√©s, d'o√π elles peuvent harceler nos colonnes, faire le coup de feu avec les avantpostes, tuer quelques hommes et s'enfuir dans la brousse pour se reformer un peu plus loin. C'est par l'une de ces bandes qu'a √©t√© surpris, le 9 juillet, le d√©tachement en route pour Lang-Son. Avec la piraterie annamite le groupement par bandes n'est plus permanent, il ne se produit que lorsque se pr√©sente une occasion favorable, il est plus fr√©quent lorsque la r√©colte est mauvaise. L'objectif est, le plus souvent, le pillage d'un village ou la capture des sampans charg√©s qui descendent les nombreux affluents du Song-Co√Ø ou du Ta√Ø-Binh. Pour r√©primer de telles exactions, les fonctionnaires qui ignorant g√©n√©ralement la langue et le pays, sont dans l'obligation d'avoir recours aux lettr√©s et aux fonctionnaires annamites. Or, ceuxci nous d√©testent cordialement, aussi est-ce avec beaucoup d'empressement qu'ils interviennent, non pour faire aboutir les poursuites, mais pour les faire avorter. Ils savent fort bien qu'une telle attitude n'est pas pour d√©plaire √† leur gouvernement. La cour de Hu√© est, on le sait, plus que jamais hostile √† notre √©tablissement au Tonkin, elle encourage secr√®tement tout ce qui peut l'entraver et nous d√©consid√©rer aux yeux des populations. Ajoutons que souvent les fonctionnaires annamites sont mat√©riellement int√©ress√©s √† ce que la piraterie s'effleurisse librement. Les pirates en usent avec les mandarins comme les pirates financiers europ√©ens avec certains journalistes et politiciens, et cela leur r√©ussit admirablement. La discr√©tion des notables annamites est telle, que les pirates, leurs m√©faits accomplis, n'ont pas m√™me √† s'√©loigner du village o√π ils ont fix√© leur r√©sidence. Ils dissimulent simplement leurs armes et, tels des travailleurs rang√©s, pr√™ts √† fournir des renseignements aux Commissions d'enqu√™te, ils assistant tranquillement aux recherches. ll n'est sans doute point besoin d'insister davantage pour que se d√©gage √©crasante, irr√©alisable, avec les moyens actuels, la t√¢che assum√©e par M. de Lanessan.

In the flat and fertile Delta, the insurgents were able to move much more quickly than the French from village to village along the dykes that separated the flooded rice paddies. Most Tonkinese villages were encircled with earth walls, ponds and thick bamboo hedges, and were consequently difficult to attack. If a band of insurgents was detected by the French, it could choose either to disperse or to strengthen a village's fortifications and wear the French down by fighting a regular defensive battle. In the mountainous regions of Upper Tonkin, the insurgents could exploit the scarcity of paths and the difficulties the French faced in supplying their columns to build strong lairs in nearly inaccessible spots. From these hideouts they would fan out into the surrounding regions, laying ambushes for French detachments. As the French troops they met were often sick and exhausted, these ambushes were sometimes successful.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 285 To counter these tactics, the French used 'shandy columns' (colonnes panach√©es), so-called because they normally contained a mix of white and native troops. Typically, a column would contain legionnaires and marine infantry, supported by companies of Tonkinese riflemen. To find the bandits, the French had to march into forests on the basis of imprecise and often misleading intelligence. When they discovered their position, they attacked, but in most cases it had already been abandoned for another. It was a tiring and frustrating struggle, which was not even interrupted during the stormy heats and the rains of summer. The soldiers of the Foreign Legion soon learned that it was more merciful to shoot wounded comrades who could not keep up with the marching columns than to leave them to be captured and tortured to death by the bandits. For several years the French had frustratingly little to show for the enormous military efforts they were making to crush the insurgency. This was above all due to the duality of the command. The regional commanders only had military powers, and in all their operations had to obtain the agreement of the native authorities and the residents of the administrative provinces corresponding to their region. The residents themselves were assisted by merchants who improvised a transport business on which the supply of food and ammunition to the posts depended, and there was no recourse against these entrepreneurs if they failed to fulfil their engagements. Military action under such conditions could be neither swift nor sure. The insurgency resumed as soon as the columns had left, and the installation of posts in some important points did not, as had been hoped, win the French control of the country. Nevertheless, the French did win some successes, and by the end of 1890 the Delta was almost pacified and the insurgent bands had been pushed back into Upper Tonkin.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 285‚Äì6  Progress of the pacification  Execution of a pirate chief in Hanoi, 1886. Pirates, when captured by the French, did not normally live long Beyond the Delta, however, the French had much less to show for their efforts. Their first major victory against the insurgents, at Ba Dinh in January 1887, owed more to the folly of the Vietnamese commander Dinh Cong Trang, who deliberately challenged the French to a set-piece battle near the Annam-Tonkin border, than to the skill of the French high command. The Vietnamese defeat at Ba Dinh was a disaster for the C·∫ßn V∆∞∆°ng movement in Annam, and cost the lives of many Vietnamese insurgents, but it did little to lessen the problems that the French faced in Tonkin.Thomazi, Histoire militaire, 139‚Äì40 The collapse of the C·∫ßn V∆∞∆°ng insurgency in Annam at the end of 1888 also did little to alter the state of affairs in Tonkin. Only two months after the capture of the young Vietnamese king H√†m Nghi in October 1888 a French column of 800 men under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Borgnis-Desbordes incurred heavy casualties (95 men killed and wounded) driving a strong force of insurgents from the villages of Cho Moi and Cho Chu on the Song Cau River. Nevertheless, though resistance continued behind their lines, the French were able to widen their zone of occupation slowly but surely. In western Tonkin, a column under the command of chef de bataillon Bergougnioux advanced up the Clear River and occupied Bac Muc and Vinh Thuy in May 1886.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 283; Histoire militaire, 130 On 1 September 1887 the French occupied H√† Giang. A column under Colonel Brissaud penetrated almost as far as the border with Siam and dislodged a Siamese force that had taken advantage of the chaos in Tonkin to cross the frontier and occupy the small town of Dien Bien Phu. In northern Tonkin Commandant Servi√®re traversed the region between L·∫°ng S∆°n and Zhennan Pass at Cua Ai, and protected the operations of the Border Delimitation Commission set up under the Treaty of Tientsin to demarcate the frontier between Vietnam and China. He dispersed several insurgent bands that had been operating around L·∫°ng S∆°n, and established a post at Chi Ma, on the Tonkin-Guangxi border.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 283 In November 1886 a large expedition under the command of General Mensier drove the insurgents from other localities near the Tonkin-Guangxi border and occupied the important frontier town of Cao B·∫±ng.Thomazi, Histoire militaire, 137 Considerable progress was also made in eastern Tonkin, a region that had seen little fighting during the Sino-French War and was still almost unexplored by the French. Between 1886 and 1888 capitaine de vaisseau de Beaumont's naval division hunted down the pirates who still infested Along Bay and most of the Delta coasts and completed the work that Admiral Am√©d√©e Courbet had begun in 1884. The wild country between L·∫°ng S∆°n and the Guangdong border that the French had been unable to subdue during the war with China was now tamed by the French occupation of Tien Yen, Ha Coi and Mong Cai. A vital preliminary to these operations was the completion of the naval survey of the coast of Tonkin by the naval hydrographer La Porte, who took over the work begun in 1883 by Renaud and Rollet de l'Isle. La Porte's moment of glory came when, as a result of this survey, he personally guided the French gunboats up the narrow river channels to Mong Cai, enabling the French to confront the town's defences with overwhelming strength. Mong Cai was occupied by the French in December 1886. La Porte crowned his career by making a general triangulation of Tonkin, from Haiphong to H∆∞ng H√≥a and to Phu Lang Thuong, drawing on a series of topographical maps produced since 1883 by military engineering officers. Finally, a column of 600 soldiers and 400 coolies under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Alphonse Dugenne, the hero of the B·∫Øc L·ªá ambush in June 1884, marched along the coastal plain of eastern Tonkin as far as the Chinese border and explored the sparsely-populated and mountainous hinterland running back to L·∫°ng S∆°n.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 283‚Äì4 The French completed their penetration of eastern Tonkin in January 1887 by driving insurgent bands from the Pak Lung peninsula, a border region disputed between Vietnam and China. In July 1887 the peninsula was awarded to China by the Border Delimitation Commission.Thomazi, Histoire militaire, 133‚Äì4  A joint political and military solution  French soldiers in Tonkin, c.1890 The tide finally turned in France's favour in Tonkin with the appointment of Jean-Marie de Lanessan as governor-general of Indochina in 1891. De Lanessan, an able, intelligent and energetic administrator, quickly put in place the administrative structures that would enable the military commanders first to contain and ultimately to master the insurrection. He reversed the policy of his predecessors, recalling the unwieldy militia units to the Delta and returning control of the mountain region of Tonkin to the military. He divided Upper Tonkin into four territories, centred respectively on Sept Pagodes, L·∫°ng S∆°n, S∆°n T√¢y and S∆°n La, and placed each territory under the orders of a military commander who was also entrusted (subject to his own oversight) with the civil powers of a r√©sident sup√©rieur. This concentration of military and civil power in the hands of a small number of officers was potentially dangerous, but de Lanessan got on well with General Duchemin, the army commander in Tonkin, and was able to ensure that the commands went to the best officers available. These men included Lieutenant-Colonel Th√©ophile Pennequin, who developed the famous 'oilstain' (tache d'huile) tactics that were eventually to prove so effective in stamping out the insurgency, Colonels Joseph Gallieni and Servi√®re, and chef de bataillon Hubert Lyautey. De Lanessan was lucky. Duchemin and his immediate subordinates were among the finest soldiers then serving in France's colonial empire. Two of them, Joseph Gallieni and Hubert Lyautey, would distinguish themselves in the First World War and end their lives as Marshals of France.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 286 This galaxy of talented administrators and soldiers pursued French aims in Tonkin with a judicious mixture of political and military action. Political action came first. De Lanessan and Gallieni agreed that the most important task for the French was to win over the population to their side. If the ordinary Tonkinese farmers could be persuaded that French rule was preferable to anarchy, they would cooperate with the colonial power. The insurgents would eventually be isolated, and military victory would then follow as a matter of course. Accordingly, the French set out to demonstrate the benefits of their rule. Roads and paths were built to link up the French posts, enabling small French columns to move quickly from place to place. As it became easier for the French to protect law-abiding villagers from the depredations of the bandits, confidence gradually returned. Markets and schools were built in the villages, and the conditions were established in which agriculture, industry and commerce could once more flourish.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 287 Seeing that the French were there to stay, and that they were increasingly capable of imposing law and order, the Tonkinese gradually turned against the insurgents. The French began to receive valuable intelligence on the whereabouts of guerrilla bands. Eventually, they felt secure enough to form local militia units to protect the villages, at last certain that their rifles would be turned against the bandits rather than against themselves. At this point the scales tipped decisively against the insurgents. Once they had lost the sympathy of the local population, they could not hope to win. With the ground thus prepared politically, the French were able to implement Pennequin's 'oilstain' method with considerable success. This method involved building a strong barrier of solid posts, judiciously placed, to push back the insurgents little by little, to occupy effectively the conquered terrain, and to establish new posts further forward. The French did not enter a new troubled region until they had finished with the previous one. The dispatch of attack columns became the exception, and was used only to achieve a clear objective that could not be achieved by political means.  Gradual collapse of the insurgency  In this way, the French were able between 1891 and 1896 to reduce the final centres of resistance in Tonkin. In November 1891 they finally secured control of the Dong Trieu massif, a thorn in their side since 1884, and dispersed the Chinese guerrillas who had operated there for so long. Trouble in the region subsided immediately on the death of the insurgent leader Luu Ky a few months later. In March 1892 the French destroyed the last bandit concentrations in the Yen The region. This remote, wooded, mountain fastness between Tuy√™n Quang and Th√°i Nguy√™n had been colonised by guerrilla bands during the war with China and held against the French ever since by the bandit chiefs Ba Phuc, De Nam and De Tham. Although French troops continued to skirmish with bandits in the Yen The until De Tham's death in 1913, they were no longer a serious threat to law and order. With the removal of these two running sores, the French were able to scale down their military operations in Tonkin between 1892 and 1896 to a very low level. The insurgents, once so formidable, were now reduced to kidnapping isolated French and Vietnamese officials and demanding ransoms for their safe return. They had become a nuisance rather than a threat. Routine sweeps and patrols by single companies now sufficed to police both the Delta and the mountain regions, and in 1896 it became possible for French politicians to speak of the 'pacification' of Tonkin with genuine conviction.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 286‚Äì7  Frontier security  As internal order was restored, the security of the border with China loomed larger. The border had long been porous, and Chinese bands took advantage of the weakness of the French frontier garrisons to cross over into Tonkin, plunder as many villages as they could, then retreat back into China before the French could catch up with them. In 1887 China and France had agreed on the delimitation of the frontier, but this agreement proved to be almost worthless in practice, because the Chinese authorities in the frontier districts actively connived at the activities of the raiders. Indeed, the raiding bands often consisted of parties of regular soldiers of the Guangxi and Yunnan armies. Some French commanders, notably Gallieni, raided villages on the Chinese side of the border in retaliation, or conducted 'hot pursuit' operations across the border into China to track down bands of raiders. Formally, France and China now enjoyed the best of relations, and both the French and Chinese governments turned a blind eye to such incursions. Frontier security for Tonkin was finally achieved in the closing years of the nineteenth century, after the French lined the border with China with blockhouses and stationed enough soldiers there to deter incursions.

When guitarist Fred Mascherino left the group after the Projekt Revolution tour ended in September 2007, band members took a break after years of touring. New Again was recorded in October and November 2008 at several studios in New York and California with David Kahne and Matt Squire as producers. Matthew Fazzi of Facing New York joined Taking Back Sunday in early 2008. He was praised by vocalist Adam Lazzara and the group's manager for incorporating new instruments into the group's sound. Guitarist Eddie Reyes called the album \\"one of the most aggressive records we've ever written\\". Towards the end of 2008, the group revealed the album's title, went on a US tour, and made \\"Carpathia\\" available for streaming. Following a European tour in April 2009, the title-track was released as a free download. Later in the month, \\"Carpathia\\" was released as a Record Store Day release, and \\"Sink into Me\\" was released as a single. After \\"Everything Must Go\\" was made available for streaming, the band toured the US in May and June. New Again was released on June 2 through Warner Bros. Records, with several editions of the album featuring bonus tracks and video content. Following the release of the title- track as a single in July, the group had a support slot on Blink-182's North American tour in August and September. The group embarked on a short US tour in October, followed by a co-headlining US tour with The All-American Rejects in November and December. After an appearance at Soundwave festival in Australia in February and March 2010, Fazzi and Rubano left the group and were replaced by former members John Nolan and Shaun Cooper. New Again sold 48,000 copies in its first week of release, charting at number 7 on the Billboard 200. It also reached the top 10 on several other Billboard charts. The album also reached the top 40 in Canada and Australia. \\"Sink into Me\\" reached the top 40 on the Alternative Songs and Hot Rock Songs charts. New Again received a generally favorable response from critics, who praised the album's sound and Lazzara's vocals even though he called it \\"a gigantic step backwards\\". Subsequently, few songs have been performed live after the release of the band's fifth studio album, Taking Back Sunday. \\"Everything Must Go,‚Äù ‚ÄúCatholic Knees,‚Äù and ‚ÄúLonely, Lonely‚Äù have made rare appearances, with no other songs from the album being played. Background In June 2007, vocalist Adam Lazzara said Taking Back Sunday were preparing to write the follow-up album to Louder Now (2006). In July, bassist Matthew Rubano mentioned that the other members of the band were in the process of writing individually in separate locations: Rubano in Manhattan, Lazzara in Texas, guitarist Fred Mascherino in Jersey, drummer Mark O'Connell on Long Island and guitarist Eddie Reyes in Ohio. From late July to early September, the band participated in the 2007 Projekt Revolution tour. During the tour, they brought along a mobile recording studio and demoed material, and continued writing for their next album. Plans to do serious writing, as well as record their next album towards the end of the year, were in place. However, Mascherino left the band following the end of the tour. He said, \\"It was getting to the point where I felt I had taken the road as long as I possibly could,\\" and his compositions were \\"more pop than anyone else [in the band] wanted to go\\". In October, the group revealed that their next album was \\"in its very early stages\\". In December, Rubano said the group was in New York City working on new material, having already written six songs. Prior to demoing, O'Connell had to have back surgery, having injured it during the Projekt Revolution tour. During the demoing process, the group tried different drummers, but according to Rubano: \\"They just weren't Mark. Not enough ferocity, intensity.\\" Following this, the band's members took time to refocus themselves after several years of constant touring. Lazzara sorted his life out following addiction issues, ending his engagement to Chauntelle DuPree of Eisley. He subsequently moved to another town, got married, and had a child. O'Connell also got married, Reyes spent time with his family, and Rubano recorded music for the TV show Electric Company. In May 2008, it was announced that guitarist Matthew Fazzi, formerly of Facing New York, had joined the band. Reyes, who had met Fazzi during Facing New York's stint on the 2004 Warped Tour, asked him by text whether he wanted to audition for Taking Back Sunday. In a statement, the group called Fazzi \\"talented and versed in many musical instruments\\", mentioning that he would be \\"bring[ing] his unique talent and style to the mix\\". Rubano was uneasy with Fazzi initially: \\"He was this very nice, very talented, ambitious, happy guy, and I was like, 'This guy isn't going to last with us, this guy's the wrong fit.'\\" Around this time, Fazzi and Rubano visited Lazzara in Texas; accompanied by acoustic guitars and a bass, the trio practiced in Lazzara's living room.Taking Back Sunday 2009, event occurs at 1:18‚Äì27 Here, the trio wrote \\"New Again\\" which helped \\"catapult the energy for the beginning of writing [New Again] forward,\\" according to Rubano.Taking Back Sunday 2009, event occurs at 1:28‚Äì39, 1:55‚Äì2:00 During an appearance at the Virgin Mobile Festival in August 2008, Spin reported that the band was on the brink of entering a recording studio. Production In October 2008, the band began recording a new album aiming to release it in early 2009. They initially wanted Eric Valentine as a producer, but according to Lazzara, \\"the timing didn't work\\". David Kahne produced the sessions and engineered the overdubs. He aimed to capture the \\"power and scope\\" of the band's live performances. The group worked with Kahne because of Fazzi. According to Lazzara, when the band learned he produced Paul McCartney's Memory Almost Full (2007) album, they said, \\"let's go work with him\\". Evil Joe Barresi engineered the tracking, with additional production and engineering performed by Jamie Siegel. Recording was done at Avatar Studios, with Justin Gerrish, and at See Squared Studios in New York City. The majority of the album was recorded in five days. Additional recording took place at J-Rock Studios in New York City, with Anthony Lenoci. \\"Sink into Me\\" was recorded at J-Rock Studios, as well as NRG Studios in North Hollywood, California, and The Village in Los Angeles, California. \\"Where My Mouth Is\\" was produced by Matt Squire with engineer Bill Appleberry. It was recorded at NRG Studios, with assistance from Casey Lewis, and at The Village, with help from Jared Nugent. Squire also provided additional production and engineering on \\"Sink into Me\\". On October 24, the band mentioned that they had nearly finishing recording the album and would start the mixing process shortly afterwards. On November 6, the band announced they were \\"still putting the finshing touches on the album\\". The recordings were mixed by Tom Lord-Alge with Fernio Hernandez at South Beach Studios in Miami, Florida. Ted Jensen mastered the recordings at Sterling Sound in New York City. In retrospect, Lazzara called Kahne \\"a good producer,\\" but didn't think he was \\"the right fit\\" for the group. He added that what the group aimed to accomplish was \\"just different than what he had envisioned both sonically and with all of that stuff\\". Reyes said he was \\"pre-warned about working with him and I didn't listen to that. ... It was kind of very blank. I think I put my guitar tracks on and then I flew back home and that was it.\\" Music and lyrics Guitarist Matthew Fazzi (right, pictured with his band Happy Body Slow Brain) has been called a major influence while making the album by both Lazzara and the group's manager. =Overview= An early title for the album was When All Is Said and Done More Is Said Than Done, suggested by Fazzi. The group liked it, however, Fazzi said it was \\"way too long to fit on a side of a CD\\". According to Lazzara, the album was given the title New Again because \\"that's what it feels like. We are in a totally different band, just because there has been this new life breathed into the band with the addition of Matt[hew Fazzi].\\" The album was written in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Here, Rubano said the group \\"stuck out on the street because we were so loud\\". For the album, the band embraced the concept that \\"it's up to us to decide what Taking Back Sunday sounds like. We always want to be redefining what that means, and there's stuff on this record I think in the past we would have stayed away from\\", according to Rubano. Fazzi said the group wanted to \\"put a new foot forward ... to show people that we're expanding the music\\". He noted that the song structures and chord patterns were \\"just a bit stronger and smarter\\". According to Lazzara, Fazzi was a major contributor in writing New Again. The band was, \\"Experimenting ... [with] a lot of different instruments, horns, glockenspiels, there's a flautist on the record. And it's stuff we never would've tried before.\\" Jillian Newman, the group's manager, also mentioned Fazzi's influence: \\"[Fazzi] brought a really positive, happy energy to the band. A lot of the walls came down during writing. He allowed everybody to try new things.\\" With New Again, Lazzara considered his lyrics to be \\"a lot more forward,\\" compared those on earlier songs. Reyes called the album \\"one of the most aggressive records we've ever written\\". The album's sound has been described as alternative rock, pop punk, pop rock and post-hardcore, shifting away from the emo sound of their earlier work. =Songs= Rubano had a bassline that, within an hour of playing it, became the track \\"New Again.\\"Taking Back Sunday 2009, event occurs at 1:00‚Äì12 After writing it, Fazzi said it was a \\"no-brainer for an opener\\".Taking Back Sunday 2009, event occurs at 0:19‚Äì23 O'Connell called it \\"powerful\\" and said it \\"sets the mood\\" for the album.Taking Back Sunday 2009, event occurs at 0:25‚Äì29 One day during rehearsals, Fazzi played a guitar riff, then O'Connell played along, resulting in \\"Sink into Me.\\"Taking Back Sunday 2009, event occurs at 4:11‚Äì19 The song begins with cheerleader-esque \\"hey!\\"s that Fazzi came up with,Taking Back Sunday 2009, event occurs at 4:19‚Äì26 as well as handclaps.

Later that month, the band performed a few shows with The (International) Noise Conspiracy in the US. In December, the group went on a tour of the US with Envy on the Coast dubbed Hurray Tour!. On every night of the tour, local acts were added to the lineup. In addition, fans could purchase holiday cards on the tour. The cards contained a code that, upon being entered on a website, would allow them to download \\"Carpathia\\". On December 21, \\"Carpathia\\" was made available for streaming on YouTube. In addition, it was mentioned that New Again was expected to be released in spring. On March 14, the album's artwork was revealed. In addition, fans could hear snippets of new tracks on the group's website. Three days later, New Again was announced for release. On April 8, the band posted a clip of \\"Sink into Me\\" online. Following an appearance at Bamboozle Left in April, the band went on a tour of Europe with Underoath, Emery and Innerpartysystem as part of the Give it a Name festival. On April 17, the album's track listing was revealed, and \\"New Again\\" was released as a free download. The band released a 7\\" vinyl single of \\"Carpathia,\\" with a live version of \\"Catholic Knees\\" as the B-side, on April 18 as part of Record Store Day. On April 19, \\"Sink into Me\\" was made available for streaming, and released via the iTunes Store on April 24. \\"Catholic Knees (26th St. Shakedown)\\" served as the single's B-side. The music video for \\"Sink into Me\\", which had been filmed in New York with director Travis Kopach in early April, premiered on May 11 on MTV.com. It features the band covered in black goo, a reference to The X-Files black oil, sinking into a stage. The following day, Rubano revealed that \\"an entirely acoustic reinterpretation\\" of New Again was in the works. On May 18, \\"Everything Must Go\\" was made available for streaming on the band's Myspace profile. Following an appearance at the Bamboozle Festival, the band toured the US in May and June with Anberlin and Envy on the Coast. With every two tickets purchased for the tour, fans received a digital download copy of New Again. New Again was made available for streaming via the band's Myspace account on May 28, and released on June 2 through major label Warner Bros. Records. People who pre-ordered the limited version of the album received two extra songs: \\"Didn't See That Coming\\" and \\"Catholic Knees (26th St. Shakedown).\\" A deluxe edition included a DVD with a making-of feature of the recording process, as well as a track-by-track commentary by the band. The iTunes edition included \\"Long Time Comin'\\" and the music video for \\"Sink into Me\\" as bonus tracks. In promoting the album, Warner Bros. Senior Vice- President of Marketing Rob Gordon said the promotional campaign would accomplish two objectives: \\"No. 1 is energizing the fan base. No. 2 is taking this band from the world of ... whatever you want to call it to an arena-rock band,\\" such as the Foo Fighters. To help with the first point, the label worked with Myspace to hold listening sessions aboard the band's tour bus in various cities. The album's release was followed by a European tour in July. \\"New Again\\" was released as a single on July 24 with an acoustic version of \\"Sink into Me\\" as the B-side. In late July and early August, the band toured the UK with support from Twin Atlantic. In August and September, the band supported Blink-182 on their North American tour and performed at Virgin Mobile FreeFest. \\"Where My Mouth Is\\" was released to radio on September 1. In late October, the band went on a brief tour of the US. In November and December, the band co-headlined a US tour with The All-American Rejects, with support from Anberlin. The Japanese edition of the album was released on December 9 through Warner Music Japan and included \\"Didn't See That Coming\\" as a bonus track. In February and March 2010, the band participated in the Soundwave festival in Australia. On this tour, the band performed sideshows with Enter Shikari. After returning home, Rubano sent the rest of the band song ideas, which were ignored: \\"No responses to like half a dozen songs being sent out. Just, very weird.\\" Following two weeks of no communication with the band, three members of the band and their manager held a conference call with Rubano. During the call, the band stated their intention of continuing without him. Likewise, Fazzi received a call saying that the group were letting him go. On March 29, statements by Fazzi and Rubano announcing their departure from the group were posted on the band's website. Two days later, it was announced that former members guitarist John Nolan and bassist Shaun Cooper had re-joined the band. Reception =Critical response= New Again received generally favorable reviews from critics, according to review aggregation website Metacritic. AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that, like their peers, Taking Back Sunday \\"gets increasingly poppy as their career winds on\\". He mentioned that their sound was \\"brighter and bigger in every regard\\". Writing for Alternative Press, Scott Heisel praised the record highly, stating that it \\"leaps forward as the best album of Taking Back Sunday's career to date\\". He also mentioned it featured \\"a darker, more menacing vibe\\". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard said the group \\"branch[ed] out from its emo roots,\\" sounding \\"focused\\" delving into \\"complex melodies and thematic ideas\\". Lipshutz said that Lazzara's growth as a songwriter made the album \\"a brisk, enjoyable outing\\". In a review for Entertainment Weekly, author Andy Greenwald said the group were able to \\"reinvent themselves as mainstreamo shredders\\" with New Again. Melodic reviewer Tom Spinelli noted that the \\"more straight forward ... sound\\" the group were going for could push them \\"into a more mainstream audience\\". He mentioned that while a lot of the songs have \\"a more radio sound on them,\\" it's not done in a \\"cheesy way\\". Jon Pareles of The New York Times mentioned Kahne's production as giving the band \\"a little more gloss\\". Pareles noted several homages to U2: the guitar work on \\"New Again\\" and \\"Catholic Knees,\\" the keyboard intro to \\"Where My Mouth Is,\\" as well as Lazzara's \\"vocal delivery, full of Bono's breathy gulps and open- throated crescendos\\". PopMatters Matthew Niner praised Lazzara's voice, calling him \\"an incredibly versatile vocalist\\". Niner wrote that the group created \\"another solid album that cements their reputation as one of the most genuinely affecting and consistent bands in the current scene\\". Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone wrote that while an \\"arena-ready polish\\" features throughout the album, it doesn't help the \\"forced melodrama,\\" in songs such as \\"Lonely, Lonely\\". Spin reviewer David Bevan wrote that album \\"focuses on roaring arenas as much as on two-timing lovers\\". He said Lazzara's vocals sounded \\"more sore- than full-throated, but they still freeze blood for short stretches\\". Channing Freeman of Sputnikmusic wrote that New Again \\"places less emphasis on catchy parts and [is] more focused on entire songs\\". =Commercial performance and legacy= New Again debuted at number seven on the Billboard 200, selling 48,000 copies in its first week in the United States. The album reached number two on the Alternative Albums chart, number five on both the Digital Albums and Top Rock Albums charts and number six on the Tastemaker Albums chart. The album also charted at number 16 on the Canadian Albums Chart, number 31 on the Australian Albums Chart and number 46 on the UK Albums Chart. \\"Sink into Me\\" peaked at number 10 on the Alternative Songs chart and number 32 on the Hot Rock Songs chart. Alternative Press named it album of the year. Fuse.tv's Jason Lipshutz called New Again his least-favorite Taking Back Sunday album. Lipshutz said that there were \\"moments worth revisiting\\" on the album, but it was \\"clearly a transitional outing,\\" attempting to build on the success of Louder Now. In a retrospective piece, Scott Heisel of Alternative Press said Fazzi helped bring \\"jazz, off-kilter riffs\\" and \\"lush textures\\" to the band, while mentioning the rest of the group provided the \\"most aggressive songs to date in 'Lonely, Lonely' and 'Swing'.\\" In 2010, Lazzara answered questions on his Formspring account, commenting that New Again \\"was a gigantic step backwards\\" and that he was \\"not fully satisfied with what we put out\\". In 2012, Reyes said of New Again: \\"I didn't like how we had to constantly change producers and the songwriting didn't turn out originally as it was, it just kind of bummed us out a bit.\\" Discussing New Again in 2016, Rubano called the period \\"the golden time where I was like 'oh, we're doing music, that we all really like, that we can't wait to get out' and things were going pretty good for a little while\\". However, when the album was released, the \\"critics seemed to like it, but it didn't really hit [with the public], and then when we started the touring cycle for it there was a very decisive mood turn in a band that already was insanely moody all the time\\". The album was released on vinyl in April 2017. Track listing All songs written by Taking Back Sunday. Scroll down to the relevant entries and click on the titles for the songwriter information.

She was the long-term tag team partner of Wendi Richter. She held the NWA United States Women's Championship once and the NWA Women's World Tag Team Championship four times‚Äîtwice with Richter and twice with her other tag team partner Vicki Williams. Professional wrestling career =Training= Joyce Fowler (who also competed as Joyce Becker) was the first female wrestler to use the ring name \\"Joyce Grable\\". Fowler was active from 1963‚Äì1974 and then retired from professional wrestling to focus on her family. In the early 1970s, Betty Wade- Murphy was trained by professional wrestler Judy Grable (who was her childhood idol) to become a female wrestler. Upon her professional debut, she was given the ring name \\"Joyce Grable\\" both as a tribute to her idol and trainer, Judy Grable, and because Fabulous Moolah felt she bared a strong physical resemblance to the original Joyce Grable (portrayed by Fowler). =National Wrestling Alliance= The team of Grable and Vicki Williams won the NWA Women's World Tag Team Championship from Donna Christanello and Toni Rose on October 15, 1973 in New York City. It was not until October 1975 that Rose and Christanello regained the title from Grable and Williams. In 1978 at Superbowl of Wrestling II, she defeated seven other wrestlers in an eight-woman battle royal. Later that year, she defeated Ann Casey to win the NWA United States Women's Championship. In 1979, she helped train Judy Martin. In August 1979, the team of Grable and Williams defeated The Glamour Girls (Leilani Kai and Martin) to begin their second reign as NWA Women's Tag Champions. During the time period from 1973‚Äì1983, Grable frequently competed in the World Wrestling Federation, often in singles matches against WWF Women's Champion Fabulous Moolah and in tag team matches with Williams. In 1982, Wendi Richter became her tag team partner after Grable trained her for six months in Atlanta, Georgia. She wrestled in a series of matches in Stampede Wrestling with partner Richter against Velvet McIntyre and Judy Martin. The teams continued their rivalry into April 1983 in Verne Gagne's American Wrestling Association. In May 1983, she returned to Stampede Wrestling, where she once again teamed with Richter against McIntyre and Penny Mitchell. In 1986, Grable participated in a 10-woman battle royal at the American Wrestling Association's WrestleRock 86 event, losing to Sherri Martel. She continued to appear sporadically on the independent circuit and competed in the Delta Tiger Lilies promotion in 1988. =Retirement= She retired in 1991 and had back surgery. On January 29, 2005, Grable appeared at WrestleReunion managing Sherri Martel, Peggy Lee Leather, Krissy Vaine, and Amber O'Neal in an eight-woman tag team match against Wendi Richter, Bambi, Malia Hosaka, and Jenny Taylor. Grable continues to make appearances at wrestling reunions and conventions, as well as occasional independent shows. Grable appeared at a Magnificent Ladies Wrestling event on April 30, 2011, where she managed Melanie Cruise in a match against \\"Pryme Tyme\\" Amy Lee, and also managed Million Dollar Baby in a street fight against Robbie Rage. On May 20, 2011, she (along with several other retired professional wrestlers) was a guest at a Total Nonstop Action Wrestling live event in Amsterdam, New York. Personal life Grable was originally from Columbus, Georgia. Grable had one biological son, Derek Murphy and a step daughter, Melissa Wade and stepson, Richard Wade from her second husband, Richard Wade's, first marriage. She worked as a trainer at the women's wrestling training facility ran by Fabulous Moolah and was responsible for training several notable female wrestlers, including Wendi Richter and Sherri Martel. After retiring from wrestling, Grable worked as a receptionist at a center for mentally and physically disabled people. In 2013, Grable revealed she had cancer, prompting a benefit show to be held in Florida.

Sperm whaling is the hunting of these marine mammals for the oil, meat and bone that can be extracted from their bodies. Sperm whales, a large and deep-diving species, produce a waxy substance that was especially useful during the Industrial Revolution, and so they were targeted in 19th-century whaling, as exemplified in Moby Dick. Sperm oil is no longer needed, but another unusual product, ambergris, is still valued as a perfume fixative. Although the animal is classified as a vulnerable species, aboriginal whaling in limited numbers is still permitted, notably from two villages in Indonesia, for subsistence. Economic motivation The nose of the whale is filled with a waxy substance that was widely used in candles, oil lamps, and lubricants. Sperm whales were hunted in the 19th century by American, British and other national whaling fleets. As with all the species targeted, the thick layer of fat (blubber) was flensed (removed from the carcass) and rendered, either on the whaling ship itself, or at a shore station. This was the whale oil, stored in casks for the long journey home. It was sold as a lamp fuel, not a food product; the whale meat was discarded. The other species that were within reach during the Age of Sail were filter- feeders, and their baleen had many commercial uses. The sperm whale, being a toothed hunter, lacked this so-called whalebone, but it did produce a valuable commodity: sperm oil. Each whale's head held up to a ton, in a cavity called the \\"case\\". It was part of a waxy liquid called spermaceti, from which the whale got its common name. The liquid was removed from the spermaceti organ at sea, and stored separately from the rendered whale oil for processing back in port. On return home, this headmatter, which was worth around 20% more than the oil from the blubber, was divided into two valuable commodities. One was a very pure type of sperm whale oil that required little or no additional processing. It was found particularly suitable as a lubricant for fine machinery, such as pocket watches. What remained after the oil was extracted was a waxy substance that could be made into spermaceti candles. These burned longer and brighter than tallow candles and left no smell and, as a result, sold at a higher price.Gordon Jackson, The British whaling trade, London, 1978, p.49. Although spermaceti by-products were high-value, they made up only a small proportion, perhaps 10%, of the substances extracted from sperm whales. These much sought after commodities had a variety of commercial applications.T. Mori & M. Saiki, \\"Properties of fats and oils contained in various parts of a sperm whale,\\" Scientific Reports of the Whales Research Institute (Tokyo), No.3, February 1950, pp.79-84. In addition to the manufacture of candles, spermaceti was used in soap, cosmetics, machine oil, other specialized lubricants, lamp oil, paint, putty, pencils, crayons, leather waterproofing, rust-proofing materials and many pharmaceutical compounds. Two other products of the sperm whale are of economic importance. Ambergris, a solid, waxy, flammable substance produced in their digestive system, was also sought as a fixative in perfumery. The whales' teeth were carved by sailors into scrimshaw art. History Nantucket, in red, is an island off the state of Massachusetts where much sperm whaling originated Historically, whaling took a heavy toll on sperm whale populations. Prior to the early 18th century, sperm whales were hunted in Japan and Indonesia. Legend has it that sometime in the early 18th century, supposed to be not far from 1712, Captain Christopher Hussey, while cruising for right whales near shore, was blown offshore by a northerly wind, where he encountered a school of sperm whales and killed one. It is not clear whether this story is apocryphal, since no Christopher Hussey would have been the proper age in 1712. However, another member of the Hussey family, possibly Bachelor (Bachelder) or Sylvanus Hussey, may have been the actual person referred to in the story. Although the story may not be true, sperm whales were indeed soon exploited by American whalemen, as Judge Paul Dudley, in his Essay upon the Natural History of Whales (1725), states that one Atkins, ten or twelve years in the trade, was among the first to catch sperm whales sometime around 1720. =Early 18th century= Only a few sperm whales were recorded to have been caught during the first few decades (1709‚Äì1730s) of offshore whaling, as sloops concentrated on Nantucket Shoals where they would have taken right whales or were sent to the Davis Strait region to catch bowhead whales. By the early 1740s, with the advent of spermaceti candles (before 1743), American vessels appear to have begun to take sperm whales in earnest. The diary of Benjamin Bangs (1721‚Äì1769) shows that, along with the bumpkin sloop he was in, he found three other sloops with sperm whales being flensed alongside off the coast of North Carolina in late May 1743. On returning to Nantucket in the summer 1744 on a subsequent sperm whaling voyage he noted that \\"45 spermacetes are brought in here this day,\\" another indication that American sperm whaling was in full swing. =Late 18th century= Sperm whaling American sperm whaling soon spread from the east coast of the American colonies to the Gulf Stream, the Grand Banks, West Africa (1763), the Azores (1765) and the South Atlantic (1770s). From 1770 to 1775 Massachusetts, New York, Connecticut, and Rhode Island ports produced 45,000 barrels of sperm oil annually, compared to 8,500 of whale oil. In the same decade the British began sperm whaling, employing American ships and personnel. By the following decade the French had entered the trade, also employing American expertise. Sperm whaling increased until the mid-19th century, as spermaceti oil was important in public lighting (for example, in lighthouses, where it was used in the United States until 1862, when it was replaced by lard oil, which was quickly replaced by petroleum) and for lubricating the machines (such as those used in cotton mills) of the Industrial Revolution. Sperm whaling declined in the second half of the 19th century, as petroleum and other products began to replace spermaceti. =19th century= Sperm whaling in the 18th century began with small sloops carrying only a pair of whaleboats (sometimes only one). As the scope and size of the fleet increased so did the rig of the vessels change, as brigs, schooners, and finally ships and barks were introduced. In the 19th century stubby, square-rigged ships (and later barks) dominated the fleet, being sent to the Pacific (the first being the British whaleship Emilia, in 1788), the Indian Ocean (1780s), and as far away as the Japan grounds (1820) and the coast of Arabia (1820s), as well as Australia (1790s) and New Zealand (1790s). Sperm whaling involved the above-named ships searching for sperm whales on certain \\"grounds,\\" or areas where sperm whales were likely to be found, such as the \\"Western\\" Ground in the mid-North Atlantic or the \\"Offshore\\" Ground in the latitudes of 5‚Äì10 degrees south and 105‚Äì125 degrees west longitude. The whales were spotted from one of the several look-outs stationed at the mast-heads. When a whale was found, whaleboats would be lowered and a harpoon attached to a long line would be thrown into it. The whale would then drag the boats (the famous \\"Nantucket sleighride\\") until it was too tired to resist, at which point the crew would lance it to death. A sperm whale is killed and stripped of its blubber and spermaceti. Hunting for sperm whales during this period was a notoriously dangerous affair for the crews of the whaleboats. Although a properly harpooned sperm whale generally exhibited a fairly consistent pattern of attempting to flee underwater to the point of exhaustion (at which point it would surface and offer no further resistance), it was not uncommon for bull whales to become enraged and turn to attack pursuing whaleboats on the surface, particularly if it had already been wounded by repeated harpooning attempts. A commonly reported tactic was for the whale to invert itself and violently thrash the surface of the water with its fluke, flipping and crushing nearby boats. Particularly massive sperm whale specimens have also proven willing (on rare occasions) to attack comparably sized whaleships. In the most famous example, on November 20, 1820 a huge bull sperm whale (purportedly 85-ft in length) rammed the 87-ft Nantucket whaler Essex twice, staving in the hull under the waterline and forcing the crew to abandon ship. After months adrift in lifeboats, the crew eventually resorted to cannibalism, with only 8 out of the 20 sailors surviving until rescue; a 21st sailor had jumped ship in South America before the attack. The bull was unwounded and unprovoked at the time of the attack, but the crew of the Essex was in the process of hunting several smaller females from a nearby pod. Recent analysis suggests that the commotion and the bull's possible extreme size may have caused it to falsely identify the similarly-sized Essex as an intruding competitive male. Bull sperm whales, especially older, solitary bulls, are known to battle amongst themselves for dominance by ramming each other, with the heavy, spermaceti-filled head spaces providing the biological equivalent of a weighted boxing glove.Summers, Adam. \\"Fat Heads Sink Ships\\". American Museum of Natural History: Dept. of Biomechanics. Another proposed factor was the vibrations from repeated sledgehammer blows as the ship's hull was being repaired prior to the attack, which scientists suggest might have carried into the water and unintentionally mimicked the echolocation \\"clicks\\" that sperm whales generate to identify and communicate with each other. Another recorded case of a sperm whale attacking a large ship is that of the New Bedford whaleship Ann Alexander which was rammed and sunk by a wounded and enraged bull off the Galapagos Islands whaling grounds in 1851, just miles from the spot where the Essex had been sunk 31 years prior. The large and unusually aggressive bull had already attacked and chewed to pieces two pursuing whaleboats before eventually turning on the Ann Alexander itself and ramming it just above the keel at an estimated speed of 15 knots. The crew were forced to abandon ship, but unlike the Essex all were recovered safely within days. The bull (whose unusual aggressiveness was eventually blamed on old age and pain from disease) was later discovered floating on the surface, mortally injured and \\"full of wooden splinters\\" from the attack.NY Times, 1851, \\"Thrilling Account of the Destruction of a Whale Ship by a Sperm Whale\\". https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1851/11/05/297732752.pdf American writer Herman Melville was inspired by the account of the Essex, and used some facts from the story, as well as his own eighteen-month experience as a sailor aboard a commercial whaler, to write his epic 1851 novel on the oil whaling industry, Moby Dick. The sections in Moby Dick on the biology of the sperm whale were largely based on books by Thomas Beale (1839) and Frederick Bennett (1840). =20th century= Whaling activity declined from the 1880s until 1946, but picked up again after World War II. Modern whaling was more efficient than open-boat whaling, using steam and then diesel powered ships and exploding harpoons. Initially, modern whaling activity focused on large baleen whales, but as these populations were decimated, sperm whaling increased. Cosmetics, soap and machine oil formed the major uses of sperm whale products during this time. Sperm whale oil was still in use in automobile transmission cooling units in the United States in the 1970s.L.R. Magnolia (compiler), Whales, whaling and whale research, Whaling Museum, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, 1977, p.78. In modern whaling, after the oil had been extracted the meat was usually ground down into a meal for feeding livestock. After sperm whale populations declined significantly, the species was given full protection by the International Whaling Commission in 1985. Hunting of sperm whales by Japan in the northern Pacific Ocean continued until 1988. =21st century= Sperm whales and other deep-sea species are still hunted from small open boats by hunters from two Indonesian villages, Lamalera and Lamakera. This is permitted under rules concerning aboriginal whaling. Effect on sperm whale population An 1861 cartoon showing sperm whales celebrating the discovery of new petroleum wells in Pennsylvania. The proliferation of mineral oils reduced demand for their species' oil. It is estimated that the historic worldwide sperm whale population numbered 1,100,000 before commercial sperm whaling began in the early 18th century. By 1880 it had declined an estimated 29 per cent. From that date until 1946 the population appears to have recovered somewhat as whaling pressure lessened, but after the Second World War, with the industry's focus again on sperm whales, the population declined even further to only 33 per cent. It has been estimated that in the 19th century between 184,000 and 236,000 sperm whales were killed by the various whaling nations, while in the modern era, at least 770,000 were taken, the majority between 1946 and 1980.Over 680,000 officially reported at . In addition, studies have found that official reports understated USSR catches by at least 89,000 . Furthermore, other countries, such as Japan have been found to have understated catches Remaining sperm whale populations are large enough so that the species' conservation status is vulnerable, rather than endangered. However, the recovery from the whaling years is a slow process, particularly in the South Pacific, where the toll on males of a breeding age was severe.

Designed by Dabney Cosby, a former assistant to Thomas Jefferson, it is the only substantial building remaining from the former community of Ca Ira. For its architectural and historical significance, Grace Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 30, 1980. History At the turn of the nineteenth century, Ca Ira was a typical small farming community such as could be found in many locations around Virginia. It was formally established by the Virginia General Assembly in 1796; the origin of the name is unknown, but given the spirit of the times, and the fact that many Virginians admired the French Revolution, it is suspected to have been derived from a popular French song of the era. By 1836, Ca Ira could be described as a post village, with a population of 210; it had forty dwellings, three stores, a mill, a tobacco warehouse, two taverns, and a Masonic hall. Construction of Grace Church was begun in 1840; the original deed to its location was described in the Cumberland County Deed Book of 1843 as > a certain lot or parcel or ground adjoining the town of Ca Ira on the West, > and bounded as follows. Orig. on the South by the Main road from Ca Ira to > Buckingham Ct. House, West by the line separating it from McAshan's Old > Stemmery Lot, on which the fence now runs North by the road leading into > said stemmery and, East by the Western Crop Street of the town of Ca Ira, it > being the lot, as now enclosed whereon the New Episcopal Church, called > Grace Church, has been recently erected, containing about two thirds of an > acre, together with all the appurtenances thereunto belonging. Immediately upon its completion, it began serving not only the populace of the town itself but also those families, many prominent in local affairs, that owned the surrounding plantations. Among those known to be part of the congregation of the church was Valentine Parrish, who not only donated the land on which it stood, but served as the builder for the project. The architect was Dabney Cosby, who had worked with Thomas Jefferson on the construction of buildings at the University of Virginia. This was not the first time that Cosby and Parrish had worked together; the two were listed together as co-architects on the cornerstone of the 1826 Goochland County Courthouse in nearby Goochland. Parrish was among the most prominent citizens in Cumberland County in the years leading up to the Civil War; he presented numerous petitions on the subject of local tolls to the Virginia General Assembly, and also made numerous suggestions regarding the distribution of economic aid to the county. Woodwork and framing on the church is said to have been the work of one Albert Mann, a slave attached to the Parrish plantation; construction of the church was overseen by Rev. Henry Kinckle. Back of the church seen from the cemetery, including the vestry With the completion of Grace Church in 1843 the town received its largest and most distinguished building to date. The church also revived the fortunes of Littleton parish, which surrounded the town but which had been inactive since 1813. An 1857 report from Bishop William Meade indicated that the structure was \\"in constant use\\". Even so, although Ca Ira had continued to rise in importance through the 1850s, at one point incorporating its first and only bank, by the postbellum years it had begun losing population, and shrank rapidly during the last decades of the nineteenth century. The church was not spared, and was abandoned along with most other structures during this period; a 1906 entry in the Lippincott World Gazetteer mentioned its presence among a handful of other buildings, mainly shops. The rehabilitation of the structure began in 1928, when descendants of members of the initial congregation organized the Ca Ira Restoration Society; this organization was dedicated to raising funds to restore the building, which was soon accomplished. The Society also blocked an attempt by the diocese to sell the property, and in 1954 reinstituted an annual series of \\"homecoming services\\" in continuation of a tradition begun in the 1930s. Today, Grace Church is preserved in working order as a shrine of the Episcopal Diocese of Southern Virginia; to keep its status as such, it is required to host at least one religious service yearly. The church was surveyed as part of the Historic American Buildings Survey sometime after 1933. Description > Grace Church, Ca Ira, survives as a charming illustration of the stylistic > hybridization that occurred with Romantic Revivalism in the antebellum > period. Unlike many of its similarly imaginative contemporaries, Grace > Church is devoid of architectural naivete and is at once a skillful blending > of Roman, Greek, and Gothic Revival elements, all executed with superb > crnftsmanship. Its temple form and fine brickwork are an offspring of > Virginia's Jeffersonian tradition, while its Greek and Gothic details are > adapted from builders' pattern books. =Exterior= A floor plan of the church The exterior of Grace Church reflects the influence of Roman, Greek, and Gothic Revival architecture on mid-nineteenth-century American architectural design. Described as a \\"temple- form country church\\", it measures 32' x 48'; there is a small vestry attached to the back of the building. The church sits on a foundation of brick, and has ventilation holes at its base. Its walls are built of handmade bricks, even in color and unglazed; the mortar joints are deliberately precise. Two styles of brickwork were used in construction; the front and east side are of Flemish bond, the north side is of five-course American bond, and the west side is a combination or the two, with four-course American substituted for the five- course. Original penciling may still be seen in the mortar joints. All elevations are fitted with windows; these are triple-hung with 12/12 sash, and are hung with louvered shutters and 8-inch rectilinear moldings; the moldings have been topped by ramped lintels with 6-inch-square corner blocks. Sitting over the entryway is a lancet transom with intersecting tracery, a similar design to which may also be seen in the window in the tympanum. On the east side of the church, the first bay is a jib window which according to local lore was used for funerals. The roof is surrounded by a cove cornice which serves to define two pediments, one in either facade. The roof is covered by Buckingham County, Virginia Buckingham Slate. Later additions to the exterior include a pair of small chimneys and a small wooden cross, which latter is situated at the apex of the front pediment and was erected in the 1950s. =Interior= Architectural drawings of some of the interior fittings The church interior consists of one single room; the vestry, which is situated behind the sanctuary proper, is in a later addition to the building. There are two main aisles in the nave; these are formed by the placement of the original pews in the building. Of the pews, those in the center are freestanding, and larger than those on the sides; these have been angled slightly and attached to the side walls. There is a gallery in the south wall, with one center aisle and two down its sides. It is supported by a pair of Doric columns on the side walls, as well as by a number of pilasters. There is a dentiled entablature, set above the columns and topped by a railing with turned balusters. Entry to the gallery is achieved via an enclosed stairway on the east side; one wall is fitted with beaded diagonal paneling, and there is no stair rail. The pulpit for the church is attached to its north wall, enclosed in a communion rail with rectangular rungs. It is paneled and inset with a bold Greek fret in its frieze. This appears to have been adapted from a design found in the Practical House Carpenter of Asher Benjamin, a popular builders' pattern book first published in 1830; with numerous other details, most especially the building's architraves, it indicates Cosby's familiarity with the popular architectural styles of the day. Near the pulpit is a baptismal font of marble. Also remaining in the church are two wood-burning stoves, elaborate constructions in cast iron, bearing the maker's mark of \\"Leibrandt & McDowell, Philadelphia & Baltimore\\". The dado running the perimeter of the main room is paneled and incorporates a chair rail. The floor is unfinished, while the walls and ceiling are covered in plaster. =Cemetery= View of the church cemetery. There is a small cemetery attached to the church grounds, located at the back in a hilly, wooded area overlooking the Willis River. Just when burials began is unknown; the earliest legible headstones date to the 1880s. It is possible that earlier burials exist; however, most of the grave markers on the grounds are nearly completely worn away, and as a result the total number of interments is unknown. Some of these missing markers have been replaced with modern stones, and the cemetery continues in use for some local families. Two veterans of the Confederate Army are also buried in the cemetery. The church and cemetery are together contained in the National Register listing, as is the land on which both stand; the parcel, approximately two-thirds of an acre in area, follows the lines of the original deed of the property as recorded in Cumberland County records. Significance Grace Church is significant for a number of reasons, not least of which is its association with Dabney Cosby, and through him the Jeffersonian school of architectural thought so prevalent across Virginia in the second quarter of the nineteenth century. The building stands as a well-preserved example of a rural Virginia church, incorporating elements of various architectural styles into its construction; it also serves as one of the last few tangible reminders, and much the best-preserved, of the once-thriving merchant community of Ca Ira.

Formally established in 1796, it fell into disuse in the years after the American Civil War; today, few traces of the town remain, save for the old Grace Church and a handful of houses. History At the turn of the nineteenth century, Ca Ira was a typical small farming community such as could be found in many locations around Virginia. The community of Ca Ira, located along Route 632. near the WiIIis River, served as a takeout point for the Willis River and as the main exporting point along the Willis. The community took its name from a popular French marching song meaning \\"the Revolution will triumph\\" or \\"it will go,\\" reflecting the popular enthusiasm for the French Revolution in Virginia at the time. Though originally established by the General Assembly in 1796, it reached its high point between 1827 and 1860. Described by Joseph Martin in 1836 in The Gazetteer of Virginia and the District of Columbia, the village of Ca Ira contained approximately 40 dwellings, three mercantile stores a merchant mill a tobacco warehouse, two taverns, a non-denominational church, and a masonic hall. The population at the time was 310 and mail was delivered three times a week. Amongst the residents were two blacksmiths, two wheelwrights, two tailors, and two plough manufacturers. The rapid expansion of this community took place as a result of the removal of a dam along the large pond adjacent to the area. Ca Ira stagnated until 1825, when the Willis River canal was completed. Prior to this, the surrounding pond has produced conditions for bilious attacks which has twice nearly depopulated the town, completely. This served numerous purposes; it caused the removal of a pond, long the source of poor health for residents and, more importantly, it opened the town up to the tobacco trade, making it easier to transport wares along the James River between Prince Edward and Charlotte Counties and Richmond and Petersburg. During its heyday, Ca Ira boasted $40,000 worth of sales annually by its three mercantile stores, 28-30,000 bushels of wheat ground at the mill during the season., and 300 to 500 hogsheads of tobacco received. With the completion, in 1843, of Grace Church, Ca Ira had its most important and distinguished building; this not only served as a place of worship, but acted as a gathering place for members of surrounding plantations. Good fortune was not to last, however; the town's heyday came in the middle of the 1850s, when it incorporated a bank. Its postbellum decline was rapid; the church, along with most of the rest of the town, was deserted by the end of the 19th century. A 1906 visit found little more than a \\"post hamlet,\\" with only a handful of houses, a post office, two stores, and the church surviving among the ruins of warehouses and other structures. Of these, only the church exists today, although some newer houses have been erected in the vicinity. Today, Virginia Route 632 is known as \\"Ca Ira Road\\" where it passes through the site of the former village. Only a few buildings survive from this once thriving village. The extant structures located along Route 632 near the Ca Ira Pond include Grace Episcopal Church, now on the National Register, approximately five modest dwellings, and the Ca Ira Fishing Club. Of these, only the church and the fishing lodge date to Ca Ira's period of prosperity. https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/pdf_files/SpecialCollections/CM-004_Historic_AH_Survey_Cumberland_1994_TRACRIES_report.pdf References Category:Ghost towns in Virginia Category:Geography of Cumberland County, Virginia Category:Populated places established in 1796 Category:1796 establishments in Virginia ","title":"Ca Ira, Virginia"},{"id":"20104040","title":"Tom Ridge Stakes"},{"id":"20104047","text":"White bison at Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary photographed by the wildlife photographer N.

Published by Manager of Publications, 1966 Census of India, (1961) p. 60 They are occasionally called Manjampatti white bison ( kaatteni, or kaattu maadu, meaning \\"forest cow\\"). These gaur are notable for their distinctive ash-grey color as opposed to the almost black color of most gaur. Since 1929, there have been at least 19 documented sightings of these rare animals, including the 2004 photographs of N. A. Naseer.  Description  Normal colored gaur bull with typical high dorsal ridge The gray-colored jungle bison is a peculiar subspecies of gaur (Bos gaurus gaurus).

Gaurs in Northern India are smaller than the southern breed, and more of the larger, better specimens can be seen in South India, due to the high concentration of gaur there.Gaur#Description Calf and juvenile gaurs have several predators, including tigers; Asian black bears  Historic references  There are several herds of gaur (popularly called bison) in Manjampatti Valley. Earlier, the area was well known for many Manjampatti white bison sightings. Only the Manjampatti valley of Udumalpet range is said to harbour white bison, a very rare animal.The Indian Forester, Published by R. P. Sharma, Business Manager, Indian Forester., 1974 Item notes: v.100 1974 no. 1‚Äì6, p. 186 Original from the University of Michigan Digitized 1 Nov 2007 Between 1929 and 1937, James L. H. Williams, a British wildlife enthusiast, reported sighting many gaur with light pink or white skin during many trips to Manjampatty Valley. He reported seeing many herds of gaur, with up to 13,120 animals in a herd. Most herds had some individuals with color varying from light red through the duns to pure white. In one herd of 20 animals, every animal was of abnormal color. He reported the white bison had some religious significance to the local Pulayar tribal residents, and they would gently divert outsiders away from any herds with abnormally colored animals. Before 1939, a Mr. Ranicar shot a white bison in the Talinji area of Manjampatti Valley. J. C. Gouldsbury reported that Ranicar presented the mounted specimen of his cow white bison to the High Range Club in Munnar, where it was subsequently displayed. The pelage was originally almost cream- colored. The 1939 Madras Forest Department ‚Äì Administration Report mentions \\"white\\" bison in the Manjampatti Valley, Before 1970, Mr. M. A. S. M. Muthuswamy walked the Munnar-Udumalpet road (SH 17) frequently. He reported seeing a herd of four white bison, which he described as greenish-grey in color, on several occasions in previous years. In 1969, he also saw a fine greenish-grey bull in a herd of normal-colored gaur at Kamanuthu, just off the SH 17 road in the Kombu beat on the Tamil Nadu side of the border. His brother, Mr Padmanabhan, said he had seen a herd of five there also. In 1969, an ash-colored bull was seen by a dhobi from Amaravathinagar, who said he saw it while collecting firewood at Kamanuthu. In 1965, Mr. A. J. Packianathan, senior master of the Sainik School, Amaravathinagar, saw four ash-colored gaur in the same area. In January 1969, Koolayan, a cattleman of the Malasar tribe, who keeps cattle at Kumulam overlooking the northern slopes of Manjamalai and part of the northern slopes of Mudian Malai, saw one grey-colored gaur, the only one among the many gaur he has ever seen. In 1970, Rajagopala Tondaiman, the Raja of Pudukottai, saw one white bull gaur beyond Kukal in Koilan Alai, and he has seen about half a dozen of them in the past 30 years among herds of normal colored gaur. An ancient Sinhala Kavi verse reads in part: \\"Having come swiftly, On the day the excellent white gaur was killed, A scoop of blood was given to thee ! ...\\"Sinhala Verse (Kavi), by Hugh Nevill, P E P Deraniyagala, published by Ceylon National Museums, 1954, Item notes: v. 2, p. 304, Original from the University of Michigan, Digitized May 8, 2006 In 1970, E. R. C. Davidar, a famous wildlife researcher, spent several months on behalf of the Bombay Natural History Society in Chinnar trying to spot and photograph this animal. His mission, undertaken to provide scientific evidence to the rumours floating in the air for several decades, did not find success. His report to the BNHS, White Bison of Manjampatti said the white gaur reported by Williams might have become extinct following the outbreak of an epizootic disease that wiped out several herds from the region in those days. But, tribals living in the forests continued to claim white gaurs were still there in Chinnar. In 1972, Rev. Sam Schmitthenner observed two white gaur in Manjampatti Valley. He said: > I took one more hike down into Manjampatti after staying in Kukkal Cave > overnight. Early in the morning, we saw a herd of bison, and there on the > edge of the herd were two albino calves. Earlier that month I had read an > article in Hornbill, a Bombay conservation magazine, about the albino bison > of Manjamphatti. About 1975, two local guides guiding some Europeans hoping to see the white bison said they had not seen a 'white bison' in the last 15 or 20 years. They admitted quite frankly this was partly because there was no occasion for them to go looking for gaur.  Recent sightings  In January or February, 2011, Minoo Avari, Sunder Shaker, who was then the Manager at the Kodaikanal Golf Club and at least two caddies saw a beautiful white bison cow on the golf course at about 2 or 2:30 in the afternoon. They were on the tee box and the bison was on the 14th green. The players were warned by their caddies that she was skittish and liable to charge if they went too close. That is not usually a problem with other bison often seen on the course. The golf caddies said they see this white bison from time to time. During the 2008 annual wildlife census in the Amaravati range in the Indira Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary, bison were seen in Thanlinji village, Manjampatti and Mungilpallam and reportedly there was also a white (albino) bison. On 29 December 2007, C. R. Jayaprakash made a clear photograph of a white gaur resting near Masingudi on the Sigur Plateau. This is considerably out of the normal range of the animal in the Annamalai Hills. A 2007 encounter with a white bison at the jungle lodge near the Chinnar checkpost has been described: > A white bison reaches the end of the trail and stops at the edge of the > clearing. He's huge. Over tall and to long. Sharp horns over long. I have no > where to go because the bison herd has blocked the other two exits, so I'm > just standing there, hoping white bison will keep walking and I can go back > onto the trail. No such luck. He stands there, barely ten feet away from me, > and stares. And stares. I'm thinking, wow, I'm totally going to die right > now, because I've got white bison in front of me and brown bison to my left, > and neither of them like me here... So for about five full minutes we face > off, until white bison decides the water is more important, and finally > meanders off. Heather, Two Timing the Cosmos, you have many jungle cock? > (2007-1-04) In 2007, a rare Manjampatti white bison was seen by George Roshan in a herd of about eight or 10 normal-coloured bison grazing and resting on mountain downs above Kukkal at the northeast corner of Manjampatti Valley.George Roshan, personal communication, 10/21/08 In 2006, this possible subspecies was seen and photographed in Manjampatti Valley by Forest Department staff. The white bison photographed by N. A. Naseer. In 2004, the famous and extremely rare white bison was reported at Chinnar.Department of Forests and Wildlife, Government of Kerala, Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary, Flora and Fauna In July 2004, an unusual white gaur, moving with a herd of dark-skinned gaur, was spotted repeatedly over several days in the Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary and photographed by the wildlife photographer, N. A. Naseer. This is the only published photographic documentation of Manjampatti white bison.P. Venugopal, The Hindu, Freak' gaur spotted in Chinnar (2004-9-11) In 1998, the then Wildlife Warden of Eravikulam, Mohan Alambath, his Range Officer, V. K. Franzis, and a wildlife enthusiast, V. P. Ajithkumar, claimed sighting this animal in Chinnar. Though they reported the matter in the journal of BNHSAjith, V. P., M. Alenbath, and V. K. Francis (1998) White bison in Chinnar, Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society; 95(3): 499-500 the photograph they had taken of the animal lacked clarity. On 21 October 1997, two grayish-white gaur, an adult female and a subadult, were observed along with 9 other gaur on the slopes of Cheevaparamala in the Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary. On 3 January 1998, a juvenile with the same color was seen at Koottar along with five others. In addition to the white gaur, the majority of the animals in these herds ranged from brick red to light red. In the first herd of 11, there were only four normal-colored gaur, and in the second herd of six, only two normal-colored individuals. This was the first record of white bison in the Chinnar Sanctuary, which shares a long common border with the Manjampatti Valley. In 1997 in Satpura, four totally white gaur were reported ‚Äì presumably albinos or some genetic sport, which, amid their black companions, appear like ghosts in a forest.

Guys Marsh is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service. History Guys Marsh was a former US Military Hospital. In 1960 it opened as a borstal (HM Borstal Guys Marsh). The buildings were standard World War II Nissen huts and the only buildings that had been added were the officers' quarters (around 50 houses) and the boiler house. The borstal continued in the buildings until the 1980s, when gradually the structures of the building were rebuilt or refurbished. In 1984, Guys Marsh became a Young Offender Institution. In 1992, it began also housing adult prisoners when the building of a perimeter fence made it a closed establishment. Guys Marsh soon became an all-adult prison, and within 18 months the gaol managed to increase its operating capacity by 278. In January 2002 the Board of Visitors criticised Guys Marsh prison failing to meet government standards on re-offending rates amongst released prisoners. The board blamed a shortage of staff and shortage of money for poor facilities at the jail. The Board also expressed concern over medical care, after a local GPs practice withdrew its services from the prison. In March 2017 a wing of the prison had to be evacuated when a prisoner climbed onto the roof and started a fire there. The prison today Accommodation at Guys Marsh comprises seven residential units, which have cellular accommodation and one unit has less secure rooms. Guys Marsh offers workshops to prisoners including Farms and Estates Management, Laundry, Industrial Cleaning, Bricklaying and a number of contract production workshops. Some of the workshops run recognised external qualifications. A Visitor Centre is available at the prison, with facilities including toilets and a baby changing room. When Guys Marsh was inspected in 2014 it was found prison officers had, \\"all but lost control\\". The prison was described as in crisis and gangs operated openly. Spice and alcohol related violence was high and prisoners lived in fear.Guys Marsh Prison: Evacuation after fire is started 'by inmate on roof' BBC Prisoners are afraid to leave their cells sometimes for months at a time. Prisoners are inadequately supervised, prisoners push ahead in dinner and medicine queues, walk around in shorts or dressing gowns and smoke unchallenged by staff. Bullying has become so widespread one wing is reserved for prisoners who fear for their safety. Peter Clarke, the chief inspector, said the 2014 inspection found the prison in crisis ‚Äúwhere managers and staff had all but lost control‚Äù. The prison got six months‚Äô notice of the inspectors‚Äô decision to return in December 2016, inspectors found not enough had been done too late about their worries, and the prison was worse in some respects.Bullying and violence make Guys Marsh jail unsafe, say inspectors The Guardian References External links * Ministry of Justice pages on Guys Marsh * HMP Guys Marsh - HM Inspectorate of Prisons Reports Category:Category C prisons in England Category:Prisons in Dorset Category:1960 establishments in England Category:Men's prisons Category:Shaftesbury ","title":"HM Prison Guys Marsh"},{"id":"20104079","text":"Anthony Bebbington (born 1962) is a geographer, Higgins Professor of Environment and Society in the Graduate School of Geography, Clark University, USA. He was previously Laureate Professor at the School of Geography, University of Melbourne, Australia and Professor at the University of Manchester, UK. Background Tony Bebbington was born in Staffordshire, England, studied geography and land economy at the University of Cambridge where he graduated with distinction, and completed a PhD at the Graduate School of Geography, Clark University, USA in 1990, supervised by Billie Lee Turner II. He holds British and American citizenship. He held a postdoctoral appointment in Latin American Studies at Cambridge (1989-1992), before working at two London research organizations: the Overseas Development Institute (1992-4) and the International Institute for Environment and Development (1994-5). He moved to the USA again in 1995, working at the World Bank (1995-6, 1999-2000) and as Associate Professor of Geography, University of Colorado, Boulder (1996-2003) before moving to Manchester. Contributions Bebbington's early work was on farmer knowledge, livelihoods, and agrarian change in mountain communities of Peru and Ecuador. He made distinctive contributions to human geography and to understanding of rural development in the Andes, combining detailed fieldwork with farming households with broader understanding of rural institutions and social movements. He has retained an interest in theory, scholarship, and practical development issues. This interest in rural organizations and social movements led to research on the performance and practice on non-governmental organizations in Latin America, expressed in several books on NGOs and their contributions to development. After working in social policy at the World Bank, he became interested in how the World Bank works with NGOs, and particularly the use of 'social capital' in the World Bank's work. Recent studies have been of mining, development, and the state in Peru and Ecuador, and the nature of protest surrounding mining proposals, funded by an ESRC research professorship, ARC Laureate Fellowship, and other grants. He has worked most often in the Andes, elsewhere in South and Central America, and briefly in Indonesia and Nepal. Bebbington has also collaborated with United Nations Research Institute For Social Development on the flagship report Combating Poverty and Inequality (2010); a project for which he wrote a background thematic paper Poverty Reduction and Social Movements: A Framework with Cases. Additionally, he collaborated on the project Financing Social Policy (2006-2010).

Construction and commissioning USS LST-1160 was laid down on 18 December 1952 at Bath, Maine, by the Bath Iron Works. She was launched on 3 October 1953, sponsored by Mrs. Omar R. King, and commissioned on 19 December 1953 with Lieutenant Commander James W. Perkins in command. Atlantic, Caribbean, and Mediterranean service Late in January 1954, LST-1160 moved, from Boston, Massachusetts, where she had completed outfitting, to Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek at Virginia Beach, Virginia. On 26 March 1954, after seven weeks of shakedown training in the Virginia Capes operating area and three weeks of post-shakedown availability, LST-1160 became an active unit of the United States Atlantic Fleet Amphibious Force. Between the spring of 1954 and the summer of 1955, she completed seven training exercises to sharpen her skill as an amphibious warfare ship. Those drills frequently took her south to the West Indies, most often to Vieques Island near Puerto Rico, where embarked United States Marines practiced amphibious landings. On 1 July 1955, LST-1160 was named USS Traverse County (LST-1160). Not long thereafter, she was awarded the Battle Efficiency \\"E\\" as the outstanding ship of Landing Ship Tank Flotilla 4. Late in 1955, Traverse County entered the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for a four-month overhaul. She exited the shipyard in April 1956 and, following a month of refresher training, resumed operations out of Little Creek. The remainder of 1956 saw her periodically embarking Marines at Morehead City, North Carolina, and putting them ashore at Little Creek and at nearby Camp Pendleton. At the beginning of 1957, Traverse County completed preparations for her first deployment with the United States Sixth Fleet. From 1957 through 1968, Traverse County performed eight tours of duty in the Mediterranean. Most often, her operations with the Sixth Fleet included visits to ports in Spain, France, Italy, Greece, and Turkey, and along the North African coast. She often conducted training exercises with units of friendly foreign navies. However, during her 1958 deployment, a crisis erupted in Lebanon at the far eastern end of the Mediterranean, and in July 1958 Traverse County joined other Sixth Fleet units and Amphibious Squadron 6 landing ships tank in landing Marines at Beirut to help stabilize the situation. The remainder of her Mediterranean assignments proved to be more routine in nature. When not attached to the Sixth Fleet, Traverse County operated out of Little Creek in Virginia. Her western Atlantic duties frequently took her to the West Indies and the Caribbean where, in addition to the usual amphibious exercises, she performed supply missions to various American bases in the area under the auspices of the Commander, Service Force, Atlantic Fleet. Such was her assignment in the fall of 1962 when American surveillance of Cuba uncovered the siting of offensive ballistic missiles on that island by the Soviet Union. When the Cuban Missile Crisis occurred, President John F. Kennedy invoked a successful blockade, or quarantine, of Cuba to secure the removal of the missiles. During that operation, Traverse County provided support as a combat-ready unit. However, the Soviet Union withdrew the missiles and the tension abated, enabling Traverse County to resume her normal routine early in 1963. She returned to supplying Caribbean bases and conducting amphibious exercises at Little Creek, at Onslow Beach, North Carolina, and at Vieques Island near Puerto Rico. The Cuban Missile Crisis proved to be Traverse Countys last internationally significant operation. After 1962, she resumed her routine, alternating Mediterranean deployments with United States East Coast operations. She completed her eighth and last Sixth Fleet assignment in December 1968. During 1969, she conducted another series of amphibious exercises at her old haunts, Little Creek, Onslow Beach, and Vieques Island. Similar operations carried her into 1970. Latin American operations On 7 March 1970 she headed for the Panama Canal and a tour of special duty. After transporting the 8th Marine Engineering Battalion from Morehead City, North Carolina, to Vieques Island, she arrived at Colon, Panama Canal Zone, on 12 March 1970. She transited the Panama Canal and embarked scientists and equipment of the Smithsonian Institution for research operations in the vicinity of the Secas Islands of Panama. That duty lasted until 3 April 1970 when she returned to Rodman Naval Station in the Canal Zone. Between the 3 April 1970 and 24 April 1970, Traverse County transported United States Army Reserve troops and their equipment between Rio Hato and Rodman Naval Station and carried Operation Handclasp supplies to Guayaquil, Ecuador. On 27 April 1970, she reembarked the Smithsonian scientists for another week of research operations. Upon her return to Rodman Naval Station early in May 1870, she entered the Panama Canal Company's Mount Hope Shipyard for repairs. She exited the shipyard on 11 June 1970, retransited the canal, and joined the Caribbean Amphibious Ready Group for a day before returning to Rodman Naval Station for further orders. Late in June 1970, she transported more Army reservists between Rio Hato and Rodman Naval Station. Decommissioning On 7 July 1970, Traverse County headed back to the United States for inactivation. She reached Little Creek on 15 July 1970. Later that autumn, Traverse County was decommissioned. Sometime thereafter, she was moved to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet berthing area at Orange, Texas. Military Sealift Command service Traverse County was reactivated on 7 June 1973 to serve as a cargo ship in a non-commissioned status with a civil service crew with the Military Sealift Command, being designated the United States Naval Ship USNS Traverse County (T-LST-1160). This service continued until she was stricken from the Navy List on 1 November 1973. At that time, she was transferred to the Maritime Administration for layup in the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Suisun Bay, Benicia, California. Transfer to Peru BAP Eten (DT-144) in 2015. On 7 August 1984, Traverse County and three of her sister ships -- USS Waldo County (LST-1163), USS Walworth County (LST-1164), and USS Washoe County (LST-1165)‚Äîwere leased to Peru, and Traverse County was commissioned into service in the Peruvian Navy as BAP Eten (DT-144) on 4 March 1985. Peru renewed the lease on all four ships in August 1989 and August 1994,Jane's All the World's Fighting Ships, 2001-2002, p. 521. and the United States sold all four outright to Peru under the Security Assistance Program on 26 April 1999; all four were struck from the U.S. Naval Register on the day of the sale.

It provides a single-lens \\"walk-around\\" solution for wide-angle through to telephoto shots, as well as close-up photography. F-mount on 18-200mm DX lens with mechanical and electrical contacts Introduction Nikon announced the first version of this lens on November 1, 2005. The lens offers a 35 film equivalent focal length range of 27-300mm, with a compact silent wave autofocus motor featuring full-time manual override and internal focusing. Its second generation Vibration Reduction technology claims to provide compensation equivalent to an increase in shutter speed of four stops. The lens has sixteen lens elements in twelve groups, with two ED glass elements to reduce chromatic aberration, and three aspherical elements to reduce image distortion. Although this lens was designed for use on Nikon DX format DSLRs, its Nikon F lens mount allows it to be used on Nikon full- frame DSLRs, albeit with vignetting due to a smaller image circle. This lens also works with teleconverters.Teleconverter for 18-200 mm Nikkor VR On July 30, 2009, Nikon announced an updated variant, the AF-S DX NIKKOR 18-200mm 3.5-5.6G ED VR II. It adds a zoom lock to prevent zoom creep. Archived 2009-08-01 The first generation of 18-200 had some issues with zoom creep when the lens was facing down Reception Reviewers have praised the lens for its 11.1x focal length range, effective vibration reduction, excellent autofocus motor and its versatility. However, the lens has been criticised for pronounced and complex distortion across of the range, extreme softness at certain focal lengths and zoom creep. Overall, it has garnered generally positive reviews, citing the lens' flexibility and ability to \\"allow the photographer to travel light and never miss a shot while changing lenses\\". Problems The lens has problems with auto-focus of near subjects and in wide-angle position of infinity subjects on some older Nikon digital camera bodies. The problem occurs in Nikon D 300 S also. The slow auto-focus problem can be solved in new DSLR cameras disabling the light bulb guide that's built in the body camera. Enabling only one point of focus and enabling \\"continuous engine focus\\" or \\"automatic\\" instead of single servo, may speed up auto-focus greatly to normal again.

The character was created by series' producer Shonda Rhimes, and is portrayed by Scottish actor Kevin McKidd. He was introduced in season five as a U.S. Army trauma surgeon who served in war-torn Iraq, and subsequently joins the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital to teach medicine as a surgical attending, head of trauma surgery, and eventual chief of surgery, sometimes with unorthodox methods. Originally contracted to appear for a multi-episode story arc, he was upgraded to a series' regular at the conclusion of his first appearance. The fictional character served as a love interest for surgical fellow Cristina Yang, and had an unstable personality when first introduced, suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). McKidd's connection with fellow actress Sandra Oh (Cristina Yang) has been acclaimed amongst critics, with Matt Roush of TV Guide calling the \\"instant sparks\\" between McKidd and Oh \\"electrifying.\\" McKidd was nominated for two awards for his work on the show, winning one of them. Chris Monfette of IGN has praised the addition of \\"fresh, new characters\\" such as Owen Hunt.  Storylines  Before his regular appearances on the show, Owen Hunt was a United States Army surgeon, specializing in trauma surgery. The character makes a dramatic first appearance when he performs a tracheotomy on a man with a pen, winning the admiration of resident Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh). He is offered a job by former chief of surgery Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.), but declines, explaining that he has not completed his tour in Iraq. His appointment as the new head of trauma surgery at Seattle Grace Hospital was not well-received initially. By his first week he manages to irk both Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) and Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), head of neurosurgery and plastic surgery, respectively, who view his treatment of some of the patients as crude, and also rebuffed by resident Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) when he stabs a set of pigs and then orders the residents and interns to save their lives, in order to teach them medicine on \\"live tissue.\\" Hunt eventually embarks on a relationship with Yang, but it comes to a sudden close when his PTSD gets the best of him, and he unconsciously strangles her. Soon after the breakup, he begins therapy with the hospital psychiatrist, Dr. Wyatt. Some time later, a soldier visits the hospital for treatment, and his presence influences Owen to contemplate returning to the US Army. When he shares this with Cristina, she disagrees with his decision, stating that she doesn't want him to die, and the two eventually rekindle their relationship. Owen brings in Teddy Altman (Kim Raver), his best friend and colleague from when he was in the army, as the new head of cardiothoracic surgery. When it is revealed that Hunt and Altman may be potential lovers, Hunt and Yang's relationship is challenged, and eventually concluded by Yang. During a hospital shooting, Owen is shot and injured, attracting the sympathy of Cristina, who subsequently restores their relationship. Due to the emotional reverberations of the shooting crisis, Owen and Cristina decide to wed one another shortly after their reconciliation, not wanting to risk separation. There are some concerns from Cristina's friends that Owen is taking advantage of her PTSD to rush her into marriage, which she had previously decided against. When Cristina discovers she is pregnant, Owen is displeased with her desire to abort the baby, and the two separate from each other. One of the major, recurring points of conflict in their relationship are Owen's strong desires for children and a traditional wife, and Cristina's equally strong conviction that she never wants children. In the fallout of resident Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo)'s tampering with Derek Shepherd's Alzheimer's trial, Owen is promoted to Chief of Surgery after Webber steps down. After substantial thought, Owen reluctantly decides to accompany Cristina to the abortion, uniting the two. Owen's friendship with Teddy ends when Owen lies to Teddy about her husband's sudden death, due to Owen wanting her to finish a surgery she was currently performing and Teddy blaming Owen for her husband's death. Feeling abandoned and disconcerted after an altercation with Cristina, Owen has a one-night stand with a patient's friend. Cristina consequently finds out, terminates their relationship, and their marriage is tested. After Cristina passed her medical boards, she reconciles with Owen, but reveals to him that she is leaving Seattle to go to Mayo Clinic. Teddy and Owen eventually became friends again. She had been offered a position at the United States Army Medical Command but chose to stay at Seattle Grace Mercy West out of loyalty. After Teddy's husband Henry dies she wallows in her grief and it affects her colleagues and residents, causing Owen to \\"fire\\" her so that she can have a fresh start elsewhere. He also fires April Kepner (Sarah Drew) because the hospital cannot afford to keep her due to her not being a Board certified. Months later, Hunt visits Kepner and rehires her as he realized he made a mistake. In later seasons, Owen and Kepner become close friends due to her choice to sign up with the military, a decision Owen helped prompt and encourage, and a decision which leads to the eventual end of Kepner's marriage to Avery. In season 9 Cristina and Owen's marriage is again very strained. Cristina is working at Mayo Clinic and Owen in Seattle but she returns. Owen asks for a divorce. He later shows that he is still in love with her and only asked for a divorce so Cristina and the others involved in the plane crash get the money. Cristina and Owen reconcile in episode 9 before Bailey's wedding. In season 10, Cristina decides to accept a job to run a state of the art clinic in Switzerland. Owen supports her decision as he realizes no good could come from him asking her to stay, but requests her not to leave him until she has to leave him for good, following which, they both spend two weeks leading to her permanent departure together. While saying her farewell to her colleagues of the last seven years, there is a possible act of terrorism in Seattle, which later turns out to be just a gas main explosion. Cristina has a quick but emotional goodbye hug with Derek, Bailey, and Webber, leaves her shares of the hospital to Alex, and dances it out with Meredith one last time to an old favorite song. Owen, however, is busy saving a patient in the O.R., so they share a silent goodbye through the gallery's glass. In Season 11, Owen develops a relationship with Amelia Shepherd. This is off and on throughout Season 11 and 12 until the end of Season 12 where he and Amelia get married, after Amelia proposes to him. Owen is attracted to Amelia's desire for a \\"real family\\" and children. In Season 14, after going through a series of marital issues, Owen decides to pursue a divorce from Amelia, citing Amelia's reversal on wanting to have children and her increasingly erratic behavior. Owen listens to Amelia when she, in a fit of pique, tells him to go be with Teddy. As a result, he flies to Germany to be with Teddy, but, after they spend the night together, Owen reveals he is there at his wife's suggestion. Teddy is insulted he made her a last choice, citing his inability to be alone, and Teddy breaks it off. Owen returns to Grey Sloan alone. It is later discovered that Amelia's behavior was caused by a brain tumor. In a reversal of blame, Amelia is angry Owen placed sole blame on her for their marital issues, as well as committing adultery with Teddy, since he ignored all of her tumor symptoms as selfishness and poor character. Despite pursuing their divorce, they continue sleeping together. Owen decides to pursue his lifelong dream of fatherhood alone and begins fostering Leo, a baby who was given up by his teenage mother. When Amelia finds Leo's mother, Betty, homeless and addicted to drugs, Amelia takes Betty in, and, together, Owen and Amelia take care of Leo and Betty at Owen's home, reconciling and deciding to stay in their relationship and renew their marriage. In Season 15, Owen and Amelia have a strong relationship, which is interrupted by the news that Teddy is pregnant with Owen's child. Teddy did not tell Owen at first, because she knew he would leave Amelia for the chance to be a father, and Teddy does not want to be with Owen after he made her his alternate choice. Owen is upset because he would not have reconciled with Amelia or fostered Leo if Teddy had told him earlier that he was expecting a biological child. This causes additional tension with Amelia, who knows Owen would have left her without trying to salvage their marriage. In light of Teddy's disinterest, Owen tells Amelia he chooses her. However, Owen continues to exhibit possessive and obsessive behavior over Teddy and her pregnancy, causing Amelia to permanently split from their relationship. Owen then adopts Leo as his son and welcomes his newborn daughter, Allison, with Teddy, whom they named after Teddy's best friend Allison Brown, who died during the collapse of the second tower on September 11, 2001. Teddy has a change of mind and decides to try a relationship with Owen. In Season 16, Owen is in a relationship with Teddy, whom he had previously given his position as Grey-Sloan's Head of Trauma to keep her in the country. Owen has a contentious relationship with the new Chief of Surgery, Koracik, whom Teddy had dated during her pregnancy. After electrocuting Koracik's genitals, Koracik takes out a restraining order against Owen, requiring him to be 500 feet away. Teddy has been finding motherhood overwhelming and hating her maternity leave, so Owen decides to take paternity leave to allow her to return to work. His paternity leave turns into a resignation. Owen eventually accepts an offer from Karev to become Chief of Trauma at Pac-North after he finds stay-at-home parenting overwhelming and boring.  Development  = Casting and creation = McKidd had to postpone his appointment with series' creator Shonda Rhimes due to it being his son's birthday. Shonda Rhimes, series' creator, says that the character was envisioned \\"an old-fashioned tortured hero\\" and likens him to Heathcliff. Originally set to appear in a multi-episode story arc, Kevin McKidd's contract was extended, securing him a slot as a series' regular of Grey's Anatomy. In July 2008, Entertainment Weekly announced the possibility of McKidd becoming a series' regular, with this possibility eventually being confirmed by People. When asked of how he got involved with the show, McKidd offered the insight: McKidd told BuddyTV, \\"It's been really great. I was nervous when I started because every job I've ever done before this, I have been in the job right from day one when everybody's new and getting to know each other. So I was nervous because I had never done this before. And I feel really grateful to the Grey's cast and crew and everyone there, really, because they've been so nice to me and gracious and accepting of me joining the show. The transition was much easier than I thought it might be, which I'm very grateful for.\\" McKidd has told People that he thinks Grey's Anatomy is a great show and he feels lucky to be on it. Shonda Rhimes, the series' creator, said of his addition, \\"I am excited to have Kevin McKidd joining us for the season, he's been a delight to collaborate with and brings incredible passion, talent and creativity to his work. Plus, he‚Äôs already got the ‚ÄòMc‚Äô built into his name so we had to keep him.\\" =Characterization= McKidd and Oh's characters' relationship and connection has been a major aspect of Owen's characterization The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) characterized Hunt as \\"confident\\", \\"innovative\\", \\"intelligent\\", while he also can be \\"aggressive\\", \\"brazen\\", \\"presumptuous\\", \\"hasty and rash\\". McKidd said of his character: \\"[...] He's not an easy character to connect to, I think. There's some darkness to him and there's some danger to him that I think is really interesting and exciting to play. [...]\\" Additionally, McKidd describes Hunt as \\"very instinctive, and follows his gut, and he's very impulsive, and very immediate. He immediately assesses a situation. And he's very honest, sometimes painfully honest, with himself and with others. He wants to make himself better. He wants to improve himself as a person. He's a decent guy, a sort of a guy I'd like to go out and have a beer with.\\" Hunt's unorthodox teaching methods have been the subject of controversy. McKidd said of this: The look of Owen has been described as hardcore and the antithesis of the other males on the show. McKidd says it's not just the look of Owen, but the fact that in his profession, he is dealing with life and death everyday. The one distinction he finds between his character and the others is that Owen does not care what other people think of him. When McKidd returned from his first appearance, his character appeared to have been changed. McKidd told TV Guide: \\"Yes, that was who he really is in the premiere, but now we're seeing what can happen to a good man, a good soldier and good surgeon [because of war].\\" The character of Owen Hunt had an almost instant attraction to Cristina Yang since his first appearance at Seattle Grace, illustrated by the passionate kiss they share soon after they meet. Owen's story and connection with fellow character Cristina has been a topic of discussion. McKidd said: \\"Between him [Owen] and her [Cristina], it‚Äôs going to get really complex and kind of tense and explosive.\\" Owen and Cristina have experienced roadblocks in their fictional relationship, and continue to. McKidd offered this insight on his character's relationship with Cristina: McKidd has referred to his character and the character of Cristina Yang as \\"soulmates.\\" Speaking of Owen's PTSD storyline, McKidd stated: \\"What's exciting about telling this story with this character is that it's quite brave of ABC and Shonda [Rhimes], on a prime-time network TV show, to address a tough subject, and one that people don't necessarily want to hear about. But so far the writing room is handling it beautifully. They're not banging people over the head with it but exploring it in a sensitive and interesting way.\\" Owen and Cristina have struggled with their fictional relationship in season eight, leading to Owen having a sexual affair. Directly before the episode involving the affair aired, McKidd said to Entertainment Weekly: \\"The thing about Owen is that he tries to do things perfectly, and obviously, he messes up as the chief because you have to make these odd black-and-white decisions and sometimes you make the wrong decision. There‚Äôs a lot of stress in his life at the moment, so he‚Äôs trying not to let that affect his efficiency as chief.\\" Although the characters' marriage is tested, McKidd reported to The Hollywood Reporter: \\"I think they're meant for each other. I hold out faith in Cristina and Owen, even though they go to the darkest places out of all the couples on the show. It's going to get worse but it's going to get better soon.\\" Reception The character has received generally positive feedback from television critics. Weeks after Hunt's first appearance on the show, Matt Roush of TV Guide commented that \\"Hunt/McKidd is the most encouraging thing to happen to Grey's Anatomy in quite a while.\\" He also added: \\"The instant sparks between him [Hunt] and Yang were electrifying.\\" On the other hand, Robert Rorke of the New York Post states that McKidd was brought in as Hunt to \\"boost the sagging fortunes\\" of the show's ratings. Kelley L. Carter of USA Today, describes Hunt as \\"hardcore\\" and \\"the antithesis of the other males on the show.\\" Chris Monfette of IGN said that the fifth season of Grey's Anatomy was an improvement on the previous two seasons, attributing this in part to the introduction of \\"fresh, new characters\\", Owen and Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw). He also referred to McKidd as \\"the season [five]'s best, most effective addition\\", adding: Margaret Lyons of New York Magazine judged Hunt \\"too sad\\" for the first part of the ninth season. In 2010, Kevin McKidd was nominated for the Prism Award for Best Performance in a Drama Series' Multi- Episode Storyline, and won the award. In 2011, McKidd was nominated for the Prism Award for Best Performance in a Drama Series, for his work on Grey's Anatomy. McKidd was nominated, along with the rest of the Grey's Anatomy cast, for Best Drama Series at the 21st GLAAD Media Awards, in 2010. Also in 2010, McKidd, and the rest of the cast, were nominated for Outstanding Drama Series, at the NAACP Image Awards. The same nomination was received at the 2011 NAACP Image Awards, with the cast winning the award. At the 43rd NAACP Image Awards, in 2012, McKidd and the cast were nominated yet again for Outstanding Drama Series.

During processing of a packet, routers may check for bit-level errors in the packet that occurred during transmission as well as determining where the packet's next destination is. Processing delays in high-speed routers are typically on the order of microseconds or less. After this nodal processing, the router directs the packet to the queue where further delay can happen (queuing delay). In the past, the processing delay has been ignored as insignificant compared to the other forms of network delay.

(1972) Symbolist Art. London: Thames & Hudson, p. 54. in the French newspaper Le Figaro by the Greek-born poet and essayist Jean Mor√©as. It describes a new literary movement, an evolution from and rebellion against both romanticism and naturalism, and it asserts the name of Symbolism as not only the appropriate for that movement, but also uniquely reflective of how creative minds approach the creation of art. The manifesto was also intended to serve more practical, immediate needs. Mor√©as, together with Gustave Kahn and others, felt a need to distinguish themselves from a group of writers associated with Anatole Baju and Le D√©cadent. For Mor√©as and Kahn's group, the self-identified decadent writers represented both an earlier stage of development on the path towards symbolism, and also a frivolous exploitation of the language and techniques of the movement. Definition became especially important with the publication of Les Deliquescence d'Adore Floupette, a work of intentional parody whose mimicry was technically perfect, but whose content was a mockery of what was important to Mor√©as, Kahn, and their group. Unfortunately, because of the skill with which it was executed, the reading public thought that Les Deliquescence was representative of this new literature. Clarification was essential. The manifesto unfolds as an introduction establishing the purpose of the document and then three stages: an opening argument, a dramatic intermezzo, and a closing argument.  Opening argument  The first stage of making the case for Symbolism is an aggressive and frank definition of the movement, its beliefs and priorities. As a reaction against the authority of rational naturalism, the manifesto describes symbolists as enemies \\"of education, declamation, wrong feelings, [and] objective description.\\" As a reaction against the newly self-styled decadents, the manifesto goes on to stipulate the primacy of \\"the Idea\\". The purpose of creativity is to find an appropriate way to subjectively express the Idea through extravagant analogy, using natural and concrete things to obliquely reference \\"primordial Ideas\\". Against charges of obscurity resulting from this approach, the manifesto simply points to many allegorical or obscurely symbolic characters from widely accepted literature. The conclusion of the opening argument is an explanation of the style itself. Mor√©as lays forth the sort of paradox that is typical for symbolist art when he talks about the rhythm of their writing: ancient but lively, chaotic but ordered, fluid but boldly assertive. He then gives an appropriately colorful and obscure description of their literary technique: > ... an archetypal and complex style; of unpolluted terms, periods which > brace themselves alternating with periods of undulating lapses, significant > pleonasms, mysterious ellipses, outstanding anacoluthia, any audacious and > multiform surplus; finally the good language ‚Äì instituted and updated ‚Äì, > good and luxuriant and energetic french language ...  Dramatic intermezzo  The second portion of the manifesto is a brief drama in two scenes, featuring poet Th√©odore de Banville whose 1871 work Petit Trait√© de Po√©sie Fran√ßaise (\\"A Small Treatise on French Poetry\\") helped to liberate French poets from traditions and rules that prevented the free exercise of their creativity. Different qualities of the French language lent themselves to different kinds of poetic rhythm and structures. He also increased the emphasis on poetry as an exercise for the poet in developing clever rhyming games. There are three characters in the drama: A DETRACTOR OF THE SYMBOLIC SCHOOL, MR THEODORE DE BANVILLE, and ERATO. In the first scene, DETRACTOR melodramatically raises a series of charges against symbolism and de Banville stands in for the defense of the movement. The charges of interest are grandiloquence, a vainglorious spirit, violation of the rules of poetry, and the continuing importance of romantic literature. de Branville responds aptly to each charge and does so in a way that allows him to drive home some of the important emphases of the symbolist movement: * Truth in excess and extravagance. * Truth in apparent chaos and insanity. * Truth in subjective experience. * The danger of platitudes and natural banality. * The constant need to be ever more audacious. * The risk of what was once rebellious to become conformist. In the second scene, ERATO praises de Banville for Petit Trait√© de Po√©sie Fran√ßaise, but speaks on behalf of the young poets of this new movement, who feel abandoned by him. de Banville makes a brief lament and leaves, described in the text with a sly reference to his work, The Exiles. That collection of poetry was de Banville's most personal attempt to pour all of himself in the name of all those who have been abandoned.  Closing argument  The manifesto concludes by first explaining the power of art and literature to bring together streams of thought and transform them into new and grand things, implying both its grandeur and its wonder. Mor√©as credits writers of other traditions with their accomplishments in this regard, but then argues that symbolists are uniquely positioned to deal with the essence of life: the human being within a reality that has been distorted by his own hallucinations. Symbolists are free to work with things both mechanical and mythical, things seen ahead and recalled from behind. The final words of the Symbolist Manifesto are that \\"art would not know how to search into the objective, what an extremely succinct and simple starting point.\\" For thus art must do its searching within the subjective.  Roots  According to the manifesto, there are traces of early symbolism in the work of Alfred de Vigny, William Shakespeare, and unnamed others. Specific credit was also given to Victor Hugo for the manner in which his French romantic literature established the precedent of change. The manifesto situates symbolist novel-writing in the realm established by such authors as Stendhal, Balzac, Flaubert, and Edmond de Goncourt, and √âmile Zola. These authors exhibited craftsmanship that Mor√©as respected, and some of them shared a disillusion with human progress, but they explored all that in a way that assumed the objectivity of human reality and primacy of the natural world. The manifesto identifies a few poets as most immediately responsible for developing this current symbolism: Charles Baudelaire, St√©phane Mallarm√©, Paul Verlaine, and Theodore de Banville. Symbolism was seen, however as a work in-progress, constantly being refined, including by the efforts of those writers. Mor√©as left the door open, as well, for newcomers to shape the movement even further.  Influence and Legacy  It is important to note that Mor√©as did not choose to publish the Symbolist Manifesto in a small publication such as the short-lived La Vogue or Le Symboliste, even though he helped run the latter. Instead, he chose to first publish in Le Temps, one of the major newspapers in Paris. After generating some immediate heat, he was then given the opportunity to publish the piece in Le Figaro. This scope of publication, including Le Figaro's status as highest- circulating paper, ensured the attention of readers, writers, and the general public alike. The impact of the manifesto was tremendous. The writers who were part of this movement were recognized as symbolists and the only traces of the old \\"decadence\\" were primarily those affiliated with Anatole Baju, precisely those that Mor√©as wished to be regarded as distinct from his own group. At the same time, it made the symbolist label the new go-to for anti-establishment writers, and, apart from Baju's group, many writers who had been called decadent previously were now called symbolist, not because of any change in their perspective or method, but because of a change in the jargon. As a bold, clear statement of symbolism, Le Symbolisme is often taken as the model document for all symbolism, but it is the statement of Jean Mor√©as on behalf of a movement with no formal membership. Even close allies wrote their own responses to the manifesto, differing on points of evidence. Gustave Kahn, for example, preferred to situate symbolism in the realm of impressionism rather than as an evolution of naturalism.

Vienna: C. Kr. Dvorna in Dr≈æavna Tiskarna, p. 19.) is a castle or manor located in Gorju≈°a near the town of Dom≈æale in central Slovenia. History According to Valvasor, the castle was built in the late 13th century by the noble Rabensbergs from Koprivnik. The predecessor of the current castle is first mentioned in 1338 as a possession of Herkules of Krumperk, of the noble house of Kreutberg. By the 15th century, it belonged to the house of Rusbach, which sold it to Engelhand Zellenperger in 1410 under the name Turn Chraw-perg. Valvasor notes that it had once been called either Thurn unter Kreutberg or Thurn zu Kreutberg, although there is confusion as to which of these names referred to Krumperk Castle and which to the ruin of Koprivnik (Rabensberg) Castle near Moravƒçe. At the end of the 16th century, the male Zellenperger line became extinct, and the castle passed by inheritance accord to the older branch of the house of Rauber, one of the most prominent noble families in 15th and 16th century Carniola, who were later elevated to barons. The best-known member of the family was Adam von Rauber, who participated in the Battle of Sisak. At its height, the Krumperk lordship contained the settlements of Dob, Ihan, Krtina, Brezovica, and Studenec. The Raubers replaced the old castle with the current building in 1580. Their line eventually became extinct; the daughter of the last Baron Rauber was the mother of the historian Johann Weikhard von Valvasor. The next owners, in 1631, were the Rasp family, followed by the counts Thurn und Vals√°ssina, then in 1840 the barons Rechbach, who in 1928 moved to Austria after selling the estate to its final private owner, Stanka Pogaƒçnik, a landowner from Ru≈°e near Maribor. After World War II, the castle was nationalized and stripped of its furnishings. The communist authorities converted the structure into a sanatorium for wounded military officers; in 1953, it was given to the Municipality of Dom≈æale, which subdivided it into apartment housing. In 1985, the Krumperk holdings were partitioned; the castle went to Agrokombinat and the estate was taken over by Biotechnical Faculty of the University of Ljubljana, which established an equestrian center. Today, the castle is the subject of a denationalization proceeding and is in a fairly poor state of repair. The Spelunkers' Club () is located nearby, as are two karst caves: Iron Cave () and Hag's Cave (). The castle meadow hosts the Krumperk Equestrian Club, sponsored by the Veterinary Faculty of the University of Ljubljana. Tales of the castle's past are collected in the book Jutro ob kresu (Morning Beside the Bonfire) by Ivan Sivec.

History  IMCO Carbide Tool is a family -owned and -operated company founded in 1977 by Lawrence R. Osburn. With his wife and two sons, Perry and Matthew, Osburn built his business in general-purpose end mills, burs, routers and drills for the automotive and manufacturing industries. The sons served as company vice presidents, learning the business from the ground up and across all disciplines. Perry succeeded his father as President in 1984, with Matthew continuing as Vice President in charge of factory set-up, production processes, hiring, training, inventory management, supplier relations and quality oversight. As the machining industry was challenged by engineered materials with difficult-to-machine characteristics and more demanding specifications and tolerances, the brothers turned their focus on developing tools to meet those challenges. IMCO began to research and develop end mills, working with customers to create tools capable of much higher performance with new and emerging high-speed machining technologies. Versatile tools dubbed STREAKERS M2 end mills were introduced in 1988. STREAKERS were designed especially for working in aluminum. A notoriously \\"soft\\" metal, aluminum tends to meld in the intense heat of the cutting zone before the chips can be evacuated. This causes the chips to congeal in the cutting zone, requiring downtime to clear the blockage and, often, replace the tool. Tests with customer shops showed that STREAKERS end mills' two- and three-flute design eliminate this clogging problem. IMCO's M7 Omega-6 end mills, introduced in 2000, were designed to resolve problems in achieving high surface finishes, especially in hard-to-machine materials. With these materials, from cast iron to titanium, the more balanced and frequent the contact between the cutting edges and the material, the smoother the finish. IMCO developed geometries that maximize contact while maintaining exceptional balance (breaking up harmonics). A heat-resistant coating helps deflect the intense heat generated by cutting tough metals with six ultra-hard carbide flutes. Customers use Omega-6 end mills for a wide range of machining applications, describing \\"performance they didn't think was possible.\\" Soon thereafter, IMCO launched another new product called enDURO M5 end mills, developed especially for working in and finishing aerospace alloys (titanium, stainless steels) and high-silicon aluminum. This line includes three- and five-flute designs to accommodate varying needs for chipload, chip evacuation and finish quality. Advances in coating formulations add to the tools' productivity and extended life. By 2004, the demand for titanium and stainless steel increased; the medical instruments/equipment industry expanded and many planes in commercial and military fleets were \\"aging-out\\" of service. By 2005, IMCO had introduced the POW-R-FEED M9 series, a group of high-performance end mills effective in milling, pocketing, slotting and finishing in titanium and stainless steel and other very hard metals. This demand for machining in engineered metals also prompted a return to the M5 enDURO M505 end mill for redesign. In 2011, the second generation enDURO M525 was launched with refined geometries for even stronger, more chip-resistant cutting edges and higher metal removal rates. Repeated testing showed enDURO tools were effective in titanium and other hard metals even using low-horsepower machining centers. This not only enabled smaller job shops to share in the titanium work, it also allowed shops of all sizes to keep its older/low horsepower equipment running if higher horsepower centers were needed for another project, maximizing capacity and resources. With 2012 came the launch of the second generation of the original 4-flute POW-R-FEED with the introduction of the POW-R-FEED M924. This line expansion also marked the appearance of a new engineered coating - aluminum-chromium-nitride or AlCrNX - with improved heat protection. IMCO refined the tool's rake and relief angles and reinforced its cutting edges, which afforded users higher metal removal rates and shorter cycle times. Better chip resistance along the cutting edges offered the longer tool life shops need to reduce overall tool costs. IMCO distinguished between the POW-R- FEED lines, recommending the M924 for higher-volume operations and the original M904 for shop environments where short runs and a variety of materials are common.  Products  IMCO tools are designed, tested, sourced and manufactured in the U.S. for machining in a wide range of materials, such as aluminum, carbon and stainless steel, tool steels, titanium, cast iron, high-temperature alloys, copper and magnesium alloys, brass, bronze, composites, plastics, and graphite. IMCO tool categories include high- performance and general-purpose end mills, burs, drills, countersinks, rougher/finishers, reamers, routers, die trimmers and custom-made, special purpose precision tools for industrial applications. The company also performs custom modifications to off-the-shelf cutting tools. IMCO Carbide Tool products begin with \\"blanks,\\" or rods of micrograin carbide or ultra-fine micrograin carbide, because of its extreme hardness and favorable heat resistance. IMCO specializes in high-performance end mills designed with variable fluting. Varying flute geometries break up the harmonics, or multiple mechanical frequencies that develop as tools spin and can cause tool instability and failure. Variable fluting breaks up harmonics and keeps the tool balanced as it turns for optimum tool stability. This, in turn, enables the tool to cut with greater precision. IMCO high-performance tools frequently include an engineered coating that deflects heat away from the tool. Typical coatings in the industry include titanium nitride (TiN), aluminum titanium nitride (AlTiN) and titanium aluminum nitride (TiAlN), although IMCO, like many tool makers, fine-tunes these engineered coatings for better heat protection and longer tool use. IMCO added another coating - an aluminum- chromium-nitride (AlCrNX) formula - with the POW-R-FEED M924 end mill introduced in 2012. This AlCrNX coating was shown in research to provide heightened heat protection and exponentially longer tool life. Because extreme temperatures are generated in the cutting zone, where the cutting edges shear through the material at very high speeds, coatings are added to deflect the heat away from the tool. Coatings offer varying degrees of heat protection, or hot hardness, as well as other unique performance characteristics, depending on their formulation. Tools coated with each formulation will work well in some materials and poorly in others. Coatings also provide a degree of lubricity that helps evacuate metal cuttings or chips, from the cutting zone. This prevents clogs and removes chips before they can melt and bond with the tool's cutting edges, which ruins the tool. Tool geometries, or cutting and fluting angles, are essential to the tool's performance. A minute change in angle or cutting radius can make a significant difference in the tool's balance, chiploads and other performance characteristics. IMCO and other tool manufacturers conduct extensive research to fine-tune these geometries, especially for use in heat-treated alloy steels, Inconel, Hastelloy and other engineered metals. Through research and testing, IMCO has developed a range of \\"unique combinations using multiple coating formulas and substrates.\\"  Competitors  * ISCAR * Kennametal/WIDIA * OSG Tool & Die * Sandvik * SGS Tools * Sumitomo References  External links  *Cutting Tools: Carbide to the rescue (example of carbide tool in real application) *Ohio Manufacturer Cuts Milling Time By 75 Percent (example of IMCO‚Äôs work with complex machining operations) *Five-Flute End Mills cut titanium and stainless steel *Perfecting the cutting edge (example of carbide tool in real application) *IMCO Introduces 5-Flute Tools Designed for Titanium and Stainless Steel (example of new products) *Breaking through the profitability barrier (example of IMCO's work with complex materials) *New IMCO M525 End Mill, High-Efficiency Machining Form Dynamic Duo in Titanium, Stainless Steel (example of IMCO's work with complex materials) *IMCO's System Makes Leap Forward in Customer Service (example of new catalogs and videos) *IMCO's System Makes Leap Forward in Customer-Friendly Product Information (example of new catalogs and videos) *IMCO's System Makes Leap Forward in Customer Service (example of new catalogs and videos) *IMCO Carbide's reputation builds out of the limelight (feature story on IMCO) *Chips talk!

The population was 400 at the 2010 census. Wanship is located at the intersection of Interstate 80 and Utah State Route 32, at the junction of Silver Creek and the Weber River. It is from Salt Lake City, and from Coalville. The town lies at an elevation of . History Wanship was founded in 1859 by Stephen Nixon and Henry Roper, who were joined by other settlers over the next two years. In 1861, 300 Native Americans settled in the area. The sudden population increase made attempting to gather food in the area difficult. A friendly Ute, Chief Wanship, helped the non-native settlers to find game, locate edible plants, and trade with the Indians. In return, the town was named for him.Summit County Historical Society Website Farming in the area included rye, barley, wheat, and alfalfa. The town also served as a local commodity hub, as coal from Coalville, silver from Park City, and lumber from Kamas passed through. In 1862 an overland stage stop, called the Kimballs Stage Station, opened in Wanship. Federal Writers‚Äô Project (1954). Utah. US History Publishers. Due to its central location, Wanship became the first county seat of Summit County, from the formation of the county government in 1866 until Coalville became county seat in 1872. The first two-story home built by Thomas Albert Smith, in Summit County was built in Wanship, and has since been relocated to Pioneer Village in Lagoon Amusement Park. Wanship today Today Wanship exists as a small, unincorporated community. There are a few businesses, including a filling station, and a museum in an old barn that contains a collection of antique carriages and other western memorabilia.Photos of Wanship, Utah The Wanship Dam, creating the Rockport Reservoir, was built south of the town in the mid 1950s.USBR Website Demographics As of the census of 2010, there were 400 people living in the CDP.

They were a feature of the Sydney inner-city music-scene during the late 1970s and their music was critically acclaimed. Their sound was influenced by Krautrock and has been described by a band-member as an \\"unsettling mixture of song- driven rock elements and free-noise experimentation\\".Phil Turnbull, ‚ÄòVoigt/465‚Äô, ‚ÄòNo Night Sweats‚Äô web-site Voigt/465 recorded an album, Slights Unspoken, before they disbanded in late 1979. With their self-funded recordings and determinedly uncompromising music Voigt/465 epitomised the do- it-yourself ethic of the alternative music scene of the late 1970s. History Voigt/465 was formed in 1976 from a group of school-friends. The band was composed of Rod Pobestek (guitar), Lindsay O‚ÄôMeara (bass), Phil Turnbull (synthesiser, organ and vocals), Rae Macron Cru (vocals) and Bruce Stalder (drums). They rehearsed and played sporadically during 1977. In 1978 Voigt/465 recorded four songs at Axent Studios at Kogarah, in Sydney‚Äôs southern suburbs. During 1978 the band performed more regularly and began to attract a following. In mid-1978 the drummer left the group and was replaced by Mark Boswell. Later that year Voigt/645 released a self-funded single made up of two of the songs they had recorded earlier that year ‚Äì \\"State\\" and \\"A Secret West\\". The band had a mid-week residency at the Sussex Hotel and regularly performed at other inner-city venues in Sydney. Voigt/465 also travelled to Melbourne to perform a series of gigs. Voigt/465 were highlighted as the \\"band of 1979\\" in Clinton Walker's influential book Inner City Sound, a document of punk and post-punk music in Australia.Clinton Walker, Inner City Sound, Wild & Woolley Pty Ltd, 1982. In 1979 the bass-player Lindsay O‚ÄôMeara decided to leave the band to join Crime and the City Solution in Melbourne. With Voigt/465 on the verge of breaking up the band-members decided to record an album as a lasting document of their songs. The recordings were made at Axent studios and the album Slights Unspoken was released in a limited edition in September 1979. O‚ÄôMeara later returned from Melbourne and eventually joined Pel Mel.

It includes studies of the protozoan and metazoan parasites of humans in the past, as well as parasites which may have affected past human societies, such as those infesting domesticated animals. Reinhard suggested that the term \\"archaeoparasitology\\" be applied to \\"... all parasitological remains excavated from archaeological contexts ... derived from human activity\\" and that \\"the term 'paleoparasitology' be applied to studies of nonhuman, paleontological material.\\" (p. 233) Paleoparasitology includes all studies of ancient parasites outside of archaeological contexts, such as those found in amber, and even dinosaur parasites. The first archaeoparasitology report described calcified eggs of Bilharzia haematobia (now Schistosoma haematobium) from the kidneys of an ancient Egyptian mummy. Since then, many fundamental archaeological questions have been answered by integrating our knowledge of the hosts, life cycles and basic biology of parasites, with the archaeological, anthropological and historical contexts in which they are found. Parasitology basics Parasites are organisms which live in close association with another organism, called the host, in which the parasite benefits from the association, to the detriment of the host. Many other kinds of associations may exist between two closely allied organisms, such as commensalism or mutualism. Endoparasites (such as protozoans and helminths), tend to be found inside the host, while ectoparasites (such as ticks, lice and fleas) live on the outside of the host body. Parasite life cycles often require that different developmental stages pass sequentially through multiple host species in order to successfully mature and reproduce. Some parasites are very host-specific, meaning that only one or a few species of hosts are capable of perpetuating their life cycle. Others are not host-specific, since many different hosts appear to harbor and pass on the infective stages of the parasite. Most archaeoparasitology reports involve species which are considered to be true parasites of humans today. However, incidental parasitism (referred to by some authors as \\"pseudoparasitism\\", \\"false parasitism\\" or \\"accidental parasitism\\") occurs when a parasite which does not normally utilize a host for the perpetuation of its lifecycle is found in that host incidentally. One example is finding the eggs of Cryptocotyle lingua (a fish parasite) in the stomach contents of an Eskimo mummy. It is estimated that 70% of the \\"parasite\\" species reported from present-day humans are actually only incidental parasites. Some incidental parasites do cause harm to the infested pseudohosts. Sources of material In archaeological contexts, endoparasites (or their eggs or cysts) are usually found in (i) fossilized human or animal dung (coprolites), (ii) the tissues and digestive contents of mummified corpses, or (iii) soil samples from latrines, cesspits, or middens (dumps for domestic waste). A cyst of Echinococcus granulosus was even retrieved from cemetery soil in Poland. Ectoparasites may be found on the skin or scalp, as well as wigs, clothing, or personal grooming accessories found in archaeological sites. Ectoparasite eggs may be found attached to individual hairs. The International Ancient Egyptian Mummy Tissue Bank in Manchester, England, provides tissue samples for a variety of uses, including parasitological studies. Since 1910, parasite remains have been found in archaeological samples from Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and New Zealand. The age of archaeological sites yielding human parasite remains ranges from approx. 25,000-30,000 years ago to late 19th-early 20th century. Parasite remains have also been found in domestic animal remains at archaeological sites. Human skeletal remains may exhibit indirect evidence of parasitism. For example, hookworm (Ancyslostoma duodenale) parasitism may lead to anemia, and anemia is one factor associated with the skeletal changes of cribra orbitalia and porotic hyperostosis. Thus, hookworm parasitism may be a causal factor in observed cribra orbitalia and porotic hyperostosis, though dietary factors may also lead to anemia. Information on the presence of intermediate hosts, required for life cycle completion by many parasites, is also useful in determining the likelihood that a parasite may have infected a particular ancient society. One example is the identification of molluscan intermediate hosts of schistosomiasis in an Islamic archaeological context. Artifacts depicting the appearance of individuals may also indicate cases of parasitism. Examples include the characteristic facial deformities of leishmaniasis found on pre-Columbian Mochica pottery, and morphological features of certain ancient Egyptian figurative art. Literary sources also provide valuable information regarding not only the parasites present in historic societies, but also the knowledge and attitudes that the people had towards their parasitic infestations. However, specific parasitological diagnoses reported in ancient and medieval texts must always be read with some degree of skepticism. Techniques and methods Capillaria hepatica eggs from the corpse of an adolescent from the late Roman period in France, treated with petrographic methods Parasite remains in archaeological samples are identified by a variety of techniques. Very durable remains, such as eggs and cysts, may remain intact for many thousands of years. In some cases, relatively intact soft-bodied adult helminths and ectoparasitic arthropods have been found. All of these forms can be identified to the family, genus or species level by compound or electron microscopy. Petrographic techniques have been used for eggs of Capillaria hepatica found in cysts in the corpse of an adolescent from the late Roman period buried in Amiens (France). The authors stated that identification of tissue-dwelling parasites such as Capillaria hepatica in archaeological remains is particularly dependent on preservation conditions and taphonomic changes and should be interpreted with caution due to morphological similarities with Trichuris sp. eggs In cases where the intact bodies of parasites are not found, protein or DNA from the parasite may still be present. Antigenic and immunological assays (including enzyme-linked immunoassay - ELISA,), and DNA sequencing are used to identify the source of these chemical remains, often to the species level. Fundamental questions Archaeoparasitological studies have provided information on many fundamental archaeological, historical, and biogeographical questions. These questions may be grouped into the following broad categories: past dietary and farming practices, animal domestication, migration patterns, climate change, sanitary practices, cultural contacts, ethnomedicine, and the overall health of various human societies. Archaeoparasitology data, combined with our knowledge of present host-parasite associations, also contributes to our understanding of the co-evolution of human host-parasite interactions. Our understanding of the geographic origins, evolution and biogeography of the parasites themselves and human diseases associated with them has also benefitted tremendously from archaeoparasitological studies.

Richard's father Thurstan Goz had become viscount of the Hi√©mois between 1017 and 1025,Hollister, Henry I, p. 53 while Richard himself became viscount of the Avranchin in either 1055 or 1056.Barlow, William Rufus, p. 298, and Hollister, Henry I, p. 54, give the name \\"Margaret\\" for Ranulf's mother; King, \\"Ranulf (I)\\", gives the name \\"Matilda\\", as does Douglas, William the Conqueror, p. 93, who gives Maud Her brother (Richard Goz's son) was Hugh d'Avranches \\"Lupus\\" (\\"the Wolf\\"), viscount of the Avranchin and Earl of Chester (from c. 1070).Hollister, Henry I, p. 54; Lewis, \\"Avranches, Hugh d'\\" Ranulf was thus, in addition to being heir to the Bessin, the nephew of one of Norman England's most powerful and prestigious families.Newman, Anglo-Norman Nobility, pp. 57‚Äì58, 78, 81, 119, 120, 125, 133, 167‚Äì68, 191 We know from an entry in the Durham Liber Vitae, c. 1098 x 1120, that Ranulf le Meschin had an older brother named Richard (who died in youth), and a younger brother named William.King, \\"Ranulf (I)\\"; Rollason & Rollason (eds.), The Durham Liber Vitae, vol. i, p. 159 He had a sister called Agnes, who later married Robert de Grandmesnil (died 1136). =Early career= Historian C. Warren Hollister thought that Ranulf's father Ranulf de Briquessart was one of the early close companions of Prince Henry, the future Henry I. Hollister called Ranulf the Elder \\"a friend from Henry's youthful days in western Normandy\\",Hollister, Henry I, p. 200 and argued that the homeland of the two Ranulfs had been under Henry's overlordship since 1088, despite both ducal and royal authority lying with Henry's two brothers.Hollister, Henry I, p. 54; argument is based on a passage in Robert of Torigny, which says that in 1096, when Robert Curthose went on Crusade and pawned the duchy to William Rufus, Henry received ex integro the counties of Coutances and Bayeux save only Bayeux and Caen, a grant Hollister thought was probably a \\"renewal\\" rather than a new patronage Hollister further suggested that Ranulf le Meschin may have had a role in persuading Robert Curthose to free Henry from captivity in 1089.Hollister, Henry I, p. 342 The date of Ranulf senior's death, and succession of Ranulf junior, is unclear, but the former's last and the latter's earliest appearance in extant historical records coincides, dating to 24 April 1089 in charter of Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy, to Bayeux Cathedral.Davis and Whitwell, Regesta Regum, no. 308; King, \\"Ranulf (I)\\" Ranulf le Meschin appears as \\"Ranulf son of Ranulf the viscount\\". In the foundation charter of Chester Abbey granted by his uncle Hugh Lupus, earl of Chester, and purportedly issued in 1093, Ranulf le Meschin is listed as a witness.Barraclough (ed.), Charters, no. 3; King, \\"Ranulf (I)\\" His attestation to this grant is written Signum Ranulfi nepotis comitis, \\"signature of Ranulf nephew of the earl\\".Barraclough (ed.), Charters, no. 3, at p. 7 However, the editor of the Chester comital charters, Geoffrey Barraclough, thought this charter was forged in the period of Earl Ranulf II.Barraclough (ed.), Charters, pp. 7‚Äì11 Between 1098 and 1101 (probably in 1098) Ranulf became a major English landowner in his own right when he became the third husband of Lucy, heiress of the honour of Bolingbroke in Lincolnshire.King, \\"Ranulf (I)\\"; Newman, Anglo-Norman Nobility, p. 40; Sharpe, Norman Rule in Cumbria, pp. 45-46 This acquisition also brought him the lordship of Appleby in Westmorland, previously held by Lucy's second husband Ivo Taillebois. Marriage to a great heiress came only with royal patronage, which in turn meant that Ranulf had to be respected and trusted by the king. Ranulf was probably, like his father, among the earliest and most loyal of Henry's followers, and was noted as such by Orderic Vitalis.Hollister, Henry I, pp. 116, 200, 257 (n. 90 for the reference to Orderic, which is book 6.222) Ranulf was however not recorded often at the court of Henry I, and did not form part of the king's closest group of administrative advisers.Newman, Anglo-Norman Nobility, p. 98 He witnessed charters only occasionally, though this became more frequent after he became earl.Hollister, Henry I, pp. 342‚Äì43 In 1106 he is found serving as one of several justiciars at York hearing a case about the lordship of Ripon.Green, Henry I, p. 116 In 1116 he is recorded in a similar context. Ranulf was, however, one of the king's military companions. When, soon after Whitsun 1101 Henry heard news of a planned invasion of England by his brother Robert Curthose, he sought promises from his subjects to defend the kingdom.Hollister, Henry I, p. 136 A letter to the men of Lincolnshire names Ranulf as one of four figures entrusted with collecting these oaths.Hollister, Henry I, p. 136; Johnson, Cronne, and Davis (eds.), Regesta Regum, vol. ii, no. 531 Ranulf was one of the magnates who accompanied King Henry on his invasion of Duke Robert's Norman territory in 1106.Green, Henry I, p. 90; Hollister, Henry I, p. 200 Ranulf served under Henry as an officer of the royal household when the latter was on campaign; Ranulf was in fact one of his three commanders at the Battle of Tinchebrai.Kapelle, Norman Conquest, p. 200; King, \\"Ranulf (I)\\" The first line of Henry's force was led by Ranulf, the second (with the king) by Robert of Meulan, and third by William de Warrene, with another thousand knights from Brittany and Maine led by Helias, Count of Maine.Green, Henry I, pp. 91‚Äì92 Ranulf's line consisted of the men of Bayeux, Avranches and Coutances.Green, Henry I, p. 91 =Lord of Cumberland= The gatehouse of Wetheral Priory, founded by Ranulf c. 1106. A charter issued in 1124 by David I, King of the Scots, to Robert I de Brus cited Ranulf's lordship of Carlisle and Cumberland as a model for Robert's new lordship in Annandale.King \\"Ranulf; Phythian- Adams, Land of the Cumbrians, p. 149 This is significant because Robert is known from other sources to have acted with semi-regal authority in this region. A source from 1212 attests that the jurors of Cumberland remembered Ranulf as quondam dominus Cumberland (\\"sometime Lord of Cumberland\\").Sharpe, Norman Rule in Cumbria, p. 47 Ranulf possessed the power and in some respects the dignity of a semi-independent earl in the region, though he lacked the formal status of being called such. A contemporary illustration of this authority comes from the records of Wetheral Priory, where Ranulf is found addressing his own sheriff, \\"Richer\\" (probably Richard de Boivill, baron of Kirklinton).Sharpe, Norman Rule in Cumbria, p. 48 Indeed, no royal activity occurred in Cumberland or Westmorland during Ranulf's time in charge there, testimony to the fullness of his powers in the region.Sharpe, Norman Rule in Cumbria, p. 51 Ivo Taillebois, when he married Ranulf's future wife Lucy, had acquired her Lincolnshire lands but sometime after 1086 he acquired estates in Kendal and elsewhere in Westmorland. Adjacent lands in Westmorland and Lancashire that had previously been controlled by Earl Tostig Godwinson were probably carved up between Roger the Poitevin and Ivo in the 1080s, a territorial division at least partially responsible for the later boundary between the two counties.Sharpe, Norman Rule in Cumbria, pp. 39‚Äì40 Norman lordship in the heartland of Cumberland can be dated from chronicle sources to around 1092, the year King William Rufus seized the region from its previous ruler, Dolfin.Phythian-Adams, Land of the Cumbrians, p. 24; Sharpe, Norman Rule in Cumbria, p. 34 There is inconclusive evidence that settlers from Ivo's Lincolnshire lands had come into Cumberland as a result.For details, see Sharpe, Norman Rule in Cumbria, pp. 36‚Äì38 Between 1094 and 1098 Lucy was married to Roger fitz Gerold de Roumare, and it is probable that this marriage was the king's way of transferring authority in the region to Roger fitz Gerold.Sharpe, Norman Rule in Cumbria, pp. 41-42; Sharpe also cites (p. 42) the \\"unexplained interests in Westmorland in the 1130s\\" held by Richard fitz Gerard of Appleby, the son of the marriage, as additional evidence for this Only from 1106 however, well into the reign of Henry I, do we have certain evidence that this authority had come to Ranulf. The \\"traditional view\\", held by the historian William Kapelle, was that Ranulf's authority in the region did not come about until 1106 or after, as a reward for participation in the Battle of Tinchebrai.Kapelle, Norman Conquest, p. 200; King, \\"Ranulf (I)\\"; see also Sharpe, Norman Rule in Cumbria, pp. 43‚Äì44 Another historian, Richard Sharpe, has recently attacked this view and argued that it probably came in or soon after 1098. Sharpe stressed that Lucy was the mechanism by which this authority changed hands, and pointed out that Ranulf had been married to Lucy years before Tinchebrai and can be found months before Tinchebrai taking evidence from county jurors at York (which may have been responsible for Cumbria at this point).Sharpe, Norman Rule in Cumbria, pp. 44‚Äì46 Ranulf likewise distributed land to the church, founding a Benedictine monastic house at Wetheral.King, \\"Ranulf\\"; Sharpe, Norman Rule in Cumbria, p. 47 This he established as a daughter-house of St Mary's Abbey, York, a house that in turn had been generously endowed by Ivo Taillebois. This had occurred by 1112, the year of the death of Abbot Stephen of St Mary's, named in the foundation deed.Knowles, Brooke and London, Heads of Religious Houses, vol. i, p. 84; Sharpe, Norman Rule in Cumbria, p. 47 In later times at least, the priory of Wetheral was dedicated to St Mary and the Holy Trinity, as well as another saint named Constantine.Knowles, Brooke and London, Heads of Religious Houses, vol. i, p. 97 Ranulf gave Wetheral, among other things, his two churches at Appleby, St Lawrences (Burgate) and St Michaels (Bongate).Sharpe, Norman Rule in Cumbria, p. 49 As an incoming regional magnate Ranulf would be expected to distribute land to his own followers, and indeed the record of the jurors of Cumberland dating to 1212 claimed that Ranulf created two baronies in the region.Sharpe, Norman Rule in Cumbria, pp. 46‚Äì47 Ranulf's brother-in-law Robert de Trevers received the barony of Burgh-by-Sands, while the barony of Liddel went to Turgis Brandos. He appears to have attempted to give the large compact barony of Gilsland to his brother William, but failed to dislodge the native lord, the eponymous \\"Gille\\" son of Boite; later the lordship of Allerdale (including Copeland), even larger than Gilsland stretching along the coast from the River Ellen to the River Esk, was given to William.Kapelle, Norman Conquest, p. 200; King, \\"Ranulf (I)\\"; Phythian-Adams, Land of the Cumbrians, pp. 8‚Äì10 Kirklinton may have been given to Richard de Boivill, Ranulf's sheriff. =Earl of Chester= Chester Cathedral today, originally Chester Abbey, where Ranulf's body was buried. 1120 was a fateful year for both Henry I and Ranulf. Richard, earl of Chester, like Henry's son and heir William Adeling, died in the White Ship Disaster near Barfleur on 25 November. Only four days before the disaster, Ranulf and his cousin Richard had witnessed a charter together at Cerisy. Henry probably could not wait long to replace Richard, as the Welsh were resurgent under the charismatic leadership of Gruffudd ap Cynan. According to the Historia Regum, Richard's death prompted the Welsh to raid Cheshire, looting, killing, and burning two castles.Hinde (ed.), Symeonis Dunelmensis Opera, p. 117; Green, Henry I, p. 172; Stevenson, Simeon of Durham, p. 190 Perhaps because of his recognised military ability and social strength, because he was loyal and because he was the closest male relation to Earl Richard, Henry recognized Ranulf as Richard's successor to the county of Chester.Green, Henry I, p. 173; King, \\"Ranulf\\" In 1123, Henry sent Ranulf to Normandy with a large number of knights and with his bastard son, Robert, Earl of Gloucester, to strengthen the garrisons there.Green, Henry I, p. 182 Ranulf commanded the king's garrison at √âvreux and governed the county of √âvreux during the 1123-1124 war with William Clito, Robert Curthose's son and heir.Hollister, Henry I, pp. 294, 296-7; King, \\"Ranulf\\" In March 1124 Ranulf assisted in the capture of Waleran, Count of Meulan.Hollister, Henry I, p. 298; King, \\"Ranulf\\" Scouts informed Ranulf that Waleran's forces were planning an expedition to Vatteville, and Ranulf planned an to intercept them, a plan carried out by Henry de Pommeroy, Odo Borleng and William de Pont-Authou, with 300 knights.Green, Henry I, p. 185; Hollister, Henry I, p. 298 A battle followed, perhaps at Rougemontier (or Bourgth√©roulde), in which Waleran was captured.Green, Henry I, pp. 185‚Äì86; Hollister, Henry I, pp. 299‚Äì301 Although Ranulf bore the title \\"earl of Chester\\", the honour (i.e., group of estates) which formed the holdings of the earl of Chester were scattered throughout England, and during the rule of his predecessors included the cantref of Tegeingl in Perfeddwlad in north-western Wales.Thacker, \\"Introduction\\", p. 10 Around 1100, only a quarter of the value of the honour actually lay in Cheshire, which was one of England's poorest and least developed counties.Lewis, \\"Formation of the Honor\\", p. 42 The estates elsewhere were probably given to the earls in compensation for Cheshire's poverty, in order to strengthen its vulnerable position on the Anglo-Welsh border.Thacker, \\"Introduction\\", p. 9 The possibility of conquest and booty in Wales should have supplemented the lordship's wealth and attractiveness, but for much of Henry's reign the English king tried to keep the neighboring Welsh princes under his peace.Davis, Conquest, p. 42; Thacker, \\"Introduction\\" Ranulf's accession may have involved him giving up many of his other lands, including much of his wife's Lincolnshire lands as well as his lands in Cumbria, though direct evidence for this beyond convenient timing is lacking.King, \\"Ranulf (I)\\"; Sharpe, Norman Rule in Cumbria, pp. 51‚Äì52 That Cumberland was given up at this point is likely, as King Henry visited Carlisle in December 1122, where, according to the Historia Regum, he ordered the strengthening of the castle.Hinde (ed.), Symeonis Dunelmensis Opera, p. 119; Green, Henry I, pp. 176‚Äì77; Summerson, Medieval Carlisle, p. 25; Stevenson, Simeon of Durham, p. 192 Hollister believed that Ranulf offered the Bolingbroke lands to Henry in exchange for Henry's bestowal of the earldom. The historian A. T. Thacker believed that Henry I forced Ranulf to give up most of the Bolingbroke lands through fear that Ranulf would become too powerful, dominating both Cheshire and the richer county of Lincoln.Thacker, \\"Introduction\\", p. 11 Sharpe, however, suggested that Ranulf may have had to sell a great deal of land in order to pay the king for the county of Chester, though it could not have covered the whole fee, as Ranulf's son Ranulf de Gernon, when he succeeded his father to Chester in 1129, owed the king ¬£1000 \\"from his father's debt for the land of Earl Hugh\\".Sharpe, Norman Rule in Cumbria, p. 52, n. 135 Hollister thought this debt was merely the normal feudal relief expected to be paid on a large honour, and suggested that Ranulf's partial non-payment, or Henry's forgiveness for non-payment, was a form of royal patronage.Hollister, Henry I, p. 343 Ranulf died in January 1129, and was buried in Chester Abbey. He was survived by his wife and countess, Lucy, and succeeded by his son Ranulf de Gernon. A daughter, Alicia, married Richard de Clare, a lord in the Anglo-Welsh marches. One of his offspring, his fifth son, participated in the Siege of Lisbon, and for this aid was granted the Lordship of Azambuja by King Afonso I of Portugal. That his career had some claim on the popular imagination may be inferred from lines in William Langland's Piers Plowman (c. 1362‚Äìc. 1386) in which Sloth, the lazy priest, confesses: \\"I kan [know] not parfitly [perfectly] my Paternoster as the preest it singeth,/ But I kan rymes of Robyn Hood and Randolf Erl of Chestre.\\" References Sources        * * Chester, Ranulf le Meschin, 3rd Earl of Chester, Ranulf le Meschin, 3rd Earl of Category:Norman warriors Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Burials at Chester Cathedral Category:Earls of Chester (1121) ","title":"Ranulf le Meschin, 3rd Earl of Chester"},{"id":"20104794","text":"A paraw on a Philippine postcard (c.1940) Boracay Island Paraw (Philippine Spanish: parao) are various double outrigger sail boats in the Philippines. It is a general term (similar to the term bangka) and thus can refer to a range of ship types, from small fishing canoes to large merchant lashed-lug plank boats (balangay or baloto) with two outriggers (katig) propelled by sails (usually a large crab-claw sail opposite a smaller triangular foresail) Etymology Austronesian crab claw sails The word paraw (also spelled parao) is a cognate of the terms proa of the Pacific Islands, perahu of Malaysia, and prau of Indonesia. It refers to outrigger boats propelled by sails (layag). It is a type of bangka, the wider term used for boats (with or without outriggers) in the Philippines. Characteristics The paraw has three major elements that make it a paraw: the bangka (canoe or main hull), the katig (outriggers), and the layag (sails). Motorized versions of bangkas (with outriggers) are commonly known as pump boats and are used for inter- island travel. Paraws can sail between 11 and 17 knots (20~31 km/h). The outriggers (ama), or katig, are made of wood or bamboo, and may be straight or curved upward much like skis. Construction A paraw sailboat on a beach Traditionally these boats have been made from dungon, guisoc, ipil, duca, baslayan, obacya, bayog, Philippine mahogany (lawaan), basa and molave. Modern versions use plywood. The ropes of the boats are traditionally made from abaca (Manila hemp), but are now often synthetic rope. The main hull (excluding outriggers) is called a bangka for dugout canoes or baloto (also balangay, baroto, biroko, biray, etc.) for hulls made of planks secured with lashed lugs. The boat itself may be classified by passenger capacity as isahan (\\"for one [person]\\") or duwahan (\\"for two [persons]\\"), but the paraw usually has capacity for more than two people, leading to its use in ferrying small groups of passengers and goods between islands. The narrow cross-section of the boat made it sleek, cutting across water without a lot of drag. The two katig or outriggers usually made from bamboo or various kinds of wood and served as counterpoise so that the boat would not easily overturn. They are attached to the boat via tarik (akas). The presence of the outriggers negates the need for a heavy keel and therefore reduces the overall weight of the paraw without sacrificing stability. The layag or main sail may be made of anything from woven mats, cloth, canvas even sack cloth. Traditionally the main sail is similar to a lateen rig or a crabclaw sail and is attached to a vertical and horizontal spar, the sail differs from a traditional lateen rig in that the vertical spar is parallel to the mast and does not suffer from bad tack. The sail's spar may be as long as the mast, unattached and may appear to be longer than the mast when attached to it. There are no guidelines as to how the main sail is shaped but it may approximate an equilateral triangle. The paraw is also equipped with a foresail or jib and adds to the overall surface area and generated thrust derived from the wind. A variation of the paraw with rectangular sails is the vinta. The mast, commonly made of bamboo, is secured by lines attached to, among other things, the outriggers, the fore (and sometimes, the aft) and various parts of the boat. Historically, the mast of smaller paraws was a spear or bangkaw and was a useful part of the ship when conducting raids against other seaside villages. Current uses =Balatik= The Balatik, a sailing paraw used by Tao Philippines in Coron, Palawan In November 2012, a team led by the artisan Gener Paduga, along with the Tao Philippines organization, started building a full-sized paraw sailboat in Palawan. Paduga originally envisioned the project while crewing a sailing yacht from Palawan to Africa. After having witnessed the thriving native sailing traditions in the Indian Ocean, he decided to revive the almost extinct native boat-building and sailing traditions of the Philippines. Sailing ships, which were once used throughout the islands, were in steep decline after engines became widely available in the 1970s. The team consisted of several traditional boat carpenters from the islands of Cagayancillo and Romblon. The boat was constructed entirely using native techniques and also featured intricate designs by two master carvers of the native Palaw'an people. The boat was completed in March 2014 and was officially named the Balatik, after a traditional Filipino constellation (equivalent to Orion) named after a hunter's trapping device. It is long and at the widest point of the hull. It has two masts with four sails and could be crewed by three or four people. The boat is currently used both for tourism and for educational and social welfare projects of the Tao Kalahi Foundation in Palawan. =Paraw Regatta= The Paraw Regatta a large tourism event is held annually since 1973 is a 36.5 kilometer race held in the Iloilo City. =Paraw sailing Boracay Island= Before Boracay Island became a tourist resort, paraws were used for fishing and transportation of people as well as goods. Paraw sailing these days is a major tourist attraction. Local sailors offer their paraws for Island hopping and sunset sailing for a fairly small renting fee.

The label, in 1950, crafted a \\"shared\\" 10-inch children's LP. On side one, Hollywood actor Victor Jory narrated Tubby the Tuba, while side two featured Burl Ives performing seven tunes under the title Animal Fair: Songs for Children. The catalog number was JL 8103. One year earlier, Animal Fair: Songs for Children had been presented separately on a two-disc 78-rpm set, using as a catalog number MJV 59. In 1956, another Ives endeavor for children appeared, containing \\"The Little White Duck\\" and six other ditties. Part of Columbia's brief (1955‚Äì56) House Party Series of 10-inch LPs, the album was called Children's Favorites, affixed with the catalog number CL 2570. Next, a new collection, expanded to 12 inches, combining these 14 Ives selections and 2 additional ones and entitled Burl Ives Sings Songs for All Ages, was issued by Columbia in 1957, bearing CL 980 as the catalog number. Two years later, this album was shortened by two tracks, christened with its final title, Burl Ives Sings Little White Duck and Other Children's Favorites, and reassigned to Columbia's budget label, Harmony Records, which employed HL 9507 as the catalog number. Being the customary practice in the vinyl marketplace of the 60s, this monaural platter wound up electronically enhanced for stereo, circa 1963, and given the modified catalog number HS 14507. Columbia, in 1974, reissued the LP, again in simulated stereo, with the catalog number C 33183. At the same time, the label also transferred the album to cassette tape, affixing the catalog number CT 33183. On November 22, 1988, Columbia unveiled the album in CD format, which upgraded the sound quality to digital stereo. Distribution of the disc then was taken over by Sony Wonder on October 3, 1995. The 1974 LP cover, later retained for the CD, was designed by Ed Lee and Eloise Smith, with illustrations by Reynolds Ruffin.Album credits Currently, the CD is out of print, but it still can be purchased through online music sellers.

City of Quebec: City Hall - Mayors since 1833  Biography  John LeMesurier was the son of Charles LeMesurier, who was born on Jersey, and who served in the Royal Navy under the British Vice Admiral, Lord Horatio Nelson, for nine years and was present at the famed engagement at Trafalgar, where Lord Nelson lost his life at age 47. He was born in 1826 in Gasp√©, and in 1847 sailed on board the schooner \\"Antelope\\" for Quebec City. It was wrecked coming up the Saint Lawrence River. He returned to Gasp√© and embarked on the \\"Mary;\\" he was then wrecked a second time. It is reported that, enduring great hardship and privation, Le Mesurier and crew members walked over the snow and ice to Sault au Cauchon. He stayed there with two crew members and worked for the Price family. The remaining crew members headed for Quebec City. The following spring, LeMesurier crossed to the south shore and made his way on foot to Quebec, then returned to the fishery business in Gasp√©. Young Le Mesurier set out a third time for Quebec City. The schooner took 21 days, but this time he made it to his destination. His first job was with a Mr. Withall who became vice president of the Quebec Bank. In the second year a trifling increase was made to his small salary. Finally, Withall sold his business to Le Mesurier, who made a success of it. Next he started an oakum manufactory, probably to help a brother, but it did not prosper. In 1859, he was elected to the city council, and in 1867 was elected mayor, defeating the sitting mayor, Joseph Cauchon, who later became governor of Manitoba. Following John's first term, the people of Quebec re-elected him by acclamation. During the first year of his mayoralty, John Le Mesurier, delivered the welcome address to H. R. H. Prince Arthur and dined with him at a dinner given by Sir Narcisse Belleau at the Stadacona Club. While Le Mesurier retained office as chief magistrate, a labor riot broke out. He was ordered to read the Riot Act, but this he refused to do. Instead, he courageously went amidst the rioters and, by diplomatic persuasion, induced them to disperse. Because armed troops had been ordered up, Le Mesurier's cool headed daring probably saved bloodshed. He left politics in 1869 to take care of his tobacco venture that was in financial distress. Mr LeMesurier was actively engaged in Liberal party politics, and in October 1877 was asked to introduce Wilfrid Laurier to a meeting that took place in his store. In his introduction, he is reported to have \\"made a very able speech against the corrupt government to which Mr. Laurier was opposing his energy and talents,\\" and \\"spoke in felicitous terms of the great reforms made by the reform parties all over the world, and said that if the just measures of reformers had been carried out, we would not have discontent or disaffection anywhere.\\" John LeMesurier married Marie Sylvain of Quebec, a French Canadian Catholic who was 12 years his senior, and they had five children. In 1870, he opened a brewery and tannery, but not satisfied with the results, he gave them up and, in 1873, went into tobacco manufacturing, taking his sons William and Henry as partners. This enterprise became one of the largest of its type in the province. In addition, LeMesurier became owner of fairly extensive real estate holdings. A biographer, writing in a flowery 19th-century style, gives John Le Mesurier very high marks for his accomplishments in Quebec City, saying \\"Possibly, in Quebec City, there is no man stands higher 'rated' amongst the banking community, with whom he has always done business, than John Le Mesurier.\\" His tobacco company, Lemesurier and Sons, was found to be worth around $10,000 around 1890, which was then appreciable. John LeMesurier died in 1891, and is buried next to his wife, Marie, in Mount Hermon Cemetery, in the Sillery neighbourhood of Quebec City.

Intermittent fasting, also known as intermittent energy restriction, is an umbrella term for various meal timing schedules that cycle between voluntary fasting (or reduced calorie intake) and non-fasting over a given period. Three methods of intermittent fasting are alternate-day fasting, periodic fasting, and daily time-restricted feeding. Intermittent fasting may be similar to a calorie- restriction diet, and has been studied in the 21st century as a practice to possibly reduce the risk of diet-related diseases, such as metabolic syndrome. However, intermittent fasting has been criticised as a fad. The science concerning intermittent fasting is contested. The American Heart Association (AHA) states that intermittent fasting may produce weight loss, reduce insulin resistance, and lower the risk of cardiometabolic diseases, although its long- term sustainability is unknown. The US National Institute on Aging states that there is insufficient evidence to recommend intermittent fasting and encourages speaking to one's healthcare provider about the benefits and risks before making any significant changes to one's eating pattern. A 2019 review concluded that intermittent fasting may help with obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and inflammation. Fasting exists in various religious practices, including Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Jainism, and Buddhism.  Types  An alternate day fasting schedule, that alternates between usual eating (feast days) and fast days with reduced or no calories Three methods of intermittent fasting are alternate-day fasting, periodic fasting, and time-restricted feeding: * Alternate-day fasting involves alternating between a 24-hour \\"fast day\\" when the person eats less than 25% of usual energy needs, followed by a 24-hour non-fasting \\"feast day\\" period. It is the strictest form of intermittent fasting because there are more days of fasting per week. There are two subtypes: **Complete alternate-day fasting (or total intermittent energy restriction), where no calories are consumed on fast days. ** Modified alternate-day fasting (or partial intermittent energy restriction) which allows the consumption of up to 25% of daily calorie needs on fasting days instead of complete fasting. This is akin to alternating days with normal eating and days with a very-low-calorie diet. * Periodic fasting or whole-day fasting involves any period of consecutive fasting of more than 24 hours, such as the 5:2 diet where there are one or two fast days per week, to the more extreme version with several days or weeks of fasting. During the fasting days, consumption of approximately 500 to 700 calories, or about 25% of regular daily caloric intake, may be allowed instead of complete fasting. * Time-restricted feeding involves eating only during a certain number of hours each day. Skipping a meal and the 16:8 diet (16 fasting hours cycled by 8 non- fasting hours) are examples. This schedule is thought to leverage the circadian rhythm. The science concerning intermittent fasting is preliminary and uncertain due to an absence of studies on its long term effects. Preliminary evidence indicates that intermittent fasting may be effective for weight loss, may decrease insulin resistance and fasting insulin, and may improve cardiovascular and metabolic health, although the long term sustainability of these effects has not been studied.  Recommendations  The AHA recommends intermittent fasting as an option for weight loss and calorie control as part of an \\"intentional approach to eating that focuses on the timing and frequency of meals and snacks as the basis of a healthier lifestyle and improved risk factor management\\". For overweight people, fasting may be integrated into a wider dietary change, such as \\"placing snacks strategically before meals that might be associated with overeating\\", planning meals and snacks throughout the day to help manage hunger and control meal portions, and \\"promote consistent overnight fast periods\\". The AHA noted that eating some food on a fast day (instead of a complete fast) produced the greatest weight loss, when at least 4% weight loss was achieved by obese individuals. The American Diabetes Association \\"found limited evidence about the safety and/or effects of intermittent fasting on type 1 diabetes\\" and preliminary results of weight loss for type 2 diabetes, and so does not recommend any specific dietary pattern for the management of diabetes until more research is done, recommending instead that \\"health care providers should focus on the key factors that are common among the patterns\\". New Zealand's Ministry of Health considers that intermittent fasting can be advised by doctors to some people, except diabetics, stating that these \\"diets can be as effective as other energy-restricted diets, and some people may find them easier to stick to\\" but there are possible side effects during fasting days such as \\"hunger, low energy levels, light-headedness and poor mental functioning\\" and note that healthy food must be chosen on non-fast days. The NIA stated that although intermittent fasting showed weight loss success in several studies on obese or overweight individuals, it does not recommend intermittent fasting for non-overweight individuals because of uncertainties about its effectiveness and safety, especially for older adults. According to NHS Choices, people considering the 5:2 diet should first consult a physician, as fasting can sometimes be unsafe. A news item in the Canadian Medical Association Journal expressed concern that promotional material for the diet showed people eating high-calorie food, such as hamburgers and chips, and that this could encourage binge eating since the implication was that \\"if you fast two days a week, you can devour as much junk as your gullet can swallow during the remaining five days\\". Binge eating following dietary restrictions has been observed in a post-war famine study, where nineteen prisoners of war were observed during their rehabilitation with unlimited access to food, and found they tended to indulge in binge eating. Given the lack of advantage and the increased incidence of diarrhea, European guidelines do not recommend intermittent feeding.  Usage trends  , intermittent fasting was a common fad diet, attracting celebrity endorsements and public interest. = UK = Intermittent fasting (specifically the 5:2 diet of Michelle Harvie and Mark Mattson and popularized by Michael Mosley) became popular in the UK in 2012 after the BBC2 television Horizon documentary Eat, Fast and Live Longer. Via sales of best-selling books, it became widely practiced. = North America = In the United States, intermittent fasting became a fad in Silicon Valley. It was the most popular diet in 2018 according to a survey by the International Food Information Council. = Commercial activity = , interest in intermittent fasting led some companies to commercialize diet coaching, dietary supplements and full meal packages. These companies were criticized for offering expensive products or services that were not backed by science. Research  = Weight = There is limited evidence that intermittent fasting produces weight loss comparable to a calorie restricted diet. Most studies on intermittent fasting in humans have observed weight loss, ranging from 2.5% to 9.9%. Alternate day fasting does not affect lean body mass, although one review found a small decrease. Alternate day fasting improves cardiovascular and metabolic biomarkers similarly to a calorie restriction diet in people who are overweight, obese or have a metabolic syndrome. Intermittent fasting has not yet been studied in children, elderly, or underweight people, and can be harmful in these populations. Intermittent fasting is not recommended for people who are not overweight. The long-term sustainability of intermittent fasting is unknown . = Other effects = Night-time eating is linked to impaired sleep quality. Intermittent fasting is not recommended to treat cancer in France, the United Kingdom, or the United States, although a few small-scale clinical studies suggest that it may reduce chemotherapy side effects. Periodic fasting may have a minor effect on chronic pain and mood disorders. In preliminary research, intermittent fasting has shown signs of reducing risk factors for certain disorders, including insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease. Intermittent fasting does not affect bone health. Athletic performance does not benefit from intermittent fasting. Overnight fasting before exercise increases lipolysis, but reduces performance in prolonged exercise (more than 60 min). =Adverse effects= Reviews of preliminary clinical studies found that short-term intermittent fasting may produce minor adverse effects, such as continuous feeling of hunger, irritability, and impaired thinking, although these effects disappear within a month from the fasting practice. However, the data remains sparse, as most of the studies did not analyze adverse effects specifically. A 2018 systematic review found no major adverse effect. Intermittent fasting is not recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women, or growing children and adolescents, or individuals vulnerable to eating disorders. =Tolerance= Tolerance of a diet is a determinant of the potential effectiveness and maintenance of benefits obtained, such as weight loss or biomarker improvement. A 2019 review found that drop-out rates varied widely from 2% to 38% for intermittent fasting, and from 0% to 50% for calorie restriction diet. =Putative mechanisms= Preliminary research indicates that fasting may induce a transition through four states: 1) the fed state or absorptive state during satiety, when the primary fuel source is glucose and body fat storage is active, lasting for about 4 hours; 2) the postabsorptive state, lasting for up to 18 hours, when glucagon is secreted and the body uses liver glucose reserves as a fuel source; 3) the fasted state, transitioning progressively to other reserves, such as fat, lactic acid, and alanine, as fuel sources, when the liver glucose reserves are depleted, occurring after 12 to 36 hours of continued fast; 4) the shift from preferential lipid synthesis and fat storage, to the mobilization of fat (in the form of free fatty acids), metabolized into fatty acid-derived ketones to provide energy. Some authors call this transition the \\"metabolic switch\\". A 2019 review of weight-change interventions, including alternate day fasting, time-restricted feeding, exercise and overeating, found that body weight homeostasis could not precisely correct \\"energetic errors\\" - the loss or gain of calories - in the short-term. =Intermittent feeding= Other feeding schemes, such as hypocaloric feeding and intermittent feeding, also called bolus feeding were under study. A 2019 meta-analysis found that intermittent feeding may be more beneficial for premature infants, although better designed studies are required to devise clinical practices. In adults, reviews have not found intermittent feeding to increase glucose variability or gastrointestinal intolerance. A meta-analysis found intermittent feeding had no influence on gastric residual volumes and aspiration, pneumonia, mortality nor morbidity in people with a trauma, but increased the risk of diarrhea. =Food production= Intermittent fasting, or \\"skip-a-day\\" feeding, is supposedly the most common feeding strategy for poultry in broiler breeder farms worldwide, as an alternative to adding bulky fibers to the diet to reduce growth. It is perceived as welfare-reducing and thus illegal in several European countries including Sweden. Intermittent fasting in poultry appears to increase food consumption but reduce appetitive behaviors such as foraging.  History  Fasting is an ancient tradition, having been practiced by many cultures and religions over centuries. Therapeutic intermittent fasts for the treatment of obesity are investigated since at least 1915, with a renewed interest in the medical community in the 1960s after Bloom and his colleagues published an \\"enthusiastic report\\". Intermittent fasts, or \\"short-term starvation periods\\", were ranging from 1 to 14 days in these early studies. This enthusiasm penetrated lay magazines, which prompted researchers and clinicians to caution about the use of intermittent fasts without medical monitoring. A modern type of intermittent fasting, the 5:2 diet, began in the United Kingdom in 2012.  Religious fasting  The Christian season of Lent begins on Ash Wednesday, which is observed through fasting and the public imposition of ashes, as in this Lutheran celebration of the Mass. Intermittent fasting exists in some religious practices. These include the Black Fast of Christianity (commonly practiced during Lent), Vrata (Hinduism), Ramadan (Islam), Yom Kippur and other fasts (Judaism), Fast Sunday (The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints), Jain fasting and Buddhist fasting. Religious fasting practices may only require abstinence from certain foods or, last for a short period of time and cause negligible effects. In Christianity, many adherents of Christian denominations including Catholics, Lutherans, Methodists, Anglicans and the Orthodox, often observe the Friday Fast throughout the year, which commonly includes abstinence from meat. Throughout the liturgical season of Lent (and especially on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday) in the Christian kalendar, many Christians practice a form of intermittent fasting in which one can consume two collations and one full meal; others partake of the Black Fast, in which no food is consumed until sundown. In Buddhism, fasting is undertaken as part of the monastic training of Theravada Buddhist monks, who fast daily from noon to sunrise of the next day. This daily fasting pattern may be undertaken by laypeople following the eight precepts. During Ramadan, Islamic practices are similar to intermittent fasting by not eating or drinking from dawn until sunset, while permitting food intake in the morning before dawn and in the evening after dusk. A meta-analysis on the health of Muslims during Ramadan shows significant weight loss during the fasting period of up to , but this weight was regained within about two weeks thereafter. The analysis concluded that \\"Ramadan provides an opportunity to lose weight, but structured and consistent lifestyle modifications are necessary to achieve lasting weight loss.\\" One review found similarities between Ramadan and time-restricted feeding, with the main dissimilarity being the disallowance of water drinking with Islamic fasting. Negative effects of Ramadan fasting include increased risk of hypoglycemia in diabetics, as well as inadequate levels of certain nutrients. Ramadan disallows fluids during the fasting period. This is hazardous for pregnant women, as it is associated with risks of inducing labor and causing gestational diabetes, although it does not appear to affect the child's weight.

Construction and commissioning USS LST-1158 was laid down on 16 June 1952 at Bath, Maine, by Bath Iron Works. She was launched on 11 April 1953, sponsored by Mrs. Joseph A. Callaghan, and commissioned on 20 June 1953 with Lieutenant Commander Charles R. Patton in command. Pacific service Following shakedown out of Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek at Virginia Beach, Virginia, LST-1158 shifted to the United States West Coast in January 1954 and operated out of San Diego, California. For the next few years, she worked along the U.S. West Coast and in the Hawaiian Islands. On 2 July 1955, LST-1158 was renamed USS Tioga County (LST-1158). Tioga County conducted two Western Pacific (WestPac) deployments between January 1957 and mid-1960, interspersed with local operations and cruises to the Hawaiian Islands. While en route from the Philippines to Yokosuka, Japan, Tioga County went to the aid of a stricken Taiwanese fishing vessel on 2 February 1960. Bucking gale-force winds and 17-foot (5.2-meter) seas, Tioga County passed lines to the foundering craft and drew her alongside. Tioga Countys crew passed lifejackets down to the fishermen and brought them up via a Jacob's ladder, including one of the nine who had injured his leg. Following her return to the U.S. West Coast from the second Western Pacific deployment, Tioga County resumed local operations out of San Diego. In August 1961, she sailed north for Alaskan waters and operated in the Aleutian Islands for three months. On one occasion off Attu, Tioga County battled high seas and gales up to 80 knots. She returned to San Diego on 1 December 1961. Sailing for Hawaii following leave and upkeep, Tioga County participated in joint United States Army-United States Navy exercises in the islands before returning to the California coast. She conducted local operations and training out of San Diego, on occasion between the U.S. West Coast and the Hawaiian Islands, into 1965. On 31 May 1965 of that year, Tioga County was selected as the test bed for the Sea Sparrow antiaircraft and antimissile missile, and she participated in these tests until June 1965, when she was commended by the Raytheon Corporation for her part in the development of the missile system. In July 1965, Tioga County departed San Diego, bound for Hawaii. During her five-month deployment, she operated out of Pearl Harbor and worked with the U.S. Army 25th Infantry Division on exercises. Vietnam War service Although Tioga County was scheduled to spend Christmas 1965 in San Diego, a change of plans sent her to the Far East for her third Western Pacific deployment. Arriving at Subic Bay, the Philippines, en route to Vietnamese waters, Tioga County loaded barbed wire and aviation fuel tanks and got underway for Da Nang, South Vietnam in mid-January 1966. After delivering her cargo there, she embarked troops and served as a \\"combat taxi\\" for the U.S. Army 101st Airborne Division, making troop and vehicle lifts between Phan Rang and Tuy H√≤a and carrying up to 1,000 troops each time. After shifting briefly to Subic Bay for a drydocking for repair of her screws, Tioga County soon returned to Vietnamese waters to take part in Operation Double Eagle, off Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i Province. She made numerous beachings to load troops and cargo and earned her first engagement star for this action. Following this logistics support evolution, Tioga County returned to the U.S. West Coast via Hong Kong, Yokosuka, Japan, and Pearl Harbor, and reached San Diego on 14 May 1966. Tioga County conducted local operations along the U.S. West Coast until 2 March 1967, when she got underway for her fourth Western Pacific deployment. Proceeding via Pearl Harbor, Guam, and Subic Bay, she arrived at Da Nang on 28 April 1967 with 43 vehicles and other cargo. Following a run to Okinawa, Tioga County returned to Vietnam and became the first landing ship tank of her class to participate in duty with the Mobile Riverine Assault Force. Arriving at V≈©ng T√†u on 6 June 1967, Tioga County loaded 30,000 cases of C rations, 700 tons of U.S. Army ammunition, and 350 tons of miscellaneous cargo. She transited the Song Cua Thi·ªáu to the 9th Infantry Regiment's advanced base at Dong Tam Base Camp and took on board 369 men of \\"B\\" and \\"C\\" companies of the 3rd Battalion, 9th Infantry. Under the aegis of Commander, River Flotilla 1, Tioga County served in the Rung Sat Special Zone of the Mekong Delta region, supporting \\"search-and-destroy\\" missions against Viet Cong (VC) troops. She acted as a \\"Mekong Hilton\\" to the men who were based on board and served as a mobile ammunition and supply depot. In addition, she accompanied the rest of the riverine warfare force up the Song Soirap to Nha Be for close support of both artillery and infantry combat operations. Difficulty with Tioga Countys generators forced her back to Subic Bay for repairs before she returned to Vietnamese waters in late July 1967. She then joined Amphibious Ready Group Alfa off the coast of Vietnam near the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). Here she participated in Operation Beacon Gate, Operation Beacon Guide, and Operation Beacon Point. During this period, in addition to logistics support operations, Tioga County conducted her first combat landing as her LCVPs put a U.S. Marine landing team ashore on the coastal region of Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i Province, a known VC stronghold near the DMZ, with the initial landing wave. Detached from this duty on 6 September 1967, Tioga County sailed for the United States, steamed via Yokosuka and Pearl Harbor, and arrived back at her homeport on Navy Day, 27 October 1967. She conducted local operations and training out of San Diego into 1970, before she conducted her fifth and final Western Pacific deployment from 5 January 1970 to 7 July 1970. Tioga County received three battle stars for Vietnam War service, for: *Vietnamese Counteroffensive 11 January 1966 ‚Äì 27 January 1966, 10 February 1966 ‚Äì 22 February 1966, and 5 March 1966 ‚Äì 19 March 1966 *Vietnamese Counteroffensive Phase II 29 April 1967 ‚Äì 4 May 1967 *Vietnamese Counteroffensive Phase III 2 June 1967 ‚Äì 21 June 1967, 22 July 1967 ‚Äì 17 August 1967, and 29 August 1967 ‚Äì 9 September 1967. Decommissioning Decommissioned on 23 December 1970, Tioga County was placed in reserve at San Diego with the inactive fleet. Military Sealift Command service Tioga County was reactivated in mid-1972 to serve as a cargo ship in a non-commissioned status with a civil service crew with the Military Sealift Command, being designated the United States Naval Ship USNS Tioga County (T-LST-1158). This service continued until she was stricken from the Navy List on 1 November 1973. Disposal After her Military Sealift Command service ended, Tioga County was transferred to the Maritime Administration for layup in the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Suisun Bay, Benicia, California. Custody of Tioga County was transferred to the Maritime Administration on 17 December 1992. She was sold for scrapping to ESCO Marine of Brownsville, Texas on 21 July 2005. She was returned to U.S. Navy custody, removed from the National Defense Reserve Fleet Suisun Bay Group by towing on 17 August 2005 and subsequently scrapped.

Some parasites leave marks or traces (ichnofossils) on host remains, which persist in the fossil record in the absence of structural remains of the parasite. Parasitic ichnofossils include plant remains which exhibit characteristic signs of parasitic insect infestation, such as galls or leaf minesScott, A.C., J. Stephenson, and M.E.

Plant and animal parasites have been found in samples from a broad spectrum of geological periods, including the Holocene (samples over 10,000 years old), Pleistocene (over 550,000 years old), Eocene (over 44 million years old),Wappler, T., V.S.

Cretaceous (over 100 million years) and even Lower Cambrian (over 500 million years). Evidence of parasitism One of the most daunting tasks involved in studying parasitic relationships from the past is supporting the assertion that the relationship between two organisms is indeed parasitic. Organisms living in \\"close association\\" with each other may exhibit one of several different types of trophic relationships, such as parasitism, mutualism, and commensalism. Demonstration of true parasitism between existing species typically involves observing the harmful effects of parasites on a presumed host. Experimental infection of the presumed host, followed by recovery of viable parasites from that host also supports any claim of true parasitism. Obviously such experiments are not possible with specimens of extinct organisms found in paleontological contexts. Assumptions of true parasitism in paleontological settings which are based on analogy to known present-day parasitic relationships may not be valid, due to host- specificity. For example, Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense are both devastating human parasites, but the related subspecies Trypanosoma brucei brucei will infect a number of animal hosts, but cannot even survive in the human blood stream, much less reproduce and infect a human host. So a related (or unidentifiable) species of Trypanosoma found in a paleontological or archaeological context may not be a true human parasite, even though it appears identical (or very similar) to the modern parasitic forms. The most convincing evidence of paleoparasitism is obtained when a presumed parasite is found in direct association with its presumed host, in a context that is consistent with known host-parasite associations. Some examples include helminths caught in amber in the process of escaping from the body of an insect, lice found in the fur of guinea pig mummies, protozoans in the alimentary canal of flies in amber, nematode larvae found embedded in animal coprolites, and a mite caught in amber in the process of apparently feeding on a spider. Fossil organisms which are related to present-day parasites often possess the morphological features associated with a parasitic lifestyle, such as blood-feeding mouthparts. So fossil ticks and hematophagous insectsLukashevich, E.D. and M.B. Mostovski (2003) Hematophagous insects in the fossil record. Paleontologicheskii Zhurnal 2003(2):48-56 (Russian) / Paleontological Journal 37(2):153-161 (English).Ponomarenko, A.G. (1976) A new insect from the Cretaceous of Transbaikalia, a possible parasite of pterosaurians. Paleontological Journal 10(3):339-343 (English) / Paleontologicheskii Zhurnal 1976(3):102-106 (Russian) are generally assumed to be ectoparasites, even when their remains are found in the absence of a host. The presence of structures resembling leaf miner trails in leaf fossils provide indirect evidence of parasitism, even if remains of the parasite are not recovered. The dramatic tissue aberrations seen in present-day plant galls and gall-like structures in some invertebrates are direct physiological reactions to the presence of either metazoan parasites or microbial pathogens. Similar structures seen in fossil plant and invertebrate remains are often interpreted as evidence of paleoparasitism. Host-parasite interactions today are often exploited by other species, and similar examples have been found in the fossil record of plant galls and leaf mines. For example, there are species of wasps, called inquilines, which are unable to induce their own plant galls, so they simply take up residence in the galls that are made by other wasps. Another example is the predation of plant galls or leaf mines, to eat the trapped insect larva inside the gall or mine. Knowledge gained from ancient animal and plant parasites Studies of parasite remains and traces from the past have yielded a vast catalog of ancient host-parasite associations.Baumiller, T.K. and F.J. Gahn (2002) Fossil record of parasitism on marine invertebrates with special emphasis on the platyceratid-crinoid interaction . Paleontological Society Papers 8:195-209. Genetic sequence data obtained directly from ancient animal parasites, and inferences of past relationships based on genetic sequences of existing parasite groups are also being applied to paleoparasitological questions. Data obtained by all of these methods are constantly improving our understanding of the origin and evolution of the parasites themselves and their vectors,Black, W.C, IV (2003) Evolution of arthropod disease vectors. In: C.L. Greenblatt and M. Spigelman (eds) Emerging Pathogens: The Archaeology, Ecology, and Evolution of Infectious Disease. Oxford University Press, pp. 49-63. and of the host-parasite and vector-parasite associations.Labandeira, C.C. (2006) Four phases of plant- arthropod associations in deep time . Geologica Acta 4(4):409-438. In some cases, presumed host-parasite relationships of the past seem quite different from those known in the present, such as a fly which appears to be a parasite of a mite Paleoparasitological studies have also provided insight into questions outside the realm of parasitology. Examples include the migration and phylogeography of marine mammal hosts, the identity of domestic animal bones based on the known hosts of parasite remains found at the site, and the possible role of climatic changes on animal host genetic diversity.

Seventh-day Adventist believe it is day which God set aside from the beginning, specifically for holy purposes, on which all Mankind should rest from their labor during the week and come together to worship the Creator. One Adventist author wrote, \\"Worship involves an attitude of mind and heart which enables man to love God with all his being.\\" Also printed as The Westminster Dictionary of Worship (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1972);  Worship service  The major weekly church worship service occurs on Saturday, typically commencing with Sabbath School which is a structured time of small- group study at church. Most Adventists make use of an officially produced \\"Sabbath School Lesson\\", which deals with a particular biblical text or doctrine every quarter. Special meetings are provided for children and youth in different age groups during this time (analogous to Sunday school in other churches). After a brief break, the community joins together again for a church service that follows a typical evangelical format, with a sermon as a central feature. Corporate singing, Scripture readings, prayers and an offering, including tithing (or money collection), are other standard features. They would normally have bible class and AY (Adventist Youths) and vespers to close the Sabbath. Special religious ceremonies The weekly church service can also include a baptism which is done in the form of immersion, in which the candidate is submerged completely under the water. Adventist teach that baptism symbolizes and declares our new faith in Christ and our trust in His forgiveness, and buried in the water, we arise to a new life in Jesus, empowered by the Holy Spirit.https://www.adventist.org/en/beliefs/church/baptism/article/go/-/baptism- by-the-book/ The 15th Fundamental Belief states \\"By baptism we confess our faith in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and testify of our death to sin and of our purpose to walk in newness of life. Thus we acknowledge Christ as Lord and Saviour, become His people, and are received as members by His church. Baptism is a symbol of our union with Christ, the forgiveness of our sins, and our reception of the Holy Spirit. It is by immersion in water and is contingent on an affirmation of faith in Jesus and evidence of repentance of sin. It follows instruction in the Holy Scriptures and acceptance of their teachings. (Matt. 28:19, 20; Acts 2:38; 16:30-33; 22:16; Rom. 6:1-6; Gal. 3:27; Col. 2:12, 13.).\\"https://www.adventist.org/en/beliefs/church/baptism/http://ssnet.org/about- us/fundamental-beliefs-seventh-day-adventists/baptism-fundamental-belief-15/ =Music style & Guidelines= Adventist worship is generally restrained and carefully organized. Ellen White, on the topic of appropriate music, referred Adventists to the Bible and her writings. She encouraged believers to use judgement and hindsight when considering music that is uplifting. She said, \\"Those things which have been in the past will be in the future. Satan will make music a snare by the way in which it is conducted. God calls upon His people, who have the light before them in the Word and in the Testimonies, to read and consider, and to take heed. Clear and definite instruction has been given in order that all may understand. But the itching desire to originate something new results in strange doctrines, and largely destroys the influence of those who would be a power for good if they held firm the beginning of their confidence in the truth the Lord had given them. \\" 2nd Selected Messages, p. 36-38., Ellen White In her book Education, White writes about the use of music for the uplift of souls. She writes that music \\"is one of the most effective means of impressing the heart with spiritual truth. . . . As a part of religious service, singing is as much an act of worship as is prayer. Indeed, many a song is prayer. . . . Heaven's communion begins on earth. We learn here the keynote of its praise.\\" Education, pg. 168 According to White, \\"Music, when not abused, is a great blessing; but when it is put to a wrong use, it is a terrible curse.\\"Testimonies, vol. 1, pg. 497. The Adventist leaders used her advice and have based a theory of Adventist worship music on verses such as Job 38:7, 2 Samuel 6:15, Psalm 150:3, 1 Corinthians 10:31, Phillipians 4:8, Revelation 4:9-11, 14:1-3, and 19:1-8. These verses advocate the use of music to uplift and praise God. The General Conference voted to propose a list of general music guidelines based on the principles that \\"music is not morally and spiritually neutral\\" and that \\"we cannot be indifferent to it.\\" This led to the following nine principles, summarized here: # Music should actively glorify God. Anything else weakens a relationship with Him. # Music should strive for heavenly perfection. # Music should be socially acceptable. # Music should be appealing and uplifting. # Music should implement melody, harmony, and rhythm effectively and enjoyably. # Lyrical music should be rich in content and of sound Biblical qualities. # Lyrical and instrumental musical elements should complement. # It maintains a judicious balance of spiritual, intellectual, and emotional elements. # We should recognize and acknowledge the contribution of different cultures in worshiping God. Musical forms and instruments vary greatly in the worldwide Seventh-day Adventist family, and music drawn from one culture may sound strange to someone from a different culture. \\"Seventh-day Adventist Philosophy of Music - Guidelines,\\" General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists Annual Council on October 13, 2004. =Holy Communion service= Adventists usually practice communion four times a year. The communion is an open service that is available to members and Christian non-members. It commences with a foot washing ceremony, known as the \\"Ordinance of Humility\\", based on the Gospel account of . The Ordinance of Humility is meant to symbolize Christ's washing of his disciples' feet at the Last Supper and remind participants of the need to humbly serve one another. Participants segregate by gender to separate rooms to conduct this ritual, although some congregations allow married couples to perform the ordinance on each other and families are often encouraged to participate together. After its completion, participants return to the main sanctuary for consumption of the Lord's Supper, which consists of the pastor and elders consecrating and sharing unleavened bread and unfermented grape juice with the members.

Lu (; born June 12, 1966) is a former United States Deputy Secretary of Labor. He also served as Assistant to the President and White House Cabinet Secretary for United States President Barack Obama from 2009 to 2013, as well as the co-chair of the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.White House Website, \\"Leadership Bios for Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders\\" Lu graduated from the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University and from Harvard Law School, where he was a classmate of Obama's. After serving briefly as an advisor on Senator John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign, Lu began working for Barack Obama in 2005 in his U.S. Senate office, where Lu served as legislative director and acting chief of staff. Following Obama's successful 2008 campaign for presidency, Lu was appointed executive director of the Obama-Biden Transition Project. When Obama appointed Lu as Cabinet Secretary, The New York Times described him as \\"one of the highest-ranking Asian Americans in the Obama administration\\". Early life Chris Lu was born on June 12, 1966 in New Jersey. In 1974, his family moved to the Fallsmead neighborhood of Rockville, Maryland, where he graduated from Thomas S. Wootton High School in 1984. Lu is the son of Eileen and Chien-Yang Lu, both of whom were born in China and lived in Taiwan until the 1950s when they emigrated to the United States to attend college. Lu's grandfather, Wang Renyuan, was the Minister of Justice of Taiwan from 1970 to 1976 and was elected to the first Legislative Yuan in 1948 to represent Tianjin. Lu said he was heavily influenced by his father, who worked as an electrical engineer but loved literature and history; the two would read biographies of politicians and watch the evening news together. Lu attended the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University, where he was the senior news editor of the Daily Princetonian. Lu's ambition for a political career developed at Princeton, particularly during his internship in the Capitol Hill office of Senator Charles Mathias. He graduated magna cum laude in 1988,\\"Kaleo O Aapi: Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.\\" Obama for America, official campaign literature, pg.4, July 25, 2008. after writing a 161-page long senior thesis titled \\"Press Coverage of Presidential Primaries, 1972-1984.\\" After graduating from Princeton, Lu attended Harvard Law School, where he was one of Barack Obama's classmates from 1988 to 1991. Career After graduating cum laude from Harvard in 1991, Lu started his career as a law clerk to Judge Robert Cowen in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In 1992, he began working as a litigation attorney at the Washington, D.C. office of Sidley Austin, a large Chicago-based law firm. Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, also worked at Sidley Austin, in the firm's Chicago office. In 1997, Lu left Sidley Austin and took his first job in the political arena as deputy chief counsel for Representative Henry Waxman and the Democratic staff of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee of the House of Representatives. Phil Schiliro, Waxman's chief of staff, had a large part in the decision to hire Lu; the two would work together again later on the Obama administration; Lu later said he considers Schiliro and Pete Rouse, another future White House staffer, among his most influential mentors. During his tenure with the Government Reform Committee, Lu conducted several high-profile investigations, including investigations into campaign fundraising during the 1996 presidential election, the collapse of Enron, and substandard nursing home conditions. Lu also served as special adviser for communications to Senator John Kerry during the 2004 presidential election. One of his primary duties there was coordinating the activities of families of September 11 attack victims supporting the Kerry campaign. Barack Obama's Senate office After Barack Obama was elected as U.S. Senator of Illinois, Lu joined Obama's office in early 2005 as legislative director. Lu developed a strong admiration for Obama, of whom he said, \\"With his quick and incisive mind, Obama is the most intelligent person that I have ever met (in the political arena).\\" As legislative director, Lu led a 15-person group and was responsible for overseeing the drafting of all legislation and advising Obama on votes and policy decisions. When weighing difficult votes, Obama had Lu and his other staff members assemble together and argue about the issue in front of him. David Mendell, a Chicago Tribune reporter and Obama biographer, said Lu was among the \\"moderate voices in this atmosphere of smart young staffers.\\" Lu advised Obama to vote in favor of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 because he felt it would have been politically wiser to support it, but Obama ultimately voted against it. Lu said of his role as legislative director, \\"It's one of the most fun jobs in the Senate (but) it's also an incredibly difficult job because you have to know something about any given thing going on in the Senate at the time ... It takes a couple years off your life.\\" Lu, along with Robert Gibbs and several other Obama staffers, read Obama's manuscript for The Audacity of Hope and provided him with several editorial suggestions. Lu eventually became acting chief of staff in Obama's Senate office. When Obama announced his candidacy for president in February 2007, Lu did not move over to the campaign, but remained to continue running Obama's operations in the Senate; Lu said of Obama at that time, \\"Even while he was running for president, he had a day job [in the Senate].\\" Obama administration Blue Room of the White House In May 2008, Obama asked Lu to begin planning for a possible presidential transition.

During the transition period, Lu was in daily contact with Bush administration officials, managed the $9 million budget, and negotiated the ground rules for Obama transition representatives to gather information on federal agency operations and programs. Obama selected Lu to serve as Cabinet Secretary, making him one of the highest-ranking Asian Americans in the administration, along with Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke and Secretary of Energy Steven Chu. At the time of his selection, The New York Times reporter Michael Falcone wrote, \\"By now, Mr. Lu knows the president-elect's record better than almost anyone.\\" Lu's responsibilities included representing Obama's positions to each of the Cabinet secretaries and agencies and coordinating a common White House agenda among them. Marc Ambinder, associate editor of The Atlantic, said of Lu, \\"when agency heads have a problem, or when the White House has a problem with an agency head, Mr. Lu will be the first person who's called, or calls.\\" In 2009, Lu visited China in July 2009 as part of an official delegation for the Obama administration, along with Locke and Chu.

He was unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate on April 1, 2014. Lu became the first Asian American to hold the position, and only the second Asian American in history to serve as deputy secretary of a cabinet department, after Elaine Chao. Lu's service in this position ended on January 20, 2017, concurrent with the end of the Obama Administration. Lu soon took up positions as a Senior Fellow of the University of Virginia Miller Center, specializing in presidential scholarship, and as a Senior Advisor to FiscalNote. He remains heavily involved as a DNC superdelegate and co-chaired DNC Chairman Tom Perez's transition committee.

The majority of smaller and less expensive IBM 360s and 370s came equipped with these ruggedized Selectric keyboard devices.

(Alamo EMS) was an Advanced Life Support (ALS) and Basic Life Support (BLS) ambulance service owned by Health Quest, with transportation services in the Hudson Valley region of New York. Alamo operated ambulances staffed by emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and paramedics. Alamo held Emergency Response 9-1-1 contracts and CON's in Dutchess, Putnam, Orange and Ulster Counties. History Alamo Ambulance began in the early 1960s in Binghamton, New York http://alamoems.com/showPage.asp?pagename=About_WhoAreWe Alamo EMS : Who Are We? by paramedic James Alamo. In 1966 Jim Alamo moved the company to Poughkeepsie, New York. On March 21, 1966, The Poughkeepsie Common Council voted to contract with Alamo and replace the ambulance contract they had with Vassar and St Francis Hospitals. The initial contact called for Alamo to bill $20 per private call, $16 for welfare calls and a $5 surcharge if oxygen was used. Alamo EMS was one of the main EMS companies to offer services to Dutchess County in the late 1900s. Before ambulances were readily available, Alamo would have \\"Fly Cars\\" or paramedics that have an SUV with all the equipment an ambulance has, including a drug box. This was more practical for towns and jurisdictions that didn't have enough residents to merit a separate ambulance. Often the paramedic would ride in the back of a town ambulance to provide advanced medical care to the patient en route to the hospital. Poughkeepsie, seen from an ambulance. In 1996 Alamo became the 51st ambulance service in the United States and the first not-for-profit in the Northeast to be accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Ambulance Services (CAAS). CAAS [1] is a non-profit organization which was established to encourage and promote quality patient care in America's medical transportation system. The primary focus of the Commission's standards is high-quality patient care. This is accomplished by establishing national standards which not only address the delivery of patient care, but also the ambulance service's total operation and its relationships with other agencies, the general public, and the medical community. The Commission's standards often exceed state or local licensing requirements. In 2004 Alamo received its second perfect score for re-accreditation and still maintains its accreditation today. On December 14, 2007, Northern Dutchess Paramedics announced a proposed merger with Alamo EMS.http://www.health-quest.org/alamo Health Quest Network The application was the first step in the regulatory process toward creating an organization which was aimed at better serving the Hudson Valley community in providing emergency and ambulance services. The joint venture would also have required approval from the New York State Attorney General's Office, and the New York State Supreme Court. Health Quest and Northern Dutchess Paramedics anticipated that the regulatory process would take approximately six to twelve months; however as of December 31, 2008 the merger was not completed and is now abandoned. If it had been completed it would have created the largest independent ambulance provider in the Hudson Valley Region. On December 17, 2008, the two companies announced that the merger had fallen through, and would not be completed. The companies claimed they had differences that could not be settled. In January 2009 Health Quest began allocating additional funding to Alamo to aid their goal of covering most of the towns in Dutchess County. Town Of Beekman. On June 4, 2009, Health Quest, the parent company of Alamo EMS, announced to its employees that the company has been sold to TransCare, with a projected completion of acquisition of August 1, 2009. The date was pushed back to a later date due to the complexities involved in the takeover. On September 19, 2009, the buyout was completed and all Alamo EMS services were terminated and transitioned to TransCare. Up until its demise in 2009, Alamo EMS was the only community-owned ambulance service and was governed by an all-volunteer board of trustees composed of community leaders, and under the guidance the umbrella organization Health Quest. As a \\"not-for-profit, charitable organization, all operating funds went back into Alamo and increased the quality of the ambulance service offered. Other than emergency medical services, Alamo operated a full-time Ambulette service which provided service to the disabled seven days a week.

Galvin was secretary and president of the Australian Labor Party's Glenelg electorate committee and was an AWU delegate to the party's state council. In 1951, he was elected to the Australian House of Representatives as a member of the Labor Party, defeating Liberal MP Jim Handby for the seat of Kingston. He held the seat until 1966, when he was defeated by Liberal candidate Kay Brownbill. Galvin died in 1980.

She was a playwright, journalist, radio and television presenter, writer, and publicist, working primarily in Adelaide. She was the first South Australian woman elected to the House of Representatives and the third overall, serving a single term from 1966 to 1969. Early life Brownbill was born in Adelaide on 21 July 1914. She was a child actress under the name \\"Kitty Brownbill\\", making her debut on stage at the age of six, but gave up the theatre after injuring an ankle while dancing. She attended Unley High School and business colleges in Adelaide and Sydney, earning a certificate in home economics, and also took classes in English and public speaking at the University of Adelaide. Media career At a young age, Brownbill began writing, producing, and acting in radio plays under the name \\"Cathrine Brownbill\\". Her plays were distributed by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and aired in Canada, New Zealand, India and South Africa. Her play \\"Sleep to Wake\\" ‚Äì about Colonel William Light ‚Äì won second prize in a competition run by The Advertiser and was performed at the celebrations marking the centenary of South Australia in 1938. Brownbill briefly worked at radio station 2WG in Wagga Wagga before returning to Adelaide in 1939. She spent eight years at 5DN and 5RM, holding the title of \\"social editress\\" and helping expand the station's female listenership. Brownbill eventually moved to Sydney to work as an executive at 2GB, another Macquarie Network affiliate. In 1949, she moved to England for a year to study at a television school. Upon her return she was heralded by The News as \\"Australia's first television expert\\". She eventually transitioned to the field of public relations, and was deputy state president of the Public Relations Institute of Australia. Politics Brownbill was active in the Liberal and Country League of South Australia, and first stood for the House of Representatives at the 1963 federal election. She ran in the Division of Kingston but the seat was retained by the sitting Labor member Pat Galvin. She reprised her candidacy in 1966, defeating Galvin with a 12.7-point swing as the Coalition won a landslide victory. Brownbill was the third woman elected to the House of Representatives, after Enid Lyons and Doris Blackburn, and the first from South Australia. She was the first woman elected to the House since 1949, and the first not to have been the widow of a previous member. At the time of her election she was the only South Australian woman in federal parliament, but she was joined by Senator Nancy Buttfield in July 1968. Brownbill's maiden speech focused on the need to attract more overseas tourists to Australia, and she lobbied for the appointment of a woman to the board of the newly created Australian Tourist Commission. She served on the Printing Committee and the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings, and supported quotas for Australian content on radio and television. Her speeches showed \\"a keen interest in aircraft noise, foreign policy, social welfare reform and education\\". Her parliamentary career came to an end after a single term, as she lost her seat to Labor's Richard Gun at the 1969 election. It was not until 1987 that another South Australian woman, Elizabeth Harvey, was elected to the House of Representatives. Other activities In 1962, Brownbill published a historical mystery novel titled Blow the Wind Southerly. Before and after her political career, she lectured in South Australian history at the University of Adelaide's Adult Education Department. She began working on a biography of artist Hans Heysen in 1963, but after her election to parliament she passed on her notes and tape- recordings to Colin Thiele who completed his own biography of Heysen. Brownbill was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1980 Queen's Birthday Honours. She died in Adelaide in February 2002, aged 87.

It was a significant factor in the Kokoda Track Campaign and also a contributing factor to the destruction caused by Cyclone Guba. History =World War II= Kumusi River Crossing at Wairopi Aerial view of Kumusi River Due to its relative proximity to the Kokoda Track, the Kumusi River was often a factor in the Kokoda Track Campaign of World War II. The fast flowing and wide river provided natural barrier from enemy, and gave the soldiers a distinct advantage. There were few bridges, the solid ones were often bombed to break a supply line. Soldiers often had to walk, or use rafts through the powerful current in order to get across Many fatalities were recorded as the current overwhelmed the soldiers. One of the most notable deaths was that of Japanese Major General Tomitaro Horii. After the Oivi-Gorari battle, the Japanese chaotically crossed the river at Wairopi. Although his horse already had drowned, Horii opted to try and cross on a raft. He soon fell into the water and drowned. =Cyclone Guba= On 14 and 15 November 2007, Cyclone Guba hit the Oro Province. The Cyclone brought five days of solid rain, causing widespread flooding; the Kumusi swelled to ten times its original width. The flooding destroyed homes, gardens and in some cases, entire villages were washed away. The flooding completely destroyed the provinces vital infrastructure, over twenty-two bridges were washed away, cutting the link to Popondetta. Of the twenty-two, the Kumusi Bridge, a large steel structure was destroyed, with estimated rebuilding costs at K70 million.

G.8032v1 supported a single ring topology and G.8032v2 supports multiple rings/ladder topology. Overview ERPS specifies protection switching mechanisms and a protocol for Ethernet layer network (ETH) rings. Ethernet Rings can provide wide-area multipoint connectivity more economically due to their reduced number of links. The mechanisms and protocol defined in this Recommendation achieve highly reliable and stable protection; and never form loops, which would fatally affect network operation and service availability. Each Ethernet Ring Node is connected to adjacent Ethernet Ring Nodes participating in the same Ethernet Ring, using two independent links. A ring link is bounded by two adjacent Ethernet Ring Nodes, and a port for a ring link is called a ring port. The minimum number of Ethernet Ring Nodes in an Ethernet Ring is three.https://www.juniper.net/techpubs/en_US/junos15.1/topics/example/interfaces- ethernet-ring-protection-switching-ex-series-els.html The fundamentals of this ring protection switching architecture are: a) The principle of loop avoidance. b) The utilization of learning, forwarding, and Filtering Database (FDB) mechanisms defined in the Ethernet flow forwarding function (ETH_FF). Loop avoidance in an Ethernet Ring is achieved by guaranteeing that, at any time, traffic may flow on all but one of the ring links. This particular link is called the Ring Protection Link (RPL), and under normal conditions this ring link is blocked, i.e. not used for service traffic. One designated Ethernet Ring Node, the RPL Owner Node, is responsible for blocking traffic at one end of the RPL. Under an Ethernet ring failure condition, the RPL Owner Node is responsible for unblocking its end of the RPL (unless the RPL has failed) allowing the RPL to be used for traffic. The other Ethernet Ring Node adjacent to the RPL, the RPL Neighbour Node, may also participate in blocking or unblocking its end of the RPL. The event of an Ethernet Ring failure results in protection switching of the traffic. This is achieved under the control of the ETH_FF functions on all Ethernet Ring Nodes. An APS protocol is used to coordinate the protection actions over the ring. =G.8032v2= Version 2 of G.8032 introduced many additional features, such as: * Multi-ring/ladder network support * Revertive/ Non-revertive mode after the condition that is causing the switch has been cleared * Administrative commands: Forced Switch (FS), Manual Switch (MS) for blocking a particular ring port * Flush FDB (Filtering database) Logic, which significantly reduces amount of flush FDB operations in the ring * Support of multiple ERP instances on a single ring Principle of operation =G.8032v1= In ERPS there is a central node called RPL Owner Node which blocks one of the ports to ensure that there is no loop formed for the Ethernet traffic. The link blocked by the RPL owner node is called the Ring Protection Link or RPL. The node at the other end of the RPL is known as RPL Neighbor Node. It uses R-APS control messages to coordinate the activities of switching on/off the RPL link. Any failure along the ring triggers a R-APS(SF) (R-APS signal fail) message along both directions from the nodes adjacent to the failed link after these nodes have blocked the port facing the failed link. On obtaining this message, RPL owner unblocks the RPL port. (Note that a single link failure anywhere in the ring ensures a loop free topology.) During the recovery phase when the failed link gets restored the nodes adjacent to the restored link send R-APS(NR) (R-APS no request) messages. On obtaining this message, the RPL owner block the RPL port and then sends a R-APS(NR,RB) (R-APS no request, RPL blocked) message. This will cause all other nodes other than RPL owner in the ring to unblock all the blocked ports. This protocol is robust enough to work for unidirectional failure and multiple link failure scenarios in a ring topology. It includes a mechanism to force switch (FS) or manual switch (MS) which is used in field maintenance scenarios.

Senate Democrats responded that there was sufficient time to vote on a nominee before the election. Consequently, no action was taken on the nomination, which expired in January 2017.

He responded: Later in March 2008, while on the campaign trail in Ohio, Obama again addressed the traits he would look for in a Supreme Court justice, suggesting he might leaven legal scholarship with practical political experience. He held up Earl Warren, a former governor of California who later became Chief Justice, as an example. Mr. Warren, he said, had had the wisdom to recognize that segregation was wrong less because of precise sociological effects and more so because it was immoral and stigmatized blacks: Later, however, Obama seemed to step away from the example of Warren. In an interview with the editorial board of the Detroit Free Press on October 2, 2008, Obama said: Instead, Obama mentioned then current justices David Souter and Stephen Breyer as examples of people he would like to nominate to the Supreme Court in the future: In the third and final presidential debate with Republican nominee John McCain on October 15, 2008, Obama also implied that he would look for a Supreme Court nominee with previous judicial experience: =Court demographics= Demographic considerations have played into the appointment of Supreme Court justices since the institution was established. Starting in the 20th century, these concerns shifted from geographic representation to issues of gender and ethnicity.Jeffrey Toobin, Diverse Opinions, The New Yorker, (June 8, 2009). Prior to the 2008 presidential election, many court watchers suggested that the next president would be under significant pressure to appoint another woman or ethnic minority to the court.Greg Stohr, Obama, McCain Would Look to Women, Hispanics for Supreme Court, Bloomberg (July 15, 2008).Jeffrey Rosen, Short Bench: Why the Dems lack Supreme Court nominees, The New Republic (March 12, 2008). The calls for naming more women were particularly widespread given the recent retirement of Sandra Day O'Connor and the rapidly changing demographics of the legal community, with women now accounting for about a fifth of all law partners and law school deans, a quarter of the federal bench, and nearly half of all law school graduates.Charlie Savage, Wider World of Choices to Fill Souter‚Äôs Vacancy, The New York Times (May 1, 2009). Shortly before the election, for example, NPR reported, \\"Most observers of the Supreme Court agree about one thing: The next nominee is likely to be a woman\\".Nina Totenberg, Law School Past Shapes Obama's View On Justices, National Public Radio (November 2, 2008). Furthermore, after Obama's presidential election victory, Hispanic legal interests groups such as the Hispanic National Bar Association began urging Obama to nominate a Hispanic justice.Tony Mauro, Pressure Is on Obama to Name First Hispanic Supreme Court Justice, Legal Times (December 1, 2008). Given the relative youth of the most recent Republican appointments, it was also noted that Democrats had \\"a strong incentive to pick younger justices this time around\\". Age proved to be an important consideration for Obama, who was \\"looking for a justice who will be an intellectual force on the court for many years to come\\".Bill Mears, Sources: High court selection process down to finalists, CNN (May 13, 2009). As a result, Obama did not seriously consider candidates such as Jos√© A.

Sonia Sotomayor nomination On May 26, 2009, Obama announced Second Circuit appeals court judge Sonia Sotomayor as his choice to replace retiring Associate Justice David H. Souter. Sotomayor's nomination was submitted to the United States Senate on June 1, 2009, when the 111th Congress reconvened after its Memorial Day recess. Sotomayor was confirmed by the Senate on August 6, 2009, by a vote of 68‚Äì31,Charlie Savage, Sotomayor Confirmed by Senate, 68-31, The New York Times (August 6, 2009). and was sworn in as an Associate Justice on August 8, 2009.Greg Storh, Sonia Sotomayor Sworn In as Supreme Court Justice, Bloomberg (August 8, 2009). =David Souter retirement= Long before the election of President Obama, Associate Justice David H. Souter had expressed a desire to leave Washington, D.C., and return to his native New Hampshire.Robert Barnes, Souter Reportedly Planning to Retire From High Court, The Washington Post (May 1, 2009). The election of a Democratic president in 2008 made Souter more inclined to retire, but he did not want to create a situation in which there would be multiple vacancies at once. Souter apparently became satisfied that no other justices planned to retire at the end of the Supreme Court's term in June 2009. As a result, in mid-April 2009 he privately notified the White House of his intent to retire from the Supreme Court at the conclusion of its business for that term. Souter submitted a resignation letter to Obama on May 1, who later that day made an unscheduled appearance during the daily White House press briefing to publicly announce Souter's retirement. =Short list= Obama began the process of identifying potential Supreme Court nominees shortly after his election in 2008, before a Supreme Court vacancy was actually known. White House Counsel Greg Craig helped assemble an early list of possible names. Once the White House had learned of Souter's plans to retire, two members of the Vice President's staff, Chief of Staff Ron Klain and Counsel Cynthia Hogan, ran the daily operations of the selection process. Within a week of Souter's announcement the White House had formalized its short list of candidates to replace Souter, with Judge Sonia Sotomayor of the Second Circuit, Judge Diane Pamela Wood of the Seventh Circuit, and Solicitor General Elena Kagan reportedly leading contenders for the nomination.Jan Crawford Greenburg, White House Formalizes Supreme Court Short List, ABC News (May 7, 2009). Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, California Supreme Court Justice Carlos Moreno, and Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm were also reportedly on the short list of candidates under serious consideration by the White House.Ben Feller, White House: No interviews of court candidates yet, Associated Press (May 15, 2009). Chief Justice Leah Ward Sears of the Georgia Supreme Court, Judge Merrick B. Garland of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and Judge Ruben Castillo of the Federal District Court for the Northern District in Illinois were also on the final list of nine candidates. =Interviews= Obama had not interviewed any of the candidates before May 18,Associated Press, Court candidate Granholm visits White House (May 19, 2009). but that week saw a flurry of activity and speculation surrounding possible interviews of candidates. Jennifer Granholm attended a CAFE standards meeting at the White House on May 19 and spoke with Obama, but officials would not comment on whether the two discussed a potential court appointment.

Vice President Joe Biden also interviewed the four finalists. Obama telephoned Judge Sotomayor at 9 pm EST on May 25 to alert her that she was his choice. Later that night, he called the other three finalists and informed them of his decision. Obama announced the nomination the next morning in the East Room of the White House in a press conference alongside Sotomayor and Joe Biden. Elena Kagan nomination On May 10, 2010, Obama nominated Elena Kagan, the Solicitor General of the United States, to replace retiring Associate Justice John Paul Stevens. Solicitor General Elena Kagan was confirmed by the Senate by a 63-37 vote. =John Paul Stevens retirement= On April 9, 2010, Associate Justice John Paul Stevens announced that he would retire at the conclusion of the Supreme Court's term in June 2010.Mark Sherman, Summer battle ahead for Stevens' court replacement, Associated Press (April 9, 2010).

Savage, Speculation rises that Supreme Court Justice Stevens will retire, Los Angeles Times (September 3, 2009). (Full-time associate justices are allowed up to four law clerks while retired justices have only one.) =Short list= Before the announcement, the White House had been preparing for another possible Supreme Court vacancy, with White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs responding to speculation about a possible Stevens retirement by saying \\"We'll be ready.\\"Associated Press, Who would replace Justice John Paul Stevens?, (April 5, 2010). After Stevens announced his retirement, an anonymous White House official said that about ten people were under consideration.

Plot summary  The main protagonist, Fujiki awakens to find himself in a strange desert landscape suffering from amnesia. His only clue is a small generic hand held game console \\"Pocket Game Kids,\\" which informs him that he is now the unwilling participant in a game called \\"The Mars Labyrinth\\" and must head for the \\"1st checkpoint.\\" While attempting to recall the foggy circumstances surrounding his arrival in the mysterious landscape he comes upon a woman named Ai. Since her machine is broken they decide to cooperate in order to reach the first checkpoint. Upon their arrival, they meet seven additional players who also possess the game machines. The game's instructions are divided among all the players to ensure initial cooperation. The nine players discover that there are seven total checkpoints. The second checkpoint is divided into four possible choices: North for information, East for survival items, South for food, and West for self-defense items. The players divide up and agree to reconvene in order to divide up the items. Ai suggests to Fujiki that they choose \\"North.\\" Upon reaching the checkpoint they are given additional game software which includes survival tips and explains that the game is set in the Bungle Bungles of Australia. Once the players reunite it becomes apparent that they have all chosen to act selfishly and hold out on each other so Fujiki decides not to share all of their new found information. The following day everyone parts company but Fujiki and Ai decide to remain as a team and focus on honing their survival skills. It eventually becomes apparent that the initial directions chosen by the players determines their roles in the game.

Education and academic career She matriculated at the Durban Girls' High School, leaving for Edinburgh shortly after. Jacot Guillarmod was awarded an MA in English and History at the University of St Andrews, but inspired by D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson, switched interests and started an MSc degree in Botany and Zoology at the same university. On her return to South Africa, she taught briefly in Durban and was then appointed plant pathologist in the Division of Botany and Plant Pathology of the Department of Agriculture in Pretoria. Her first papers dealt with the viral diseases of tobacco and other crops. She spent the years between 1940 and 1957 in Basutoland. In 1956/7 she became Head of the Botany Department of the Pius XII College in Roma. Jacot Guillarmod founded the Roma Herbarium in 1956. In 1958 she and her family moved to Grahamstown when she took up an appointment as lecturer in the Botany Department of Rhodes University. Her links with Basutoland were not forgotten, and in 1967 she received a DSc from the University of St Andrews for her research on the flora of Basutoland. She is commemorated in Merxmuellera guillarmodiae Conert, Navicula jacotiae F.R. Schoeman, Pinnularia guillarmodiae F.R. Schoeman and a number of other organisms. Volume 50, part 1 (1988) of The Flowering Plants of Africa was dedicated to her.

History In 1966, the fledgling band began hanging around gigs by The Groop, who were a favourite of Melbourne pop fans during 1966. Eventually, the group played their first live gig, which was headlined by The Groop. The new group immediately attracted the attention of their future mentors, particularly keyboardist Brian Cadd and singer Ronnie Charles. Somebody's Image quickly developed a strong following at Melbourne's premier venues and it wasn't long before the band came to the notice of Go-Set staff writer Ian Meldrum, who was already championing The Groop relentlessly in his columns. Meldrum took over as their manager. Somebody's Image began their recording career with the single \\"Heat Wave\\" a cover of the Martha and the Vandellas song, but it failed to chart. Their second single was a version of Joe South's \\"Hush\\" which peaked at number #15. With Meldrum's support and hard work promoting the band, he helped them to secure a firmer recording deal with EMI Records. The band released \\"Hide and Seek\\" in 1968 which peaked at number #32. In September 1968, Morris and Meldrum left the band and they recruited new singer/guitarist Brian Holloway (ex The Dream), but the band parted ways in 1969.

In his later life, Burke became rather eccentric, preferring the privations of life away from his native England. Plant hunter Heliamphora nutans Burke was born in Kent and joined Veitch as a gardener at Chelsea, London. In 1880, after expressing a desire to travel, he was asked to accompany Charles Curtis on a trial trip to Borneo, where they were instructed by Harry Veitch to collect specimens of Nepenthes northiana; the search for the elusive pitcher plant was unsuccessful, but the pair discovered many other species, including many interesting stove (hot-house) plants, palms, and orchids. At the end of the trip, Burke returned to England with the collection of plants, including large consignments of slipper orchids, Paphiopedilum stonei and P. lowii, as well as many Vandas, Rhododendrons, and the beautiful Stove-foliage plant, Leea amabilis. Nepenthes burkei In 1881, Burke was sent to British Guiana, where he re-discovered the insectivorous plant Heliamphora nutans, which had not been seen since its discovery on Mount Roraima by the two brothers Robert and Richard Schomburgk in 1839, and successfully introduced it to England. Amongst orchids he introduced from British Guiana were the rare Zygopetalum burkei (named after him) and Phragmipedium lindleyanum; from that trip he also sent the stove- house plant Amasonia punicea. Two years later, Burke visited the Philippines with instructions to search for Phalaenopsis; amongst those he introduced were Phalaenopsis mariae (previously discovered by Frederick William Burbidge in the Sulu Archipelago in 1878), which Burke located on the hills near the south-east coast of the island of Mindanao. On Mindanao, he also discovered Phaius philippinensis on the slopes of the hills at 3,000-4,000 ft. elevation; this was interesting as being the first species of the genus Phaius to be discovered in the Philippines. In the Philippines, he also discovered and introduced Nepenthes burkei, a species of pitcher plant which was named after him, and Dendrobium taurinum, which he found on Ambon Island. He subsequently visited New Guinea (twice), from where he introduced Cirrhopetalum robustum and Coelogyne veitchii as well as returning to Burma to search for orchids. During the years 1894 to 1896 he made three trips to Colombia to search for Cattleya mendelii, C. schroedera, C. trianae and Odontoglossum crispum. On the last trip, he also introduced Marattia burkei, although his notes did not record the locality. Death and obituary In 1896, having spent a short time in England, Burke embarked on what was to be his final voyage, to the Celebes Islands and the Moluccas. Prior to his departure, he stated: \\"I‚Äôm off again and if I make a good meal for someone I hope I shall give full satisfaction.\\" On 11 April 1897, he died on Ambon Island. The circumstances of his death were reported back to England by a German commercial traveller. According to Hortus Veitchii, \\"This traveller (Burke) crossed a greater area of the earth's surface and covered more miles in search of plants than any other Veitchian collector, with the possible exception of the two brothers William and Thomas Lobb.\\" In her biography of the Veitch family, Sue Shephard describes Burke as Harry Veitch's \\"strangest, longest‚Äìserving and most adventurous orchid collector\\".

McMichael played outside the Kingdome, KeyArena, McCaw Hall, Safeco Field, and Qwest Field, among other venues. McMichael was known for playing songs appropriate for the climate of the venue where he was playing, such as \\"Happy Days Are Here Again\\" during the Seattle Mariners' successful 1995 season; for adapting mainstream rock and roll songs to the tuba; and for wearing funny, often colorful hats while he played. Early life McMichael graduated in the mid-1970s from King's Garden High School. He played in the band at North Seattle Community College, and in the Seattle Youth Symphony. He also played in the Bellevue Philharmonic, Everett Symphony and Cascade Symphony. A Seattle Youth Symphony scholarship will be established in McMichael's name.  Death  According to police, on October 25, 2008, a group of black youths beat and robbed McMichael near Seattle Center just after midnight. The attackers punched and kicked McMichael as he lay on the ground in the fetal position. He was treated at a hospital, but died November 3. Seattle Post-Intelligencer columnist Robert Jamieson wrote a front-page story about McMichael's life and death, while KOMO 1000 commentators Ken Schram and John Carlson interrupted 2008 election coverage to organize a memorial fund for McMichael. Seattle Seahawks officials helped to organize a November 12, 2008 public memorial at Qwest Field Events Center that was attended by 1,500 people. The webmaster of The Tuba Man website created and maintains this site in honor of McMichael's memory. It celebrates the legacy of his music, and also has links to related local events. Terry Henderson, local organizer of the April 14, 2009 Safeco Field event, offered locals an opportunity to get involved. =Perpetrators= Three teenagers were sentenced to detention for manslaughter in connection with the death of McMichael. One was sentenced to serve up to 36 weeks, and the other two were sentenced to serve up to 72 weeks, including the time already spent in custody (about 24 weeks). The two other suspects have not been found and their whereabouts are unknown. In regard to the two at-large suspects, the Seattle Police Department's morning press release stated: \\"Unfortunately, the only description that we have is that the suspects were black males in their mid-teens.\\" The DA who prosecuted the case told the Seattle Times that because no eyewitnesses came forward after McMichael was assaulted and robbed, he was not legally able to charge the perpetrators as adults and seek longer prison terms for their actions, and was limited to the standards of juvenile criminal law instead. Ja‚Äômari Alexander-Alan Jones, who at age 15 served six months for killing McMichael, pleaded guilty on 10 December 2014 to the murder of DeShawn Milliken and was sentenced to 18 years in prison. His fellow killer Billy Chambers was later convicted of a firearms charge and sentenced to 6 years in prison.

History  St. Peders Priory, later Skovkloster, was founded by the powerful noble, Peder Bodilsen, his mother, Bodil, and his brothers, Henning and J√∏rgen with several donations (Danish:gavebrev) in 1135. Among them they gave town lands and many other farms scattered across Zealand and Falster. Archbishop Eskild, who was a personal friend of Bernard of Clairvaux, was enthusiastic about the establishment of a religious house at Naestved. Skovkloster's royal charter from Eric III of Denmark in 1140 is the oldest still in existence for any monastic house in Denmark. The original monastery and church lay inside the town on the main square of Great Naestved but no trace of it remains. The small original church was constructed out of granite in Romanesque style without a tower. A second church across town was constructed of granite, dedicated to St. Morten a few decades later which also belonged to St. Peders. The archives of St Peders have been remarkably preserved at Herlufsholm. Among other documents is the most complete account ledger for any monastic house in Denmark. These documents provide insight not only into the daily workings of St. Peders, but other houses as well. The National Library has in its collection the Naestved Annals (Danish:√Örbogen) as well as lists of benefactors and an obituary book (Danish: d√∏debog). The establishment of St. Peders put Naestved on the map; there had been two small villages, Great Naestved and Little Naestved, on the banks of the Sus√• since Viking times. They grew together grew into the third largest town in Denmark and the largest on Zealand through trade. It was a logical place to offload goods and passengers going into or out of Zealand. The monks built a Romanesque church in Naestved called 'St. Peders' which was a simple single nave building without a tower completed by 1200. St. Morten's church was rebuilt on its present location in the mid-13th century. Naestved was a good location for additional houses; the Franciscans arrived about 1240 and the Dominicans established a house at Naestved before 1266. The prior of St Peder's was also the lord of the city, and the market fees were paid directly to the monastery for the maintenance of the house and its operations. Even today the city's coat of arms has the keys of St. Peter on it as a reminder of the city's origins. St. Peter's was moved 2 kilometers outside Naestved about 1200 where the monks built a new and larger complex with its own church (Herlufsholm Kirke) and ranges for dormitories, lay brothers, a hospital, refectory making it one of the larger Benedictine religious houses in Denmark. The name change to 'Forest Abbey' (Danish:Skovkloster) reflects the change in location. Skovkloster became an abbey under the Bishop of Roskilde by order of the Curia in Rome. A fire in 1261 destroyed the complex which was rebuilt in Gothic style. By that time it had already come into possession of more than 100 income properties in Zealand, Sk√•ne, and Falster. Bishops and kings also extended privileges or rent rights to several special incomes. Several abbots are remembered. Abbot Mathias who died in 1419 was praised for his care of the monks for 28 years and for improving some of the buildings which had fallen into disrepair. Abbot Jens caused trouble in the abbey when he implemented reforms for a stricter rule, some of the monks rebelled. In the 1400'a Naestved became an important port for the Hanseatic League which brought the town to its economic height. The city's wealth also brought the establishment of a Dominican house for nuns at Gavn√∏ in 1390. The monastery experienced difficulty in keeping enough lay brothers to do the field work on the many farms which supported the Benedictines. The monks eventually had to split their time between farm work and prayers. St Peders church was expanded and completely rebuilt by 1375 in the Gothic style out of brick, the most common building material of the age. It has an unusually wide nave and remains a fine example of Danish Gothic architecture. In 1500 a tower was added to St Peders, slightly off-kilter from the rest of the church which wasn't corrected until the major restoration of the church in the 1880s. St Peders Church reached its existing form. = Dissolution = The early 16th century were turbulent as Denmark struggled over whether its religious loyalty lay with the Roman Catholic Church or a Protestant church controlled by the rulers of Denmark. With its Hanseatic ties, Naestved's loyalties lay with imprisoned Christian II, Denmark's last Catholic king and his agent, Count Christoffer. As early as 1527 the Franciscan houses in Denmark were forced to close, often violently. The Franciscan Friary at Naestved was the location of refuge for many of the homeless friars. Friar Rasmus Olsen and Friar Jacob took down eyewitness accounts of the various expulsions of the Franciscans which were collected and published long after under the title, 'Chronicle of the Expulsion of the Grayfriars' (Danish: Udjagelse af Gr√•br√∏drenes fra Danmark). The Franciscans were hounded from their monastery in 1532. Open civil war called the 'Count's Feud' broke out between Prince Christian, soon to be Christian III of Denmark and Count Christoffer. Less than two years later Christian III was firmly in control of all of Denmark including Sk√•ne. Denmark became officially Lutheran in October 1536 and all monastic houses and their property became crown property. In an unusual move the monks at Skovkloster were permitted to remain in the abbey which passed to the Lutheran superintendent, later Bishop of Aarhus, Ove Bille in 1537. The last abbot, Christoffer Hansen, handed the keys of the abbey complex over to Oluf Trolle in 1559 as the monks were forced from the abbey. He was one of Frederik II's advisors and a national naval hero. Herluf Trolle owned a huge estate at Hiller√∏d in north Zealand called Hiller√∏dsholm and was persuaded by the king to trade that estate for Skovkloster. Trolle agreed and moved to what he renamed Herlufsholm (Danish: Herluf's Island) about 1560. The king promptly began building Frederiksborg Palace. Herluf Trolle converted the abbey into a manor house and estate, and before he died in 1565, he and his wife, Birgitte Mogensdatter G√∏ye, who was childless, founded the boarding school Herlufsholm for 'youth of noble and honorable heritage'. She died in 1574; both were buried in Herlufsholm Church. There is an interesting legend about Lady G√∏ye's posthumous desire to see the school persist. After her death, the family attempted to wrest control of the estate from the school. They were summoned to Copenhagen to produce the letter of gift establishing the school. The family was unable to produce it, to their embarrassment. But it threw the ownership of the estate into confusion. Lady G√∏ye appeared to the pastor in charge of the school the night before he was to leave for Copenhagen to try to prove the school's right to retain the property. She appeared to him and went to a large table where she repeatedly struck one of the legs and then vanished. The next morning the pastor went to the table and found a secret compartment containing the G√∏ye's letter of gift leaving Herlufsholm to the school, thereby securing its future.  Later history  Herlufsholm Boarding School () was established by the Trolle's and properties attached to the deed ensured it was adequately funded. However, the descendants of Herlufsholm weren't as enthusiastic about the loss of such a magnificent and valuable property to the school. Children served as governors of the school, which was established for 42 students. In the 1870s a major reconstruction of the school was undertaken. All of the remaining monastery buildings were demolished, only the cellar of the 'Monastery Building' and a much restored Herlufsholm church incorporating elements of the original remain from the monastery. The newer Herlufsholm buildings were constructed in the Gothic style out of the same materials to reflect the heritage of the school. The two churches in Naestved once belonging to the Benedictines became the parish churches for the town with St Peder's taking precedence. St Peders Church was restored to its Gothic style in the 1880s. St Peder's Church has three bells in the tower, one of which dates from before the Reformation. Oluf Kegge and Johannes Pavli's bell cast in 1488 is still in use. The organ at St Peter's was first installed in 1586 as a swallow's nest organ high in a loft above the chancel. It was constructed by Master Hans Brebus. Brebus was a Flemish immigrant who built organs as early as 1570. In time he became the royal organ maker under Frederick II and Christian III.

Probably related to the old English earls of Mercia, she came to possess extensive lands in Lincolnshire which she passed on to her husbands and sons. She was a notable religious patron, founding or co-founding two small religious houses and endowing several with lands and churches. Ancestry A charter of Crowland Abbey, now thought to be spurious, described Thorold of Bucknall, perhaps the same as her probable father Thorold of Lincoln, as a brother of Godgifu (Godiva), wife of Leofric, Earl of Mercia.Keats-Rohan, \\"Antecessor Noster\\", p. 1; Williams, \\"Godgifu\\". The same charter contradicted itself on the matter, proceeding to style Godgifu's son (by Leofric), √Ülfgar, as Thorold's cognatus (cousin).Keats- Rohan, \\"Antecessor Noster\\", p. 1. Another later source, from Coventry Abbey, made Lucy the sister of Earls Edwin and Morcar, √ÜlfgƒÅr's sons, while two other unreliable sources, the Chronicle of Abbot Ingmund of Crowland and the Peterbrough Chronicle also make Lucy the daughter of Earl √Ülfgar. Keats- Rohan's explanation for these accounts is that they were ill-informed and were confusing Lucy with her ancestor, William Malet's mother, who was in some manner related to the family of Godgifu. Although there is much confusion about Lucy's ancestry in earlier writings, recent historians tend to believe that she was the daughter of Thorold, sheriff of Lincoln, by a daughter of William Malet (died 1071).Johns, Noblewomen, Aristocracy and Power, p. 76, n. 26; Keats-Rohan, \\"Antecessor Noster\\", pp. 1‚Äì2; Sharpe, Norman Rule in Cumbria, p. 36, n. 85. She inherited a huge group of estates centred on Spalding in Lincolnshire, probably inherited from both the Lincoln and the Malet family.Keats-Rohan, \\"Antecessor Noster\\", p. 2. This group of estates have come to be called the \\"Honour of Bolingbroke\\".King, \\"Ranulf (I)\\". Marriages The heiress Lucy was married to three different husbands, all of whom died in her lifetime. The first of these was to Ivo Taillebois, a marriage which took place \\"around 1083\\".Sharpe, Norman Rule in Cumbria, pp. 36‚Äì7. Ivo took over her lands as husband, and seems in addition to have been granted estates and extensive authority in Westmorland and Cumberland.For discussion of Cumbria during the lifetime of Lucy's husbands and their role, see Sharpe, Norman Rule in Cumbria, pp. 34‚Äì52. The lands of Ivo in Lincolnshire are listed in the Domesday Book, see Williams & Martin (eds.), Domesday Book, pp. 909‚Äì14. Ivo died in 1094.Sharpe, Norman Rule in Cumbria, p. 40. The second marriage was to one Roger de Roumare or Roger fitz Gerold, with whom she had one son, William de Roumare (future Earl of Lincoln), who inherited some of her land.King, \\"Ranulf (I)\\"; Sharpe, Norman Rule in Cumbria, p. 40. The latter was the ancestor of the de Roumare family of Westmorland.Sharpe, Norman Rule in Cumbria, p. 41. n. 98. Roger died in either 1097 or 1098.Green, Aristocracy, p. 369; Sharpe, Norman Rule in Cumbria, p. 41. Sometime after this, though before 1101, she was married to Ranulf le Meschin, her last and longest marriage.Sharpe, Norman Rule in Cumbria, p. 45. A son Ranulf de Gernon, succeeded his father to the earldom of Chester (which Ranulf acquired in 1121) and a daughter, Alice, married Richard de Clare. Upon her death, most of the Lincolnshire lands she inherited passed to her older son William de Roumare, while the rest passed to Ranulf II of Chester (forty versus twenty knights' fees).Green, Aristocracy, p. 369. The 1130 pipe roll informs us that Lucy had paid King Henry I 500 marks after her last husband's death for the right not to have to remarry.Johns, Noblewomen, Aristocracy and Power, p. 60; King, \\"Ranulf (I)\\". She died around 1138. Religious patronage Lucy, as widowed countess, founded the convent of Stixwould in 1135, becoming, in the words of one historian, \\"one of the few aristocratic women of the late eleventh and twelfth centuries to achieve the role of independent lay founder\\".Johns, Noblewomen, Aristocracy and Power, p. 60. Her religious patronage however centered on Spalding Priory, a religious house for which her own family was the primary patron. This house (a monastic cell of Crowland) was founded, or re-founded, in 1085 by Lucy and her first husband Ivo Taillebois. Later, she was responsible for many endowments, for instance in the 1120s she and her third husband Earl Ranulf granted the priory the churches of Minting, Belchford and Scamblesby. In 1135, Lucy, now widowed for the last time, granted the priory her own manor of Spalding for the permanent use of the monks. The records indicate that Lucy went to great effort to ensure that, after her own death, her sons would honour and uphold her gifts.Johns, Noblewomen, Aristocracy and Power, p. 61.

Symptoms of tetrasomy 9p vary widely among affected individuals but typically include varying degrees of delayed growth, abnormal facial features and intellectual disability. Symptoms of the disorder are comparable to those of trisomy 9p.  Symptoms  The symptoms and prognosis of tetrasomy 9p are highly variable. The severity of the symptoms is largely determined by the size of the isochromosome, the specific regions of chromosome 9p that are duplicated, as well as the number and type of tissues that are affected in the mosaic form. Most patients exhibit some degree of intellectual disability, abnormal skeletal and muscular development, and abnormal facial structures. Cognitive symptoms range from slight learning disabilities to severe deficits in intellectual functioning. Due to abnormal development of the muscles, individuals often experience limited or delayed mobility. Atypical facial features are characteristic of the syndrome, including widely spaced eyes, a large nose, and unusually positioned ears. Additionally, patients often have extra skin around the neck and widely spaced nipples. A wide range of renal, digestive, cardiac, respiratory, and nervous system abnormalities have been observed. Though rare, a few cases of phenotypically normal individuals with tetrasomy 9p have been documented.  Causes  Tetrasomy 9p is caused by the presence of two additional copies of the short arm of chromosome 9. These two extra copies are found in the cell as an isochromosome, in addition to the normal 46 chromosomes. An isochromosome is formed when one of the arms of a chromosome is duplicated (in this case, the short arm), and the other is lost (in this case, the long arm), forming a chromosome with two identical arms. Varying amounts of the short arm may be incorporated into the isochromosome, and occasionally, small regions of DNA from the long arm are included as well. The disorder is almost never inherited; it most commonly arises through the improper distribution of chromosomes during the formation of eggs or sperm.  Mechanism  The tetrasomy is typically caused by the incorrect distribution of chromosomes during meiosis or mitosis, called nondisjunction. When cell division occurs normally, each daughter cell receives one short arm and one long arm of each chromosome. However, errors during this process may cause one daughter cell to receive two short arms of chromosome 9, while the other cell receives two long arms. The identical arms are subsequently connected via a centromere. In most cases, isochromosomes of 9p contain two centromeres, called a dicentric chromosome. The tetrasomy can also be formed independently of cell division. Double stranded breaks in the short arm of chromosome 9 may be repaired incorrectly, resulting in the formation of an isochromosome of 9p with a single centromere. This isochromosome can then be passed on during cell division. = Mosaicism = In most cases, affected individuals carry the tetrasomy in every cell in their bodies. However, some patients have the tetrasomy in some of their tissues but not in others; this is referred to as the mosaic form of the syndrome, and often results in less severe symptoms. Non-mosaic tetrasomy 9p is most often the result of abnormal chromosome separation during the formation of eggs or sperm. In contrast, the mosaic form is often a result of a nondisjunction event that occurs early in embryonic development. The type and number of tissues affected in the mosaic form is dependent upon the timing and location of the abnormal division within the developing embryo.  Diagnosis  After birth, galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) activity in the infant's blood is measured. GALT is regulated by a protein encoded on chromosome 9p, so irregular levels of GALT activity may indicate an underlying chromosomal abnormality. Abnormal results are followed by analysis of blood, skin, and inner cheek cells, typically via fluorescence in situ hybridization, which allows genetic counsellors to physically view the chromosomal composition of the cells. Analysis of more than one tissue type is necessary in order to determine if the tetrasomy is present in its mosaic form. If tetrasomy 9p is confirmed, chromosomal analysis of additional tissue types may be performed in order to estimate the ratio of affected cells in the body. Management  Prognosis  Though the outcome for individuals with either form of the tetrasomy is highly variable, mosaic individuals consistently experience a more favourable outcome than those with the non-mosaic form. Some affected infants die shortly after birth, particularly those with the non-mosaic tetrasomy. Many patients do not survive to reproductive age, while others are able to function relatively normally in a school or workplace setting. Early diagnosis and intervention has been shown to have a strong positive influence on the prognosis. = Recurrence risk = Since tetrasomy 9p is not usually inherited, the risk of a couple having a second child with the disorder is minimal. While patients often do not survive to reproductive age, those who do may or may not be fertile. The risk of a patient's child inheriting the disorder is largely dependent on the details of the individual's case.

She has a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Manitoba, and a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton. Before becoming a judge, Webster was a Crown attorney.Kevin Rollason, \\"View from the bench\\" [interview with Judith Webster], Winnipeg Free Press, 6 March 1994. Provincial Chief Justice Webster was appointed to the Manitoba Provincial Court in 1989 as a judge in Winnipeg. In 1993, she was named as the court's Chief Justice by provincial Justice Minister Rosemary Vodrey. Her appointment was generally recognized as a significant breakthrough for female judges in the province.Paul Samyn, \\"Webster named chief judge\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 16 December 1993. As Chief Justice, Webster served on the nominating committee for new provincial judges.Mike McIntyre, \\"Two defence lawyers named provincial court judges\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 27 July 2000, A6. She was criticized in 1994, after she transferred Judge Ron Meyers from family violence court to the rural circuit. Two days before the transfer, the Winnipeg Free Press published an interview with Meyers in which he said that he became motivated to specialize in spousal assault cases due to witnessing domestic abuse in his family as a child. Webster described the transfer as a routine reassignment, although she acknowledged that its timing appeared suspicious. Some speculated that Meyers was punished for stepping outside the traditionally detached role of the judiciary, and a number of women's groups called on Webster to reconsider her decision.Jim Carr, \\"Silence in the court\\" [editorial], Winnipeg Free Press, 10 June 1994; Ruth Teichrob, \\"Dedicated judge deserves better\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 6 January 1995. Webster had a sometimes fractious relationship with Vic Toews, who served as provincial Justice Minister from 1997 to 1999. In June 1999, she expressed her \\"profound disappointment\\" with what she described as \\"misleading and inaccurate\\" statements by Toews about the workload the judges.Paul McKie, \\"Top judge takes shot at justice boss\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 10 June 1999.

Toews refused to apologize, and said that official records backed his claims.David Kuxhaus, \\"Toews says stats back up remarks on courtrooms\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 25 June 1999, 3. In 2001, Webster assigned herself to oversee an inquest into the murders of two aboriginal sisters the previous February. The sisters had telephoned the police five times, including four calls for the 9-1-1 emergency service, but police cars were only sent after the first and last calls.Bruce Owen, \\"Chief judge to handle inquest into 911 murders\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 22 August 2001, A3; Kim Guttormson, \\"Judge reporting on police response to 911 murders\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 29 October 2002, A13. During this period, Webster announced that judges who preside over inquests would be allowed to set aside official work hours to write their reports. Provincial Justice Minister Gord Mackintosh approved of this decision, saying that it would reduce delays before the reports were released.Kim Guttormson, \\"Inquest judges get time to write\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 21 August 2001, A3. Provincial Justice Webster resigned as Chief Justice in October 2001, citing new provincial legislation that placed a term limit on her position. She was formally exempt from the legislation as the incumbent Chief Justice, but argued that she should abide by its spirit and resign after eight years in the position.Mike McIntyre, \\"Webster resigns as chief judge\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 25 October 2001, A9. She remained an active judge on the provincial court. Webster issued her report into the 911 murders in October 2002, and made several recommendations to restore confidence in the system.\\"What Judge Judith Webster recommended\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 30 October 2002, A3. One of her more noteworthy recommendations was that the province should review its zero tolerance legislation for situations of domestic abuse. The law required that police attending a domestic incident must charge the accused, even if the alleged victim did not wish to press charges or if there was no evidence of assault. Webster argued that this policy slowed police response to calls, and adversely affected the workload of other agencies. She also criticized 911's decision to identify all domestic calls as \\"Priority 1\\" after the murders, arguing that this actually created a slower response time to real emergencies.Kim Guttormson, \\"NDP urged to review abuse policy\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 30 October 2002, A3.

In Australia in the 1930s, men digging deep ditches tossed clay 10 to 15 feet above their heads using long handled shovels. Instead of separating, the sticky clay would sometimes stick to the shovel; the worker would hear a pop and feel a sudden pain between the shoulder blades, unable to continue working. The mechanism of injury is believed to be secondary to muscle pull and reflex with force transmission through the supraspinous ligaments. The tremendous force pulls on the spinous process producing an avulsion fracture. The fracture is diagnosed by plain film examination.

Thirunavukkarasu (11 January 1926 - 5 November 1926), popularly known as V.T. Arasu was a Singaporean journalist, civil servant, editor, author and Tamil enthusiast. Arasu was born in India on 11 January 1926 and moved to Singapore in 1951. He was educated at the University of Madras and obtained a degree there. With five years of experience in journalism in India, he joined Tamil Murasu in Singapore, the then leading Tamil daily, as its sub-editor. His pithy weekly and daily columns and catchy headlines attracted readers. In tandem with this portfolio, under the guidance of the community leader and editor G. Sarangapany, Arasu played a prominent role in the cultural and educational movements of the 1950s and 1960s. Notable among these activities were the management of Tamil schools, encouragement of creative writing, organization of the Tamizhar Tirunaal and the campaign to establish the Tamil department at the University. In the 1950s and 1960s, he played a significant role in developing the cultural and educational scene in various ways, such as encouraging creative writing. Arasu left Tamil Murasu in 1958 to join the civil service but returned in 1989 as its Chief Editor at the request of its owners, the G. Sarangapany family. When he returned to Tamil Murasu as its chief editor, that he would begin to shape what many now call his enduring legacy: transforming a failing community newspaper into a relevant and thriving publication. Arasu started by revamping the paper's content to make it more in-depth and local-based. He upgraded its design and computerised its production and plugged the distribution system into that of all the other language papers. By the time he stepped down in 2000, Tamil Murasu had quadrupled its circulation and become a profitable paper. More importantly, by making Tamil Murasu a part of the Singapore Press Holdings, he ensured the continuity and growth of the Tamil daily for the foreseeable future. He was instrumental in securing the paper's survival.  Arasu's Years in the Civil Service  Arasu joined the Civil Service as Information Officer (Tamil) at Ministry of Culture in 1958, when preparations were underway to make Tamil one of Singapore's four official languages. He played a crucial role in the production of various Tamil publications and current affairs publications. He went on to take charge of several publications, including The Mirror and the Singapore Yearbook. He also headed the Singapore Government's Media Relations Department during his time there. Subsequently, he served the Government in various capacities as editor of books at the Institute of national Language and Culture, editor of current affairs weeklies Kannottam ( Tamil) and the Mirror ( English) and several other publications of the Ministry of Culture. He co-authored and edited the best seller, Singapore, An Illustrated History 1941 - 1984. He was also one of the editors of Singapore Poetry -Asean Literatures. Arasu also served as head of the Singapore Government Media Relations Department and acted from time to time as Press Secretary to the Prime Minister.  Contributions to the Community  As Chairman of the Hindu Advisory Board (1974‚Äì76), Arasu persuaded the Hindu community to abandon the age-old practice of open cremation by firewood and opt for closed cremation by gas. He also persuaded the Government to provide special facilities at the crematorium to perform Hindu funeral rites and ceremonies. Arasu also served as member of the Hindu Endowments Board for a few terms. As President of the Tamil Language and Cultural Society, from 1984 to 1998, he invited young professionals to join the organization and encouraged them to play a greater role in the community. Tirukkural Vizha, which was his initiative, became a popular annual literary and family event. Under his guidance, the society produced four attractively illustrated Tamil story books for children from the ages 4 to 7. The Society's nationwide parental education programmes and its representation to the Parliamentary Select Committee on Group Representation Constituency are its other achievements. Arasu also served as a trustee of Singapore Indian Development Association (SINDA) from 1991 to 2000. He was the first chairman of the Tamil Language Council, a national organization set up to promote the wider usage of Tamil in Singapore. He also served as one of the Secretary-Generals of the International Association for Tamil Research since 1987 till the 2000s. While Arasu's involvement with Indian community issues and promotion of Tamil extended throughout the last 50 years of his life, he also devoted considerable time and effort on matters of common interest to all Singaporeans. His work at the Preservation of Monuments Board (1975-1992) particularly as chairman of the Board's Research and Publicity Committee from 1979 is one example. He had also served as member of the National Archives and Oral History Board. and several other committees relating to arts and literature and social issues. The Singapore government conferred on Arasu the Efficiency Medal in 1985 and the Public Service Medallion (PBM) in 1999. The National University of Singapore's Centre for the Arts honoured him for his services at the conference on ‚ÄúTamil in the International Arena.‚Äù in January 2002 Arasu died at the age of 83, on 4.11.2008 from complications linked to pancreatic cancer. He is survived by his wife, son and three grand children.

A symptom can be subjective or objective. Tiredness is a subjective symptom whereas cough or fever are objective symptoms. In contrast to a symptom, a sign is a clue to a disease elicited by an examiner or a doctor. For example, paresthesia is a symptom (only the person experiencing it can directly observe their own tingling feeling), whereas erythema is a sign (anyone can confirm that the skin is redder than usual). Symptoms and signs are often nonspecific, but often combinations of them are at least suggestive of certain diagnoses, helping to narrow down what may be wrong. In other cases they are specific even to the point of being pathognomonic. The term is sometimes also applied to physiological states outside the context of disease, as for example when referring to \\"symptoms of pregnancy\\". Many people use the term sign and symptom interchangeably. Types Symptoms may be briefly acute or a more prolonged but acute or chronic, relapsing or remitting. Asymptomatic conditions also exist (e.g. subclinical infections and silent diseases like sometimes, high blood pressure). Constitutional or general symptoms are those related to the systemic effects of a disease (e.g., fever, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss). They affect the entire body rather than a specific organ or location. The terms \\"chief complaint\\", \\"presenting symptom\\", \\"iatrotropic symptom\\", or \\"presenting complaint\\" are used to describe the initial concern which brings a patient to a doctor. The symptom that ultimately leads to a diagnosis is called a \\"cardinal symptom\\". =Non-specific symptoms= Non-specific symptoms are self-reported symptoms that do not indicate a specific disease process or involve an isolated body system. For example, fatigue is a feature of many acute and chronic medical conditions, which may or may not be mental, and may be either a primary or secondary symptom. Fatigue is also a normal, healthy condition when experienced after exertion or at the end of a day. =Positive and negative = Symptoms can be divided into positive and negative. Positive symptoms are the ones observed in persons with a disease or other abnormal condition, but normally not observed in average healthy persons. A negative symptom is absence of a function or feeling normally present in an average person. For example, in describing mental disorders, Encyclopedia of Mental Disorders: negative symptom especially schizophrenia, positive and negative symptoms are as follows. Positive symptoms Positive symptoms are symptoms that are present in the disorder and are not normally experienced by most individuals. It reflects an excess or distortion of normal functions (i.e., experiences and behaviors that have been added to a person's normal way of functioning).Understanding Psychosis , Mental Health Illness of Australia. Examples are hallucinations, delusions, and bizarre behavior. For somatic sensory symptoms, the positive ones are tingling, itching and various sensations described as pricking, bandlike, lightning-like shooting feelings (lancinations), aching, knifelike, twisting, drawing, pulling, tightening, burning, searing, electrical, or raw feelings. The terms used to describe positive sensory symptoms are paresthesia and dysesthesia. Negative symptoms Negative symptoms are functions that are normally found in healthy persons, but that are diminished or not present in affected persons. Thus, it is something that has disappeared from a person's normal way of functioning. Examples are social withdrawal, apathy, inability to experience pleasure and defects in attention control. The negative sensory symptoms are diminished or missing sensations. The most common one is numbness. The following terms are used for negative symptoms. Hypoesthesia (hypesthesia) is a partial loss of sensitivity to moderate stimuli, such as pressure, touch, warmness, coldness, etc. Anesthesia is the complete loss of sensitivity to stronger stimuli, such as pinprick. Hypalgesia (analgesia) is loss of sensation to painful stimuli.Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 19th edition, Chapter 31: Numbness, Tingling, and Sensory Loss Possible causes Some symptoms occur in a wide range of disease processes, whereas other symptoms are fairly specific for a narrow range of illnesses. For example, a sudden loss of sight in one eye has a significantly smaller number of possible causes than nausea does. Some symptoms can be misleading to the patient or the medical practitioner caring for them. For example, inflammation of the gallbladder often gives rise to pain in the right shoulder, which may understandably lead the patient to attribute the pain to a non-abdominal cause such as muscle strain. Symptom versus sign A medical sign has the potential to be objectively observed by someone other than the patient, whereas a symptom does not. There is a correlation between this difference and the difference between the medical history and the physical examination. Symptoms belong only to the history, whereas signs can often belong to both. Clinical signs such as rash and muscle tremors are objectively observable both by the patient and by anyone else. Some signs belong only to the physical examination, because it takes medical expertise to uncover them. (For example, laboratory signs such as hypocalcaemia or neutropenia require blood tests to find.) A sign observed by the patient last week but now gone (such as a resolved rash) was a sign, but it belongs to the medical history, not the physical examination, because the physician cannot independently verify it today. Symptomatology Symptomatology (also called semiology) is a branch of medicine dealing with symptoms. Also this study deals with the signs and indications of a disease.

However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled in the case Fox et al. v. Federal Communications Commission (06-1760) that the FCC cannot punish broadcast stations for such incidents. On the week of March 17, 2008, the Supreme Court announced that it would hear this case. The Supreme Court heard arguments from the case on November 4, 2008, which was also Election Day. Chief Justice John G. Roberts and Associate Justice Antonin Scalia expressed support for the FCC. Supreme Court decision The Supreme Court ruled in a 5-4 decision on April 28, 2009 that the Federal Communications Commission had not acted arbitrarily when it changed a long- standing policy and implemented a new ban on even \\"fleeting expletives\\" from the airwaves. The Court explicitly declined to decide whether the new rule is constitutional, and sent that issue back to the lower courts for their review. Justice Antonin Scalia, in the majority opinion, wrote: \\"The FCC‚Äôs new policy and its order finding the broadcasts at issue actionably indecent were neither arbitrary nor capricious.\\" In the dissenting opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens claimed that this decision was hypocritical given the presence of television commercials for products treating impotence or constipation. First Amendment question In its decision, \\"the court did not definitively settle the First Amendment implications of allowing a federal agency to censor broadcasts,\\"Suderman, Peter (April 5, 2010) The FCC Doesn't Need to Be, Reason and left that issue for the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. However, Justice Clarence Thomas's separate opinion openly stated his willingness to overturn Federal Communications Commission v. Pacifica Foundation and Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. Federal Communications Commission, the two cases on which all FCC authority rest, even as he joined the majority on procedural grounds. Subsequent history Upon remand, the Second Circuit addressed the actual Constitutionality of the fleeting expletive rules, striking it down in July 2010.Second Circuit opinion against FCC on constitutional grounds The FCC re- appealed the case. On June 21, 2012, the Court decided the re-appeal narrowly, striking down the fines as unconstitutionally vague, but upholding the authority of the FCC to act in the interests of the general public when licensing broadcast spectrums to enforce decency standards, so long as they are not vague, without violating the First Amendment.

In 1989 the marsh was designated a protected area in order to preserve the natural habitat of rare species of waterfowl and 40 species of higher plants.  Description  The marsh is situated in the westernmost reaches of the Sofia Valley, 5 km north-west of the town of Slivnitsa and 1 km north of the village of Aldomirovtsi near European route E80. It is located not far from the Serbian border (28 km), and 30 km from capital city Sofia. The Aldomirovtsi Marsh covers an area of 129.4 ha. Near the marsh are the localities Meka Crev and Tri Ushi-\\\\- a scene of the bloody battle of Slivnitsa in November 1885 during the Serbo-Bulgarian War when the Bulgarians decisively defeated a Serbian invasion. Little bittern in the Aldomirovtsi Marsh The marsh used to be a popular destination for anglers due to the large specimen of northern pike, common carp and the introduced grass carp. The record for a grass carp fished by angle was set there in 1982 -\\\\- 22.7 kg. The Aldomirovtsi Marsh is home to many nesting and wintering bird species, including ruff, great crested grebe, little grebe, black-necked grebe, white stork, water rail, little gull, common redshank, little egret, little bittern, short-toed snake eagle, etc.  Drying problems and recovery  The marsh has a variable water regime and irregular shape. Its area increases in spring and almost dries in summer and autumn. The marsh had dried completely twice, in 1991 and 2012. In May 2012, immediately after the 2012 Pernik earthquake, the marsh began to rapidly dry up until it disappeared completely in July 2013. The cause was a shift of the earth layers of the local karst rocks in the aftermath of the earthquake. In 2014 experts from Slivnitsa municipality and environmentalists discovered that the water of the marsh was draining in a ponor. The ponor was sealed with clay and concrete and since the autumn of 2014 the Aldomirovtsi Marsh has recovered.

The natural remanent magnetization of an igneous rock can be altered by this process. This is generally an unwanted component and some form of stepwise demagnetization must be used to remove it.  Origin  Viscous remanent magnetization is the result of jumps between magnetic states driven by thermal fluctuations. In the simplest case, there is a single characteristic time called the thermal relaxation time. If the starting magnetization is and the magnetization in equilibrium is , the magnetization after a time is : M(t) = M_0 + \\\\left(M_\\\\text{eq}-M_0\\\\right)\\\\exp(-t/\\\\tau). If is a natural remanent magnetization (NRM) acquired in the Earth's field at one time, and is the equilibrium magnetization in a different field at some later time, the change in remanence is the VRM. The above equation is applicable to the simplest single domain magnets, those described by the Stoner‚ÄìWohlfarth model. The relaxation time depends on factors such as the size of the magnet and its magnetic anisotropy. Rocks have collections of magnetic minerals with varying size and anisotropy, and therefore a broad spectrum of relaxation times. The magnetization tends to have a logarithmic dependence on time, so the rate of change is often represented by a viscosity coefficient : S = \\\\frac{\\\\partial M}{\\\\partial \\\\log t}.  Significance for paleomagnetism  Paleomagnetists are interested in the primary natural remanent magnetization (NRM) in a rock, acquired when the rock was originally formed. Viscous remanent magnetization is regarded as noise. Any component of the NRM that is in the direction of the present Earth's field is suspect because it may have been acquired since the last geomagnetic reversal. VRM is often removed by the first steps in a stepwise thermal demagnetization of the NRM. VRM may also be acquired in the laboratory while measuring the NRM. To avoid this, paleomagnetists make their measurements in a magnetically shielded environment. Often the magnetometer is housed in a room with walls made of mu-metal.

In business affairs he was frequently referred to in contemporary reports and newspapers as Delmar; however, many of his published works appeared under the name of del Mar. He sometimes appended the letters C.E. and/or M.E. (respectively \\"Civil Engineer\\" and \\"Mining Engineer\\") to his name. He was the first Director of the Bureau of Statistics at the U.S. Treasury Department from 1866‚Äì69.The US Treasury Department's Bureau of Statistics (1866‚Äì1903) should not be confused with the Bureau of Statistics of the US State Department (1874‚Äì1897). The two were eventually merged in 1903 under the Department of Commerce and Labor. See Del Mar was a rigorous historian who made important contributions to the history of money. During the mid-1890s, he was distinctly hostile to a central monetary role for gold as commodity money, championing the cause of silver and its re- monetization as a prerogative of the state. He believed strongly in the legal function of money. Del Mar dedicated much of his free time to original research in the great libraries and coin collections of Europe on the history of monetary systems and finance. Biography Alexander del Mar, of Jewish- Spanish descent, was born in New York City, August 9, 1836, as oldest son of Jacob and Belvidere Alexander del Mar. He lived for a short period of time in the United Kingdom with his uncle Emanuel del Mar and there received an education in humanities from a private tutor, Arthur Helps (later knighted, becoming Sir Arthur Helps). He was instructed in history, literature, law, and political economy. After graduating from New York University as a civil engineer, he was educated as a mining engineer in Spain at the Madrid School of Mines. Aged 18, he returned to the U.S. in 1854 to become the financial editor of the short-lived Daily American Times. He moved to Hunt's Merchant's Magazine in 1860, and in 1863 co-founded and edited with Simon Stern the prestigious quarterly New York Social Science Review (first published in January 1865). He was also involved with the Commercial and Financial Chronicle, founded in 1865 by William Dana. In 1865, Del Mar, a notorious Free Trader, helped establish the first Free Trade organization in the United States, the American Free Trade League (AFTL), alongside Horace White, William Lloyd Garrison, and Ralph Waldo Emerson, among others. In 1866 Del Mar was appointed as the first Director of US Treasury Department's Bureau of Statistics (now part of the Bureau of Economic Analysis). At the time the bureau was a board of trade, with executive functions, among others the supervision of the commissioners of mines, commerce, immigration, etc. Del Mar pioneered the use of a modern and scientific approach to statistics. He remained director until 1869, overseeing numerous reports.del Mar, Alexander.

He was forced to resign by his superior, David Ames Wells, and was replaced by Francis Amasa Walker. Both were ardent supporters of specie money and opposed to Del Mar's convictions of fiat money. In 1866 he was appointed the American delegate to the International Monetary Congress which met in Turin, Italy. During the close-fought 1868 presidential election he was nominated for Secretary of the Treasury under Horatio Seymour's Democratic ticket. In 1869 he purchased the Washington-based National Intelligencer, merged it with the Washington Express and moved its offices to New York in January 1870. It later became the New York City and National Intelligencer which he edited and published until 1872. He ran under Horace Greeley's ticket for Secretary of the Treasury during the 1872 United States presidential election. The coalition between the Democrats and Greeley's Liberal Republican Party was soundly defeated, and the LRP ceased to exist shortly after. In the same year Del Mar represented the United States at the international monetary congress in St. Petersburg, Russia. In 1877 Del Mar was appointed mining commissioner to the U.S. Monetary Commission. This commission was created by Congress in 1876 when it discovered the subterfuge that led to the Panic of 1873. It was charged to investigate: Although the commission reported unfavourably on the switch to the de facto gold standard and recommended a return to silver, gold's status as a reserve currency was to remain unchallenged until the 1930s. In 1878, Del Mar was appointed as clerk to the United States House Committee on Expenditures in the Navy Department. In 1878, Del Mar also wrote a series of letters under the Chinese pseudonym \\"Kwang Chang Ling\\" in the San Francisco Argonaut journal. The letters warned Californians, and the broader United States, that China had the potential to rise as an economic giant. Del Mar, as Kwang Chang Ling, argued that excluding cheap Chinese labor to protect American wages and lessen unemployment would do little to protect American laborers in the long term, for China's labor force would continue to pose a global economic threat despite national policies. Del Mar's writings are the first known attempt to use Free Trade rhetoric as a solution to the \\"Chinese Question\\" and to counter anti-Chinese attitudes that led to the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act. In 1879 he published his History of the Precious Metals, the labor of twenty-two years of research during his own free time. From 1880 onwards he mainly devoted his professional career to writing. In 1881, he published A History of Money in Ancient States, in 1885 Money and Civilization, in 1889 The Science of Money, in 1895, A History of Monetary Systems in Modern States, in 1899 A History of Monetary Crimes, in 1900 A History of Money in America, in 1903 A History of Monetary Systems of France. Del Mar also published several archaeological treatises of great interest. Del Mar was the New York state chairman of the Silver Party, and spoke at its 1896 Chicago meeting in support of William Jennings Bryan. He was editor-in-chief of the American Banker, 1905‚Äì1906. Upon his death, he donated his private library of 15,000 volumes to the American Bankers Association. Alexander del Mar died in 1926 at the age of ninety. Family life With his wife, the former Emily Joseph (the daughter of Joseph L. Joseph), he had eleven children, seven that survived to adulthood, including five sons, Walter, Eugene, Harry, Algernon, and William ; and two daughters, Francesca Paloma del Mar, who trained as an artist., and Maud (Blackwelder) del Mar.

History They formed in the summer of 1977 at St. Augustine's High School in Edinburgh and performed their first gig in December of that year at St. Margaret's Church Hall in Davidson's Mains, a suburb of Edinburgh. The following year, they sent a demo tape of rehearsals to Bruce Findlay of Bruce's Records Shop, which led to signing a recording contract with Zoom Records in Edinburgh in 1978. The band's first single was \\"Some Other Guy\\" backed with \\"Rock & Roll Ain't Dead\\" (August 1978). They were crowned Young Band of the Year by Southern Television on Saturday Banana in December 1978. \\"I Can't Get Over You\\" b/w \\"Answers\\" followed in January 1979. The band subsequently left school in June 1980 and came to the attention of Paul Weller with \\"Get Away From it All\\", a track that was never officially released. The band supported The Jam at the Edinburgh Playhouse Theatre on the first of many occasions in October 1980, and signed to Weller's fledgling Respond Records in 1981. The Questions contributed three songs to Respond's Love the Reason album - \\"Work and Play\\", \\"Building on a Strong Foundation\\" and \\"Give It Up Girl\\". They also contributed to the track \\"Mama Never Told Me\\" with Tracie Young as Tracie & The Questions. Many tours, TV appearances and singles followed, including \\"Work and Play\\", \\"Tear Soup\\" and \\"Price You Pay\\". In 1983, band members Paul Barry and John Robinson penned the Top 10 hit \\"The House That Jack Built\\" for fellow Respond Records label mate Tracie Young. They would go on to write three additional songs - \\"I Can't Hold on Till Summer\\", \\"Moving Together\\" and \\"What Did I Hear You Say\\" - for Young's debut LP, Far From the Hurting Kind. In 1984, Belief, the band's only full-length album was finally released. \\"Tuesday Sunshine\\" and \\"A Month of Sundays\\" were released as singles. The album did not sell well, and the band played its final concert on 30 November 1984, at the 100 Club in Oxford Street, London. After a twelve- year wait, Belief was issued on CD by the Japanese label Trattoria Records. The re-issue included the album's original eleven songs, plus eight previously unreleased tracks.

Taurolidine‚Äôs putative mechanism of action is based on a chemical reaction. During the metabolism of taurolidine to taurinamide and ultimately taurine and water, methylol groups are liberated that chemically react with the mureins in the bacterial cell wall and with the amino and hydroxyl groups of endotoxins and exotoxins. This results in denaturing of the complex polysaccharide and lipopolysaccharide components of the bacterial cell wall and of the endotoxin and in the inactivation of susceptible exotoxins.  Medical uses  Taurolidine is an antimicrobial agent used in an effort to prevent catheter infections. It however is not approved for this use in the United States as of 2011. * Catheter lock solution in home parenteral nutrition (HPN) or total parenteral nutrition (TPN): catheter-related blood stream infections (CRBSI) remains the most common serious complication associated with long-term parenteral nutrition. The use of taurolidine as a catheter lock solution shows a reduction of CRBSI. The overall quality of the evidence however is not strong enough to justify routine use. * Catheter lock solution: Taurolidine decreases the adherence of bacteria and fungi to host cells by destructing the fimbriae and flagella and thus prevent the biofilm formation. Taurolidine is the active ingredient of antimicrobial catheter lock solutions for the prevention and treatment of catheter related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) and is suitable for use in all catheter based vascular access devices. Bacterial resistance against taurolidine has never been observed in various studies. * The use of a taurolidine lock solution may decrease the risk of catheter infection in children with cancer but the evidence is tentative.  Side effects  No systemic side effects have been identified. The safety of taurolidine has also been confirmed in clinical studies with long-term intravenous administration of high doses (up to 20 grams daily). In the body, taurolidine is metabolized rapidly via the metabolites taurultam and methylol taurinamide, which also have a bactericidal action, to taurine, an endogenous aminosulphonic acid, carbon dioxide and water. Therefore, no toxic effects are known or expected in the event of accidental injection. Burning sensation while instilling, numbness, erythema, facial flushing, headache, epistaxis, and nausea have been reported. = Toxicology = Taurolidine has a relatively low acute and subacute toxicity. Intravenous injection of 5 grams taurolidine into humans over 0.5‚Äì2 hours produce only burning sensation while instilling, numbness, and erythema at the injection sites. For treatment of peritonitis, taurolidine was administered by peritoneal lavage, intraperitoneal instillation or intravenous infusion, or by a combination thereof. The total daily dose ranged widely from 0.5 to 50 g. The total cumulative dose ranged from 0.5 to 721 g. In those patients who received intravenous taurolidine, the daily intravenous dose was usually 15 to 30 g but several patients received up to 40 g/day. Total daily doses of up to 40 g and total cumulative doses exceeding 300 g were safe and well tolerated.  Pharmacology  * Metabolism: Taurolidine and taurultam are quickly metabolized to taurinamide, taurine, carbon dioxide and water. Taurolidine exists in equilibrium with taurultam and N-methylol- taurultam in aqueous solution. *Pharmacokinetic (elimination): The half-life of the terminal elimination phase of taurultam is about 1.5 hours, and of the taurinamide metabolite about 6 hours. 25% of the taurolidine dose applied is renally eliminated as taurinamide and/or taurine. = Mechanism of action = Following administration of taurolidine, the antimicrobial and antiendotoxin activity of the taurolidine molecule is conferred by the release of three active methylol (hydroxymethyl) groups as taurolidine is rapidly metabolized by hydrolysis via methylol taurultam to methylol taurinamide and taurine. These labile N-methylol derivatives of taurultam and taurinamide react with the bacterial cell-wall resulting in lysis of the bacteria, and by inter- and intramolecular cross-linking of the lipopolysaccharide-protein complex, neutralization of the bacterial endotoxins which is enhanced by enzymatic activation. This mechanism of action is accelerated and maximised when taurolidine is pre-warmed to . Microbes are killed and the resulting toxins are inactivated; the destruction time in vitro is 30 minutes. The chemical mode of action of taurolidine via its reactive methylol groups confers greater potency in vivo than indicated by in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values, and also appears to preclude susceptibility to resistance mechanisms. Taurolidine binding to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) prevents microbial adherence to host epithelial cells, thereby prevents microbial invasion of uninfected host cells. Although the mechanism underlying its antineoplastic activity has not been fully elucidated, it may be related to this agent's anti-adherence property. Taurolidine has been shown to block interleukin 1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). In addition, taurolidine also promotes apoptosis by inducing various apoptotic factors and suppresses the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a protein that plays an important role in angiogenesis. Taurolidine is highly active against the common infecting pathogens associated with peritonitis and catheter sepsis, this activity extends across a wide-spectrum of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and fungi (with no diminution of effect in the presence of biological fluids, e.g. blood, serum, pus). *Gram-positive bacteria (MIC of 1‚Äì2 mg/mL): Staphylococcus (including multiple-antibiotic resistant coagulase negative strains, methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Streptococcus, Enterococcus. *Gram- negative bacteria (MIC of 0.5‚Äì5 mg/mL): Aerobacter species, Citrobacter species, Enterobacter species, Escherichia coli, Proteus species (indole negative), Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas species (including P. aeruginosa), Salmonella species, Serratia marcescans, Klebsiella species. *Anaerobes (MIC 0.03‚Äì0.3 mg/mL): Bacteroides species (including B. fragilis), Fusobacteria, Clostridium species, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. * Fungi (MIC 0.3‚Äì5 mg/mL): Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus species, Trichophyton rubrum, Epidermophyton floccosum, Pityrosporum ovale. Chemical properties The chemical name for taurolidine is 4,4'-Methylene- bis(1,2,4-thiadiazinane)-1,1,1‚Äô,1'-tetraoxide. It is a white to off white odourless crystalline powder. It is practically insoluble in chloroform, slightly soluble in boiling acetone, ethanol, methanol, and ethyl acetate, sparingly soluble in water 8 at 20¬∞ and ethyl alcohol, soluble in dilute hydrochloric acid, and dilute sodium hydroxide, and freely soluble in N,N-dimethylformamide (at 60 ¬∞C).  History  Taurolidine was first synthesized in the laboratories of Geistlich Pharma AG, Switzerland in 1972. Clinical trials begun in 1975 in patients with severe peritonitis.  Research  Taurolidine demonstrates some anti-tumor properties, with positive results seen in early-stage clinical investigations using the drug to treat gastrointestinal malignancies and tumors of the central nervous system. More recently, it has been found to exert antineoplastic activity. Taurolidine induces cancer cell death through a variety of mechanisms. Even now, all the antineoplastic pathways it employs are not completely elucidated. It has been shown to enhance apoptosis, inhibit angiogenesis, reduce tumor adherence, downregulate pro-inflammatory cytokine release, and stimulate anticancer immune regulation following surgical trauma. Apoptosis is activated through both a mitochondrial cytochrome-c-dependent mechanism and an extrinsic direct pathway. A lot of in vitro and animal data support taurolidine's tumoricidal action. Taurolidine has been used as an antimicrobial agent in the clinical setting since the 1970s and thus far appears nontoxic. The nontoxic nature of taurolidine makes it a favorable option compared with current chemotherapeutic regimens. Few published clinical studies exist evaluating the role of taurolidine as a chemotherapeutic agent. The literature lacks a gold-standard level 1 randomized clinical trial to evaluate taurolidine's potential antineoplastic benefits. However, these trials are currently underway. Such randomized control studies are vital to clarify the role of taurolidine in modern cancer treatment.

She was quickly and quietly released. Her case created an outrage among the public, made worse by the fact that the Home Secretary, Reginald McKenna, denied that she had been force fed and that her illness was actually caused by her hunger strike. However, Home Office papers show that she was force fed on 23 February 1913.Home Office Papers, The National Archives A letter to The Times in 1913, from Victor Horsley, a leading surgeon, claimed \\"...the Home Secretary's attempted denial that Miss Lenton was nearly killed by the forcible feeding is worthless...she was tied into a chair and her head dragged backward across the back of the chair by her hair. The tube was forced through the nose twice . . . after the second introduction when the food was poured in, it caused violent choking.\\" To avoid more such political embarrassment, the Government rushed through its 'Cat and Mouse Act' in April 1913, which stated that hunger- striking suffragette 'mice' could be released on temporary licence to recover their health, when the security forces could re-arrest them. Lenton and Harry Johnson (left) in the dock at Leeds Assizes in June 1913 In June 1913 Lenton was arrested in Doncaster and charged as 'May Dennis' with being on the premises of an unoccupied house which had been set on fire. She was released from Armley Prison in Leeds after several days; on this occasion there had been no attempt to force feed her. Her accomplice in the arson attack was an 18-year-old local journalist called Harry Johnson, who was sentenced to 12 months with hard labour in Wakefield Prison. In July 1913 the police in Leeds were searching for Lenton when an elaborate plot was hatched, while she way staying with Frank Rutter, Director of the Leeds Art Gallery,Grace Newton, 'The fascinating tale of the suburban Leeds home that sheltered suffragettes on the run' in The Yorkshire Post (UK newspaper), 5 February 2018 to enable her to escape in a delivery van, driven by Leonora Cohen dressed as a baker's man while Lenton swapped places with Nora Duval dressed as an errand boy reading a comic and eating an apple. Taxis took her to Harrogate, then Scarborough, from where she escaped to France in a private yacht. The Criminal Record Office issued a surveillance photograph of her (see above right) taken secretly in the exercise yard of Holloway Prison, in the accompanying details of which she is described as being 5 feet 2 inches tall with brown eyes and hair. Lenton later stated, \\"Whenever I was out of prison my object was to burn two buildings a week‚Ä¶ The object was to create an absolutely impossible condition of affairs in the country, to prove it was impossible to govern without the consent of the governed\\". She was arrested in October 1913 while collecting a bicycle from the left luggage office at Paddington Station,'The Times' 8 October 1913 and while on remand went on a hunger strike and a thirst strike, for which she was again forcibly fed. Her physical health again being seriously affected by this treatment, she was released on licence for 5 days into the care of a Mrs Diplock of London, but again absconded. Lenton was rearrested on 22 December 1913, on a charge of setting fire to a house in Cheltenham. She was recognised from her police surveillance photograph, and imprisoned, when she commenced another hunger and thirst strike, being released at 11 a.m. into the care of Mrs Impey of Birmingham, from whose home she absconded yet again, remaining at large until early May 1914 when she was rearrested at Birkenhead. Held on remand and awaiting trial at the Leeds Assizes for the arson committed at Doncaster, she again went on hunger and thirst strike until she was released on 12 May 1914. Because of the frequency of her escapes Lenton became known as the \\"tiny, wily, elusive Pimpernel\\".'The Times' obituary, 4 November 1972 She received a Hunger Strike Medal 'for Valour' from the WSPU. The Women's Social and Political Union suspended their militant campaign in 1914 at the outbreak of World War I to focus on the war effort. During this time women worked in jobs traditionally done by men, proving they could do them just as well and silencing one of the last arguments against women's suffrage. After the war the Representation of the People Act 1918 was passed awarding the vote to women householders, or the wives of householders, aged 30 and over. Lenton was unimpressed by this concession, later relating in a BBC documentary, \\"Personally I didn't vote for a very long time because I hadn't either a husband or furniture, although I was over 30.\\"The Listener, 8 February 1968 (She turned 30 in 1921.

She was a speaker for the Save the Children Fund, and from 1924 to 1933 was a speaker and travel organiser for the Women's Freedom League, as well as the editor of the League's 'Bulletin' for over 11 years. After working in Scotland in animal welfare Lenton became the financial secretary of the National Union of Women Teachers until 1953. In 1955 she appeared with other former Suffragettes in a BBC News broadcast beside the statue of Mrs Pankhurst to mark the 37th anniversary of women getting the vote.'Suffragettes Anniversary' ‚Äì BBC Television Service ‚Äì 5 February 1955 She was again filmed in 1959 when she discussed the Cat and Mouse Act.

She confessed during the interview that the only one of his books she had read since meeting him was Lady Chatterley's Lover, stating \\"it must have been an expurgated edition, because I don't remember anything special about it\\". In 1970, as Treasurer of the Suffragette Fellowship, Lenton unveiled a memorial in Christchurch Gardens, Westminster, dedicated to all the women who had fought to get the vote.

The work, between 6,000‚Äì7,000 Chinese characters, discusses techniques of political lobbying based in Taoist thinking. There has been much speculation about the identity of the writer of Guiguzi, the origin of his name (literally 'The Sage of Ghost Valley') and the authenticity of the work as a whole. While there has been no final outcome to this discussion, Chinese scholars believe that the compilation reflects a genuine corpus of Warring States period writings on political lobbying. Most writers doubt the assertion that the Guiguzi was written by a single personality, Guigu Xiansheng (), who was said in the Records of the Grand Historian to have been the teacher of the late Warring States political lobbyists Su Qin and Zhang Yi. A tradition that Guigu Xiansheng was the teacher of renowned Warring States generals Sun Bin and Pang Juan is also considered to be a late confabulation. The association of the name Wang Xu () is not generally held to be supported. There is no material in the text to support the view held by some that Guiguzi is a book on military tactics. The contents of the Guiguzi text cover the relationship between lobbying techniques and the theory of yin and yang, techniques of political evaluation of the state, evaluation of political relationships between state leaders and ministers, psychological profiling of lobbying targets and rhetorical devices.

Life Thomas was the eldest son of Evan Thomas, from Lampeter, south Wales. After education in Mumbles, Swansea and at St David's College, Lampeter, Thomas went to Jesus College, Oxford in 1847, obtaining a third- class Bachelor of Arts degree in Literae Humaniores in 1851. He was ordained deacon in 1852 by the Bishop of Oxford, Samuel Wilberforce, and ordained priest the following year by the Bishop of Bangor, Christopher Bethell. His first positions were as curate of Denio and Llanor near Pwllheli, Gwynedd (1853) and chaplain of Tremadog near Porthmadog (1854-1855). He then became perpetual curate of Penmachno before his appointment as vicar of Mynydd Llandegai, near Bangor in 1860, where he remained for 34 years. During this time, he was an important figure in the foundation of the Welsh church in Patagonia, where there was a Welsh settlement, with Hugh Davies, the first chaplain, being one of his parishioners. He spent a year as vicar of Braunston, Northamptonshire before moving to Holyhead, Anglesey in 1895 as vicar. He was also appointed a canon of Bangor.

The primary goals of each enterprise board were designed to stimulate and promote local enterprise culture and entrepreneurship and to assist new business start ups, particularly through the provision of financial assistance. The Irish economy has always relied heavily on its exports and in that respect, the County & City Enterprise Boards were intended to support those companies with a potential export capacity. Once a company reached its export potential, Enterprise Ireland would incubate that company going forward. Ireland also depends on its indigenous small and medium enterprises, (SMEs) for internal economic growth. These companies were the primary target for CEB support.

The CEBs could support individuals, firms and community groups provided that the proposed projects had the capacity to achieve commercial viability.

Overview  The storm underwent rapid cyclogenesis just before travelling inland. The circulation was so small in area that the isobars were compacted tightly, thanks to a strong ridge of high pressure to the south, resulting in sustained winds of 50 mph with gusts above 70 mph. The South Valley Surprise was second only to the Columbus Day Storm in terms of wind speed for the southern Willamette Valley. The \\"surprise\\" was how rapidly the storm organized and matured, and its unanticipated strength. Thus, the public had no idea of the impending storm. The storm was able to tap into the jet stream and aim it towards the surface the phenomenon known as \\"Jet stream enhancement\\", which usually occurs in the unstable air found in a cold front in a mid latitude cyclone. The result was extensive damage to structures both directly and indirectly from falling trees and debris.

Early life  Neil Lawson Baker was born in Watford. He attended Merchant Taylors' School in Northwood, Middlesex and then went on to Guy's Hospital in London where he qualified as a dental surgeon. Wishing to further his career, he followed on by studying medicine and qualified as a doctor in 1969 at St George's Hospital at Hyde Park Corner in the heart of London's West End (the building is now the Lanesborough Hotel).Lawson Baker then went on to practise at The 31 Wilton Place Practice where he became senior partner and continued as a leading Dental Surgeon for a further 40 years, specialising in high quality restorative dentistry. He also founded The Oral Hygiene Centre at No1 Devonshire Place in the heart of London's Harley Street area. This was the first truly preventive dental practice of its type founded in 1978 and it certainly helped to pioneer preventive dentistry. He retired from practice at the age of 70 years ‚Äì calling it \\"a career change\\" ‚Äì into the art world. In his 80th year he enjoys his home and family in West Sussex and writes Children's Stories about the fantasy life of a Vet in Bowdleflodeland.  Artistic career  His first artistic expression came while at school where he made a lot of pottery, little of which survives. Baker used his medical and dentistry knowledge to fund his passion for art and travelled the world visiting galleries and acquiring contemporary art for his home in London. He developed a keen eye and formed a great interest, initially in the sculpture of Rodin and his school of followers, later moving to more contemporary schools. His artistic passion was helped by meeting Adrien Maeght, the famous French art gallery and museum owner, who organised the Paris ‚Äì Nice vintage car rally in 1970 (Baker was a keen competitions driver in vintage cars). Invitations to visit the Galerie Maeght in Rue du Bac in Paris and later the Fondation Maeght in Saint-Paul de Vence to see paintings, sculpture and lithography by Picasso, Mir√≥, L√©ger, Calder, Arp and many others, had a huge influence on what was to come. After years of viewing and collecting, in 1987, during his recovery from a serious illness, Baker began to model sculptures as recuperative therapy. His surgeon's eye‚Äìhand skills were helped by a lesson from Kees Verkade, the well- known Dutch sculptor. Kees showed Baker how to model in wax. Baker soon found himself meeting Eric Gibbard at the Burleighfield Foundry who had done work for the Tate Gallery, Elizabeth Frink, Philip Jackson, and Oscar Nemon, indeed Eric cast every bronze of Barbara Hepworth's after 1952. Eric became Baker's friend and mentor and took him to Paris to meet Charles Pinellis at the famous Susse-Fondeur foundry in Arcueil. As a result, he soon produced many bronze sculptures both in the UK and France and began selling to private collectors and then to corporate clients and governments. His works can now be found in public places both in the UK and abroad. His sculptures may be seen in the entrance to the offices of the Houses of Parliament at Westminster; at British Gas Headquarters in Reading and Loughborough; in The London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange; near Albert Bridge at Sterling House on the River Thames; at the National Stadium in Kuala Lumpur; at Beirut University College in Lebanon and many other important sites. A recent work was commissioned by Seaward Properties and installed in Church Square in East Street Chichester, West Sussex. It is a bronze Mother and Child called 'Nurture' Baker was also responsible for the sculpture unveiled by Queen Elizabeth II with President Mitterrand when they opened the Channel Tunnel in May 1994. Late in 2003 Baker began to use colour and work on two dimensional pieces for the first time. His contemporary works of art are mostly abstract and vibrant and he is prolific in his output. Baker uses Cont√©, watercolour and acrylic interchangeably. Many of the works are reminiscent of the art of the jazz musician (he was the lead saxophonist in his own swing band for some years, supporting more well-known bands) Baker moves his brush through the world of colour with great virtuosity. He paints as he played, with freedom and fluidity. Since 2007, Baker has also been exploring the world of high resolution photography as a fine art form producing a distinct style of work notably of Venice, Buenos Aires and London. In 2006, Baker was appointed to the board of the Arts Club in London and in 2007, he was appointed chairman of the Trustees of the Chichester Art Trust, which manages and stages the National Open Art Competition and its exhibitions both in Chichester and London. As of 2017 Baker is an author and professional sculptor. In early 2018 he completed his role as chairman of the Chichester Art Trust and National Open Art. He now writes Children's Stories and has recently launched Bowdleflodes Ltd and is building an online 'fantasy' zoo with children's creative 'fantasmagorical' drawings and each submission is linked to supporting endangered species, either in zoos or in wildlife programmes.

He was a noted collector of antiquities.  Early life  Worsley was born on 13February 1751, at Appuldurcombe House, near Wroxall on the Isle of Wight, the son of Sir Thomas Worsley, 6th Baronet (1726‚Äì1768) and Elizabeth Boyle (1731‚Äì1800), daughter of John Boyle, 5th Earl of Cork and Henrietta, his first wife. He succeeded to his father's baronetcy on 23September 1768. The counterpart painting of Lady Worsley in a riding habit adapted from the uniform of her husband's regiment Educated at Winchester College, Worsley spent about two years in Naples with his parents from 1765 to 1767, before matriculating at Corpus Christi College, Oxford on 9 April 1768. Instead of taking a degree, he decided to complete his education with a continental Grand Tour from 1769 to 1770, being tutored by Georges Deyverdun, who was a contact of Edward Gibbon, a family friend. Political career After his return to Britain Worsley served as High Sheriff of Hampshire for 1773-74 and then entered the House of Commons in 1774 for the constituency of Newport. A supporter of the Lord North government, he was appointed a clerk comptroller of the board of green cloth in 1777, comptroller of the king's household (1779‚Äì82), privy councillor (from 1780) and Governor of the Isle of Wight (1780‚Äì82). In 1775 he married. =1779‚Äì1788= Worsley failed to win a seat at the Hampshire by-election of December 1779 and lost all his offices when the North administration fell in 1782. Scandals involving his wife further damaged his political career. Worsley left for Spain, Portugal, and France (1783‚Äì84, quitting his parliamentary seat after his departure) and wintered in Rome. After further travels, he returned to England in 1788. =1790‚Äì1805= Appuldurcombe House Worsley re-entered Parliament as MP for Newtown, Isle of Wight, from 1790 to 1793. He became British ambassador to the Republic of Venice from 1794 until Venice's annexation by France in 1797. In the latter post he continued collecting antiquities (the French Revolutionary Wars keeping prices low at the time) and worked hard to keep France's ambassador from taking advantage of Venice's neutrality. He managed to escape Venice when the French invaded, transferring soon after his departure from a civilian convoy to a 14-gun Royal Navy sloop, leaving his art collections from Venice on the convoy with instructions to stay at Fiume to await a more peaceful situation in which to continue to England. He landed in England in mid- September 1797 and received a ¬£600 annuity from the crown for his services. Having been re-elected in absentia for Newtown in 1796, Worsley held that seat until Pitt the Younger resigned in February 1801, ending his participation in public life. Antiquarian and collector In 1778 Worsley was elected a Fellow of both the Society of Antiquaries of London and the Royal Society. In February 1785 he left Rome for the Levant with Willey Reveley as draughtsman. He visited Athens (from 1785), the Greek interior, Rhodes, Cairo, Constantinople, Sigeion (1786), Troy (1786) and the Crimea. During his travels he built up a collection of gems, paintings, sculpture and reliefs. He lost the paintings when the collection was interned in Portugal during his return from the east to Britain via Rome in 1787‚Äì88. In Rome he bought more antiquities from Thomas Jenkins and Giovanni Battista Piranesi, and became a friend of the Spanish ambassador, Jose Nicolas de Azara, and the antiquary Ennio Quirino Visconti (who would later write the text for Worsley's publication of his collections (1794‚Äì1805)). On his return Worsley arranged the collection at his house at Appuldurcombe, where he had the grounds landscaped by Capability Brown. His was the most extensive collection of ancient Greek sculpture in Britain, before the arrival of Elgin Marbles. Worsley went into seclusion, principally at Sea Cottage (later known as Marine Villa), which he built in the early 1790s near St Lawrence, in the Undercliff of the Isle of Wight, adding small classical temples in its grounds and making a failed attempt to add a vineyard. In 1801 he received news from a British government agent that a French privateer had brought the ship carrying his art treasures into M√°laga and that the paintings onboard had been bought up cheaply by Lucien Bonaparte. Only the antiquities remained, which he reacquired by paying the French bounty on them. Last years and death Memorial to Sir Richard Worsley, 7th Baronet, in All Saints' Church, Godshill, Isle of Wight Poor health prevented Worsley from taking part in defending the Isle of Wight against the Napoleonic invasion threat, but he carried on collecting until his death. He died of apoplexy on 8August 1805 at Appuldurcombe House and was buried at the parish church at Godshill. Most of Worsley's collections went to Brocklesby Park.

This work was written jointly with Ennio Quirino Visconti. * Catalogue Raisonn√© of the Principal Paintings at Appuldurcombe (1804, privately printed) Family On 20 September 1775 Worsley married Seymour Dorothy Fleming, the younger daughter and coheir of Sir John Fleming, 1st Baronet, of Brompton Park, Middlesex, and his wife, Lady Jane Fleming (died 1811). They had one legitimate son, Robert Edwin (1776‚Äì1795) and he claimed the paternity of Seymour's daughter, Jane Seymour Worsley, even though he knew her to be the daughter of Seymour's lover, George Bisset. This was done to avoid scandal, allowing the affair to remain a secret. Seymour Fleming brought ¬£52,000 to the marriage, which soon became unhappy. James Gillray cartoon - \\"Sir Richard Worse-than-sly, exposing his wife's bottom; - o fye!\\" His wife was rumoured to have 27 lovers, and in 1782 Worsley brought a criminal conversation case for ¬£20,000 against one of them, George M Bissett, a Hampshire militia officer who lived near to them. The jury decided that Worsley had connived in the adultery and awarded him only one shilling in damages. In 1788 he and his estranged wife entered into articles of separation. After the separation, she reverted to her birth name, Fleming. Worsley began an affair with a Mrs Sarah Smith, which lasted until his death. The baronetcy passed to Worsley's fourth cousin, Henry Worsley-Holmes. Fleming's ¬£70,000 jointure reverted to her, and just over a month later, on 12September, she married John Lewis Cuchet at Farnham. Worsley left the estate saddled with heavy debts. Appuldurcombe passed to his niece, Henrietta Anna Maria Charlotte (daughter of John Bridgeman Simpson), who married the Hon. Charles Anderson-Pelham, later first earl of Yarborough, in 1806.

Gordon The Food of the Gods, based on the 1904 H.G. Wells novel of the same name. It is a sequel in name only, as its plot bears no relation to the 1976 film. Plot Dr. Neil Hamilton (Paul Coufos) receives a call from his mentor Dr. Kate Travis (Jackie Burroughs) about a young boy named Bobby, whose deficient growth has been treated with Travis' experimental serum. Bobby has swiftly and unexpectedly grown larger than a full-grown adult and become violent. To find an antidote, Neil takes a sample of the serum back to his lab at a university science complex. There, animal-rights activists led by Mark Hales (R√©al Andrews) and Neil's girlfriend Alex Reed (Lisa Schrage) are protesting the work of Prof. Edmund Delhurst (Colin Fox), who claims to study cancer but in fact subjects animals to experimentation seeking a cure for baldness. Neil and his assistant Joshua (Frank Pellegrino) inject the serum into some lab rats. That night, the activists (minus Alex) break into the complex to trash Delhurst's lab and accidentally release the now-giant rats, which kill Mark and escape into the campus' utility tunnels. Police Lieutenant Weizel (Michael Copeman) does not believe the surviving activists' statements despite Neil's corroboration about the serum, and Dean White (David B. Nichols) hires a pair of exterminators to handle what he believes are normal-sized rats. The giant rats kill several people, including one of the exterminators and the surviving activists, Al and Angie, escape. But the giant rats apparently kill whoever tried to hunt the animals down themselves. Delhurst's assistant, a janitor named Zeke, is attacked. But, the surviving exterminator, despite taking several rat bites to his arms and face, appears and burns this rat. Later, a night watchman tries to escape some rats, though he is killed off screen. Alex discovers the body of a workman (a Mexican forced from his car and chased by rats) while two other men killed by the rats, whose bodies are still in the car, are discovered by the police. Although Lieutenant Weizel is convinced of the threat, Dean White remains skeptical and refuses to shut the campus down because of the upcoming grand opening of the university's new sports complex. When Joshua falls victim to the rats, Neil attacks the Dean and is fired. Delhurst steals the serum sample and tests it, first on Neil's pet rat Louise, then on a sample of cancer cells. He accidentally contaminates himself with treated cells and dies within minutes as his entire body develops massive tumors. Neil returns to the lab to retrieve the antidote he has created, testing it by destroying Delhurst's transformed corpse. Meanwhile, the rats attack the swimming competition being held in the new sports complex, killing several people including Dean White. Neil uses the enlarged but still-docile Louise, who is in heat, to lure the giant (male) rats into the university courtyard where Weizel and his men gun them all down. Neil phones Dr. Travis to inform her of the antidote, but it is too late; Bobby, now psychotic and larger than ever, kills Travis while she is on the phone and escapes.

It is a Richardsonian Romanesque circular structure of irregularly shaped, rough-faced stone, dominating the central entrance to the park. Construction of the tower was started in either 1890 or 1891, it was completed in 1892, and is approximately 34 feet in diameter and three stories high, capped by an 11-sided roof of steep pitch with a flagpole rising from its peak. It is the sole intact physical remnant of the late-19th century Chautauqua movement at Glen Echo, Maryland, and as a local specimen of late- Victorian rustic architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. The tower was originally part of a large complex of buildings at the entrance of the Glen Echo Chautauqua. The National Register of Historic Places nomination form correctly identifies the architect, Victor Mindeleff, but misspells his name. Mindeleff is best known for his work with the Bureau of American Ethnology. Currently, the Tower is the studio of Artist in Residence J. Jordan Bruns.

It is based at Leuchars Station (Royal Air Force Leuchars until 31 March 15 when it was transferred to Army control), in Fife and flies a fleet of 6 Grob Tutor aircraft. ESUAS is the parent Squadron of 12 Air Experience Flight, who share the aircraft. A Squadron Leader is the Commanding Officer and ESUAS has another 4 Qualified Flying Instructors, Chief Ground Instructor, and a Ground Training Instructor. There are some 90 students, 20 civilian support staff who are contracted from Babcock, plus an adjutant and 2 civilian admin staff. Students apply to join ESUAS at their university's Freshers' Fair and then undergo a selection process. If successful they are attested and join the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve as an Officer Cadet symbolised by a white rank tab. Normally, students are recruited for a period of 2 years. Currently, ESUAS recruit from ten academic institutions in Eastern Scotland: Aberdeen, Abertay, Dundee, Edinburgh, Heriot-Watt, Napier, Perth, QMU, RGU, and St Andrews. ESUAS' flying syllabus allows students to progress to achieve their PFB (Preliminary Flying Badge), along the way flying solo. Other activities include Sports, Adventurous Training, Charity, Engagement, Green's Training and a healthy social scene. The aim of ESUAS, like other University Air Squadrons is to let young people experience life in the Royal Air Force, without commitment to regular service and to provide training in the fields mentioned. ESUAS also parents sponsored students, on cadetships or bursaries, who will go on to join the RAF. History In 1925, as part of the creation of reserve forces for the relatively new Royal Air Force, Lord Trenchard instituted a Volunteer Reserve air squadron at Cambridge University to encourage suitable young men of good education to join the newly-formed Royal Air Force ‚Äì or at least look upon it with favour when they formed the ranks of government or occupied other high echelons of society. That was followed three weeks later by the creation of a similar squadron at Oxford and in 1935 a third squadron at the University of London. Then, in 1940, because of the attrition of aircrew and the need to recruit replacements and expand their numbers, Aberdeen University Air Squadron was created, along with those at the other three ancient Scottish universities and some older English ones, as part of the expansion of the RAF Reserve to prepare undergraduate men volunteering for aircrew duties for call-up for war service. At least two of these squadrons, Aberdeen and St Andrews, also provided short direct entry initial (officer) aircrew training course centres for non-undergraduates ‚Äì mainly older and mainly English public schoolboys ‚Äì who did not attend university as such but went on to aircrew training centres at the end of their six-month course. After discussions with the University‚Äôs newly-created Military Education Committee headed by the Principal, recruiting for AUAS began in earnest under its first CO, Wing Commander Streatfield, temporarily rested from his post as CO of one of the Blenheim bomber squadrons then based at the newly-created RAF Dyce. Among others to join him later as instructors were Professor Edward M. Wright, later Principal of the University and at the time the head of the University‚Äôs Maths Department and himself ex-Oxford UAS who later joined the code-breakers at Bletchley Park, and Dr Potter, one of his Maths Department staff. Before long, several of the University‚Äôs undergraduates had joined the squadron and were duly called up into active service ‚Äì mainly as pilots or navigators or flight engineers. Some, a number of whose names appear in the Squadron history and photo albums now held in the University Library, were killed in action. Many others returned at the end of the war to complete their studies and graduate. At least three of the young men who joined as soon as they were able to on 23 January 1941 after being founded at Marischal College of Aberdeen University, flying from Dyce airport before moving in December 1941 to Leuchars and combining with Edinburgh and Glasgow UASs on 26 July 1944 before reforming at Dyce in October 1946 as part of 66 Group before moving to Leuchars again on 3 October 1981 while part of 25 Group. After the war, the Air Ministry decided to disband all University Air Squadrons since the Service now had too many aircrew and recruits were no longer needed. However, the University of Aberdeen‚Äôs Military Education Committee, led by the Principal, Sir William Fyffe-Hamilton, strongly disagreed with that proposal, believing that the UAS was a good thing for the University. Sir William went to London and persuaded the Air Ministry with much conviction that they were wrong, therefore almost single-handedly saving the entire University Air Squadron part of the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, which now reverted to its role of encouraging young men of good education to consider joining the RAF as pilots or navigators or at least to become air-minded. Flying training up to the standard of the rest of the RAFVR was instituted and resulted in many members joining the full-time service. Over the years, many able personnel, male and female, of several disciplines entered the Service in greater numbers than many other UASs - many achieving the highest ranks - and flew almost all the aircraft ever to have been operated by it. In recognition of that, in 1966 virtually the entire Air Staff, led by the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Elworthy, attended the squadron‚Äôs 25th Anniversary Dinner in Elphinstone Hall, a rare honour, arriving together at Dyce from London in an RAF Transport Command Comet IV. In 1957 the rest of the RAFVR was finally disbanded, leaving the University Air Squadrons as the sole remaining part of the RAFVR. In 1981, because of the reduction of the Service generally, Aberdeen UAS was amalgamated with the resurrected St Andrews ‚Äì now including the new Dundee University ‚Äì University Air Squadron and then in 2003 was further amalgamated with the UAS serving the Edinburgh universities to form the current squadron East of Scotland UAS, now based at RAF Leuchars.

It is built from the Arabic words Abd, al- and Malik. The name means \\"servant of the King\\", in the Christian instance 'King' meaning 'King of Kings' as in Jesus Christ and in Islam, Al-Malik being one of the names of God in the Qur'an, which give rise to the Muslim theophoric names. The letter a of the al- is unstressed, and can be transliterated by almost any vowel, often by e. So the first part can appear as Abdel, Abdul or Abd-al. The second part may appear as Malik, Malek or in other ways. The whole name is subject to variable spacing and hyphenation.

The caption claims that the sketch \\"has been valued by 12 Connoisseurs at Twenty Thousand pounds!\\", a satirical allusion to the sum awarded to Lord Cloncurry by the jury in the ensuing criminal conversation court case of 1807. At common law, criminal conversation, often abbreviated as crim. con., is a tort arising from adultery. \\"Conversation\\" is an old euphemism for sexual intercourse that is obsolete except as part of this term. It is similar to breach of promise, a tort involving a broken engagement against the betrothed, and alienation of affections, a tort action brought by a spouse against a third party, who interfered with the marriage relationship. These torts have been abolished in most jurisdictions. The tort of criminal conversation was abolished in England and Wales in 1857; in Northern Ireland in 1939; in Australia in 1975;Family Law Act 1975, Section 120. and in the Republic of Ireland in 1981. Prior to its abolition, a husband could sue any man who had intercourse with his wife, regardless of whether she consented ‚Äì unless the couple was already separated, in which case the husband could only sue if the separation was caused by the person he was suing. Criminal conversation still exists in parts of the United States, but the application has changed. At least 29 states have abolished the tort by statute and another four have abolished it judicially. The tort of criminal conversation seeks damages for the act of sexual intercourse outside marriage, between the spouse and a third party. Each act of adultery can give rise to a separate claim for criminal conversation. History The Secret History of Crim Con., 1808 etching 1782 cartoon by James Gillray, depicting Sir Richard Worsley helping George Bisset view his wife, Seymour Fleming, naked in a bath-house. The caption reads: \\"Sir Richard Worse-than-Sly / Exposing his Wifes Bottom; ‚Äì O fye!\\" =England and Wales= Initially, criminal conversation was an action brought by a husband for compensation for the breach of fidelity with his wife.. Only a husband could be the plaintiff, and only the \\"other man\\" could be the defendant. Suits for criminal conversation reached their height in late 18th and early 19th-century England, where large sums, often between ¬£10,000 and ¬£20,000 (worth upwards of ¬£1‚Äì2 million in today's terms), could be demanded by the plaintiff for the debauching of his wife. These suits were conducted at the Court of the King's Bench in Westminster Hall, and were highly publicised by publishers such as Edmund Curll and in the newspapers of the day. Although neither the plaintiff, defendant, nor the wife accused of the adultery was permitted to take the stand, evidence of the adulterous behaviour was presented by servants or observers. A number of sensational cases involving members of the aristocracy gained public notoriety in this period. In the 1769 case of Grosvenor v Cumberland, Lord Grosvenor sued the King's brother, the Duke of Cumberland, for criminal conversation with his wife, and was awarded damages of ¬£10,000. In the 1782 case of Worsley v Bisset, Sir Richard Worsley won a technical victory against George Bisset, but was awarded the derisory sum of only one shilling damages: the fact of adultery was not contested, but it was found that he had colluded in his own dishonour by showing his friend his wife, Seymour Dorothy Fleming, naked in a bath-house.Rubenhold 2008. In 1796, the Earl of Westmeath was awarded ¬£10,000 against his wife's lover, Augustus Cavendish-Bradshaw.Earl of Westmeath v Bradshaw, 1796: reported in Collected Speeches of John Philpot Curran (New York, 1811), p. 163 In 1807 Lord Cloncurry brought a much publicized action for criminal conversation against his former friend Sir John Piers, and was awarded damages of ¬£20,000. = Australia = In the state of New South Wales, the tort of criminal conversation was abolished by section 92 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1899 (NSW). In the state of Victoria, the tort of criminal conversation was abolished by section 146 of the Marriage Act 1915 (Vic), although that act also provided for a husband to seek damages from a man guilty of adultery with his wife as part of divorce proceedings (sections 147‚Äì149). In Tasmania, action for criminal conversation was abolished in 1860 by the Matrimonial Causes Act (24 Vic, No 1), section 50. It was abolished under Commonwealth law by section 44(5) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1959 (Cth), which was restated by section 120 of the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth). Current usage: United States The tort is still recognized in a number of states in the United States, although it has been abolished either legislatively or judicially in most. The tort has seen particular use in North Carolina. In the case of Cannon v. Miller, 71 N.C. App. 460, 322 S.E.2d 780 (1984), the North Carolina Court of Appeals (the state's intermediate appellate court), abolished the tort of criminal conversation, as well as the tort of alienation of affections, in the state. However, the North Carolina Supreme Court summarily vacated the Court of Appeals' decision shortly thereafter, saying in a brief opinion that the Court of Appeal had improperly sought to overrule earlier decisions of the Supreme Court. Cannon v. Miller, 313 N.C. 324, 327 S.E.2d 888 (1985). In 2009, the General Assembly approved legislation which placed some limits on such lawsuits.(broken link) at The Sun News of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. The bill was signed into law by Governor Bev Perdue on August 3, 2009, and is codified under Chapter 52 of the North Carolina General Statutes:\\"House Bill 1110 / Session Law 2009-400\\", General Assembly of North Carolina, retrieved 23 March 2010 Each of the three limitations arose from a recent North Carolina legal case involving the tort. In Jones v. Skelley, 195 N.C. App. 500, 673 S.E.2d 385 (2009), the North Carolina Court of Appeals had held that the tort applies even to legally separated spouses. In Misenheimer v. Burris, 360 N.C. 620, 637 S.E.2d 173 (2006), the North Carolina Supreme Court held that the statute of limitation commences when the affair should have been discovered rather than when it occurred. In Smith v. Lee, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78987, the Federal District Court for the Western District of North Carolina noted that the question of whether an employer could be held liable for an affair conducted by an employee on a business trip was still unsettled in North Carolina.

France is traditionally Roman Catholic as well and has an above-average fraction of atheists. Romania and Moldova are Eastern Orthodox countries and both are very religious. The Neopagan movements found in Latin Europe can be divided into New Age spirituality inspired by Celtic, Norse or Megalithic templates on one hand (Neodruidism, Neoshamanism), polytheistic reconstructionism, either focusing on the ancient Roman religion or other native religions of Latin Europe (such as those of pre-Roman Iberia, Italy, and Romania), and political Neopaganism as part of Alain de Benoist's far-right ideology of the Nouvelle Droite on the other. France In the 1980s, Alain de Benoist theorized the Nouvelle Droite movement, creating the GRECE in 1968 with the Club de l'Horloge. They advocated a right-wing, ethno-nationalism stance focused on European culture, which advocated a return of paganism. Members of the GRECE quit the think tank in the 1980s, such as Pierre Vial who joined the FN, or Guillaume Faye who quit the organization along with others members in 1986. Faye participated in 2006 in a conference in the US organized by the American Renaissance white separatist magazine published by the New Century Foundation. The philosophical background uniting Neopaganism and the Nouvelle Droite is the occultist or esoteric literature of \\"Radical Traditionalism\\" of Ren√© Gu√©non, Julius Evola and others. The influence of the Nouvelle Droite goes beyond France and is found in e.g., Belgian (Flemish) neopaganism, such as the brand of Asatru advocated by Flemish neo-fascist and high priest Koenraad Logghe. The Libre Assembl√©e Pa√Øenne Francophone (LAPF) self-identifies as an association of \\"convinced free-thinking and humanist pagans\\". Their Horizons Pa√Øens journal appears twice yearly (since 2005). They oppose all kinds of ethnic discrimination. Libre Assembl√©e Pa√Øenne Francophone, Frequently Asked Questions (French) Ceremonial magic traditions such as Martinism, Rosicrucianism and esoteric Freemasonry, although not Pagan in the strictest sense, are very popular in France. One of the world's most popular ceremonial magic authors, Eliphas L√©vi, was French. Martinism is a Christian ceremonial magic tradition similar to England's Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Kabbalistic based groups are collectively known as the Western Esoteric Tradition. Haitian Vodou, Afro-Caribbean and Kemetic traditions also have a large following in the esoteric community in France as well, particularly among ceremonial magicians. Spain In 2004, Cardinal Alfonso Lopez Trujillo, president of the Pontifical Council for the Family issued a warning that \\"Spain is at risk from the spread of neo-paganism\\": :In some countries of Europe, there is a temptation to embrace neo-paganism, and although I do not believe that Spain is immediately at risk, nevertheless the risk exists because in today‚Äôs world everything gets passed around.Cardinal Lopez Trujillo warns of risk of neo-paganism in Spain On December 23, 2011, the Spanish Government officially acknowledged Wicca to be a religion, Celtiberian Wiccan Tradition in the Register of religious bodies with the reference 2560-SG / A, being the first country for Europe and the second in the world after U.S.A., to recognize it. Celtiberian tradition of Wicca, consisting of Fernando Gonzalez in the 1980s from the Hispanic Traditional Witchcraft to which he belongs, is a structured religion through the symbiosis between \\"traditionalism wizard\\" (inciatic and mystery), the historical reconstructionist (cultural and archaeological) and \\"adaptationism\\" liturgical (conditioning ceremonial) of Hispanic Traditional Witchcraft, paganism, religious worship pre-Christian Celtic and Iberian mainly and those that were previously formed (shamanism, Neolithic and Paleolithic cults). There is a small amount of Germanic neopaganism found in Spain, which includes the Comunidad Odinista de Espa√±a-Asatru (COE) founded as Circulo Odinista Espa√±ol in 1981. The COE was recognized by the Spanish government as a religion, allowing them to perform \\"legally binding civil ceremonies\\", such as marriages. COE is the fourth Odinist/Asatru religious organization in the world to be recognized with official status, after those in Iceland, Norway and Denmark. In December 2007, they conducted first legal pagan wedding in Spain, on the beach of Vilanova, Barcelona. \\"La verdad\\" daily Portugal Following the line of visibility that the Wiccan Religious Confession, Celtiberian Tradition, imposed throughout the institution, this Tradition Wicca also established in Portugal has taken the first step and once applied for registration in the relevant Register, has just been registered and is therefore has become the first Confession Pagan recognized as religion in the history of Portugal.Wicca Celt√≠bera registrada como confesi√≥n tambi√©n en Portugal  PNC Spain Thus, the Portuguese public administration has been entered in the Register of Religious Entities Religious Confession to Wicca, Celtiberian tradition with the nomenclature: Data of Cria√ß√£o: 26/6/12 Confiss√£o Wiccan Religious Celtiberian.

STARiS 2.0 are currently installed onboard all C151B and C151C trains, which was equipped during the manufacturing process. STARiS 2.0 was supposed to be retrofitted to C651 trains during their refurbishment (which has been shelved in 2018) as well as all other existing trains before the opening of Canberra MRT station, but it did not materialise. C751B trainset 321/322 used to have a trial version of \\"STARiS version 2.0\\" installed onboard car 3322 from late-2010, but it was eventually removed in early 2016. On 18 April 2019, an updated version of the original STARiS display was spotted onboard a C151A trainset 511/512. The new STARiS bears a new look, and has 3 provisional LED bulbs. 2 for the future Brickland and Sungei Kadut stations on the North South Line, which are part of the 2040 Land Transport Master Plan. Another one more additional LED is for unknown. All C151A trains have received the upgrade, while the rest of the other trains with the original STARiS were not upgraded as they will be retired and replaced by Bombardier Movia CR151 trains by 2026. Instead, stickers have been pasted on the route maps of these trains to remind commuters that Canberra Station will not light up, as it does not have a LED provisioned on the maps. Overview STARiS comprises a system of 4 Vacuum Fluorescent Displays (VFD) mounted at an angle from the ceiling and 8 active route maps mounted above every door in each car. The VFDs indicate the train service's direction of travel, terminal station, side of doors opening, doors closing messages, current station, next station, interchange station and displays multi-language text synchronized with in- train audio announcements. The active route maps indicate the line of travel, direction of travel, side of doors opening, current station, next station, terminal station, interchange station and the corresponding line for interchange. All STARiS 2.0 active route maps are based upon Android.

Adherents can be found across Latin Europe, but also in the Americas, the latter exemplified by Nova Roma, the largest such reconstructionist organisation.George D. Chryssides, Historical Dictionary of New Religious Movements (2011, 2nd ed.)

Additional organizations have become increasingly popular in recent years, particularly the Roman Republic: Res Publica Romana organization.

History  The lengthy platforms were situated to the north of the long, low viaduct, the main buildings being on the town (down) side of the line. A signal box was provided on the north end of the London-bound platform. The station was unique in its structures, these being highly individual. The main building had a small portico leading to the booking office at the front with all the usual facilities within the building. Platform shelters were in wood in typical style of the GNR. In the first half of the 20th century the royal family customarily attended Doncaster races. They would alight at Bawtry, being greeted with the usual enthusiasm, and proceed by road to the racecourse. It was the junction of the Bawtry to Haxey railway line, a freight only line to Misson and Haxey, which opened in 1912 and the remaining section to Misson closed in 1964. The station closed to regular passenger services in 1958 but occasional special trains served the station until the mid 1960s.Private and Untimetabled Railway Stations by G.Croughton  Present day  The buildings and platforms have been swept away but a couple of goods yard buildings are now houses. In a report to Doncaster Borough Council in September 2008 land near the station has been protected should the site be required as a new station, with car parking facilities, in the future as the town grows.

He graduated with the cand.jur. degree in 1925, he studied in Berlin from 1926 and 1927. He joined the Norwegian Fascist party Nasjonal Samling (NS), which was established in 1933, and was a central figure in the party's founding and relative success (two city council seats in its first election outing) in Hamar. He was their first ballot candidate in the Market towns of Hedmark and Oppland counties in the 1936 general election, but was not elected. In Hamar he also chaired the tennis group in Hamar IL in 1930. He left the party in 1937. As a Germanophile, his thinking clashed with the Norwegian cultural nationalism of Nasjonal Samling chairman Vidkun Quisling. In 1939 Wiesener became a barrister with access to work with cases in the Supreme Court. During the German occupation of Norway, from 1940 to 1945, he worked as a defender for members of the Norwegian resistance who were tried in Nazi-controlled courts. Among others he was the defender of Gunnar Eilifsen, the first Norwegian during the occupation to receive the death sentence from a Norwegian court. Nonetheless, as a part of the legal purge in Norway after World War II, Wiesener received a small sentence for a piece he wrote in 1940. He was active in the Nazi movement in the spring and summer of 1940, when Quisling's first period as a national leader was over, and the German occupants tried to find Germanophile collaborators in the Norwegian society. Wiesener held lectures in the German-controlled Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation, as did people like Jonas Lie, Johan Bernhard Hjort, and Ranik Halle. However, Wiesener and others faded into the background from July 1940, as Nasjonal Samling and its members returned to the upper echelons. Wiesener criticized the legal purge in the 1964 book Seierherrens justis. He had previously published Nordmenn for tysk krigsrett (1954), chronicling his time as a defender. He died in 1986.

It is a large, three story frame Queen Anne style residence constructed about 1875. It is one of the oldest residences in Takoma Park, and one of the only surviving Eastlake Stick Style examples left in the Washington D.C., area. It was built by John B. and Vorlinda Davis, who also operated a small store on nearby University Boulevard (then called \\"Old Bladensburg Road.\\" Background In the early 20th century it was used as a gambling hall and speakeasy, then from 1940 until 1987, it housed the private \\"Cynthia Warner School,\\" serving the educational needs of thousands of children of Takoma Park families from elementary through the high school level. In 1987 the property was purchased by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The Church began demolition of the building, but in 1991, Mark and Kira Davis purchased a half-acre section of the plot from the Church, and moved the house 150 meters to a new foundation, out of the way of the Church's construction plans, to preserve it from demolition. The Davis family restored the building as a residence. Kira Davis operated her business \\"PaperFaces\\" from the location (an art studio and customized paper doll business), and Mark Davis operated an international trade law firm Davis & Leiman PC from the premises as well. In 1997 the Davises sold the property to Douglas A. Harbit and Robert F. Patenaude, who operated a bed and breakfast called The Davis-Warner Inn. They also qualified the property for registry with the National Register of Historic Places, and ceded development rights to the property in perpetuity to Historic Takoma, a local historic preservation society. Harbit and Patenaude coined the name \\"Davis-Warner House\\" to honor the Davis family that originally built the house, the Davis family that moved and restored the house, and Cynthia Warner, who operated the private school for much of the 20th century. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. The Davis-Warner Inn closed in 2006, and in 2010 the building was purchased out of foreclosure by the Catholic Missionaries of Charity, who repainted it Marian blue and operated it as a convent. In 2015, the Davis-Warner Inn was purchased by local architect, Eric Saul, and his wife, Diana Simpson, for use as their primary residence.

Early life and family  Fleming was the younger daughter and coheir of the Irish-born Sir John Fleming, 1st Baronet (d. 1763), of Brompton Park (aka Hale House, Cromwell House), Middlesex, and his wife, Jane Coleman (d. 1811). She was probably named for her maternal grandmother, Jane Seymour, a daughter of Sir Edward Seymour, 5th Baronet. Her father and two of her sisters died when she was five, and she and her surviving sister were then brought up by their mother, who remarried in 1770 to Edwin Lascelles, 1st Baron Harewood, a rich sexagenarian whose wealth derived from slavery plantations in the West Indies. Her elder sister, Jane Stanhope, Countess of Harrington, was noted for being an \\"epitome of virtue\\".  Marriage to Worsley  The counterpart painting of her husband Sir Richard Worsley, 7th Baronet On 20 September 1775, at the age of 17, Seymour Fleming married Sir Richard Worsley, 7th Baronet of Appuldurcombe House, Isle of Wight, and was styled Lady Worsley until his death. She was rumoured to have been worth ¬£70,000 upon her marriage, but in truth brought ¬£52,000 to the union (). The couple were badly suited to each other, and the marriage began to fall apart shortly after it began. They had one child, a son named Robert Edwin who died young. In August 1781 Seymour bore a second child, Jane Seymour Worsley, fathered by Maurice George Bisset but claimed by Worsley as his own to avoid scandal. Bisset, a captain in the South Hampshire militia, had been Worsley's close friend and neighbour at Knighton Gorges on the Isle of Wight. Cartoon by James Gillray: \\"Sir Richard Worse-than-sly, exposing his wife's bottom; ‚Äì o fye!\\" Lady Worsley was rumoured to have had 27 lovers. In November 1781 she ran off with Bisset, and in February 1782 Worsley brought a criminal conversation case against Bisset for ¬£20,000 (). Lady Worsley turned the suit in her favour with scandalous revelations and the aid of past and present lovers and questioned the legal status of her husband. She included a number of testimonies from her lovers and her doctor, William Osborn, who related that she had suffered from a venereal disease which she had contracted from the Marquess of Graham. It was alleged that Worsley had displayed his wife naked to Bisset at the bath house in Maidstone. This testimony destroyed Worsley's suit and the jury awarded him only one shilling (2015: ¬£) in damages. Bisset eventually left Lady Worsley when it became apparent that Worsley was seeking separation rather than divorce, meaning Seymour could not remarry until Worsley's death. Seymour was forced to become a professional mistress or demimondaine and live off the donations of rich men in order to survive, joining other upper-class women in a similar position in the New Female Coterie. She had two more children: another by Bisset after he left her in 1783, whose fate is unknown; and a fourth, Charlotte Dorothy Hammond (n√©e Cochard), who she sent to be raised by a family in the Ardennes. Lady Worsley later left for Paris in order to avoid her debts. In 1788, she and her new lover the Chevalier de Saint-Georges returned to England, and her estranged husband entered into articles of separation, on the condition she spend four years in exile in France. Eight months before the expiration of this exile, she was unable to leave France because of the events of the French Revolution and she was probably imprisoned during the Reign of Terror, meaning she was abroad on the death of her and Worsley's son in 1793. In early 1797, she returned to England, and she then suffered a severe two-month illness. Owing to the forgiveness of her mother, her sister and her sister's husband, the Earl of Harrington, she was then able to move into Brompton Park, her previous home, but which the laws on property prevented her from officially holding.  Later life  On Worsley's death in 1805, her ¬£70,000 jointure reverted to her and just over a month later, on 12 September, at the age of 47 she married 26-year-old newfound lover John Lewis Cuchet (d. 1836) at Farnham. Also that month, by royal licence, she officially resumed her maiden name of Fleming, and her new husband also took it. After the armistice of 1814 ended the War of the Sixth Coalition, the couple moved to a villa at Passy where she died in 1818, aged 59. She is buried at the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.  In popular culture  In the 2015 BBC2 television film, The Scandalous Lady W, based upon Hallie Rubenhold's book Lady Worsley's Whim, she was played by Natalie Dormer.

Plot summary :;Characters: :1. The narrator, a scientist :2. Moritz, an estate agent, and his family :3. A Swiss engineer :4. His wife, a Persian born in Shiraz This novel is about suicide, a topic that permeates overtly or covertly all of Bernhard‚Äôs work. A Persian woman is the central character of narration, and the narrator prepares for her suicide by his own preoccupation with suicide. This motif of the surrogate victim is clearly established in the novel's opening sentence (see excerpt below), where the narrator describes himself as in the process of \\"dumping\\" his problems on his friend Moritz. Later, he will persist in making these revelations even though he recognizes that they have \\"wounded\\" Moritz. Similarly, he will underline the Persian woman's role as a surrogate victim when he refers to her as the ideal \\"sacrificial mechanism\\". One could easily perceive that the woman fascinates the narrator, who finds in her a suitable companion in his solitary walks into the nearby forest, where he obsesses her with interminable disquisitions and philosophical rants. She is \\"an utterly regenerating person, that is an utterly regenerating walking and thinking and talking and philosophising partner such as I had not had for years\\".Cf. Yes, p.5 Gradually the narrator goes back in time and recollects his first meetings with the Persian woman, uncovering a universe of loneliness where the only existential act left is confession. However, self-exposure not always engenders a benefit. Whilst the narrator undergoes a positive reaction, becoming once again attached to life and thus discarding suicide, the Persian woman is unable to unravel the knots of her painful social isolation and says a definitive \\"yes\\" to annihilation. Literally, the woman arrived in this comically benighted corner of Upper Austria because her companion, a Swiss engineer, had chosen it as the ideal location in which to build his new house, right in the middle of a nearby thick forest. But the reader recognizes this realistic motivation as simply a pretext for arranging the sacrificial death that Bernhard intends for her. We glimpse this archetypal pattern from the very beginning of his narrative, when the narrator describes the woman as \\"regenerating\\" and perceives the arrival of the couple as signifying his \\"redemption\\". While the narrator himself has never been able to act on his own suicidal impulses, it was his insinuating words, as we learn in the novel's closing sentence, that provoked the woman's suicide. After she has committed suicide (by throwing herself in front of a cement truck), he remembers discussing the frequent suicide of young people and asking her if she would kill herself one day, to which she replies, in the novel's closing word, \\"Yes\\". Excerpt ^ Incipit: > \\"The Swiss and his woman friend had appeared at the real-estate agent > Moritz‚Äôs place at just the moment when, for the first time, I was trying not > only to outline to him the symptoms of my emotional and mental sickness and > eventually elucidate them as a science, but had come to Moritz‚Äôs house, who > in point of fact was then probably the person closest to me, in order quite > suddenly and in the most ruthless manner to turn the inside of my, by then > not just sickly but totally sickness-ridden, existence, which until then he > had known just superficially and had not therefore been unduly irritated let > alone alarmed by in any way, turn that inside of my existence out, and thus > inevitably alarmed and appalled him by the very abrupt brutality of my > undertaking, by the fact that, on that afternoon, I totally unveiled and > revealed what, over the whole decade of my acquaintance and friendship with > Moritz, I had kept hidden from him, indeed concealed from him throughout > that period with mathematical ingeniousness, and kept continually (and > pitilessly towards myself) covered from him, in order not to grant him, > Moritz, even the slightest glimpse into my existence, which profoundly > horrified him, but I had not allowed that horror to impede me in the least > in my revealing mechanism which had, that afternoon and of course also under > the influence of the weather, gone into action, and step by step, that > afternoon, I had, as though I had no other choice, all of a sudden pounced > upon Moritz from my mental ambush, unveiling everything relating to myself, > unveiling everything that there was to unveil, revealing everything there > was to reveal; throughout the incident I had been seated, as always, in the > corner seat facing the two windows by the entrance to Moritz‚Äôs office, to > what I always called his box-file room, while Moritz himself, after all this > was the end of October, sat facing me in his mouse-grey winter overcoat, > possibly by then in a drunk state, which in the falling dusk I had been > unable to determine...\\" Cf.

Demography and distribution 2006 statistics from Spain's Instituto Nacional de Estad√≠stica showed 2,873 registered residents of Spain born in South Korea, of whom 514 held Spanish nationality, while 2,359 held other nationalities. Among Spanish nationals, men outnumbered women by a ratio of 1.3:1, which was almost exactly reversed among non-Spanish nationals. Between 1980 and 2004, a total of 696 people originally holding South Korean nationality became Spanish citizens. South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, whose statistics are based largely on registrations with consulates and count locally born persons of Korean descent as well as South Korean-born individuals, recorded a somewhat higher count of 3,769 individuals in 2005; of those, 2,538 resided in, with another 1,231 in Las Palmas. This made Koreans in Spain the fifth-largest Korean diaspora population in Western Europe, behind Koreans in the United Kingdom, Koreans in Germany, Koreans in France, and Koreans in Italy. The most recent statistics of the South Korean government, issued in July 2011, show only slight growth compared to the 2005 statistics. Of the 4,080 Koreans recorded as living in Spain, 929 had Spanish citizenship, 2,108 had permanent residence, 216 were on student visas, and the remaining 727 had other kinds of visas. Las Palmas Koreans in Las Palmas form a community distinct from that on the Spanish mainland. Theirs is the only concentration of Koreans in Spain whose presence has resulted in a recognisable Koreatown. They trace their origins to South Korean migrant workers who worked on deep-ocean fishing boats based on the island starting in the 1960s. Fishing, along with construction, was one of the main sources of overseas employment for South Koreans for decades; by the 1970s, nearly 15,000 Koreans resided in Las Palmas, making them about 4% of the city's population of 350,000. Many brought their families over and became rooted in Spain, sending their children to local schools. However, with the decline of South Korea's ocean fisheries industries in the 1990s, their population shrank, from 2,283 individuals in 1997 to just 1,292 by 1999, a number which decreased at a slower rate over the following decade to reach 1,197 by 2011. Most of the remaining Korean population have shifted away from the fishing industry, and their children have largely entered professional fields, achieving relative affluence. Mainland Spain The Korean community on the Spanish mainland consists mainly of two groups: primarily male small business owners and executives of South Korean companies along with their spouses and children, and primarily female international students at Spanish universities. Korean martial artists, though a smaller group, are also well represented; they either run their own dojang, or work for private security companies. They do not trace their origins exclusively to South Korea; some members of the communities of Koreans in Argentina and other Latin American countries have also settled in Spain, and South Korean businessowners often employ chosunjok from China in their businesses. Their population peaked in the 1990s and then decreased due to the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, during which many South Korean companies, anxious to cut costs, shifted operations out of Western Europe into the cheaper countries of Eastern Europe, Latin America, and China.

Early life Gloddaeth Hall, Carnarvonshire (now Conwy), seat of the Mostyn family Mostyn was born on 31 July 1673, in Flintshire, north Wales. He was the eldest son of Sir Thomas Mostyn, 2nd Baronet, of Mostyn, and his wife Bridget Savage, daughter and heiress of Darcy Savage of Leighton, Cheshire. He matriculated at Jesus College, Oxford on 10 February 1690, aged 15. On the death of his father in 1692, he inherited his baronetcy and estates. Although the estates were extensive and with a good income, his extravagance and love of horse racing led him into financial difficulties and he needed to make a good marriage. He married Lady Essex Finch, the daughter of Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham (with ¬£7,000) on 20 July 1703. Career Mostyn was appointed Sheriff of Caernarvonshire for 1701.

He was defeated in a contest at Cheshire, but was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament (MP) for Flintshire. In August 1702, he was returned unopposed for Flint and also elected MP for Cheshire, which he chose to represent. He was appointed Constable of Flint Castle in 1702. He voted for tacking on the Occasional Conformity Bill to the Land-tax Bill in 1705 and this may have led to the loss of his seat and office of Constable. At the 1705 general election he was defeated in the poll at Cheshire but could fall back on the seat at Flint Boroughs where he was returned unopposed. He was returned unopposed for Flintshire in 1708 and 1710 and in 1711, he was appointed paymaster of the marines. He voted against the articles of commerce in 1713.

In 1727, he was re-appointed Custos Rotulorum of Flintshire and retained the post until his death in 1739. He voted against Walpole's excise scheme in 1733, and having opposed the Septennial Bill, supported the motion for its repeal in 1734. He retired from Parliament at the 1734 general election. In consideration of his services and the expenses he incurred as paymaster of the marines, he was allowed a sum of ¬£300 for eight years.

It has produced over 40 full-scale productions since its inception. At present, it is one of only a handful of companies left in Scotland today producing large-scale operas, and one of the few to routinely to play with a full orchestra, and the foremost company of its sort in Fife.  History  On the arrival of the entertainers in La traviata, act 2, scene 2 The company was founded in 1975 with the impetus being provided by Kirsty Adam, who was then keen to draw together a number of opera enthusiasts and singers from across the county. In 1978, the company performed Menotti's Amahl and the Night Visitors in the 13th-century Cistercian Culross Abbey. From the outset, the musical director, Richard Galloway, insisted on auditioning everyone interested in joining, and insisted on high vocal quality and level of professionalism from company members. Despite this, for the company's first full-scale production from 1979, Bizet's Carmen, a cast of 54 took to the stage, accompanied by a 37-piece orchestra.Rougvie, Janet, A Brief History of Fife Opera, privately printed, 2001 A bomb scare interrupted Fife Opera's 1981 production of Smetana's The Bartered Bride leading to hordes of Bohemian peasants being spilt out into the War Memorial Gardens.

Fife Opera has a large proportion of younger singers, and increasingly is geared towards outreach and touring. In recent years, it has appeared annually at the Edinburgh Festival. Highlights from the company's past productions include Aida in 2004 and the 1983 presentation of La traviata. Among the comparative rarities performed are Lakm√© by L√©o Delibes, Les p√™cheurs de perles by Georges Bizet, and No√´l Coward's Bitter Sweet. In 2011 the company ran a highly successful \\"Come and Sing\\" Carmen; it then performed, for the first time The Tales of Hoffmann by Jacques Offenbach as its annual production in the Adam Smith Theatre in Kirkcaldy and gave a Christmas concert. 2012 saw the \\"Come and Sing\\" idea developed further with a \\"Come and Sing from the Shows\\" day in March and a \\"Come and Sing\\" Aida in May.

Painting in the Americas before European colonization is the Precolumbian painting traditions of the Americas. Painting was a relatively widespread, popular and diverse means of communication and expression for both religious and utilitarian purpose throughout the regions of the Western Hemisphere. During the period before and after European exploration and settlement of the Americas; including North America, Central America, South America and the islands of the Caribbean, the Bahamas, the West Indies, the Antilles, the Lesser Antilles and other island groups, indigenous native cultures produced a wide variety of visual arts, including painting on textiles, hides, rock and cave surfaces, bodies especially faces, ceramics, architectural features including interior murals, wood panels, and other available surfaces. Many of the perishable surfaces, such as woven textiles, typically have not been preserved, but Precolumbian painting on ceramics, walls, and rocks have survived more frequently. The oldest known paintings in the South America are the cave paintings of Caverna da Pedra Pintada, in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest that date back 11,200 years.Wilford, John Noble. Scientist at Work: Anna C. Roosevelt; Sharp and To the Point In Amazonia. New York Times. 23 April 1996 The earliest known painting in North America is the Cooper Bison Skull found near Fort Supply, Oklahoma, dated to 10,200 BCE.Bement, 176 Painting in the Americas before colonization Each continent of the Americas hosted societies that were unique and individually developed cultures; that produced totems, works of religious symbolism, and decorative and expressive painted works. African influence was especially strong in the art of the Caribbean and South America. The arts of the indigenous people of the Americas had an enormous impact and influence on European art and vice versa during and after the Age of Exploration. Spain, Portugal, France, The Netherlands and England were all powerful and influential colonial powers in the Americas during and after the 15th century. By the 19th century cultural influence began to flow both ways across the Atlantic. =Mesoamerica= The murals of Teotihuacan that adorn the archaeological site (and others, like the Wagner Murals, found in private collections) and from hieroglyphic inscriptions made by the Maya describing their encounters with Teotihuacano conquerors are the source of most of what is understood about that ancient civilization. The painting of the murals, perhaps thousands of them, reached its zenith between 450 and 650 CE. The painters' artistry was unrivalled in Mesoamerica and has been compared with that of Florence, Italy.Davies, p. 78. The Great Goddess A series of murals were found in the Tepantitla compound in Teotihuacan. In 1942, archaeologist Alfonso Caso identified the central figures as a Teotihuacan equivalent of Tlaloc, the Mesoamerican god of rain and warfare. During the 1970s researcher Esther Pasztory re-examined the murals and concluded that many paintings of \\"Tlaloc\\" instead showed a feminine deity, an analysis based on a number of factors including the gender of accompanying figures, the green bird in the headdress, and the spiders seen above the figure.Pasztory (1977, pp.83‚Äì85). Pasztory concluded that the figures represented a vegetation and fertility goddess that was a predecessor of the much later Aztec goddess Xochiquetzal. The Great Goddess has since been identified at locations other than Tepantitla ‚Äì including Teotihuacan's Tetitla compound, the Palace of the Jaguars, and the Temple of Agriculture ‚Äì as well as on several vessels.Pasztory (1977, pp.87‚Äì91). The Temple of the Murals Large painted Mayan murals were found in the archaeological site Bonampak, in the Mexican state of Chiapas near the border with Guatemala. What is referred to as The Temple of the Murals is a long narrow building with 3 rooms atop a low- stepped pyramid base. The interior walls preserve the finest examples of classic Maya painting. Huge paintings cover the walls of one of the structure's three rooms. The paintings show the story of a single battle and its victorious outcome.Coe, Michael D. (1999).

Each of the stories concerns a central female character who is somehow connected with the publisher. It was shown for the first time on BBC Four at 9:00 p.m. on Sunday 2 November 2008, and starred Emilia Fox, Jodie Whittaker, Olivia Colman and Daniel Mays. It was written by Emma Frost and directed by Dan Zeff. It begins with a disclaimer: Some of the following is based on fact ... the rest is romantic fiction.  The Stories  The first thread revolves around the establishment of Mills & Boon itself, and the relationship between Charles Boon (Daniel Mays) and his wife Mary (Jodie Whittaker). Despite the youthful idealism that saw him establish the company with his friend and win his wife's love, and the nature of the stories he oversees from hopeful authors, Charles is himself ironically blind to Mary's repeated attempts to inject passion into their relationship. This constant inability to realise--or at least acknowledge--the emotional needs of his wife or to consider her and their son as significant in their own right is a constant plot point, finally leading to a confrontation between husband & wife following Mills's death from cancer at the end of the 20s. This in turn results in the epiphany that, along with an infusion of cash from a longtime employee who replaces Mills as a partner in the business, transforms the company into a single genre publishing house focusing on populist romance novels from the female perspective. The second moves to 1974 and follows the fictitious Janet Bottomley (Olivia Colman), a dowdy typist who lives with her mother and is an avid fan of Mills & Boon stories. When her mother has to go into hospital for a hip replacement, she becomes infatuated with the arrogant surgeon handling the case. At first this inspires her to write a manuscript translating the infatuation into a hospital romance, but as she continues to write she begins to stalk him, culminating in an embarrassing confrontation at his birthday party. Soon afterwards however, she receives the welcome news that Mills & Boon have accepted her manuscript. Even more welcome is the astonishing amount the book will earn her, allowing her to quit her job to write full-time under the name Raquel Pretty. The third involves the fictitious Kirstie (Emilia Fox), a 30-something university English lecturer in 2008 teaching a unit on modern romance using the output of Mills & Boon. Jake (O. T. Fagbenle), a university student in his early 20s acting on his long distance infatuation with her enrolls in the unit and soon begins forcefully courting her. Initially confused and repelled, Kirstie soon realises that he displays passion for her and for life that she can no longer find with her current partner Nick with whom she is about to purchase a house. Challenged by Jake in and out of class, she finds herself giving into her desires and has an affair with him which she eventually confesses to Nick. Ironically, her partner's desire to \\"get through this\\" spells the end of that relationship as Kirstie walks out due to the same lack of passion that led to the affair. Following a confrontation in class during which Jake sums up the prevalence of heroines seeking rape/forceful sex from their suitors in many modern romance stories as an excuse for women to have passion without the responsibility of guilt, she commits herself and the two become a couple for however long the passion lasts.

Early life  John Dodd was born in 1863 at Avoca, Victoria, Australia. His father was Aaron Dodd, a native of Leicestershire, England, who was convicted of burglary and transported for life to Van Diemens Land in 1828. In 1840 Aaron married Mary Jane White. Some time after he gained his conditional pardon in 1846, they emigrated to Victoria, settling in Avoca around 1850. John was the 13th of possibly 15 children.Based on Victorian and Tasmanian registry and convict records John Dodd was apprenticed as a jockey to Robert Howie, a Ballarat horse trainer.  Melbourne Cup, 1881  During the running of the race a dog ran onto the race track causing one of the horses, Wheatear, to fall. Shortly after that Dodd's horse, Suwarrow, was forced into the rails. Dodd suffered a broken leg and internal injuries.The Australasian, 5 Nov 1881, p. 585. He died two weeks later in the Melbourne Hospital. His death was widely reported in local and international newspapers at the time.See for example The Maitland Mercury & Hunter River General Advertiser, Thurs 17 Nov 1881, p. 3. \\"John Dodd, the jockey, who sustained a fracture of the leg and other injuries whilst riding Suwarrow in the Melbourne Cup, is dead.\\" at .

An inquest on his body found that he died of complications from a compound fracture caused when his leg was twisted between the rail and the post. The coroner recommended paling the fence to avoid similar accidents in the future.The Argus, 16 Nov 1881, p. 5, at , The Age, 16 Nov 1881, The Australasian, 5 Nov 1881, p. 585. The Avoca Mail set up a fund in support of his 'aged mother and helpless sister' to which the Victoria Racing Club contributed 50 pounds from the Jockeys Fund. A cricket match was organised between amateur and professional jockeys at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 6 January 1882 which raised about 200 pounds for the fund.'Benefit Cricket Match', The Argus, 7 Jan 1882, p. 11.

Dodd saw this as an omen and, according to \\"The Storyteller\\", the dog that ran onto the racetrack was Dodd's missing dog. The final part of the legend is that Dodd was riding Wheatear, and died on the track, killed by his own faithful dog. Wannan and others point out that Dodd was in fact riding Suwarrow and that this accident was unrelated to the one caused by the dog. However they maintain the fiction of his first name.

It was developed by Cryo Interactive and released for Microsoft Windows based PCs.  Development  The characters in The Secret of the Nautilus are based on original 19th century engravings as published in Jules Verne's novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, despite the game taking place in the 21st century. These characters include N√©mo, and a giant octopus. The game is similar in theme to The Adventure Company's later games which include Return to Mysterious Island, Return to Mysterious Island 2, and Voyage: Inspired by Jules Verne. An official press release launching the game was published in Aachen in January 2002. In February 2002, Adventure Archiv released a preview and reported the game was due to be released on European shelves in March of that year. The preview displayed the main character with new facial features. Cryo Interactive also assigned the project to the new development studio T-Bot, which incorporated a new game design. The game was also reported to be coming out on CD and DVD for the MAC, however the release dates of these versions were not yet known.  Plot  The game is set under the sea in the 21st century, where during a scientific assignment, a young oceanographer enters into a strange type of submarine hidden on an undersea rock shelf. The vessel turns out to be the famous Nautilus which was abandoned a great many years earlier by Captain Nemo.  Gameplay  The game plays as a Myst-clone first-person adventure game, in which the player navigates through a series of computer generated screens to interact with the environment and solve puzzles.  Reception  By 2004, global sales of The Secret of the Nautilus had surpassed 117,000 copies. S√ºddeutsche Zeitung felt that while the game would attract fans of Jules Verne, they would become dismayed by the game's \\"combintion puzzles\\".

That first year he scored two tries in the Dragons' 1949 Grand Final victory over the South Sydney Rabbitohs and was the League's season top try scorer with 25 tries from 19 games. He made his representative debut for New South Wales that year and was selected for Australia's tour of New Zealand appearing in five minor matches and making his full representative debut in the 2nd Test in Auckland. Roberts is listed on the Australian Players Register as Kangaroo No. 269.ARL Annual Report 2005, page 53 Roberts was competition's leading try scorer in 1949 and 1950.http://www.jubileeavenue.com.au/history/ron_roberts.php In his three seasons with the Dragons, he scored 51 tries in 51 first grade games. Whiticker/Hudson \\"The Encyclopedia Of Rugby League Players (1995 Edition) () Defining moment For the first two Tests of the 1950 domestic Ashes series against Great Britain, Roberts was overlooked by selectors for other wingers including his club teammate Noel Pidding. The series was locked at 1‚Äìall after two games. The decider was played on a quagmire at the Sydney Cricket Ground and Roberts had regained his national wing spot after a one-year absence. Rain had been consistent in the lead up week and before the match forty tonnes of sand were dumped on the SCG to save the match from abandonment. Fourteen minutes from the end in pouring rain with the scores locked 2‚Äìall, Australia executed a back-line movement from a play-the-ball. A overlap developed by Doug McRitchie resulting in centre Keith Middleton sending the ball out to an unmarked Roberts who ran 40 metres and crossed in the corner for the only try of the match and a 5‚Äì2 win.

Willoch/Isaachsen (Store norske leksikon) Biography He was born in Mandal in Vest-Agder county Norway. Isaachsen belonged to a branch of an affluent and educated merchant family from Kjos in Kristiansand. He was the son of jurist Daniel Peter Christian Isaachsen, grandson of politician Isaach Isaachsen and great- grandson of Daniel Isaachsen (1744-1813), a Norwegian shipbuilder . He was the uncle of physicist Daniel Isaachsen, scientist Haakon Isaachsen (1867‚Äì1936), painter Herman Willoch and naval officer Odd Isaachsen Willoch. He attended Nissens Latin School in Christiania (now Oslo). He later studied under Joachim Frich and Johannes Flintoe at the Royal School of Drawing from 1850, in D√ºsseldorf from 1854 to 1859, and in Paris under Thomas Couture (1859-1860) and Gustave Courbet (1861-1862). After a visit to Italy he returned home in 1864 with a view to becoming an artist with a strong focus on archeology and history. He ultimately settled in Kristiansand, although with frequent periods spent abroad. His artistic style reflected naturalism and in later years impressionism. Isaachsen was regarded as one of Norway‚Äôs more prominent artists and great colourist with motives of the coast landscape of Southern Norway. He also painted a wide range of portraits. Moreover, he found a full valid artistic expression in Setesdalen. His art often reflected the valley's distinctive culture. He is represented with 24 works in the National Museum in Oslo (NM), former National Gallery of Norway.Isaachsen, Olaf (artnet.com) The Regional Museum in Kristiansand, S√∏rlandets Kunstmuseum (SKMU) has 58 works. Personal life Isaachsen was a knowledgeable and courteous man, a mixture of observation and locals, who spoke fluent German, Dutch, English, French and Italian. He was married in 1864 to Antonie (Toni) John Prehr (1838-1870). The couple had four children ‚Äì William (1865-1942), Eivind (1866-1926); Johanna Marie (1867-1872) and Harald (1869-1942). His wife died of tuberculosis when only 32 years old. Two years later his four-year-old daughter Johanna Marie died of diphtheria, and he was left with three small boys. He was the paternal grandfather of Sigurd Daniel Isaachsen Willoch, an art historian and director of the National Gallery of Norway.

Johnson was best known for his efforts in the 1970s and 1980s to build the Dallas Times Herald into one of the nation's most respected newspapers, which ultimately failed when the paper was purchased by its rival The Dallas Morning News in 1991 and promptly shut down. Johnson was born on August 24, 1934 in Huntington, West Virginia and graduated in 1953 from high school in Bristol, Tennessee. After completing high school, he took a job as a copyboy with the Bristol Herald Courier of Bristol, Virginia. He attended what is now East Tennessee State University. He worked for the newspaper while he was in college, serving in a succession of posts as sports writer, general assignments reporter, city editor and night editor. After graduating from college in 1960, he was hired as the chief copy editor of the Savannah Morning News in Georgia, and was promoted to city editor and was named managing editor of the paper at age 25, within six months of his hire at the Morning News.Martin, Douglas. \\"Kenneth Johnson, 74, Dies; Revitalized a Dallas Paper\\", The New York Times, November 7, 2008.

He was hired as night city editor by The Washington Post in 1966, and followed with a series of promotions to news editor, night managing editor, assistant production director, assistant general manager and vice president for operations. Johnson moved to Dallas in 1975 when he was named executive editor of the Dallas Times Herald. Johnson launched an effort to improve the paper's journalistic standards that resulted in the paper earning two Pulitzer Prizes; Erwin H. Hagler's feature photography for a series on the Western cowboy in 1980 and James B. Dickman's feature photography of life and death in El Salvador in 1983. A bitter competition arose between the Times Herald and The Dallas Morning News that improved reporting across the state but placed both publications in financial difficulty. Investigative coverage by the paper under Johnson included reports on police brutality, imbalances in city property tax appraisals and recruiting violations across football teams in the Southwest Conference. Johnson hired Bill Keller, later executive editor of The New York Times, and newspaper columnist / political commentator Molly Ivins. Johnson remained at the Times Herald until 1984. The Times Herald planned to print a story that would expose someone as a double agent of U.S. and Soviet intelligence. The article's subject threatened that he would commit suicide if the article was published and followed through on his threat after Johnson made the decision and the paper went ahead and printed the story in February 1976. Johnson stated that \\"if a story is newsworthy and supported by the facts, it is our policy to publish.\\"Clifford G. Christians, John P. Ferr√©, Mark Fackler.

In this movie, a young woman tries to escape what seems to be a family curse that is killing members of her family one by one. It was released in America at the 2009 After Dark Horrorfest film festival with the title Voices. Plot Kim Ga-in is a student in South Korea. She and her family come to her aunt Jee-sun's wedding but before the wedding, Jee-sun is pushed off the balcony and rushed to the hospital. Ga-in waits with her boyfriend, Park Hyun-joong, while her aunt recovers. They then witness Jee-sun's younger sister, Jung-sun, repeatedly stabbing her. Jung-sun is arrested for Jee-sun's murder, and held for questioning. It is revealed that the family believes they are cursed and at least one member dies in incomprehensible ways. In this case, Jung-sun was possessed and killed Jee-sun. At school, Jung Eun-kyung, the top student, attempts to kill Ga-in with scissors. During the struggle, Eun-kyung is stabbed instead and transfers to another school. That same day, Ga-in is confronted by her teacher, who blames her for Eun-kyung leaving and tries to kill her. Ga-in is saved by a classmate. Hong Seok-min, an eccentric student rumored to have killed his own father, advises Ga-in to trust no one, including herself. She visits Jung-sun to ask her about the murder. She tells her that Jee-sun's husband is Jung-sun's ex-boyfriend, and she had required revenge on Jee-sun. She says that an unknown force possessed her and coerced her to kill. That evening, the classmate that had saved her comes to have his try at killing her. She runs inside only to find her mother throwing knives at her. Frightened and no longer feeling safe inside her own home, Ga-in tells her father she is leaving. Her father tells her that there is a forgotten family member in a different village, named Hwang Dae-yong. On the bus, Ga-in meets Seok-min again, and together they visit Dae-yong. Dae-yong tells them how he killed his wife in a fit of jealousy when he learned of his wife's alleged affair, then tried to find the force that controlled him after being released from jail. After Ga-in and Seok-min return home, Dae-yong commits suicide to stay away from the curse. At school, Ga-in has an apparition of her best friend killing her and realizes that she really cannot trust anyone. One night she wakes up and finds her parents killed. It is divulged that Hyun- joong is the one who killed her parents. Hyun-joong stabs her as she tries to save her younger sister Ga-yeon, and wants to set the house on fire to turn it into hell. Both sisters stab him and leave him dead as the house begins to burn. In the hospital, Ga-in and Ga-yeon are placed in the same room. Ga-in is having nightmares and is woken by her sister. Ga-in has a hallucination of Ga- yeon taking a knife from her pocket; they struggle and the knife ends up stabbing Ga-yeon. Ga-yeon cries and asks Ga-in how she could do this to her own sister. Seok-min appears and exposes his true individuality: the curse. He can only be seen by Ga-in and the people he controls. Ga-in looks down at Ga- yeon and realizes that it wasn't a knife in her pocket, but instead a burnt family photo. Seok-min then tries to kill Ga-in. Ga-in stabs Seok-min, but in reality she stabs herself because he is controlling her from the inside. In the epilogue, a boy is being verbally assaulted by his teacher. After the teacher leaves, Hong Seok-min appears in a new body and asks the boy if he wants help to get back at the teacher.

The backline gear, including an 8x10\\" bass speaker cabinet, drums, and several powerful guitar amps, can be seen behind the two musicians in the front of the stage. The term backline is used in popular music and sound reinforcement system contexts to refer to electronic audio amplification equipment and speaker enclosures that are placed behind the band or the rhythm section on stage, including amplifiers and speaker cabinets for guitars, bass guitars and keyboards. Such equipment is often rented or leased by the band or their management, or provided by the venue. Speakers placed at the front of the stage facing the performers are also known as monitor speakers or \\"foldback.\\" The main speakers facing the audience are sometimes referred to as \\"Front of House Speakers.\\" History In rock music's early days in the early 1960s, PA systems were not very loud or powerful. As a result, 1960s rock bands typically used the PA system just for the vocals, even if they were playing at a large venue. As a result, the rhythm section musicians playing electric guitar, electric bass and keyboards were expected to produce enough volume to fill the venue using their own instrument amplifiers. To achieve venue-filling sound with their instruments, bands from the 1960s typically used large, powerful guitar \\"stacks\\" and big speaker enclosures. A standard cabinet used by bassists during this era was the heavy 8x10 cabinet, which contains eight ten-inch speakers. Guitarists used one or two 4x12 cabinets, referred to, respectively, as a half stack or (full) stack. During the 1960s, the PA speakers and the band's amplification were all set in a line, which conceptually grouped PA and instrument amplification together. This changed over the 1970s and 1980s, as PA systems became powerful enough to amplify all of the band's instruments and the vocals. During this era, the backline gear was set behind the PA speakers to create the modern audio stage set-up. Modern monitoring techniques, in which monitor speakers pointing at the performers are placed on the stage, as well as the concepts of frontline and backline, developed during this era. Backline equipment can be rented for concert tours. Many travelling musicians prefer not to transport their own gear across borders and continents for fear of damage or customs hassles. In some countries, all electronic and electric gear needs documentation and certification by an electrical expert before it can be brought into the country. Another issue is that some bands may travel to a country or continent which uses a different type of AC mains power and differently-shaped electric plugs. Festivals and venues provide backline gear because it speeds up the process of changing bands on a stage, because the gear does not have to be moved on and off the stage and then soundchecked again. Having professional backline gear means that the sound engineers do not have to deal with modest-quality amps, which may have ground loops, hum or noise, or produce unintended clipping when the amp is pushed to its maximum volume. The Black Crowes at the Hammerstein Ballroom. Top bands may have very specific backline requirements, including a list of amplifiers and instruments, but also the brand names and model numbers. An emerging group on its first small club tour will not usually have the negotiating leverage to request specific brands and models of backline gear. As such, an emerging band's backline \\"technical specifications\\" request as part of its contract may only ask venue managers for general types of equipment, while a top touring band's contract rider may specify, for example, an Ampeg SVT Pro bass amplifier and 8x10\\" Ampeg cabinet for the bassist and a Fender Bandmaster amp head and a Fender 4x10\\" speaker cabinet for the electric guitarist. Roles Backline guitar technicians, audio technicians and stage crew set up and put away the backline equipment. Backline gear that is used heavily will need regular maintenance to ensure that it provides reliable performance. In places where the backline is left in place indefinitely (e.g., in a nightclub's mainstage or a TV variety show studio), the gear may simply be powered down when not in use, and a cloth may be placed over top of the equipment so it does not get dusty. In music festivals with outdoor temporary stages, the backline equipment may have to be transported to a locked, climate-controlled storage area at the end of each day, to protect it from theft, vandalism, or inclement weather. Backline techs who travel with touring acts may also be called roadies, although the road crew's role typically is limited to transporting and positioning the instruments and gear. Maintenance and repair of instruments and gear is a specialized task handled by guitar, keyboard and drum technicians.

Due to the talent of Bert Williams and Malcolm Finlayson, he had to wait until 1 November 1958 to make his first team debut, in a 2‚Äì1 defeat to West Bromwich Albion. He managed 35 appearances for Wolves, including playing in the 1960 Charity Shield, before moving to their Midlands neighbours Aston Villa in February 1961. He broke through to their starting XI and played in their 1961 League Cup triumph over Rotherham United. After 88 games in total for Villa, he joined Scunthorpe United in January 1965 and was a near-ever present in the 1965-66 season for them before losing his spot to the emerging Ray Clemence. He had a spell playing in America with the New York Generals during 1967-68 when signed by his former Scunthorpe manager Freddie Goodwin. He later followed Goodwin back to England to join Brighton and Hove Albion in January 1969 before retiring in 1971. Sidebottom appeared on the US game show What's My Line! which aired on CBS on Sunday 11 June 1967. He died on 3 November 2008, aged 71.

Overview The game War and Peace by Mark McLaughlin ‚Äì according to BGG listings his first published game ‚Äì is a multi-player strategic war game from the early 1980s. \\"Mr Lincoln's War\\", a similar game of the American Civil War, was also published in the mid-1980s but is now a very rare collector's item. Since the year 2000 Mr McLaughlin has also published several card-driven games for GMT Games set in the Napoleonic period, including \\"The Napoleonic Wars\\" (another multi-player strategic game of the whole war), \\"Wellington\\" (on the Peninsular War), and \\"Kutuzov\\" (on Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812). =Components= The functional unit counters, typical of the 1980s, represent strengths of 5,000 infantry, cavalry (representing a smaller number of men but able to move independently), or 6 ships (either warships or transports). The art is colourful and very simple and functional by today's standards. There are around 50 leader counters, which play a key role in the game, as they are needed to move infantry and are rated for their ability in combat. Apart from a handful of incompetents rated \\"0\\" (e.g. Joseph Bonaparte or the Spanish Cuesta), most leaders are rated \\"1\\". Most countries have a few leaders of above-average ability, rated \\"2\\": Britain has Sir John Moore, France has Davout, Lannes, Soult and Mass√©na, Prussia has Blucher, Austria has Schwarzenberg and the Archduke Charles, whilst Russia has Bagration, Barclay de Tolly and Kutuzov. Finally Napoleon and Wellington (who were, according to McLaughlin in \\"The General\\", \\"in a league of their own\\") are rated \\"3\\". Most countries have a few \\"anonymous\\" leaders rated \\"0\\" who are used to move forces when no named general is available. Bernadotte is represented by two counters - he is a French Marshal until 1810, and then Swedish (Russian satellite) thereafter, and as in reality may well find himself fighting the French. There is only one naval leader, the British Admiral Nelson. Some leaders become available during the course of the game, and leaders may be killed in battle. The map is divided into 4 individual boards: Spain, France, Prussia/Austria and Russia. Turkey and the Balkans are not shown or included in the game (in the campaign game Russia may be required to withdraw troops to fight one or more wars against the Turks; Britain may also be required to withdraw infantry, fleets and transports to fight the War of 1812 against the USA). Many of the scenarios can be played on just two boards (usually Boards 2 and 3). A hexagonal grid is printed on the map and it is common to reference each hex by a series of letters and numbers followed by the board number in parentheses. For example, Paris is CC9(2). There are a number of very well known errors on the board, e.g. Frankfurt am Main is shown in a different hex to the River Main, whilst an erroneous river (allegedly a railway line copied onto the map by mistake) is shown near Kiev. These do not materially affect play. The map shows the boundaries of 1805, with Tyrol and Venetia still included in Austria, and Prussia and Austria controlling Poland (Posen, Thorn and Warsaw are shown as in Prussia) following the Third Partition of that country in 1795. Aside from the counters and the board, there is a Campaign Game Card, a Player Aid Card, and the rules. There is a leader display on the player aid card (on which stacks of infantry can be kept in their commanding general's box, reducing clutter on the map), while the alliance chart, force pools, and prisoners are on the campaign game card. Player sides are: France (blue), Spain (yellow), Britain (red), Austria (white), Prussia (gray), and Russia (green). The markers for Fortresses, entrenchments and demoralization are black. Tactical matrix markers (see below) are white. Strength points are also rated for what the game calls \\"morale\\" (a proxy for troop quality). Militia, landwehr, partisans and cossacks rate \\"0\\". Regular infantry (yellow lettering for minor countries, or black for Prussian, Austrian or Spanish regulars) rate \\"1\\". British, Russian and French infantry (white lettering) rate \\"2\\". French and Russian Guards rate \\"3\\". The total morale of a force is that of the largest number of strength points within it. Most minor countries have forces. Some of these (e.g. Denmark, Sweden, Poland or Bavaria) are quite large minor powers, deploying cavalry, leaders (e.g. Bernadotte in his Swedish incarnation or Poniatowski) or fleets. Others are smaller, and some are only token forces (e.g. French forces raised in Spain and Portugal) of a single strength point. Some minor countries (e.g. Poland or Westphalia - northern Germany) do not exist until called into existence by the French player. Minor countries' counters are the colour of their major patron, although with yellow lettering. Some minor countries have two sets of counters, (e.g. Saxony which may be either a Prussian or a French satellite or Holland which may be either pro-British or pro-French, the latter at any rate until she is annexed to France and her forces incorporated into the French force pool in 1810). =Scenarios= There are 10 Scenarios in War & Peace: * Austerlitz 1805. Napoleon must overwhelm Mack's forces at Ulm, then march on Vienna and defeat the Russo-Austrian forces. * Jena to Friedland 1806-7. Napoleon must overwhelm the Prussian forces in Saxony, but must then conquer the whole of Prussia by the following summer - the Russians can win by holding Warsaw or Konigsberg. * Wagram 1809. A resurgent Austria (her army now enlarged with landwehr) invades Bavaria in conjunction with a German rising and a British landing at Walcheren Island. Napoleon, returning from Spain, must defeat all these and march on Vienna again. * Napoleon in Russia 1812. Napoleon invades Russia with vast forces (as many French satellite as native French) which may melt away to attrition by the time he reaches Moscow. * The War of German Liberation 1813. For the first time Napoleon has to take on Russia, Prussia and Austria at the same time. The game box describes scenarios 4 and 5 as \\"massive\\" and \\"finely-balanced\\". * Napoleon at Bay 1814. With the tiny remnants of his army, Napoleon tries to keep the Allies out of Paris. Scenarios 4, 5 and 6 may be linked, which gives the French player the option of consolidating his advance at Smolensk instead of trying to defeat Russia in a single year. * Waterloo 1815. This scenario is essentially impossible for the French to win - even if Napoleon defeats Wellington and Blucher, he still has large Austrian and Russian forces with which to contend. The rules recommend that the players play the scenario twice, swapping sides to see who does better. * The Peninsular War 1808-14. The French Marshals (Napoleon himself is present only briefly in 1808) try to capture every city from Spanish and Portuguese militia and partisans, the latter aided by the small British Army under Wellington. It is commonly held that this is almost impossible for the French to win. * The Peninsular War 1811-14. As above, but concentrating on the Allied resurgence. The tenth scenario is a campaign game, which was added as an afterthought to link the scenarios together. This is very long: there are 120 month-long turns. At the start of the campaign game in 1805 France and Spain are at war with Britain, Austria and Russia, with Prussia neutral. France may win by conquering Russia, Spain or Britain; otherwise victory would be determined by adding up the number of objective cities controlled by each power (Spain doubled for the sake of play balance). The game would end if France is conquered (Paris captured) twice, as after a first conquest Napoleon is deemed to go into exile on Elba, a die being rolled on each turn thereafter until he returns (there is a slim chance that he may be killed by Royalist French troops on his way back). \\"The General\\" Magazine Volume 26 Number 6 introduced a new scenario, Marengo - The Italian Campaign of 1800. =Turn Sequence= * French Turn Attrition Phase Alliance Phase Reinforcement Phase Movement Phase Combat Phase'' * Non-French Turn Attrition Phase Alliance Phase Reinforcement Phase Movement Phase Combat Phase'' * Advance Turn Marker =Attrition Phase= Attrition is when forces are reduced in size to represent the effects of disease and desertion. A single die roll is made on the attrition table and then applied to all the hexes where you have forces (as a house rule, some players roll separately for each force to reduce the role of luck). There is a column for every strength value - the larger the force, the more severe attrition will be, but stacks of 5 Strength Points or less are immune, which rewards players for keeping their armies in corps-sized stacks (see below for how such stacks can reinforce one another in combat). There are DRMs that apply (e.g. attrition is more severe in winter, and in Spain and Russia where it was harder for armies to live off the land; all units in their home country get a -1 DRM whereas unsupplied units get a +1 DRM). If more than one strength point is to be lost then one of them must be cavalry if there is one in the hex. Neutral countries are immune from attrition, enabling a defeated major power to rebuild their forces until they rejoin the war. =Alliance Phase= Diplomacy takes place in the alliance phase. This system is used to allow nations to ally with one another. Alliances essentially allow you to acquire the use of another nation's forces. Each scenario has its own effects chart. For example, in 1805 Prussia is more likely to enter the war if French forces cross her territory as Bernadotte did in reality. In the 1812 scenario, a roll in the Napoleon in Russia table can allow the French to gain Austrians, cause Prussian and Austrians to desert, force Napoleon to return to Paris to stop a coup d'√©tat, or postpone more rolls on the table until November 1812. In any scenario, a defeat for Napoleon gives a large modifier to the Allies. If allied to France, a major power may be required to send a small expeditionary force under a randomly chosen commander to aid the French (e.g. La Romana's Spanish force which had to be rescued from Denmark by British ships when Spain changed sides in 1808, the Russian forces which assisted the French invasion of Austria in 1809 or more famously the Prussian and Austrian forces, under Yorck and Schwarzenberg, which assisted Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812). When there are not enough players to fill out each of the seats in the campaign game, there are rules for automatically determining the outcome of alliances. This is problematic as France receives points for controlling blocs of minor countries (e.g. in Italy and Germany), so it is easy to end up with all the continental powers allied to France. An alternative diplomacy table on www.grognard.com can be used instead for a campaign game with fewer than 6 players. The War and Peace kit from Dear Valley is also worth studying. =Reinforcement Phase= Production ‚Äì There are reinforcements in every scenario, but production rules are only used in the campaign game. Essentially each power receives a number of production points (zero, one or two according to the die roll) for each controlled production city - normally the capital - in the homeland. Each type of strength point has a different cost (e.g. 2 for cavalry, 1 for infantry, or 0.5 for militia or landwehr) in production points. French replacements are increased if Napoleon is in Paris (in between campaigns, obviously), while Britain may grant production points by sea transport, which increases the chances of the recipient allying with Britain. Some cities, e.g. Prague (part of Austria at the time) may only produce landwehr. Once Spain and Portugal are at war with France, they may produce large numbers of militia and partisans at any city in their homeland. =Movement= Leaders have a movement allowance of 10 MP, cavalry have a movement allowance of 4 MP, and infantry 3 MP, although they cannot move without a leader. Infantry units can be dropped off but not picked up during movement. Rivers cost an extra MP to cross (unless there is a friendly city in the hex), making them quite formidable obstacles. You can attempt to increase movement by 1, 2, or 3 MP using Forced March - the more MPs you try to obtain, the more likely it is that the attempt will fail and you will suffer loss of forces. However French forces have a favourable modifier which makes a forced march of 1 MP almost certain to be obtained, giving French infantry a movement allowance of 4 MP for practical purposes. Overrun attacks can occur during movement. If you spend 1 extra MP and have 4:1 odds (5:1 odds on a mountain hex), you destroy all enemy units without loss. If you have 6:1 odds you can overrun without spending a movement point. =Supply= Essentially, a unit must trace supply to a major city through a chain of friendly strength points (i.e. of the same colour - you can't trace through allies) up to 3 hexes long. A weak French supply chain might be broken by Spanish partisans or Russian cossacks. A supply chain cannot be traced through enemy units, but a unit in a city that is also besieged by enemies is always in supply (albeit subject to more stringent attrition). Unsupplied units' combat strength is halved (round up) when attacking, they may not execute overruns, and there are adjustments to the attrition roll and the forced march roll. =Combats and Sieges= The active player indicates which hexes he will attack before resolving any combat. If combat takes place in a non-city hex, it is automatically a field battle. A city-hex may have a field battle or a siege depending on the choice of the defending player. Once an attack is indicated at least one combat round must be fought. Between rounds the attacker may attempt to bring up strength points from neighboring hexes to the fight (a 5 or greater including leadership DRM is needed). That unit must be withdrawn from any ongoing combat first (you can withdraw after each round of combat). Thus, forces involved in a particular battle may change from round to round. To illustrate this consider that the French are being attacked by the British in EE7(2) and the Prussians are attacking the French in Lille EE6(2). In round 1, the British fight in EE7(2) and in round 2 the Prussians must fight in EE6(2), but in the next round, the British might withdraw some forces to Prussian-held FF6(2), which will then be available for Prussia in round 2 (assuming the 5 or greater roll succeeds). Round 2 consists of fights in both hexes EE6 and EE7, but now the Prussian siege in Lille is reinforced. This can go on for more rounds until one side is completely eliminated or the battle is broken off. If the attacker stops the fight, the defender (inactive player) can counterattack with the same method (note that in this case, the unsupplied forces of the counterattacking army are not halved). Forces that are adjacent to a battle can participate in the battle without moving to the battle hex - being adjacent is enough. To resolve combat, you total strength and the largest side divides its force by the smallest side. There are three odds ratios: 2:1 (and up), 3:2, and 1:1. There are rows for each of these in a Combat Results Table. Combat may continue for several rounds, and each round, the player with the strongest force rolls 2D6 applying modifiers for leadership, morale, terrain effects, and (if using the optional rules) tactics. Then you find the result in the table for the relevant odds ratio. Above it will be two columns (like in the header of a table) and the left side applies to the larger force, the right side to the smaller force. As an example, suppose two armies clash, one led by Napoleon (leader rating 3) and one Bagration (leader rating 2). In the French army there are 20 strength points and Bagration leads an army of 8. Odds then are 2:1 plus and there is a net 1 increase for Napoleon's tactical advantage. Suppose it takes place in a forest hex though, so there is a -1 adjustment as well. Two dice are rolled and the result is an 8. There is no net adjustment so the result for 8 is searched for in the 2:1 row. The result for the larger force is ‚Äú1‚Äù and for the smaller force ‚ÄúD1‚Äù. This means that the smaller force is immediately demoralized. The Combat Loss chart is then consulted. Bagration's army of 8 in the D1 Row means 2 SP are lost, whereas Napoleon's 20 lose 2 as well. A \\"D\\" result requires that side to lose at least one strength point of cavalry, and the loser must retreat, and must also lose an additional strength point if he is inferior in cavalry to the winner. Sieges work only slightly differently. 6 Strength Points may take refuge in a major city (4 in a minor city). A city may be assaulted or besieged. If assaulted, the defenders' combat strength is doubled (some players triple them as a house rule, making a strongly defended city even harder to assault), but a garrison of only a single strength point will still be eliminated if it takes any kind of combat loss, making small French garrisons in the Peninsular War vulnerable to Spanish partisans. If besieged, a player puts a siege marker with a value of 1 in the first combat phase and increases it each subsequent combat phase. The besieger may now roll and if the result is less than or equal to the marker the city falls and all units are taken prisoner. The value of siege points taken (which can never be greater than 5) is also added to the attrition roll of the besieged force. Naval Rules They are used only in the campaign game and consist of blockades of ports and skirmishes per sea zone (Baltic, North Sea, Atlantic and Mediterranean). There is a separate chart to see what happens when fleets come together (an alternative naval combat table was published in \\"The General\\"). As in reality, Britain has roughly as many naval units as all other countries combined. Control of the seas is critical for transport in the campaign game. An unwary French player may lose naval bases or even an insufficiently garrisoned Paris to British naval expeditions. =Optional Rules= The Tactical Matrix allows each player to (secretly) select a battlefield tactic which when cross-checked against the enemy tactic gives a possibility of a positive (or negative) DRM to the combat roll. There are some other optional rules, including a limited intelligence rule (where you don't check stack contents until a battle takes place). There are also a number of variants and FAQs on the net. A French force commanded by Napoleon may \\"commit the Imperial Guard\\" to battle for the coup de grace - the entire morale of the French force is deemed to be \\"3\\" for that round of combat, but all losses must come from Imperial Guard strength points. Although this is common, an overstretched French player may decide, like Napoleon at Borodino, that it is better to keep the Guard to fight another day. Token forces of British, Prussian or Spanish Guards (one strength point each) may be added to the game but these have little effect on play. Reception R. A. Salvatore comments: \\"I've played them all and that's the one that had me lying in bed for hours and hours, working up multi-turn strategies for blasting my enemy's supply lines, or creating a back-alley run to Paris. That's the game, with its simple elegance yet multitude of tactics, that offered to me exactly the right amount of information to juggle. Neither overwhelming nor underwhelming, too hot nor too cold, too big nor too small, too soft nor too hard, War and Peace fit this duck's bill.\\" Reviews * Casus Belli #17 (Oct 1983) Other Many other games have dealt with the same period of time, e.g. Avalon Hill's \\"Empires in Arms\\". War and Peace: 1796-1815 is a computer game. In Glasnost The Game (1989), which was inspired by a Cypriot peace builder, the winner is the player who manages to disarm their territories first.

Biography  Kartika Affandi was born in Jakarta in 1934, the only child of artists Affandi and Maryati. Kartika in 1952 married R.M. Saptohoedojo, a painter. She had eight children. Kartika's relationship with her husband was strained by his polygamy and also his stinginess with the paint they shared, and they divorced in 1972. In 1985, she married Austrian Gerhard Koberl, a yoga and meditation teacher. They separated in 1994 and divorced in 2001.  Artistic career  From the age of seven, Kartika was instructed by Affandi in how to paint with fingers and tubes directly on the canvas. Any mixing of colours is done on her hands and wrists. Kartika has no permanent studio; like Affandi, she prefers to paint outside in the village environment where she interacts directly with her subjects and on- lookers. This contrasts with most contemporary Indonesian painters, who work in their studios from mind-images, memory, photographs or sketches. Born in 1930s, when men still dominated the art world, Kartika is among a small group of women painters who from the mid-1980s succeeded in exhibiting their work on a regular basis and in gaining limited critical recognition. Even in this context, Kartika's art has been described as unique, ranging from conventional to subversive. In a culture where the individual self rarely is put to the fore, Kartika had made the self-portrait one of her main themes. In a society where emotion is suppressed, both publicly and privately, Kartika fills her canvases with intense feeling. In a culture where genitals are considered taboo in representation, Kartika has painted her own nudity graphically and without the prescribed, distancing sweetness, never depicting the body as an object of pleasure, whether that of others or her own. Given their close bond, Kartika painted penetrating portraits of her father, right through to his final years of debilitating illness. Another provocative portrait, Hindu Priest, shows an old man, close up, as he walks on a beach. His face is preoccupied, intense - a face that might have been taken from an Ingmar Bergman movie. There is nothing here of the glamour, romance or mystical aura that so often characterises images from Bali such as in O.H. Supono's Balinese Priest. =Focus= Following in the populist footsteps of Affandi, Kartika has often painted rural and dispossessed people such as fishermen, farmers, workers and beggars. Since these individuals pose while interacting with her and exchanging life histories as she paints, these must be considered portraits. Although narrative, her paintings when viewed close up dissolve into strong, abstract statements in energetically applied impasto oils. Kartika's work ranges from the sweet and idyllic to an expressive realism that can be harsh. The latter is evident in her paintings of beggars, handicapped people and suffering animals and in her uncompromising depiction of the progress of old age, whether painting a stranger, her father, or herself. Kartika's career experienced a resurgence around 1980, when she studied painting restoration in Austria to enable her to repair Affandi's deteriorating paintings. Here, solitude and reflection paved the way for her most unusual portraits. Travels and exhibitions Kartika received international critical praise for her work in the 1990s.essay entitled \\"Kartika Affandi-K√∂berl : rebirthing woman as a modern artist\\" by Astri Wright plus 46 plates of the artists paintings - * She visited Australia in 1991 for an exhibition that covered Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne..

Several isomers are possible, but none are sufficiently stable to be of practical value. Substituted disilynes contain a formal silicon‚Äìsilicon triple bond and as such are sometimes written R2Si2 (where R is a substituent group). They are the silicon analogues of alkynes. The term silyne has two diverse meanings. Some chemists use it to refer to compounds containing a silicon‚Äìsilicon triple bond,Egon Wiberg, Arnold Frederick Holleman (2001) Inorganic Chemistry, Elsevier whereas others use the term to refer to compounds containing a silicon‚Äìcarbon triple bond by analogy to silene, which often refers to compounds containing silicon‚Äìcarbon double bonds. The term polysilyne can refer to the layer polymer (SiH)n or substituted derivatives.  Substituted disilynes  The structure of the first disilyne characterised The first example isolated and characterised by X-ray crystallography is an emerald green crystalline compound reported in 2004. This molecule has the formula R'_2RSi-Si#Si- SiRR'_2, where R' = HC(SiMe3)2 and R = HCMe2. It was prepared by the reduction of the related tetrabrominated precursor by potassium graphite (KC8). It is air- and moisture-sensitive but is a stable solid up to 128 ¬∞C. The geometry of the central four-silicon chain is unlike that of analogous carbon structures. Whereas substituted alkynes are linear, having a 180¬∞ bond angle at each end of the carbon‚Äìcarbon triple bond, the silicon chain is bent to 137¬∞ at each end. The four silicon atoms in the chain are however perfectly coplanar, with the first and fourth silicon atoms trans to one another. The central triple bond length is 206 pm, which is around 4% shorter than the typical bond-length of Si‚ÄìSi double bonds (214 pm)) and the Si‚ÄìSi single bonds are 237 pm. The colour is attributed to a weak œÄ‚ÄìœÄ* transition. Calculations show a bond order of 2.6. An alternative calculation of the bond order by a different group describes the bonding as essentially due to only two electron pairs, with the third pair in a non-bonding orbital. Reaction of this compound with phenylacetylene produced a 1,2 disilabenzene. Other workers have also reported another related compound which contains a hexasila-3-yne chain: :R3Si(SiR3)SiMeSi2SiMe(SiR3)SiR3 :where Me = methyl and R = t-butyl In this compound, the Si‚ÄìSi triple bond length was calculated as 207 pm. Heavier group 14 analogues Triple bonded compounds of the heavier members of group 14 have also been prepared; lead, and tin and germanium (digermyne) The cores of the disilyne, digermyne, distannyne, and diplumbyne have similarly bent geometries. These findings are generally consistent with the absence of conventional triple bonds.

Ecology Gustavia superba grows naturally as an understory tree, where it is abundant, especially in secondary forests . It appreciates abundant moisture, sun and well drained soil. It branches little until mature, and has a bunch of leaves at the top, so that it resembles a palm. Seeds are dispersed by agoutis. The leaves are a favourite food of iguanas. Fruit It bears rounded pear shaped fruit, on the trunk (cauliflorous). Inside the hard green shell are several large seeds about 4 cm in diameter. The yellowish-orange pulp is edible, is usually boiled after which it is said to resemble meat in taste. It is rich in A, B and C vitamins. Distribution The tree is not widely known outside its native range from Ecuador to Panama and Venezuela, but has been planted in tropical botanical gardens, including in Singapore (where it is referred to as 'pungol') and Australia.http://floraofsingapore.wordpress.com/2011/04/14/gustavia- superba/http://botanybucketlist.wordpress.com/ Gustavia superba flower References superba Category:Flora of Panama Category:Flora of Colombia Category:Flora of Ecuador Category:Plants described in 1856 ","title":"Gustavia superba"},{"id":"20109952","text":"RAF Harrowbeer is former Royal Air Force airfield situated next to Yelverton in the parish of Buckland Monachorum, Devon England Location RAF Harrowbeer was located approximately NNE of the city of Plymouth and approximately south of Tavistock, and also sits within the boundary of Dartmoor National Park. Roborough Rock is a tor-like igneous rock outcrop immediately south-west of the airfield (officially called 'Udal Tor') on Roborough Down, next to the border with the A386. This location created problems for the airfield during the Second World War, mainly due to bad weather. The Rock seems to have had little impact on the use of the Airfield, the only thing that was done by the RAF was the placing of a warning light on the top. There seems to be no truth in the widely-held belief that the RAF attempted to blow it up. Although sited near the village of Yelverton, it was called 'Harrowbeer' in order to distinguish it from the similar-sounding RNAS Yeovilton which had recently changed its name from HMS Heron when the Airfield opened on 15 August 1941. The airfield was under the control of No. 10 Group RAF and was never assigned a station badge. The former Ravenscroft School became the officers' mess.RAF HARROWBEER YELVERTON Miscellaneous Information Canadian pilot Jack Brown, of 193 Squadron, recounts his first training flight in the relatively new, and daunting, Typhoon fighter-bomber at Harrowbeer: > \\"We were understandably in awe of the Tiffie's size and power.

Career Farningham trained as a youth with Dundee United before beginning his senior career with Forfar Athletic, making his debut towards the end of the 1970s. In his seven years at Station Park, Farningham was part of the sides which won the 1983‚Äì84 Scottish Second Division title and which earlier reached the 1981‚Äì82 Scottish Cup semi-final, losing to Rangers after a replay. Full-time football beckoned for Farningham and he joined Motherwell for ¬£12,000 in 1986. Farningham spent three years at Fir Park before a similar spell at East End Park with Dunfermline Athletic. In the early 1990s, Farningham joined Partick Thistle, again for three years, before returning to his hometown to join Dundee. Two years after signing, Farningham began to combine playing duties with coaching the youngsters at Dens Park, and at the end of his career, returned to first club Forfar on loan, scoring once during his temporary stay. Following his retirement from playing, Farningham continued as a coach at Dundee, stepping up to coach the senior players before becoming assistant to Jim Duffy. In July 2001 and prior to Duffy's arrival, Farningham received a three-month dugout ban after his behaviour during an under-21 match two months previously. In September 2005, Farningham returned to Forfar as manager, taking over from Brian Fairley, who had resigned. Farningham won his first two matches and kept Forfar in the Second Division but left in May 2006 to become chief scout at divisional rivals Gretna, who had won the championship that season. Farningham was made redundant in 2008 following Gretna's demise and was working on a building site before returning to Dundee in November 2008 as Jocky Scott's assistant. Farningham was appointed interim manager of Montrose in March 2011, and given the post permanently in early April. Farningham returned to Dundee as assistant manager in May 2012.

Laid down as PCS-1439 on 5 September 1943 at Jacksonville, Florida, by the Gibbs Gas Engine Co.; redesignated YMS-471 on 27 September 1943; launched on 23 May 1944; and commissioned on 27 October 1944. Service history =World War II= Following brief shakedown training, YMS-471 proceeded to Charleston, South Carolina, and began escorting coastwise convoys and conducting minesweeping operations. That duty ended in April 1945 when she was transferred to the Pacific Fleet. After a long voyage which took her by way of the Panama Canal, San Diego, Pearl Harbor, Eniwetok, Guam, and Saipan, the minesweeper finally joined the 3rd Fleet off Okinawa in June. During the last week of the month, she and the other ships of Mine Squadron (MinRon) 105 swept mines from the Buckner Bay, Kerama Retto, and Unten Ko areas of the Ryukyus. In July, YMS-471 ventured into the East China Sea for mine disposal operations. =Post-war= At the time Japan capitulated, the minesweeper was undergoing repairs at San Pedro Bay, Leyte, Philippines. Soon thereafter, she headed north to begin the monumental job of clearing mines from waters around Japan for transports bringing American occupation forces and supporting shipping. She concentrated on sweeping the approaches to the island of Honsh≈´ and remained at the task from 8 September 1945 until 20 February 1946, when she began preparations for the voyage back to the United States. The minesweeper reached the west coast in April 1946 and returned home to Charleston in June to begin demobilization. Though never actually decommissioned, she remained inactive at Charleston until early in 1947, when she embarked upon a refresher training cruise in the West Indies. She also participated in a fleet exercise held off Cuba. On 18 March 1947, near the conclusion of the exercise, YMS-471 was renamed Verdin and was re-designated AMS-38. After a tour of duty at Yorktown, Virginia, serving as a training platform for the students of the Mine Warfare School, Verdin returned to Charleston in November where she remained until the following spring. In April 1948, she entered the Charleston Naval Shipyard for repairs and then put to sea once again for refresher training put of Norfolk, Virginia. In November, the minesweeper participated in cold weather fleet exercises off Newfoundland before returning to warmer waters. This time, she reported to Panama City, Florida, for duty at the Navy's mine countermeasures research facility. For the next six years, Verdin alternated between mine warfare research duty at Panama City and mine warfare school ship operations at Yorktown. Periodic overhauls, mine and convoy exercises, and refresher training punctuated these two primary assignments. In November 1954, Verdin transferred back to Charleston where she became flagship for Mine Division 43. She spent her last eight active months there as an operational unit of the Mine Force. On 7 February 1955, she was redesignated MSC(O)-38. On 1 July 1955, she reported to Green Cove Springs, Florida, for inactivation. There, she went into reserve on 30 August 1955. A little over four years later, on 1 November 1959, her name was struck from the Navy List. No documents have been found giving details of her final disposition.

It is native to temperate Eurasia, from Poland to Japan, to the north of the Indian subcontinent and to northern Indochina.Flora of China v 25 p 92, Â∞èÁ∫¢Èó®ÂÖ∞Â±û xiao hong men lan shu, Ponerorchis They can be found in evergreen forests and meadows in temperate, mountainous regions. The species Ponerorchis chidorii, endemic to Japan, is also known to grow epiphytically. In the horticultural trade, this genus is abbreviated as \\"Pnr\\". A wide range of mostly cultivars of Ponerorchis graminifolia are in cultivation, but are rarely grown outside Japan. Description Ponerorchis species grow from an ovoid tuber. They are slender plants with one to three usually slightly fleshy leaves. The flowers are all borne on the same side of the stem. The upper sepal and the two lateral petals form a hood. The column is short and has obvious side appendages. There is a rostellum separating the pollinia from the stigma. The genus was substantially expanded in 2014, so older descriptions do not necessarily apply to the revised genus. Ponerorchis was said to be differentiated from Amitostigma and Neottianthe by the presence of a bursicle or \\"sac\\" around the viscidium (a sticky pad at the base of the pollinium). However, this feature was found to be present in some species formerly assigned to Amitostigma and to be difficult to detect in some species of Ponerorchis. In the expanded genus, a bursicle is present is some species and not in others. Taxonomy =Phylogeny and classification= The genus Ponerorchis was erected by Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach in 1852 for the species Ponerorchis graminifolia. Phylogenetic studies between 1997 and 2003 showed that Ponerorchis, when broadly defined, formed a clade with the genera Amitostigma, Neottianthe and Hemipilia. Ponerorchis, as then circumscribed, was not monophyletic. In 2003, in advance of further studies involving more species, Ponerorchis was broadened to include Chusua, and an \\"orphan\\" species was transferred from Ponerorchis to become Hemipilia brevicalcarata. A more detailed molecular phylogenetic study in 2014 confirmed the strong relationship between Amitostigma, Neottianthe and Ponerorchis, whose species were mixed together in a single clade, making none of the three genera monophyletic as then circumscribed. Amitostigma and Neottianthe were subsumed into Ponerorchis, making it a considerably larger genus. Ponerorchis was previously distinguished from related genera by the presence of bursicles (pouchlike receptacles) enclosing the pollinia. The presence or absence of a bursicle was found not to be a useful diagnostic character, having arisen independently at least four times in the Orchideae. Ponerorchis is placed in the orchid subfamily Orchidoideae, tribe Orchideae, subtribe Orchidineae. After the genera were re-circumscribed as explained above, the relationship between Ponerorchis and the rest of the subtribe is as shown in the cladogram below. =Species= Species accepted as of March 2018: * Ponerorchis alpestris (Fukuy.)

In it, he or she solemnly declares him or herself to be faithful to the Protestant faith.Callum G. Brown and Michael Snape, Secularisation in the Christian World, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2010, p. 62 The altered declaration is as follows: > \\"I [here insert the name of the Sovereign] do solemnly and sincerely in the > presence of God profess, testify, and declare that I am a faithful > Protestant, and that I will, according to the true intent of the enactments > which secure the Protestant succession to the Throne of my Realm, uphold and > maintain the said enactments to the best of my powers according to law.\\" This declaration differs from the original one in that it places emphasis on the sovereign being a Protestant, whereas the previous wording placed emphasis on denunciation of Roman Catholicism. The declaration is usually made either at the opening of the first parliament of the new monarch's reign (i.e. during the State Opening of Parliament) or, as in the case of King George VI, at his coronation.House of Commons Research Briefings: The Coronation Oath. see: Coronation of Their Majesties King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Cambridge University Press Background The Bill of Rights of 1689 required, among other things, that any monarch succeeding to the throne take the declaration as laid out by the Test Act of 1678;Referred to in the bill as \\"...Act for the more effectuall Preserveing the Kings Person and Government by disableing Papists from sitting in either House of Parlyament...\\" Reiterated by section 2 of the Act of Settlement 1701.Act of Settlement 1701, section 2 The form of the declaration was: > I, A.

The declaration, in that form, was originally administered under the Test Acts to all civil and military officials of the Crown, including the monarch him- or herself (starting with William and Mary). Following Catholic Emancipation, the law was changed to require only the monarch (who remained Supreme Head of the Church of England) to take the oath. However, when Edward VII took the throne, he was unhappy at the pointedly anti-Catholic wording of the oath (viewing it as outdated and unnecessarily offensive to Catholics, of whom he had several in his private social circle), and wished to have it changed before the next succession. When he died in 1910, his successor, George V, who agreed with his father's sentiments, made it known that he would refuse to open parliament as long as he was obliged to make the declaration in its then- current form. Prime Minister H. H. Asquith agreed with the king, and the Act was passed through the then-sitting parliament before the new king was required to open the new parliament.

Outer Tibet, which roughly corresponded to √ú-Tsang and western Kham, would \\"remain in the hands of the Tibetan Government at Lhasa under Chinese suzerainty\\", but China would not interfere in its administration. \\"Inner Tibet\\", roughly, equivalent to Amdo and eastern Kham, would be under the jurisdiction of the Chinese government. The convention with its annexes also defines the boundary between Tibet and China proper and that between Tibet and British India (the latter to be known as the McMahon Line). A draft convention was initialled by all three countries on 27 April 1914, but China immediately repudiated it. A slightly revised convention was signed again on 3 July 1914, but only by Britain and Tibet. The Chinese plenipotentiary, Ivan Chen, declined to sign it. : \\"Ivan Chen, who had initialed the first earlier in April, kept his own counsel.\\" The British and Tibetan plenipotentiaries then attached a bilateral declaration to the effect that the convention would be binding on themselves and that China would be denied any privileges under the convention. : \\"The Simla Convention itself was initialed again by the British and Tibetan conference leaders in Delhi on 3 July 1914, and they signed a joint declaration pronouncing the convention binding upon themselves, even without Chinese agreement.\\" : \\"A joint British- Tibetan declaration stipulating that its terms would apply to China only when the latter fell in line with its two other signatories was attached to the Convention.\\" McMahon's work was initially rejected by the British government as incompatible with the 1907 Anglo-Russian Convention. The latter was renounced in 1921. The British began using the McMahon Line on Survey of India maps in 1937, and the Simla Convention was published officially in 1938.

Retrieved 20 March 2009 In 1906, the British government sought Chinese acceptance of suzerainty over Tibet as part of the Anglo-Chinese Convention on Tibet, but was rebuffed by the Chinese envoy, who insisted on sovereignty.

Retrieved 20 March 2009 however, this was not accepted by the newly founded Republic of China. Conference In 1913, the British convoked a conference at Viceregal Lodge in Simla, India to discuss the issue of Tibet's status.Maxwell 1970 The conference was attended by representatives of Britain, the newly founded Republic of China, and the Tibetan government at Lhasa. The British plenipotentiary, Sir Henry McMahon, introduced the plan of dividing Tibetan-inhabited areas into \\"inner Tibet\\" and \\"outer Tibet\\" and apply different policies. \\"Inner Tibet\\", which includes Tibetan-inhabited areas in Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, would be under the jurisdiction of the Chinese government. \\"Outer Tibet\\", covering approximately the same area as the modern \\"Tibet Autonomous Region\\" would enjoy autonomy. A boundary between Tibet and British India, later called the McMahon Line, was drawn on a map referred to in the treaty. The Tibetan Indian boundary was negotiated in Simla between representatives from Britain and Tibet privately, in the absence of the Chinese representative. During the Simla conference a map of the Tibetan Indian border was provided as an annexe to the proposed agreement.Calvin, James Barnard, \\"The China-India Border War\\", Marine Corps Command and Staff College, April 1984 The Schedule appended to the Convention contained further notes. For example, it was to be understood that \\"Tibet forms part of Chinese territory\\" and after the Tibetans selected a Dalai Lama, the Chinese government was to be notified and the Chinese commissioner in Lhasa would \\"formally communicate to His Holiness the titles consistent with his dignity, which have been conferred by the Chinese Government\\"; that the Tibetan government appointed all officers for \\"Outer Tibet\\", and that \\"Outer Tibet\\" was not to be represented in the Chinese Parliament or any such assembly.. Negotiations failed when China and Tibet could not agree over the Sino-Tibetan boundary. The Chinese plenipotentiary, Ivan Chen, initialed the treaty, pending confirmation by his government. He was then ordered by the Chinese government to repudiate his agreement. On 3 July 1914, the British and Tibetan plenipotentiaries signed the Convention without a Chinese signature. They also signed an additional bilateral declaration to the effect that the convention would be binding on them and that China would be denied any privileges under the agreement until it signed it.: \\"When the Lonchen and Sir Henry proceeded to conclude the agreement, Ivan Chen was present briefly. ... Later, however, he left the chamber. After the Convention had been signed, Chen returned to the Conference room.\\" At the same time the British and Lochen Shatra signed a fresh set of trade Regulations to replace those of 1908.McKay, Alex, The History of Tibet: The modern period: 1895‚Äì1959, the Encounter with modernity, p. 136. Aftermath Simla was initially rejected by the Government of India as incompatible with the 1907 Anglo-Russian Convention. The official treaty record, C.U. Aitchison's A Collection of Treaties, was published with a note stating that no binding agreement had been reached at Simla. Since the condition (agreement with China) specified by the accord was not met, the Tibetan government didn't agree with the McMahon Line.; : \\"Since the British were not able to obtain such an acceptance, the Tibetans considered the line proposed by MacMahon invalid.[14: Alastair Lamb, 1989. p. 469]\\" The Anglo-Russian Convention was renounced by Russia and Britain jointly in 1921,UK relations with Tibet, Free Tibet Campaign. Retrieved 20 March 2009. \\"... in 1917, the Communist Government in Russia repudiated all the international engagements of the tsars, ... in 1921, the 1907 Treaty was cancelled by agreement.\\" but the McMahon Line was forgotten until 1935, when interest was revived by civil service officer Olaf Caroe.Guruswamy, Mohan, \\"The Battle for the Border\\", Rediff, 23 June 2003. The Survey of India published a map showing the McMahon Line as the official boundary in 1937. In 1938, the British published the Simla Convention in Aitchison's Treaties.Banerji, Arun Kumar, \\"China, The British And Tawang\\", The Statesman, 24 April 2011. A volume published earlier was recalled from libraries and replaced with a volume that includes the Simla Convention together with an editor's note stating that Tibet and Britain, but not China, accepted the agreement as binding.Schedule of the Simla Convention, 1914 The replacement volume has a false 1929 publication date. In April 1938, a small British force led by Captain G. S. Lightfoot arrived in Tawang and informed the monastery the district was now Indian territory. The Tibetan government protested and its authority was restored after Lightfoot's brief stay. The district remained in Tibetan hands until 1951. = Tibetan response = The British records show that the Tibetans did not agree to the new Indo- Tibetan border without obtaining the Chinese acceptance of the Simla Convention. Since the British were unable to obtain the Chinese accpetance, Alastair Lamb states that the Tibetans regarded the McMahon Line invalid. = Sino-Indian disputes in 1950 = In the late 1950s, the McMahon Line became a source of tension between China and India.Robert Barnett, Did Britain Just Sell Tibet?, The New York Times, 24 November 2008 China contends that Tibet was never an independent state and so it could not sign a treaty on behalf of China to delineate an international frontier.Kaiyan Homi Kaikobad Interpretation and Revision of International Boundary, Cambridge University Press, 2007, , pp. 36‚Äì38 China and India fought the Sino-Indian War in 1962, which nevertheless preserved the status quo ante bellum. Australian journalist and historian Neville Maxwell exposed a top-secret Indian war report that harshly criticised the highest echelons of power in India at the time for pursuing a flawed strategy of provoking China into the war without the means to handle a backlash. The so-called Henderson Brooks-Bhagat Report was an operational review of India's military debacle commissioned by New Delhi that Maxwell managed to obtain. Compiled by Lieutenant-General Henderson Brooks and Brigadier Premindra Singh Bhagat in 1963, it has been kept secret by the Indian government despite repeated appeals that it be declassified. Years later, the area, then known as the North-East Frontier Agency, gained Indian statehood as Arunachal Pradesh.China revives claims on Indian territory IRNA, Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA No.035 05/04/2005 14:22) republished under the same name, globalsecurity.org, =2008 British policy change= Until 2008 the British Government's position remained the same that China held suzerainty over Tibet but not full sovereignty. It was the only state still to hold this view.Staff, Britain's suzerain remedy, The Economist, 6 November 2008 David Miliband, the British Foreign Secretary, described the old position as an anachronism originating in the geopolitics of the early 20th century. Britain revised this view on 29 October 2008, when it recognised Chinese sovereignty over Tibet by issuing a statement on its website. The Economist stated that although the British Foreign Office's website does not use the word sovereignty, officials at the Foreign Office said \\"it means that, as far as Britain is concerned, 'Tibet is part of China. Full stop.'\\" The British Government sees their new stances as an updating of their position, while some others have viewed it as a major shift in the British position. Tibetologist Robert Barnett thinks that the decision has wider implications. India's claim to a part of its north-east territories, for example, is largely based on the same agreements ‚Äì notes exchanged during the Simla convention of 1914, which set the boundary between India and Tibet ‚Äì that the British appear to have simply discarded. It has been speculated that Britain's shift was made in exchange for China making greater contributions to the International Monetary Fund. Forsyth, James (the web editor of The Spectator).
