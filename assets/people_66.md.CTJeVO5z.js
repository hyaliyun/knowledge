The designs of both sides of the flag are different; at the reverse side, it shows the then national coat of arms at the position of stars at obverse. The stars symbolized the provinces of the Republic; once a new province was created, one star was add to the obverse of the flag. This \\"Star- Striped\\" banner was considered to be inspired by the flag of the United States. The blue stripes symbolize the ocean and sky. The white means Peace. Blue is an important color in Salvadoran culture and identity. It started with Native American cultures of Mesoamerica in El Salvador, that produced (a√±il) indigo plant which they used extracts to produce blue dyes. When the Europeans invaded and colonized the area, they saw the wealth of indigo and turned El Salvador to one of the world's foremost providers of indigo dye in its time. Synonymous to the country's wealth, the colonizers referred to the dye as \\"the blue gold\\", that dominated El Salvador's economy until it was completely replaced by coffee cultivation. Today El Salvador remains as one of the few countries in the world that still cultivates indigo to produce blue dyes. Over time El Salvador's flag has had several different shades of blue, from the lightest to darkest, including Royal blue, Klein Blue and Indigo dye. The present current modern flag displays a cobalt blue color.

He was initially an actor, before switching to working behind the cameras in the industry as a script editor and writer on programmes such as Springhill and Emmerdale, later becoming the producer of Peak Practice, Doctor Who and Coronation Street. Career Collinson has produced several series for the BBC, including the comedy drama Linda Green, and the first seasons of 1950s-set Born and Bred and paranormal thriller Sea of Souls. In January 2004, he started work as the tenth full-time in-house producer of the BBC science- fiction programme Doctor Who. While he was an actor, the role of Alexander in the 1999 Channel 4 drama Queer as Folk was written especially for him by his friend Russell T Davies. However, after Antony Cotton auditioned for the production team, Davies and his fellow producers felt they had no choice but to offer the role to him instead of Collinson. Collinson took a break from his Doctor Who production responsibilities for part of the 2007 series; Susie Liggat took his place for a month according to issue 372 of Doctor Who Magazine, while Collinson took a holiday. There was some confusion when Collinson's break was first announced, with some reports claiming that Collinson was leaving the series. \\"There was this whole madness last year when it was announced that... Susie was going to produce a couple of episodes,\\" Collinson told Doctor Who Magazine in issue 380, \\"cos everyone immediately thought that I was leaving, and she was taking over. My friends thought I was seriously ill! Why else would I leave Doctor Who?\\"\\"With a Little Help from My Friends: Julie Gardner & Phil Collinson,\\" interview by Benjamin Cook. Doctor Who Magazine, issue 380, 28 March 2007. Collinson's holiday coincided with the filming of the two-parter \\"Human Nature\\"/\\"The Family of Blood\\"; he does however receive an executive producer credit for these episodes. Liggat also produced five episodes of the 2008 series. Collinson also served as an executive producer on the CBBC Doctor Who spin-off The Sarah Jane Adventures. The BBC confirmed on 1 February 2008 that Collinson would be leaving his position on Doctor Who, to return to Manchester as BBC Head of Drama for the region. After less than two years in this role, it was announced in late 2009 than Collinson would be leaving the BBC to take over as producer of ITV's top- rated soap opera Coronation Street. Collinson is gay, and admits that Doctor Who has a special appeal for LGBT people: \\"I can only talk for myself, and when I was a teenager,\\" he said in a March 2007 interview. \\"For me, as a young boy and a teenager, growing up in the north of England, in a world where I could never imagine being a gay man, let alone settling down and finding someone, I think Doctor Who was really asexual. There were programmes like The Sweeney which were very much about men chasing women, men getting women, whereas with Doctor Who you had a show that never really dealt with that.\\" In July 2010 Collinson took over from Kim Crowther, as the new producer of Coronation Street. His first credited episode aired on 26 July 2010. On 8 October 2012, it was announced that Collinson will step down as Producer of Coronation Street as of March 2013 and be replaced by Emmerdale Producer Stuart Blackburn.

History The Falkland Islands flag flying over the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Main Building in Whitehall. The Falkland Islands have been claimed and occupied by several nations throughout its history, who generally used their national flags on the islands. It wasn't until 1876 that the islands were given a flag of their own, which consisted of a Blue Ensign defaced with the seal of the islands - an image of HMS Hebe (which brought many of the early British settlers to the islands, including Richard Moody, in the 1840s) in Falkland Sound, overlooked by a bullock (representing feral cattle which once roamed the islands). A new coat-of-arms for the islands was introduced on 16 October 1925, consisting of the Desire (which was captained by John Davis who is reputed to have discovered the islands in 1592) and a sea lion in a shield surrounded by the motto of the islands, Desire the Right. This coat-of-arms later replaced the image of the bullock and ship on the flag. On 29 September 1948, the flag was updated to include the new coat-of-arms (a ram above the Desire on shield with the motto below) superimposed upon a white disc. The flag was banned by the Argentine military junta from 2 April ‚Äì 14 June 1982, during their occupation of the islands, when it was replaced by the flag of Argentina. In 1999 the size of the arms was increased and the white disc removed to create the current flag. The Falkland Islands Red Ensign was created by The Merchant Shipping (Falkland Islands Colours) Order 1998, No. 3147 of 1998, which came into force in 1999 and which contains a picture of the ensign containing the Falkland arms on a white disc. Red Ensign with the Falklands coat of arms superimposed is used as the islands' civil ensign. Previously the plain red ensign was used by ships in the territorial waters around the Falklands. The Governor of the Falkland Islands uses a Union Flag defaced with the coat of arms. It was this flag that was raised at Government House in Stanley by the Royal Marines at the end of the Falkland War, signifying the liberation of the islands. Use of the flag Since its approval, the Falklands flag has been used to represent the Falkland Islanders internationally. In 2011, in support of Argentina's claim to the islands, the members of Mercosur banned Falklands flagged vessels from entering their ports. Vessels flying the Falklands Civil Ensign are required to re-flag with the Red Ensign to enter Mercosur ports. The flag was flown from several HM Government buildings in London, including 10 Downing Street and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in Whitehall, on 14 June 2012 to mark the 30th anniversary of the islands' liberation. Former flagsCivil ensign For the majority of the Falkland Islands existence as a British territory, the appropriate civil ensign was the same as that of the United Kingdom, an undefaced red ensign. The first warrant issued for the use of a defaced red ensign was issued in 1998, to be effective on 25 January 1999. This warrant prescribed the coat of arms of the Falkland Islands within a white disc. However, a revision of territorial flags issued later that year removed the white disc and enlarged the territorial emblems across the board. Governor's flagMilitary flag The flag of the British Forces South Atlantic Islands (which is responsible for the security of the Falkland Islands) consists of a tricolour of dark blue (representing the Royal Navy), red (representing the British Army), and light blue (representing the Royal Air Force), which is defaced in the centre with a motif of the Islands in gold.

The first time Merki√∞ was raised in the Faroe Islands was on 22 June that year in F√°mjin on the occasion of a wedding. On 25 April, 1940, the British occupation government approved the flag for use by Faroese vessels, during the tenure of Carl Aage Hilbert as Danish prefect. Britain did not want the same flag as German-occupied Denmark to be used. April 25 is still celebrated as Flaggdagur and it is a national holiday.

The state arms have been slightly modified but the flag has remained the same as during Fiji's colonial period. It is a defaced sky-blue \\"Blue Ensign\\" (the actual Blue Ensign version of the flag is the Government ensign). It has remained unchanged since Fiji was declared a republic in 1987, despite calls from some politicians for changes. A plan to change the flag, announced by Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama in 2013, was abandoned in August 2016. Design Flags of the Union Jack.svg Arms of Fiji.svg The flag's bright blue background symbolizes the Pacific Ocean, which plays an important part in the lives of the islanders, both in terms of the fishing industry, and the huge tourist trade. The Union Jack reflects the country's links with the United Kingdom. The shield is derived from the country's coat of arms, which was granted by Royal Warrant in 1908. It is a white shield with a red cross and a red chief (upper third of a shield). The images depicted on the shield represent agricultural activities on the islands, and the historical associations with the United Kingdom. At the top of the shield, a British lion holds a cocoa pod between its paws. The first quarter is sugar cane, second quarter is a coconut palm, the third quarter is a dove of peace, and the fourth quarter is a bunch of bananas. The flag is very similar to the colonial ensign used prior to independence, the main differences being the latter used a darker shade of blue and displayed the entire Fijian coat of arms as opposed to just the shield. While some reformists have called for the removal of the Union Flag, seeing it a British colonial emblem, others support its retention for the sake of historical continuity. The flags of five other independent countries (see Flags of Australia, Cook Islands, New Zealand, Niue, and Tuvalu articles) retain the Union Flag in their national flags. But of these, only Fiji is a republic. The Union flag also remains on the flag of Hawaii, a state of the USA since 1959. Some influential Fijians have called for the restoration of the full coat of arms to the flag. On 30 November 2005, Fiji's Great Council of Chiefs called for the two warrior figures, who guard the shield on the coat of arms, to be placed on the flag, along with a miniature canoe and the national motto, Rerevaka na kalou ka doka na tui (\\"Fear God and honour the Queen\\") ‚Äì symbols that were featured on the original flag of the Kingdom of Viti, the first unified Fijian state created under the leadership of Seru Epenisa Cakobau in 1871. \\"The coat of arms is very significant because it has the word of God, then it has the two warriors and the Fijian canoe also. I think that the council members prefer that the full coat of arms be included in the Fiji flag,\\" said Asesela Sadole, General Secretary of the Great Council of Chiefs. Prior to ceding the country to British rule in 1874, the government of Fiji adopted a national flag featuring blue and white vertical stripes, with in the centre a red shield depicting a white dove. This flag ceased to be used when the colonial era began and Fiji relinquished its independence. Fiji was a British colony from 1874 to 1970. Proposal for a new flag In his New Year's Day address in 2013, Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama announced that the flag would soon be changed so as \\"to reflect a sense of national renewal, to reinforce a new Fijian identity and a new confidence in being Fijian on the global stage\\". The change in the flag would accompany the adoption of a new Constitution, intended by Fiji's military leader (who came to power in a coup in December 2006) to establish a \\"one person, one vote\\", non-racial and secular democracy under military oversight. The country, a republic, had removed Queen Elizabeth II from its currency a few weeks earlier. On 3 February 2015, Bainimarama confirmed that the flag of Fiji would be replaced. He announced that a national competition to design the new flag would be held, with the aim of hoisting this flag on 11 October 2015, the 45th anniversary of independence. During the competition, over 2,000 designs were submitted, before a final shortlist of 23 was selected by Fiji's National Flag Committee on 9 June 2015. It was intended to submit these designs to the Cabinet for consideration on 30 June 2015, following a brief public feedback period. However, on 30 June, Bainimarama announced that this feedback period was to be extended to 31 December 2015, saying, \\"(People) want more time to consider what form the new flag should take... By extending the deadline, there is now ample opportunity for Fijians of all ages and backgrounds to further contribute and consider what symbols most appropriately represent our wonderful nation.\\" On 24 December 2015, the Fijian government announced that it had again put off a decision on the country's new flag via delaying the next stage by another two months to the end of February 2016. In a statement, the government said that it had now received new submissions since it released 23 designs earlier in 2015, and that it was still seeking more. Furthermore, it was announced that five designs would be chosen through the Prime Minister's Office in March 2016, with the public then having three months to select one. The government also said it expected to announce the new flag on 1 July 2016 or at a later date, and that it planned to raise the new flag on Constitution Day, 7 September 2017 (a new public holiday celebrating the 2013 Constitution of Fiji). However, on 17 August 2016, Bainimarama publicly announced that the government was abandoning plans to change the flag. He read out a statement saying: \\"While I remain convinced personally that we need to replace some of the flag‚Äôs colonial symbols with a genuinely indigenous expression of our present and our future, it has been apparent to the Government since February that the flag should not be changed for the foreseeable future\\". The flag's popularity had been boosted by the country winning its first ever Olympic gold medal under its banner in the 2016 Summer Olympics. The decision to retain the current flag was welcomed by opposition parties.

The Ghana national flag was designed in 1957 by the late Theodosia Okoh and it was adopted within the same year when Ghana attained its independence. The flag was flown until 1959 and it was then reinstated in 1966. It consists of the Pan-African colours of red, gold, and green, in horizontal stripes, with a black five-pointed star in the centre of the gold stripe. The Ghanaian flag was the second African flag after the flag of the Ethiopian Empire to feature these colours. The flag's design influenced that of the flag of Guinea-Bissau (1973). The flag of Ghana was designed by the late Mrs. Theodosia Okoh born on Tuesday, June 13, 1922 in the Wenchi town of Ghana, and died in the year 2015 in Accra where she spent most of her life with family.\\"Mrs Theodosia Okoh: The Woman Who Designed The Ghanaian Flag\\", African Celebs.Mrs. Theodosia Salome Okoh Profile at GhanaWeb.  Description of flag colours  The Ghana flag was designed in three beautiful and brighting colours following in sequence of red, gold and green. The colours are a representation of the country's struggle for independence and a symbol of its rich resources within the geographical location of the country among other African countries. The three colours used are very catchy and memorable with a star of the sky designed in a black colour within the centre, taking the centre coverage of the gold colour. The red colour of the national flag of Ghana was used to represent the blood of forefathers who led the struggle of independence and shared their blood through death. The country's struggle for independence from the British colony of the Great Britain, took the life of prominent Ghanaian leaders at the time. Name as the big six were Edward Akufo Addo, Dr. Ako Adjei, William Ofori Atta, Joseph Boakye Danquah, Emmanuel Obetsebi Lamptey, and later Osagyefor Dr. Kwame Nkrumah. The big six formed the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC) a political party formed to liberate the people of the Gold Coast from the slavery and oppressions of the British colonial rule. Red also stands for love which might influence our forefathers who led the struggles for Ghana's indepdence for the love of the nation. The gold colour takes the centre line of the three colours attraction and it represents the mineral resources mostly found in the Ashanti region of Ghana, helping to harness the wealth of the country. The gold is one of Ghana's mineral resources found mostly in Obuasi and Tarkwa towns of the Ashanti region. The enrichment of the gold resources of Ghana led to the initial name the Gold Coast which was later changed to Ghana of the struggle and success of the attainment of independence in 1957. Other Ghana's mineral resources are diamond, bauxite, and manganese. The green symbolizes the Ghana's rich forests and natural wealth that provides the nation with oil, food and cash crops, such as cocoa, timber, sheabutter, and all kinds of food products of the country. The green colour till today is used as a symbol of the green vegetations of crop produce in Ghana. Ghana is noted for it cash crop of cocoa which was first brought to Ghana by Tetteh Quarshie from Fernando Po. Most of Ghana cash crops are exported to oversea countries in exchange for physical cash which is use for the country's development of roads, schools, water, sanitation and industries for employment. The black star of the Ghana national flag is a symbol used to represent the emancipation of Africa and unity against colonialism.\\"Flag of Ghana: The Meaning of the Flag\\", GhanaWeb.\\"Theodosia Salome Okoh, Ghana's Illustrious Daughter\\", Flex Newspaper, 29 January 2017. The black star was adopted from the flag of the Black Star Line, a shipping line incorporated by Marcus Garvey that operated from 1919 to 1922. It is where the Ghana national football team derive their nickname, the \\"Black Stars\\".  Ghana's struggle for independence before the national flag  Ghana was one of the countries counted among the West African regions of the colonial government rule since the 15th to 19th century of the Gold Coast. The history of Ghana can therefore traced back to the 15th century when the europeans arrived. The Portuguese navigators sailed their way down the West African coast and to the shores of the Gold Coast in 1471 where they build a castle for themselves at the Elmina in 1482. Other europeans followed in 1492 to include the sailor from France. The europeans brought a gold cargo to the shores of the Gold Coast where they traded in gold with the Akwamu's who controlled an extensive part of the coast in the 17th century. Later the dominance of the Ashanti's of Kumasi in the 18th century took over the gold trade with the British, Dutch and Danes who were the main european traders at the Tano and Volta rivers. The most valuable commodity for export at the time changed from gold to slavery. Slaves were traded for muskets besides other western commodities. The Ashante's by then were locally empowered to take control with the Ashantehene enthroned on a golden stool as a tradition of the Ashante's. Between 1804 to 1814, the British, Dutch and Danes subsequently outlaw the slave trade which was a big blow to the Ashante's. The situation became a warefare in 1820 and in 1824 and 1870 subsequently defeated by the British force who shortly occupied the region of Kumasi in 1874. The British gradually emerged the coastal regions as the main european power. The colonial period started from 1902 to 1957. The Ashante's Kingdom in 1902 was declared a British crown colony and became the protectorate of the northern terroterate of the Gold Coast. The colonians ruled without the involvement of the African populace in the political process. After the World War II, the Gold Coast colony became prominence among the among the Sub-Saharan African countries. It was at a time when Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah had returned back to the Gold Coast in 1947 after twelve years of political study in the USA and the Great Britain. The coming back to the Gold Coast was an invitation for Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah to lead the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC) as the General Secretary with the aim to lead the campaign for self government. The UGCC at the time had won the right of the African majority in British legislative colony. With the leadership of Kwame Nkrumah, a wide spread riot began in February 1948. Within the same year, the UGCC found leaders arrested the Secretary General Dr. Kwame Nkrumah for an alert of thoughts against Nkrumah's leadership plans. The incident brought a split of the UGCC leadership with Kwame Nkrumah having to found his own Convention People's Party (CPP) in June 1949 for the aim of self-governance for the African people, dubbed \\"Self- government now\\". A non violent campaign of protest and strikes were organized by Kwame Nkrumah in 1950 in achievement of his goal. But riot led to the second arrest of Kwame Nkrumah. The colonies general election brought a big win to the Convention People's Party in the absence of Kwame Nkrumah, leading to the release of Kwame Nkrumah from the prison to join the governance of the country. Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah then became the Prime Minister of the Gold Coast in 1952. In a vote of the 1956 direct vote of all the electorate members the British Togo voted to join the Gold Coast in the campaign for the preparations towards independence. The Togo and Gold Coast territories attained independent from the colonial rule in 1957 under the supreme will power of Kwame Nkrumah. The name for the country Ghana was then adopted. The years of the independence of the Gold Coast started in 1957 with the new name of the county Ghana emerged. An independence was granted and announced by the then Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah who led the struggle for the independence. With Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah as the President, Ghana became a Republic on 1 July 1960.  Theodosia Okoh (The national flag's designer)  Known as Mrs. Theodosia Salome Abena Kumea Okoh born on Tuesday, June 13, 1922 at Wenchi in the Brong Ahafo region of Ghana was a renowned artist who has contested and showcase her artistic designs across nations. As an artist, she had used many mediums and colours to create artistic works like paintings with oil and water colours, collages with feathers and corn stalks, and galleries used in many local and international homes. She joined the Ghana Hockey Association (GHA) and work in the role of a chairperson and a patron of the Sports Writer's Association of Ghana (SWAG). She was married to the late Mr. Enoch K Okoh, the then secretary to Ghana's Cabinet and Head of the Civil Service until the uprising in 1966. Until her death at the age of ninety-three years in 2015, Theodosia has published an autobiography in 2002 when she was eighty years which she revised in the tenth year. Her autobiography tells much of the life in the early days of Ghana before, during and after independence.  Meaning and reasons for the Ghana national flag  The Ghana flag in itself stands absolutely as the symbol of power of the country and the success of attaining its independence after years of struggles with the British colonial government. Ghana as part of the colonized African countries fought for its independence against the oppressor's rule. The flag was then created to symbolize Ghana's freedom and a show of victory from imprisonment, bondage, slavery and the British dictatorship. The flag was then created among several reasons and facts for its use. The national flag of Ghana was created upon attaining independence on 6 March 1957. It was first flown on the first Independence Day celebration as a show of freedom after many decades of the British rule. The early settlers of Ghana found the land of the geographical area to have contained gold and other mineral resources and initially named the region among other West African countries as the land of the Gold Coast. The main reason for the use of a gold colour in the centre of the Ghana national flag. That the toil of our forefathers who were used as slaves, and cheap labour by the Dutch of the United Kingdom or Great Britain was over forever. Anytime the people of Ghana see the Ghana national flag, it reminds them of their toil and now having their freedom forever. The land of Ghana by its nature is rich in agricultural resources and green vegetations. The production of food crops for local use and exports. The green forest that leads to the production of timber, cocoa leading to the production of woods, coffee, and chocolates. These resources are by itself enough for us to manage our own resources and to celebrate the rich culture of the indigenous people with a proud green colour of the flag. The struggle for Ghana's freedom started with the first arrive of the Europeans. There were racists attitudes against the Ghanaian people by the black nature of the colour of their skin which looks unattractive. Against all odds, the Ghanaian people were proud of the black nature of their skin colour and add chosen black colour star to symbolize the beauty of the black skin. Also, the black star shipping line as one of the main reasons of the oppressors who were against Ghana's profitable port of exporting their rich resources for monetary gains. The creation of the Union of African States (UAS) and Ghana's union with the Guinea in 1959 led to the creation of the flag with two stars based on the fact that Guinea did not own a country flag. The two stars then symbolized Ghana's union with the Guinea after Guinea had attained its independence. A third star was added a result of the Malians independence and joining the Union of African States in May 1959. The Union flag was purposefully used between the 1958 to 1961. An emerging conflict within two years of the union arose as a result of a confusion of which nation will rule over the Union of African States. The conflict led to the falling off of Ghana and reverting back to the use of its original one black star symbol and a replacement of the gold colour in the center of the flag to a white colour in 1962. Popular public demand upon the remembrance of Ghana's rich history agitated for the nation to revert to its use of the original Ghana national flag with the red, gold and green colour and a black star centred in the gold colour. The original Ghana national flag which was used in 1957 upon Ghana's freedom and independence was reinstated for use in 1966. Ghana was then one of the first countries to adopt the Pan African colours originally used in the Ethiopian flag.  Purpose and use of the Ghana national flag  The purpose of the Ghana national flag was to have a symbol of jubilations during the post independence era. There were many flags ensemble for Ghana's use. Notably is the Ghana national flag described which has been use for many purposes as in national and international celebrations, such as the Independence Day celebration, commemoration of Ghana's big six and past leaders of the nations. The flag is raise up flying in the sky to grace glorious occasions whiles it is usually burned to fly half way to show some kind of misfortune that my have hit on the country. National ensign Under terms of section 183 of Ghana's Merchant Shipping Act of 1963, the civil ensign is a red flag with the national flag in a black- fimbriated canton. In 2003, a new merchant shipping act was enacted, however, and this simply provides that \\"the National Flag of Ghana\\" is the proper national colours for Ghanaian ships. No mention is made of other flags or other possible flags. The naval ensign is a red St. George's Cross on white flag, with the national flag in canton. Air force ensign and civil air ensign File:Air Force Ensign of Ghana.svgThe ensign of the Ghana Air Force File:Civil Air Ensign of Ghana.svgThe Ghanaian civil air ensign The Ghana Air Force has its own ensign that incorporates the flag of Ghana. Civil aviation in Ghana is represented by the national civil air ensign. It is a standard light-blue field with the Ghanaian flag in the canton. It is charged in the fly with either a red, yellow and green roundel (in the case of the military ensign) or black five-pointed star (in the case of the civil ensign). Both have been used since Independence in 1957, and the subsequent founding of the Ghana Air Force in 1959.

Similarly, when the country formed the Union of African States, the flag of the Union was modeled on Bolivia's flag, but with two black stars, representing the nations. In May 1959, a third star was added. Following the January 1964 constitutional referendum, Ghana adopted a variant of the 1957 tricolour with white in the place of yellow, after the colours of Kwame Nkrumah's ruling and then-sole legal party Convention People's Party, making it similar to the flag of Hungary. The original 1957 flag was reinstated in February 1966 following Nkrumah's overthrow in a coup d'√©tat.

Intended for service in Asia, Goliath and her sister ships were smaller and faster than the preceding s, but retained the same battery of four guns. She also carried thinner armour, but incorporated new Krupp steel, which was more effective than the Harvey armour used in the Majestics. Goliath was laid down in January 1897, launched in March 1898, and commissioned into the fleet in March 1900. The ship was deployed to the China Station from her commissioning until 1903, when she returned to Britain; she was sent back to East Asian waters, but while en route was reassigned to the Mediterranean Fleet. In early 1906, she was transferred to the Channel Fleet, followed by a stint in the Home Fleet starting in early 1907. She was sent to the Mediterranean a second time in 1908, and later returned to the Home Fleet in 1909, before being decommissioned in 1913. With the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, Goliath was mobilised into the 8th Battle Squadron. She initially served as a guard ship in Loch Ewe, one of the harbors used by the Grand Fleet, before escorting the crossing of British troops to Belgium in late August. Goliath then took part in operations against German East Africa, participating in the blockade of the German light cruiser in the Rufiji River. From March 1915, she was part of the Dardanelles Campaign, and remained in support of the landings at Gallipoli in April. On 13 May 1915 Goliath was sunk in Morto Bay off Cape Helles by three torpedoes from the Ottoman destroyer . Out of her crew of 750, 570 were killed in the sinking. Design Right elevation, deck plan and hull section as depicted in Brassey's Naval Annual 1906 Goliath and her five sister ships were designed for service in East Asia, where the new rising power Japan was beginning to build a powerful navy, though this role was quickly made redundant by the Anglo-Japanese Alliance of 1902. The ships were designed to be smaller, lighter and faster than their predecessors, the s. Goliath was long overall, with a beam of and a draft of . She displaced normally and up to full loaded. Her crew numbered 682 officers and ratings.Gardiner, p. 35 The Canopus-class ships were powered by a pair of 3-cylinder triple-expansion engines, with steam provided by twenty Belleville boilers. They were the first British battleships with water-tube boilers, which generated more power at less expense in weight compared with the fire- tube boilers used in previous ships. The new boilers led to the adoption of fore-and-aft funnels, rather than the side-by-side funnel arrangement used in many previous British battleships. The Canopus-class ships proved to be good steamers, with a high speed for battleships of their time‚Äî from ‚Äîa full two knots faster than the Majestics.Gardiner, pp. 34, 35 Goliath had a main battery of four 35-calibre guns mounted in twin-gun turrets fore and aft; these guns were mounted in circular barbettes that allowed all-around loading, although at a fixed elevation. The ships also mounted a secondary battery of twelve 40-calibre guns mounted in casemates, in addition to ten 12-pounder guns and six 3-pounder guns for defence against torpedo boats. As was customary for battleships of the period, she was also equipped with four torpedo tubes submerged in the hull. To save weight, Goliath carried less armour than the Majestics‚Äî in the belt compared to ‚Äîalthough the change from Harvey armour in the Majestics to Krupp armour in Goliath meant that the loss in protection was not as great as it might have been, Krupp armour having greater protective value at a given weight than its Harvey equivalent. Similarly, the other armour used to protect the ship could also be thinner; the bulkheads on either end of the belt were thick. The main battery turrets were 10 in thick, atop barbettes, and the casemate battery was protected with 6 in of Krupp steel. Her conning tower had 12 in thick sides as well. She was fitted with two armoured decks, thick, respectively. Operational history=Pre-World War I HMS Goliath The keel for Goliath was laid down on 4 January 1897, and the completed hull was launched on 23 March 1898. The ship was commissioned on 27 March 1900 by Captain Lewis Edmund Wintz to serve on the China Station, where she underwent a refit at Hong Kong from September 1901 ‚Äì April 1902. Captain Frank Hannam Henderson was appointed in command 11 July 1902. She left the China Station in July 1903 and returned home, where she paid off into the commissioned Reserve at Chatham Dockyard on 9 October 1903. While in reserve, Goliath underwent a refit at Palmers on the Tyne from January‚ÄìJune 1904, then participated in maneuvers later in the year. On 9 May 1905, Goliath returned to full commission at Chatham to relieve her sister ship on the China Station. However, Great Britain and Japan ratified a treaty of alliance while she was on her outbound voyage, allowing the Royal Navy to reduce its presence on the China Station and recall all battleships from those waters; when Goliath reached Colombo, Ceylon in June 1905, she was recalled, and was instead attached to the Mediterranean Fleet. In January 1906, she was transferred to the Channel Fleet.Burt, p. 158 After being fitted with fire control, Goliath transferred to the Portsmouth Division of the new Home Fleet on 15 March 1907. She was based at Portsmouth, and underwent a machinery overhaul there from August 1907 ‚Äì February 1908.Gardiner & Gray, p. 8 Upon completion of her refit, Goliath commissioned on 4 February 1908 for Mediterranean Fleet service. During her voyage to Malta, one of her propeller shafts fractured, and she required four-month repair period before she could begin her service. On 20 April 1909, she paid off at Portsmouth. On 22 April, Goliath recommissioned to serve in the 4th Division, Home Fleet, at the Nore. During this service, she was refitted at Chatham in 1910‚Äì1911 and was sent to Sheerness. In 1913, she was mothballed and joined the 3rd Fleet. World War I When the First World War broke out in August 1914, Goliath returned to full commission and was assigned to the 8th Battle Squadron, Channel Fleet, operating out of Devonport. She was sent to Loch Ewe as guard ship to defend the Grand Fleet anchorage, and then covered the landing of the Plymouth Marine Battalion at Ostend, Belgium on 25 August 1914. For this operation, she and three other battleships‚Äî, , and ‚Äîa protected cruiser, and six destroyers escorted the troopships; at the same time, elements of the Grand Fleet attacked the German patrol line off Heligoland to occupy the German High Seas Fleet.Corbett (1920), pp. 98‚Äì100 =Operations off German East Africa= , Goliaths quarry in German East Africa Goliath transferred to the East Indies Station on 20 September to support cruisers on convoy duty in the Middle East, escorting an Indian convoy to the Persian Gulf and German East Africa through October. This included a major troop convoy that left India on 16 October, in company with the battleship .Corbett (1920), p. 391 Goliaths arrival allowed cruisers that had been occupied with escorting convoys to join the hunt for the German light cruiser .Corbett (1920), p. 309 The German cruiser, having sunk the British cruiser in the Battle of Zanzibar, was trapped by three British cruisers in the Rufiji River delta in late October.Farwell, pp. 132‚Äì133 Goliath arrived shortly thereafter and was to join the blockade of the delta, but the news of the British defeat at the Battle of Coronel on 1 November forced the Admiralty to transfer Goliath to South Africa, as it was feared that the German East Asia Squadron might attack the colony after it entered the southern Atlantic.Corbett (1920), pp. 354, 381 To further complicate matters, Goliath had engine problems on arriving in Mombasa, Kenya, and was unable to proceed to South Africa, and instead the armoured cruiser was sent in her place.Corbett (1920), p. 389 After her engines were repaired, Goliath resumed her previous assignment with the blockade force at the Rufiji delta.Corbett (1920), p. 402 In November, Goliath attempted to get close enough to neutralise K√∂nigsberg, but the water was too shallow to permit her to get within range of the cruiser. As a result, she left to bombard Dar es Salaam on 28 November and 30 November. In the former attack, Commander Henry Ritchie, Goliaths executive officer, won the Victoria Cross. Goliath and the protected cruiser destroyed the colonial governor's residence; the second bombardment proved to be less effective. Goliath underwent a refit at Simonstown, South Africa, from December 1914 to February 1915. She then returned to the Rufiji delta on 25 February, as it seemed from German activities that K√∂nigsbergs commander intended to break out soon. During this period, Goliath bombarded German positions at Lindi, but she saw no action with K√∂nigsberg. On 25 March, Goliath was ordered to move to the Mediterranean to take part in operations off the Dardanelles, her place being taken by the protected cruiser ; the battleship left East African waters a week later on 1 April.Corbett (1921), pp. 235‚Äì239 =Dardanelles campaign= Map showing the Ottoman defences at the Dardanelles in 1915 Upon arrival in the Aegean Sea, Goliath joined the First Squadron, which included seven other battleships and four cruisers, and was commanded by Rear Admiral Rosslyn Wemyss. The First Squadron was tasked with supporting the Landing at Cape Helles, which took place on 25 April.Corbett (1921), pp. 310, 314 On the morning of the landings, Goliath took up a position off Y beach, some offshore to provide gunfire support. The protected cruisers and moved in closer, and all three ships opened fire at around 05:00, signalling the start of the attack. The Ottomans made no attempt to disrupt the landing, the Allied forces having successfully launched a surprise attack. By late in the day, however, an Ottoman counterattack had advanced from Krithia to threaten the British flank, but gunfire from Goliath and the cruisers broke up the attack. That night, the Ottomans launched another counterattack, this time against the centre of the British line, which was repulsed. Once the sun began to rise, Goliath and the cruisers, which had by then been reinforced by the cruisers and , shelled the Ottomans, forcing them to retreat again.Corbett (1921), pp. 324‚Äì325, 344, 351 On the morning of 26 April, wounded soldiers began to be ferried off the beach, first to Goliath and the cruisers off shore. A miscommunication with the men on shore led to an unintended, larger evacuation effort.Corbett (1921), p. 352 In the course of the action, she sustained some damage from the gunfire of Ottoman forts and shore batteries. Later in the day, order was restored on shore, and the Allied troops were able to occupy Sedd el Bahr. The Allies landed reinforcements, which allowed the advance to push toward Krithia on 27 April. Goliath and several other battleships shelled Ottoman defenders around the town to support the attack, which began the following morning at around 10:00. Goliath moved as close to shore as possible, to employ all of her guns at very close range. Despite the heavy fire support, the Allied troops were unable to dislodge the Ottoman defenders, and the First Battle of Krithia ended in an Allied defeat.Corbett (1921), pp. 353‚Äì365 Goliath was damaged by Ottoman guns again on 2 May. By mid-May, the Allied fleet had developed a rotation of two battleships on station off Gallipoli every night to support the troops dug in on the peninsula. On the night of 12‚Äì13 May, Goliath was on station with the battleship . The two ships were moored in Morto Bay, with Goliath ahead of Cornwallis; five destroyers patrolled the area against Ottoman torpedo boats. The Ottoman destroyer sortied late on 12 May under cover of a moonless night. By steaming very slowly, the Ottomans were able to slip past the destroyer patrols at about 01:00 on 13 May. Fifteen minutes later, lookouts aboard Goliath spotted Mu√¢venet-i Mill√Æye and issued a challenge; the Ottomans replied to the challenge but very quickly increased speed and launched three torpedoes at Goliath. The British opened fire, but only managed to shoot three rounds before the first torpedo struck the ship. Two torpedoes hit almost simultaneously, the first abreast her fore turret and the second abeam the fore funnel, causing a large explosion. Goliath began to capsize almost immediately, and was lying on her side when a third torpedo struck near her after turret. Mu√¢venet-i Mill√Æye sped off and escaped unscathed in the darkness as the other British warships gathered to rescue survivors from Goliath. Some 570 men, out of a crew of 750 were killed in the sinking, including the ship's commander, Captain Thomas Shelford.Burt, p. 158‚Äì159Corbett (1921), pp. 406‚Äì407 The wreck lies upside down at a depth of , and is largely buried in sediment. Only part of the hull, which was badly mangled by the explosion, and one of her screws are visible. NotesReferences   Further reading * Gibbons, Tony.

As a complement to the Guam flag design, and in response to Guam law providing for municipal flags, efforts were made to depict the culture of each Guam municipality on their own flag. These efforts to design 19 unique municipal flags were collaborated through the Mayors' Council with the assistance of illustrative artist Gerard Aflague, a Guam born native. These municipal flag designs reflect unique aspects of each of Guam's municipal villages. Construction details The length of the flag is forty inches and the width is seventy-eight inches.

Extract from the Hayato website: Hayato is located in the center of Kagoshima Prefecture in southern Japan and has a population of 37,000. Covering an area of 66.49 square kilometers, Hayato is a land rich in nature with Kinko Bay to the south and Kirishima mountains to the north. In the nearby waters one can see the small islands of Kamitsukuri floating in the distance, famous for Takachiho Shrine, where the shinto god Hikohohodemi no Mikoto rested in ancient times. Ruins surrounding this as well historical sites of the Kumaso Aborigines, who wielded power anciently in southern Kyushu, offer us many diverse legends and romanticism. Along the Amori River, which flows through the town, are the Hayato Hot Spring villages (Hinatayama and Myoken Hot Springs), which are well known from days of old and boast abundant hot water of superior quality. In 1984, the Kokubu-Hayato area was designated as a Technopolis and many modern industries have moved into the area. In 1986, Hayato received the designation of Teletopia (meaning telecommunications utopia). Hayato offers an attractive living environment where abundant nature, history and high technology exist side by side.

The flag consists of a gold saltire, which divides the flag into four sections: two of them green (top and bottom) and two black (hoist and fly).Jamaican Flag on JIS site It is currently the only national flag that does not contain the colors red, white, or blue. Design and symbolism The present design emerged from those sent in by the public in a national competition. It was originally designed with horizontal stripes, but this was considered too similar to the flag of Tanganyika (as it was in 1962, only the yellow stripes are thinner), and so the saltire was substituted. An earlier interpretation of the colours was, \\"hardships there are but the land is green and the sun shineth\\" as stated in the government Ministry Paper 28 - National Flag dated 22 May 1962. Gold recalls the shining sun, black reflects hardships, and green represents the land. It was changed in 1996 to black representing the strength and creativity of the people which has allowed them to overcome difficulties, gold for the wealth of the country and the golden sunshine, and green for the lush vegetation of the island, as well as hope. The change was made on the recommendation of the Committee to Examine National Symbols and National Observances appointed by the then Prime Minister P. J. Patterson and chaired by Milton \\"Rex\\" Nettleford. The flag is blazoned: Per saltire vert and sable, a saltire Or. Etiquette Standard etiquette applies in Jamaica to use of the national flag, primarily ensuring it is always the primary flag flown and is in good condition. The National Flag Code (a set of rules that owners of a flag should follow) was instituted by the government. Jamaica's state ensign is a Blue Ensign with the Jamaican national flag in the canton; it is normally only used by the Jamaican Government. Jamaica's naval ensign is a White Ensign with a Saint George's Cross and the Jamaican national flag in the canton, although due to the island's lack of a navy, it is normally only used by the Jamaican Coast Guard.

Flag ratio: 3:5 Jersey Red Ensign, Civil Ensign since 2010 Government Ensign since 1907Actes et correspondance au sujet de l'emploi par le vapeur \\"Duke of Normandy\\" de pavillons distinctifs, Jersey 1907 The flag of Jersey is composed of a red saltire on a white field. In the upper quadrant the badge of Jersey surmounted by a yellow \\"Plantagenet crown\\". The flag was adopted by the States of Jersey on 12 June 1979, proclaimed by Queen Elizabeth II on 10 December 1980 and first officially hoisted on 7 April 1981. Status and protocol The flag of Jersey has been decreed by the Sovereign for use in the Bailiwick of Jersey as the Island's flag. The Union flag may also be flown, but precedence should be given to the flag of Jersey. The Bailiff of Jersey requests the flying of the flag of Jersey on government buildings on a list of official flag days when flags are flown from the seat of the judiciary and legislature; individuals are encouraged, but not obliged, to observe official flag days also. The pre-1981 flag of Jersey continues to be used as part of the re-enactment ceremonies of Liberation Day on 9 May.  History The current flag is the first to be adopted officially. Unofficially, a plain red saltire had been used since at least the 1830s. The official flag adds the badge and crown to this. Plain saltire The origins of the association to Jersey of the red saltire are unknown. A 1906 letter by the Bailiff of Jersey, describing the flag as \\"the red St Andrew's cross on white ground\\", states it was used to signal the neutrality of the Channel Islands during wars between England and France. A 1483 papal bull guaranteed the islands' neutrality during the Hundred Years' War. The saltire may have been a variation of the St George's Cross. Links to the St Patrick's Cross have been proposed. The St Patrick's Cross is commonly identified with the arms of the FitzGeralds, a Cambro-Norman family which became powerful in Ireland, and who also owned land in Jersey. N. V. L. Rybot in 1951 suggested that Jersey's flag originated from a mistake in a 1783 flag book by Carington Bowles, which was copied by later authors. Rybot's theory is that Bowles misinterpreted Ierse (Dutch for \\"Irish\\") as meaning \\"Jersey\\" in a Dutch flag-book he used as a source. However, French Admiralty charts show that Jersey was using the red saltire before 1783. The use of the red saltire became more common during the German Occupation of World War II, as the local population were not allowed to display the Union Flag in occupied territory. Although the heraldic symbols of Jersey were used by the Island's government during this time, all public buildings and landmarks (such as Fort Regent and Mont Orgueil) flew the Flag of Nazi Germany. Addition of the badge The move to a new flag was begun in 1977 with Queen Elizabeth's Silver Jubilee. It was felt by many in Jersey that the flag was insufficiently distinctive to represent the island, that there was too much confusion with the cross of St. Patrick as an Irish symbol, and that the red saltire had been taken as one of the international maritime signal flags. Others, though, wanted to keep the traditional red saltire that had been used since time immemorial. A third influential body of opinion campaigned for the adoption of a banner of the three leopards (leopard being the heraldic term for a lion passant guardant), the island's heraldic device. The current flag can, therefore, be seen as a compromise between the various strands of opinion. Although the flag is flown in Jersey, the three leopards are much more widely used as a national symbol by the authorities and civil population alike. Ensigns A civil ensign for use by Jersey registered merchant ships was approved in 2010, after a consultation process. The flag, which is the British Red Ensign with the badge and crown in the fly, was approved by Queen Elizabeth II, and subsequently by the States of Jersey in June 2010. A government Blue Ensign, with the badge without the crown in the fly, was given a general warrant in 1997, having originally been issued in 1907 specifically for the government-owned tugboat Duke of Normandy.

It also demonstrates that the effect of atmospheric pressure at the entrance is not canceled by the equal atmospheric pressure at the exit. A siphon (from , \\"pipe, tube\\", also spelled nonetymologically syphon) is any of a wide variety of devices that involve the flow of liquids through tubes. In a narrower sense, the word refers particularly to a tube in an inverted \\"U\\" shape, which causes a liquid to flow upward, above the surface of a reservoir, with no pump, but powered by the fall of the liquid as it flows down the tube under the pull of gravity, then discharging at a level lower than the surface of the reservoir from which it came. There are two leading theories about how siphons cause liquid to flow uphill, against gravity, without being pumped, and powered only by gravity. The traditional theory for centuries was that gravity pulling the liquid down on the exit side of the siphon resulted in reduced pressure at the top of the siphon. Then atmospheric pressure was able to push the liquid from the upper reservoir, up into the reduced pressure at the top of the siphon, like in a barometer or drinking straw, and then over. However, it has been demonstrated that siphons can operate in a vacuum and to heights exceeding the barometric height of the liquid.. Consequently, the cohesion tension theory of siphon operation has been advocated, where the liquid is pulled over the siphon in a way similar to the chain model.. It need not be one theory or the other that is correct, but rather both theories may be correct in different circumstances of ambient pressure. The atmospheric pressure with gravity theory obviously cannot explain siphons in vacuum, where there is no significant atmospheric pressure. But the cohesion tension with gravity theory cannot explain CO2 gas siphons,. siphons working despite bubbles, and the flying droplet siphon, where gases do not exert significant pulling forces, and liquids not in contact cannot exert a cohesive tension force. All known published theories in modern times recognize Bernoulli‚Äôs equation as a decent approximation to idealized, friction-free siphon operation. History Pascal's siphon, showing two beakers of mercury inside a container of water, demonstrating that a siphon works by atmospheric pressure, not that \\"nature abhors a vacuum\\" Egyptian reliefs from 1500 BC depict siphons used to extract liquids from large storage jars.http://www.moundtop.com/pdf/AncientWinemaking.pdf There is physical evidence for the use of siphons by Greeks is the Justice cup of Pythagoras in Samos 6ed century BC and by Greek engineers in the 3rd century BC at Pergamon.Dora P. Crouch (1993). \\"Water management in ancient Greek cities\\". Oxford University Press US. p. 119. . Hero of Alexandria wrote extensively about siphons in the treatise Pneumatica. The Banu Musa brothers of 9th- century Baghdad invented a double-concentric siphon, which they described in their Book of Ingenious Devices. The edition edited by Hill includes an analysis of the double-concentric siphon. Siphons were studied further in the 17th century, in the context of suction pumps (and the recently developed vacuum pumps), particularly with an eye to understanding the maximum height of pumps (and siphons) and the apparent vacuum at the top of early barometers. This was initially explained by Galileo Galilei via the theory of (\\"nature abhors a vacuum\\"), which dates to Aristotle, and which Galileo restated as , but this was subsequently disproved by later workers, notably Evangelista Torricelli and Blaise Pascal. \\"Maximum height to which water can be raised by a suction pump\\". ‚Äì see barometer: history. Theory A practical siphon, operating at typical atmospheric pressures and tube heights, works because gravity pulling down on the taller column of liquid leaves reduced pressure at the top of the siphon (formally, hydrostatic pressure when the liquid is not moving). This reduced pressure at the top means gravity pulling down on the shorter column of liquid is not sufficient to keep the liquid stationary against the atmospheric pressure pushing it up into the reduced-pressure zone at the top of the siphon. So the liquid flows from the higher-pressure area of the upper reservoir up to the lower-pressure zone at the top of the siphon, over the top, and then, with the help of gravity and a taller column of liquid, down to the higher-pressure zone at the exit. The chain model, where the section marked \\"B\\" pulls down because it is heavier than the section \\"A\\", is a flawed but useful analogy to the operation of a siphon. The chain model is a useful but not completely accurate conceptual model of a siphon. The chain model helps to understand how a siphon can cause liquid to flow uphill, powered only by the downward force of gravity. A siphon can sometimes be thought of like a chain hanging over a pulley, with one end of the chain piled on a higher surface than the other. Since the length of chain on the shorter side is lighter than the length of chain on the taller side, the heavier chain on the taller side will move down and pull up the chain on the lighter side. Similar to a siphon, the chain model is obviously just powered by gravity acting on the heavier side, and there is clearly no violation of conservation of energy, because the chain is ultimately just moving from a higher to a lower location, as the liquid does in a siphon. Even the falling lighter lower leg from C to D can cause the liquid of the heavier upper leg to flow up and over into the lower reservoir There are a number of problems with the chain model of a siphon, and understanding these differences helps to explain the actual workings of siphons. First, unlike in the chain model of the siphon, it is not actually the weight on the taller side compared to the shorter side that matters. Rather it is the difference in height from the reservoir surfaces to the top of the siphon, that determines the balance of pressure. For example, if the tube from the upper reservoir to the top of the siphon has a much larger diameter than the taller section of tube from the lower reservoir to the top of the siphon, the shorter upper section of the siphon may have a much larger weight of liquid in it, and yet the lighter volume of liquid in the down tube can pull liquid up the fatter up tube, and the siphon can function normally. Another difference is that under most practical circumstances, dissolved gases, vapor pressure, and (sometimes) lack of adhesion with tube walls, conspire to render the tensile strength within the liquid ineffective for siphoning. Thus, unlike a chain, which has significant tensile strength, liquids usually have little tensile strength under typical siphon conditions, and therefore the liquid on the rising side cannot be pulled up in the way the chain is pulled up on the rising side. An occasional misunderstanding of siphons is that they rely on the tensile strength of the liquid to pull the liquid up and over the rise.https://phys.org/news/2010-05-qut-physicist-oxford-english- dictionary.html While water has been found to have a significant tensile strength in some experiments (such as with the z-tube), and siphons in vacuum rely on such cohesion, common siphons can easily be demonstrated to need no liquid tensile strength at all to function. Furthermore, since common siphons operate at positive pressures throughout the siphon, there is no contribution from liquid tensile strength, because the molecules are actually repelling each other in order to resist the pressure, rather than pulling on each other. Air-start siphon. When the column of liquid is allowed to fall from C down to D, liquid in the upper reservoir will flow up to B and over the top. No liquid tensile strength is needed to pull the liquid up. To demonstrate, the longer lower leg of a common siphon can be plugged at the bottom and filled almost to the crest with liquid as in the figure, leaving the top and the shorter upper leg completely dry and containing only air. When the plug is removed and the liquid in the longer lower leg is allowed to fall, the liquid in the upper reservoir will then typically sweep the air bubble down and out of the tube. The apparatus will then continue to operate as a normal siphon. As there is no contact between the liquid on either side of the siphon at the beginning of this experiment, there can be no cohesion between the liquid molecules to pull the liquid over the rise. It has been suggested by advocates of the liquid tensile strength theory, that the air start siphon only demonstrates the effect as the siphon starts, but that the situation changes after the bubble is swept out and the siphon achieves steady flow. But a similar effect can be seen in the flying-droplet siphon (see above). The flying-droplet siphon works continuously without liquid tensile strength pulling the liquid up. Demonstration of siphoning tropical fruit punch with a flying-droplet siphon The siphon in the video demonstration operated steadily for more than 28 minutes until the upper reservoir was empty. Another simple demonstration that liquid tensile strength isn't needed in the siphon is to simply introduce a bubble into the siphon during operation. The bubble can be large enough to entirely disconnect the liquids in the tube before and after the bubble, defeating any liquid tensile strength, and yet if the bubble isn't too big, the siphon will continue to operate with little change as it sweeps the bubble out. Another common misconception about siphons is that because the atmospheric pressure is virtually identical at the entrance and exit, the atmospheric pressure cancels, and therefore atmospheric pressure can't be pushing the liquid up the siphon. But equal and opposite forces may not completely cancel if there is an intervening force that counters some or all of one of the forces. In the siphon, the atmospheric pressure at the entrance and exit are both lessened by the force of gravity pulling down the liquid in each tube, but the pressure on the down side is lessened more by the taller column of liquid on the down side. In effect, the atmospheric pressure coming up the down side doesn't entirely \\"make it\\" to the top to cancel all of the atmospheric pressure pushing up the up side. This effect can be seen more easily in the example of two carts being pushed up opposite sides of a hill. As shown in the diagram, even though the person on the left seems to have his push canceled entirely by the equal and opposite push from the person on the right, the person on the left's seemingly canceled push is still the source of the force to push the left cart up. An example of equal and opposite forces that would seem to cancel each other, yet the seemingly cancelled force from the left, still pushes the object up, similar to how the equal and opposite atmospheric pressure at each end of a siphon, that would seem to cancel, leaves atmospheric pressure still able to push the liquid up. (The cars are not bound, so they don't pull on each other, only push.) In some situations siphons do function in the absence of atmospheric pressure and due to tensile strength ‚Äì see vacuum siphons ‚Äì and in these situations the chain model can be instructive. Further, in other settings water transport does occur due to tension, most significantly in transpirational pull in the xylem of vascular plants. Water and other liquids may seem to have no tensile strength because when a handful is scooped up and pulled on, the liquids narrow and pull apart effortlessly. But liquid tensile strength in a siphon is possible when the liquid adheres to the tube walls and thereby resists narrowing. Any contamination on the tube walls, such as grease or air bubbles, or other minor influences such as turbulence or vibration, can cause the liquid to detach from the walls and lose all tensile strength. In more detail, one can look at how the hydrostatic pressure varies through a static siphon, considering in turn the vertical tube from the top reservoir, the vertical tube from the bottom reservoir, and the horizontal tube connecting them (assuming a U-shape). At liquid level in the top reservoir, the liquid is under atmospheric pressure, and as one goes up the siphon, the hydrostatic pressure decreases (under vertical pressure variation), since the weight of atmospheric pressure pushing the water up is counterbalanced by the column of water in the siphon pushing down (until one reaches the maximal height of a barometer/siphon, at which point the liquid cannot be pushed higher) ‚Äì the hydrostatic pressure at the top of the tube is then lower than atmospheric pressure by an amount proportional to the height of the tube. Doing the same analysis on the tube rising from the lower reservoir yields the pressure at the top of that (vertical) tube; this pressure is lower because the tube is longer (there is more water pushing down), and requires that the lower reservoir is lower than the upper reservoir, or more generally that the discharge outlet simply be lower than the surface of the upper reservoir. Considering now the horizontal tube connecting them, one sees that the pressure at the top of the tube from the top reservoir is higher (since less water is being lifted), while the pressure at the top of the tube from the bottom reservoir is lower (since more water is being lifted), and since liquids move from high pressure to low pressure, the liquid flows across the horizontal tube from the top basin to the bottom basin. The liquid is under positive pressure (compression) throughout the tube, not tension. Bernoulli's equation is considered in the scientific literature to be a fair approximation to the operation of the siphon. In non-ideal fluids, compressibility, tensile strength and other characteristics of the working fluid (or multiple fluids) complicate Bernoulli's equation. Once started, a siphon requires no additional energy to keep the liquid flowing up and out of the reservoir. The siphon will draw liquid out of the reservoir until the level falls below the intake, allowing air or other surrounding gas to break the siphon, or until the outlet of the siphon equals the level of the reservoir, whichever comes first. In addition to atmospheric pressure, the density of the liquid, and gravity, the maximal height of the crest in practical siphons is limited by the vapour pressure of the liquid. When the pressure within the liquid drops to below the liquid's vapor pressure, tiny vapor bubbles can begin to form at the high point, and the siphon effect will end. This effect depends on how efficiently the liquid can nucleate bubbles; in the absence of impurities or rough surfaces to act as easy nucleation sites for bubbles, siphons can temporarily exceed their standard maximal height during the extended time it takes bubbles to nucleate. One siphon of degassed water was demonstrated to 24 meters for an extended period of time and other controlled experiments to 10 meters. For water at standard atmospheric pressure, the maximal siphon height is approximately 10 m (32 feet); for mercury it is 76 cm (30 inches), which is the definition of standard pressure. This equals the maximal height of a suction pump, which operates by the same principle.. \\"The siphon\\". The ratio of heights (about 13.6) equals the ratio of densities of water and mercury (at a given temperature), since the column of water (resp. mercury) is balancing with the column of air yielding atmospheric pressure, and indeed maximal height is (neglecting vapor pressure and velocity of liquid) inversely proportional to density of liquid. Modern research into the operation of the siphon In 1948, Malcolm Nokes investigated siphons working in both air pressure and in a partial vacuum, for siphons in vacuum he concluded that: \\"The gravitational force on the column of liquid in the downtake tube less the gravitational force in the uptake tube causes the liquid to move. The liquid is therefore in tension and sustains a longitudinal strain which, in the absence of disturbing factors, is insufficient to break the column of liquid\\". But for siphons of small uptake height working at atmospheric pressure, he concluded that: \\"... the tension of the liquid column is neutralized and reversed by the compressive effect of the atmosphere on the opposite ends of the liquid column.\\" Potter and Barnes at the University of Edinburgh revisited siphons in 1971. They re-examined the theories of the siphon and ran experiments on siphons in air pressure. Their conclusion was that; \\"By now it should be clear that, despite a wealth of tradition, the basic mechanism of a siphon does not depend upon atmospheric pressure.\\" Gravity, pressure and molecular cohesion were the focus of work in 2010 by Hughes at the Queensland University of Technology. He used siphons at air pressure and his conclusion was that: \\"The flow of water out of the bottom of a siphon depends on the difference in height between the inflow and outflow, and therefore cannot be dependent on atmospheric pressure‚Ä¶\\" Hughes did further work on siphons at air pressure in 2011 and concluded that: \\"The experiments described above demonstrate that ordinary siphons at atmospheric pressure operate through gravity and not atmospheric pressure\\". The father and son researchers, Ramette and Ramette, successfully siphoned carbon dioxide under air pressure in 2011 and concluded that molecular cohesion is not required for the operation of a siphon but that: \\"The basic explanation of siphon action is that, once the tube is filled, the flow is initiated by the greater pull of gravity on the fluid on the longer side compared with that on the short side. This creates a pressure drop throughout the siphon tube, in the same sense that 'sucking' on a straw reduces the pressure along its length all the way to the intake point. The ambient atmospheric pressure at the intake point responds to the reduced pressure by forcing the fluid upwards, sustaining the flow, just as in a steadily sucked straw in a milkshake.\\" Again in 2011, Richert and Binder (at the University of Hawaii) examined the siphon and concluded that molecular cohesion is not required for the operation of a siphon but relies upon gravity and a pressure differential, writing: \\"As the fluid initially primed on the long leg of the siphon rushes down due to gravity, it leaves behind a partial vacuum that allows pressure on the entrance point of the higher container to push fluid up the leg on that side\\".http://www.phys.uhh.hawaii.edu/documents/TPT-final.pdf The research team of Boatwright, Puttick, and Licence, all at the University of Nottingham, succeeded in running a siphon in high vacuum, also in 2011. They wrote that: \\"It is widely believed that the siphon is principally driven by the force of atmospheric pressure. An experiment is described that shows that a siphon can function even under high-vacuum conditions. Molecular cohesion and gravity are shown to be contributing factors in the operation of a siphon; the presence of a positive atmospheric pressure is not required\\". Writing in Physics Today in 2011, J. Dooley from Millersville University stated that both a pressure differential within the siphon tube and the tensile strength of the liquid are required for a siphon to operate. A researcher at Humboldt State University, A. McGuire, examined flow in siphons in 2012. Using the advanced general- purpose multiphysics simulation software package LS-DYNA he examined pressure initialisation, flow, and pressure propagation within a siphon. He concluded that: \\"Pressure, gravity and molecular cohesion can all be driving forces in the operation of siphons\\". In 2014, Hughes and Gurung (at the Queensland University of Technology), ran a water siphon under varying air pressures ranging from sea level to 11.9 km () altitude. They noted that: \\"Flow remained more or less constant during ascension indicating that siphon flow is independent of ambient barometric pressure\\". They used Bernoulli's equation and the Poiseuille equation to examine pressure differentials and fluid flow within a siphon. Their conclusion was that: \\"It follows from the above analysis that there must be a direct cohesive connection between water molecules flowing in and out of a siphon. This is true at all atmospheric pressures in which the pressure in the apex of the siphon is above the vapour pressure of water, an exception being ionic liquids\\".http://www.nature.com/srep/2014/140422/srep04741/pdf/srep04741.pdf Practical requirements A plain tube can be used as a siphon. An external pump has to be applied to start the liquid flowing and prime the siphon (in home use this is often done by a person inhaling through the tube until enough of it has filled with liquid; this may pose danger to the user, depending on the liquid that is being siphoned). This is sometimes done with any leak-free hose to siphon gasoline from a motor vehicle's gasoline tank to an external tank. (Siphoning gasoline by mouth often results in the accidental swallowing of gasoline, or aspirating it into the lungs, which can cause death or lung damage.) If the tube is flooded with liquid before part of the tube is raised over the intermediate high point and care is taken to keep the tube flooded while it is being raised, no pump is required. Devices sold as siphons often come with a siphon pump to start the siphon process. In some applications it can be helpful to use siphon tubing that is not much larger than necessary. Using piping of too great a diameter and then throttling the flow using valves or constrictive piping appears to increase the effect of previously cited concerns over gases or vapor collecting in the crest which serve to break the vacuum. If the vacuum is reduced too much, the siphon effect can be lost. Reducing the size of pipe used closer to requirements appears to reduce this effect and creates a more functional siphon that does not require constant re- priming and restarting. In this respect, where the requirement is to match a flow into a container with a flow out of said container (to maintain a constant level in a pond fed by a stream, for example) it would be preferable to utilize two or three smaller separate parallel pipes that can be started as required rather than attempting to use a single large pipe and attempting to throttle it.  Automatic intermittent siphon  Siphons are sometimes employed as automatic machines, in situations where it is desirable to turn a continuous trickling flow or an irregular small surge flow into a large surge volume. A common example of this is a public restroom with urinals regularly flushed by an automatic siphon in a small water tank overhead. When the container is filled, all the stored liquid is released, emerging as a large surge volume that then resets and fills again. One way to do this intermittent action involves complex machinery such as floats, chains, levers, and valves, but these can corrode, wear out, or jam over time. An alternate method is with rigid pipes and chambers, using only the water itself in a siphon as the operating mechanism. A siphon used in an automatic unattended device needs to be able to function reliably without failure. This is different from the common demonstration self-starting siphons in that there are ways the siphon can fail to function which require manual intervention to return to normal surge flow operation. The most common failure is for the liquid to dribble out slowly, matching the rate that the container is filling, and the siphon enters an undesired steady-state condition. Preventing dribbling typically involves pneumatic principles to trap one or more large air bubbles in various pipes, which are sealed by water traps. This method can fail if it can't start working intermittently without water already present in parts of the mechanism, and which will not be filled if the mechanism starts from a dry state. A second problem is that the trapped air pockets will shrink over time if the siphon is not operating due to no inflow. The air in pockets is absorbed by the liquid, which pulls liquid up into the piping until the air pocket disappears, and can cause activation of water flow outside the normal range of operating when the storage tank is not full, leading to loss of the liquid seal in lower parts of the mechanism. A third problem is where the lower end of the liquid seal is simply a U-trap bend in an outflow pipe. During vigorous emptying, the kinetic motion of the liquid out the outflow can propel too much liquid out, causing a loss of the sealing volume in the outflow trap and loss of the trapped air bubble to maintain intermittent operation. A fourth problem involves seep holes in the mechanism, intended to slowly refill these various sealing chambers when the siphon is dry. The seep holes can be plugged by debris and corrosion, requiring manual cleaning and intervention. To prevent this, the siphon may be restricted to pure liquid sources, free of solids or precipitate. Many automatic siphons have been invented going back to at least the 1850s, for automatic siphon mechanisms that attempt to overcome these problems using various pneumatic and hydrodynamic principles.  Applications and terminology  fermentation When certain liquids needs to be purified, siphoning can help prevent either the bottom (dregs) or the top (foam and floaties) from being transferred out of one container into a new container. Siphoning is thus useful in the fermentation of wine and beer for this reason, since it can keep unwanted impurities out of the new container. Self-constructed siphons, made of pipes or tubes, can be used to evacuate water from cellars after floodings. Between the flooded cellar and a deeper place outside a connection is built, using a tube or some pipes. They are filled with water through an intake valve (at the highest end of the construction). When the ends are opened, the water flows through the pipe into the sewer or the river. Siphon irrigation of cotton at St George, Queensland. Siphoning is common in irrigated fields to transfer a controlled amount of water from a ditch, over the ditch wall, into furrows. Large siphons may be used in municipal waterworks and industry. Their size requires control via valves at the intake, outlet and crest of the siphon. The siphon may be primed by closing the intake and outlets and filling the siphon at the crest. If intakes and outlets are submerged, a vacuum pump may be applied at the crest to prime the siphon. Alternatively the siphon may be primed by a pump at either the intake or outlet. Gas in the liquid is a concern in large siphons. The gas tends to accumulate at the crest and if enough accumulates to break the flow of liquid, the siphon stops working. The siphon itself will exacerbate the problem because as the liquid is raised through the siphon, the pressure drops, causing dissolved gases within the liquid to come out of solution. Higher temperature accelerates the release of gas from liquids so maintaining a constant, low temperature helps. The longer the liquid is in the siphon, the more gas is released, so a shorter siphon overall helps. Local high points will trap gas so the intake and outlet legs should have continuous slopes without intermediate high points. The flow of the liquid moves bubbles thus the intake leg can have a shallow slope as the flow will push the gas bubbles to the crest. Conversely, the outlet leg needs to have a steep slope to allow the bubbles to move against the liquid flow; though other designs call for a shallow slope in the outlet leg as well to allow the bubbles to be carried out of the siphon. At the crest the gas can be trapped in a chamber above the crest. The chamber needs to be occasionally primed again with liquid to remove the gas. A siphon used for homebrewing beer  Siphon rain gauge  A siphon rain gauge is a rain gauge that can record rainfall over an extended period. A siphon is used to automatically empty the gauge. It is often simply called a \\"siphon gauge\\" and is not to be confused with a siphon pressure gauge.  Siphon spillway  A siphon spillway in a dam is usually not technically a siphon, as it is generally used to drain elevated water levels. However, a siphon spillway operates as an actual siphon if it raises the flow higher than the surface of the source reservoir, as sometimes is the case when used in irrigation.http://eprints.qut.edu.au/31098/32/Lake__Bonney_siphon_and_embankment1.JPG In operation, a siphon spillway is considered to be \\"pipe flow\\" or \\"closed- duct flow\\".http://www.tamuc.edu/academics/colleges/scienceengineeringagriculture/departments/engineeringTechnology/documents/safety/Hm16036e.pdf A normal spillway flow is pressurized by the height of the reservoir above the spillway, whereas a siphon flow rate is governed by the difference in height of the inlet and outlet. Some designs make use of an automatic system that uses the flow of water in a spiral vortex to remove the air above to prime the siphon. Such a design includes the volute siphon.  Flush toilet  Flush toilets often have some siphon effect as the bowl empties. Some toilets also use the siphon principle to obtain the actual flush from the cistern. The flush is triggered by a lever or handle that operates a simple diaphragm-like piston pump that lifts enough water to the crest of the siphon to start the flow of water which then completely empties the contents of the cistern into the toilet bowl. The advantage of this system was that no water would leak from the cistern excepting when flushed. These were mandatory in the UK until 2011. Early urinals incorporated a siphon in the cistern which would flush automatically on a regular cycle because there was a constant trickle of clean water being fed to the cistern by a slightly open valve.  Devices that are not true siphons = Siphon coffee  Siphon coffee brewer: when warmed by a heat source (A), vapor pressure increases in the lower chamber (B), forcing the water downwards (C) and through the central pipe into the upper chamber (D) where it is mixed with the coffee grounds. When the heat is removed, the water flows back down. While if both ends of a siphon are at atmospheric pressure, liquid flows from high to low, if the bottom end of a siphon is pressurized, liquid can flow from low to high. If pressure is removed from the bottom end, the liquid flow will reverse, illustrating that it is pressure driving the siphon. An everyday illustration of this is the siphon coffee brewer, which works as follows (designs vary; this is a standard design, omitting coffee grounds): * a glass vessel is filled with water, then corked (so air-tight) with a siphon sticking vertically upwards * another glass vessel is placed on top, open to the atmosphere ‚Äì the top vessel is empty, the bottom is filled with water * the bottom vessel is then heated; as the temperature increases, the vapor pressure of the water increases (it increasingly evaporates); when the water boils the vapor pressure equals atmospheric pressure, and as the temperature increases above boiling the pressure in the bottom vessel then exceeds atmospheric pressure, and pushes the water up the siphon tube into the upper vessel. * a small amount of still hot water and steam remain in the bottom vessel and are kept heated, with this pressure keeping the water in the upper vessel * when the heat is removed from the bottom vessel, the vapor pressure decreases, and can no longer support the column of water ‚Äì gravity (acting on the water) and atmospheric pressure then push the water back into the bottom vessel. In practice, the top vessel is filled with coffee grounds, and the heat is removed from the bottom vessel when the coffee has finished brewing. What vapor pressure means concretely is that the boiling water converts high-density water (a liquid) into low-density steam (a gas), which thus expands to take up more volume (in other words, the pressure increases). This pressure from the expanding steam then forces the liquid up the siphon; when the steam then condenses down to water the pressure decreases and the liquid flows back down.  Siphon pump  While a simple siphon cannot output liquid at a level higher than the source reservoir, a more complicated device utilizing an airtight metering chamber at the crest and a system of automatic valves, may discharge liquid on an ongoing basis, at a level higher than the source reservoir, without outside pumping energy being added. It can accomplish this despite what initially appears to be a violation of conservation of energy because it can take advantage of the energy of a large volume of liquid dropping some distance, to raise and discharge a small volume of liquid above the source reservoir. Thus it might be said to \\"require\\" a large quantity of falling liquid to power the dispensing of a small quantity. Such a system typically operates in a cyclical or start/stop but ongoing and self-powered manner. Ram pumps do not work in this way. These metering pumps are true siphon pumping devices which use siphons as their power source. Inverted siphon Water seal under a sink. Inverted siphoning occurs below the line \\"A\\". An inverted siphon is not a siphon but a term applied to pipes that must dip below an obstruction to form a \\"U\\" shaped flow path. Large inverted siphons are used to convey water being carried in canals or flumes across valleys, for irrigation or gold mining. The Romans used inverted siphons of multiple lead pipes to cross valleys that were too big to construct an aqueduct. Inverted siphons are commonly called traps for their function in preventing smelly sewer gases from coming back out of drains and sometimes making dense objects like rings and electronic components retrievable after falling into a drain. Liquid flowing in one end simply forces liquid up and out the other end, but solids like sand will accumulate. This is especially important in sewage systems or culverts which must be routed under rivers or other deep obstructions where the better term is \\"depressed sewer\\".http://www.azdeq.gov/environ/water/engineering/download/scs_depressed.pdf Back siphonage Back siphonage is a plumbing term applied to the reversal of normal water flow in a plumbing system due to sharply reduced or negative pressure on the water supply side, such as high demand on water supply by fire-fighting; it is not an actual siphon as it is suction. Back siphonage is rare as it depends on submerged inlets at the outlet (home) end and these are uncommon. Back siphonage is not to be confused with backflow; which is the reversed flow of water from the outlet end to the supply end caused by pressure occurring at the outlet end. Anti-siphon valve Building codes often contain specific sections on back siphonage and especially for external faucets (See the sample building code quote, below). Backflow prevention devices such as anti-siphon valves are required in such designs. The reason is that external faucets may be attached to hoses which may be immersed in an external body of water, such as a garden pond, swimming pool, aquarium or washing machine. In these situations the flow is not actually a siphon but suction due to reduced pressure on the water supply side. Should the pressure within the water supply system fall, the external water may be returned by back pressure into the drinking water system through the faucet. Another possible contamination point is the water intake in the toilet tank. An anti- siphon valve is also required here to prevent pressure drops in the water supply line from suctioning water out of the toilet tank (which may contain additives such as \\"toilet blue\\") and contaminating the water system. Anti- siphon valves function as a one-direction check valve. Anti-siphon valves are also used medically. Hydrocephalus, or excess fluid in the brain, may be treated with a shunt which drains cerebrospinal fluid from the brain. All shunts have a valve to relieve excess pressure in the brain. The shunt may lead into the abdominal cavity such that the shunt outlet is significantly lower than the shunt intake when the patient is standing. Thus a siphon effect may take place and instead of simply relieving excess pressure, the shunt may act as a siphon, completely draining cerebrospinal fluid from the brain. The valve in the shunt may be designed to prevent this siphon action so that negative pressure on the drain of the shunt does not result in excess drainage. Only excess positive pressure from within the brain should result in drainage. The anti-siphon valve in medical shunts is preventing excess forward flow of liquid. In plumbing systems, the anti-siphon valve is preventing backflow. Sample building code regulations regarding \\"back siphonage\\" from the Canadian province of Ontario: :7.6.2.3.Back Siphonage :# Every potable water system that supplies a fixture or tank that is not subject to pressures above atmospheric shall be protected against back-siphonage by a backflow preventer. :# Where a potable water supply is connected to a boiler, tank, cooling jacket, lawn sprinkler system or other device where a non-potable fluid may be under pressure that is above atmospheric or the water outlet may be submerged in the non-potable fluid, the water supply shall be protected against backflow by a backflow preventer. :# Where a hose bibb is installed outside a building, inside a garage, or where there is an identifiable risk of contamination, the potable water system shall be protected against backflow by a backflow preventer. =Other anti-siphoning devices= Along with anti-siphon valves, anti-siphoning devices also exist. The two are unrelated in application. Siphoning can be used to remove fuel from tanks. With the cost of fuel increasing, it has been linked in several countries to the rise in fuel theft. Trucks, with their large fuel tanks, are most vulnerable. The anti-siphon device prevents thieves from inserting a tube into the fuel tank. Siphon barometer A siphon barometer is the term sometimes applied to the simplest of mercury barometers. A continuous U-shaped tube of the same diameter throughout is sealed on one end and filled with mercury. When placed into the upright, \\"U\\", position, mercury will flow away from the sealed end, forming a partial vacuum, until balanced by atmospheric pressure on the other end. The term \\"siphon\\" derives from the belief that air pressure is involved in the operation of a siphon. The difference in height of the fluid between the two arms of the U-shaped tube is the same as the maximum intermediate height of a siphon. When used to measure pressures other than atmospheric pressure, a siphon barometer is sometimes called a siphon gauge; these are not siphons but follow a standard 'U'-shaped design leading to the term. Siphon barometers are still produced as precision instruments. Siphon barometers should not be confused with a siphon rain gauge., Siphon bottle Siphon bottles A siphon bottle (also called a soda syphon or, archaically, a siphoidhttp://voronoi.ics.uci.edu/cgi- bin/Dict?Form=Dict2&Database;=*&Query;=siphoid) is a pressurized bottle with a vent and a valve. It is not a siphon as pressure within the bottle drives the liquid up and out a tube. A special form was the gasogene. Siphon cup A siphon cup is the (hanging) reservoir of paint attached to a spray gun, it is not a siphon as a vacuum pump extracts the paint. This name is to distinguish it from gravity-fed reservoirs. An archaic use of the term is a cup of oil in which the oil is transported out of the cup via a cotton wick or tube to a surface to be lubricated, this is not a siphon but an example of capillary action. Heron's siphon Heron's siphon is not a siphon as it works as a gravity driven pressure pump,http://www.xcdsystem.com/iie2014/abstract/finalpapers/i835.pdf at first glance it appears to be a perpetual motion machine but will stop when the air in the priming pump is depleted. In a slightly differently configuration, it is also known as Heron's fountain. Venturi siphon A venturi siphon, also known as an eductor, is not a siphon but a form of vacuum pump using the Venturi effect of fast flowing fluids (e.g. air), to produce low pressures to suction other fluids; a common example is the carburetor. See pressure head. The low pressure at the throat of the venturi is called a siphon when a second fluid is introduced, or an aspirator when the fluid is air, this is an example of the misconception that air pressure is the operating force for siphons. Siphonic roof drainage Despite the name, siphonic roof drainage does not work as a siphon; the technology makes use of gravity induced vacuum pumping to carry water horizontally from multiple roof drains to a single downpipe and to increase flow velocity. Metal baffles at the roof drain inlets reduce the injection of air which increases the efficiency of the system. One benefit to this drainage technique is reduced capital costs in construction compared to traditional roof drainage. Another benefit is the elimination of pipe pitch or gradient required for conventional roof drainage piping. However this system of gravity pumping is mainly suitable for large buildings and is not usually suitable for residential properties.  Self-siphons  The term self-siphon is used in a number of ways. Liquids that are composed of long polymers can \\"self-siphon\\"School of Chemistry. Chem.soton.ac.uk. Retrieved on 11 November 2010. and these liquids do not depend on atmospheric pressure. Self-siphoning polymer liquids work the same as the siphon-chain model where the lower part of the chain pulls the rest of the chain up and over the crest. This phenomenon is also called a tubeless siphon.Tubeless Siphon and Die Swell Demonstration, Christopher W. MacMinn & Gareth H. McKinley, 26 September 2004 \\"Self-siphon\\" is also often used in sales literature by siphon manufacturers to describe portable siphons that contain a pump. With the pump, no external suction (e.g. from a person's mouth/lungs) is required to start the siphon and thus the product is described as a \\"self-siphon\\". If the upper reservoir is such that the liquid there can rise above the height of the siphon crest, the rising liquid in the reservoir can \\"self-prime\\" the siphon and the whole apparatus be described as a \\"self-siphon\\". Once primed, such a siphon will continue to operate until the level of the upper reservoir falls below the intake of the siphon. Such self-priming siphons are useful in some rain gauges and dams. In nature= Anatomy  The term \\"siphon\\" is used for a number of structures in human and animal anatomy, either because flowing liquids are involved or because the structure is shaped like a siphon, but in which no actual siphon effect is occurring: see Siphon (disambiguation). There has been a debate if whether the siphon mechanism plays a role in blood circulation. However, in the 'closed loop' of circulation this was discounted; \\"In contrast, in 'closed' systems, like the circulation, gravity does not hinder uphill flow nor does it cause downhill flow, because gravity acts equally on the ascending and descending limbs of the circuit\\", but for \\"historical reasons\\", the term is used.http://www.descsite.nl/Publications/Thesis/Gisolf/Gisolf_Chap1.pdf One hypothesis (in 1989) was that a siphon existed in the circulation of the giraffe. But further research in 2004 found that, \\"There is no hydrostatic gradient and since the 'fall' of fluid does not assist the ascending arm, there is no siphon. The giraffe‚Äôs high arterial pressure, which is sufficient to raise the blood 2 m from heart to head with sufficient remaining pressure to perfuse the brain, supports this concept.\\" However, a paper written in 2005 urged more research on the hypothesis: > The principle of the siphon is not species specific and should be a > fundamental principle of closed circulatory systems. Therefore, the > controversy surrounding the role of the siphon principle may best be > resolved by a comparative approach. Analyses of blood pressure on a variety > of long-necked and long-bodied animals, which take into account phylogenetic > relatedness, will be important. In addition experimental studies that > combined measurements of arterial and venous blood pressures, with cerebral > blood flow, under a variety of gravitational stresses (different head > positions), will ultimately resolve this controversy. Species Some species are named after siphons because they resemble siphons in whole or in part. Geosiphons are fungi. There are species of alga belonging to the family Siphonocladaceae in the phylum Chlorophyta https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Aigara_Alves/publication/260247798_Flora_da_Bahia_Siphonocladaceae/links/0a85e5342e37eb90b3000000.pdf which have tube-like structures. Ruellia villosa is a tropical plant in the family Acanthaceae that is also known by the botanical synonym, 'Siphonacanthus villosus Nees'.  Geology  In speleology, a siphon or a sump is that part of a cave passage that lies under water and through which cavers have to dive to progress further into the cave system, it is not an actual siphon.  Rivers  A river siphon occurs when part of the water flow passes under a submerged object like a rock or tree trunk. The water flowing under the obstruction can be very powerful, and as such can be very dangerous for kayaking, canyoning, and other river-based watersports. Explanation using Bernoulli's equation Bernoulli's equation may be applied to a siphon to derive the flow rate and maximum height of the siphon. Bernoulli's equation :Let the surface of the upper reservoir be the reference elevation. :Let point A be the start point of siphon, immersed within the higher reservoir and at a depth ‚àíd below the surface of the upper reservoir. :Let point B be the intermediate high point on the siphon tube at height +hB above the surface of the upper reservoir. :Let point C be the drain point of the siphon at height ‚àíhC below the surface of the upper reservoir. Bernoulli's equation: : {v^2 \\\\over 2}+gy+{P \\\\over \\\\rho}=\\\\mathrm{constant} : v \\\\; = fluid velocity along the streamline : g \\\\; = gravitational acceleration downwards : y \\\\; = elevation in gravity field : P \\\\; = pressure along the streamline : \\\\rho \\\\; = fluid density Apply Bernoulli's equation to the surface of the upper reservoir. The surface is technically falling as the upper reservoir is being drained. However, for this example we will assume the reservoir to be infinite and the velocity of the surface may be set to zero. Furthermore, the pressure at both the surface and the exit point C is atmospheric pressure. Thus: Apply Bernoulli's equation to point A at the start of the siphon tube in the upper reservoir where P = PA, v = vA and y = ‚àíd Apply Bernoulli's equation to point B at the intermediate high point of the siphon tube where P = PB, v = vB and y = hB Apply Bernoulli's equation to point C where the siphon empties. Where v = vC and y = ‚àíhC. Furthermore, the pressure at the exit point is atmospheric pressure. Thus: Velocity As the siphon is a single system, the constant in all four equations is the same. Setting equations 1 and 4 equal to each other gives: :{0^2 \\\\over 2}+g(0)+{P_\\\\mathrm{atm} \\\\over \\\\rho}={v_C^2 \\\\over 2}-gh_C+{P_\\\\mathrm{atm} \\\\over \\\\rho} Solving for vC: :Velocity of siphon: :v_C=\\\\sqrt{2gh_C} The velocity of the siphon is thus driven solely by the height difference between the surface of the upper reservoir and the drain point. The height of the intermediate high point, hB, does not affect the velocity of the siphon. However, as the siphon is a single system, vB = vC and the intermediate high point does limit the maximum velocity. The drain point cannot be lowered indefinitely to increase the velocity. Equation 3 will limit the velocity to a positive pressure at the intermediate high point to prevent cavitation. The maximum velocity may be calculated by combining equations 1 and 3: :{0^2 \\\\over 2}+g(0)+{P_\\\\mathrm{atm} \\\\over \\\\rho}={v_B^2 \\\\over 2}+gh_B+{P_B \\\\over \\\\rho} Setting PB = 0 and solving for vmax: :Maximum velocity of siphon: :v_\\\\mathrm{max}=\\\\sqrt{2\\\\left({P_\\\\mathrm{atm} \\\\over \\\\rho}-gh_B\\\\right)} The depth, ‚àíd, of the initial entry point of the siphon in the upper reservoir, does not affect the velocity of the siphon. No limit to the depth of the siphon start point is implied by Equation 2 as pressure PA increases with depth d. Both these facts imply the operator of the siphon may bottom skim or top skim the upper reservoir without impacting the siphon's performance. This equation for the velocity is the same as that of any object falling height hC. This equation assumes PC is atmospheric pressure. If the end of the siphon is below the surface, the height to the end of the siphon cannot be used; rather the height difference between the reservoirs should be used. Maximum height Although siphons can exceed the barometric height of the liquid in special circumstances, e.g. when the liquid is degassed and the tube is clean and smooth, in general the practical maximum height can be found as follows. Setting equations 1 and 3 equal to each other gives: :{0^2 \\\\over 2}+g(0)+{P_\\\\mathrm{atm} \\\\over \\\\rho}={v_B^2 \\\\over 2}+gh_B+{P_B \\\\over \\\\rho} Maximum height of the intermediate high point occurs when it is so high that the pressure at the intermediate high point is zero; in typical scenarios this will cause the liquid to form bubbles and if the bubbles enlarge to fill the pipe then the siphon will \\"break\\". Setting PB = 0: :{P_\\\\mathrm{atm} \\\\over {\\\\rho}}={v_B^2 \\\\over 2}+gh_B Solving for hB: :General height of siphon: :h_B={P_\\\\mathrm{atm} \\\\over \\\\rho g} - {v_B^2 \\\\over 2g}. This means that the height of the intermediate high point is limited by pressure along the streamline being always greater than zero. :Maximum height of siphon: :h_{B\\\\mathrm{,max}}={P_\\\\mathrm{atm} \\\\over \\\\rho g} This is the maximum height that a siphon will work. Substituting values will give approximately 10 metres for water and, by definition of standard pressure, 0.76 metres () for mercury. The ratio of heights (about 13.6) equals the ratio of densities of water and mercury (at a given temperature). As long as this condition is satisfied (pressure greater than zero), the flow at the output of the siphon is still only governed by the height difference between the source surface and the outlet. Volume of fluid in the apparatus is not relevant as long as the pressure head remains above zero in every section. Because pressure drops when velocity is increased, a static siphon (or manometer) can have a slightly higher height than a flowing siphon. Vacuum siphons Experiments have shown that siphons can operate in a vacuum, via cohesion and tensile strength between molecules, provided that the liquids are pure and degassed and surfaces are very clean. Oxford English Dictionary The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) entry on siphon, published in 1911, states that a siphon works by atmospheric pressure. Stephen Hughes of Queensland University of Technology criticized this in a 2010 article which was widely reported in the media.QUT physicist corrects Oxford English Dictionary The OED editors stated, \\"there is continuing debate among scientists as to which view is correct. ... We would expect to reflect this debate in the fully updated entry for siphon, due to be published later this year.\\" Dr. Hughes continued to defend his view of the siphon in a late September post at the Oxford blog. The 2015 definition by the OED is: > A tube used to convey liquid upwards from a reservoir and then down to a > lower level of its own accord. Once the liquid has been forced into the > tube, typically by suction or immersion, flow continues unaided. The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica currently describes a siphon as: > Siphon, also spelled syphon, instrument, usually in the form of a tube bent > to form two legs of unequal length, for conveying liquid over the edge of a > vessel and delivering it at a lower level.

The white stripe is twice the height ( width ) of the red ones (ratio 1:2:1)‚Äîa Spanish fess. The green cedar (Lebanon Cedar) in the middle touches each of the red stripes and its width is one third of the width of the flag.The description of the flag is cited in the Lebanese Constitution, Chapter 1, Article 5. Symbolism  The Presence and position of the Cedar in the middle of the flag is directly inspired by the mountains of Lebanon cedar (Cedrus libani). The Cedar is a symbol of holiness, eternity and peace. As an emblem of longevity, the cedar of Lebanon has its origin in many biblical references. Cedrus libani. The cedar of Lebanon is mentioned seventy-seven times in the Bible, especially in the book Psalms chapter 92 verse 13 where it says that \\"The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree, He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon\\" and Chapter 104, verse 16, where it is stated: \\"[t]he trees of the Lord are well watered, the cedars of Lebanon that he planted\\". Alphonse de Lamartine (1790-1869), marveling at the cedars of Lebanon during his trip to the Orient with his daughter Julia, had these words: \\"[t]he cedars of Lebanon are the relics of centuries and nature, the most famous natural landmarks in the universe. They know the history of the earth, better than the story itself\\". Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry (1900-1944), who loved the cedars and also had visited Lebanon in 1935, wrote in his work Citadel \\"[t]he peace is a long growing tree. We need, as the cedar, to rock its unity\\". In 1920, in a text of the proclamation of the State of Greater Lebanon, it was said: \\"[a]n evergreen cedar is like a young nation despite a cruel past. Although oppressed, never conquered, the cedar is its rallying. By the union, it will break all attacks\\". The white color on the flag represents the snow as a symbol of purity and peace. The two red stripes refer to the Lebanese blood shed to preserve the country against the successive invaders.  Construction sheet  Construction sheet of the Lebanese Flag According to the Article 5 of the constitution of Lebanon: \\"The Lebanese flag shall be composed of three horizontal stripes, a white stripe between two red ones. The width of the white stripe shall be equal to that of both red stripes.

It was similar to the tricolour flag of France but with a green cedar (Lebanon Cedar) in the middle.  Lebanese Republic  The present Lebanese flag was adopted just prior to independence from France in 1943. Seeking independence, the actual flag was first drawn by member of parliament Henri Pharaon in the Chamber of deputies Saeb Salam's house in Mousaitbeh by the deputies of the Lebanese parliament. It was adopted on 7 December 1943, during a meeting in the parliament, where the article 5 in the Lebanese constitution was modified. One theory is that Henri Pharaon based the composition of the flag on the Lebanese geography and therefore, the first red represents the Mount Lebanon and the second red represents the Anti-Lebanon mountains and the white represents the Beqaa Valley, which is situated in the middle of the two mountain ranges on the map of Lebanon. And the green cedar (Lebanon Cedar) in the middle of the white part touches each of the red stripes is added because Lebanon is sometimes metonymically referred to as the Land of the Cedars. The composition of the white stripe (a Spanish fess) could have been inspired by the red- yellow-red Flag of Spain, where the flag structure is based on the Lebanese connection to the Mediterranean Sea and its Phoenician past that reached to the Mediterranean shores of present-day Spain. However, the most likely inspiration for the modern flag is the flag of the precursor to the modern republic, The Mount Lebanon Emirate. The Emirate bore the flag of the Ma'an dynasty, a Druze dynasty which included one of the most influential figures in the shaping of an independent Lebanese identity, Emir Fakhr al-Din II, who struggled through his reign to establish independence from the Ottoman Empire. The flag has the exact same color scheme and even a similar composition. Red, white, and green being the primary colors with the green wreath in the center being replaced by the cedar in the modern flag; it is entirely probable that the modern flag is simply a redesign of this older, dynastic flag. Further evidence is supported by the fact that many government institutions in Lebanon continue to use the Ma'anid flag, such as the flag of the Lebanese Armed Forces, but without the green wreath, and it is still in place to this day.

Surrounding municipalities *Tokunoshima *Amagi History The early history of Isen is difficult to trace, as there was no formal writing system. Archaeological sites have revealed historic ruins (pottery and tools) dating back 30,000 years. The now famous \\"Kamuiyaki\\" historic ruins were discovered in 1983 and declared a national historic landmark in 2006. The findings suggest that the Sue ware pottery that spread around the Ryukyu Islands and up into the Kyushu mainland were largely made in Tokunoshima. On April 1, 1908 Shimajiri Village was founded; it was renamed Isen on June 29, 1921. As with all of Tokunoshima, the village came under the administration of the United States from 1 July 1946 to 25 December 1953. On 1 January 1962, Isen was upgraded to town status. Economy While mountainous in the north, the majority of land is relatively flat and arable, making Isen a prime location for agriculture. Isen's main agricultural products include sugar cane, potatoes, pumpkins, horticulture, and fruit trees. Education Isen has eight elementary and three junior high schools. Local attractions Isen has numerous sightseeing locations, including the Kamyuiki Ruins, Cape Inutabu, Yamamoto War Memorial, Seta-umi Beach, Kinenbama Beach, and a historical museum showcasing many of the archaeological discoveries found in Isen. Among historical sites is Shigechiyo Izumi's (Ê≥âÈáçÂçÉ‰ª£) grave site. Shigechiyo was Isen's oldest resident, being born on June 29, 1865 and dying February 21, 1986, making him 120 years old at the time of his death. He was inducted into the Guinness Book of World Records for being the oldest living person alive; however subsequent research has brought into question his birth date. He is now widely considered to have lived until he was 105 years old, putting his real birthday as June 29, 1880. Isen is also famous for T≈çgy≈´ (bullfighting). Different from western bullfighting, in T≈çgy≈´ two bulls fight each other while people cheer them on.

Later, a black and white striped hoist called the Dhandimathi () was added to the flag. This version of the flag was used until early in the 20th century, when Abdul Majeed Didi added a crescent to the national flag. At the same time, a distinct state flag was made, which had the crescent on a green rectangle. These changes were made some time between 1926 and 1932, during Abdul Majeed's term as Prime Minister. In 1953, the Maldives became a republic, resulting in another flag change. The national flag was dropped and the crescent on the state flag was reversed, so that it faced the hoist. The Sultanate was restored in 1954, but the flag was not changed back. Instead, Muhammad Fareed Didi created a new flag specifically for the Sultan, with a five-pointed star next to the crescent. A version of this flag is still used today as the Presidential Standard. When the Maldives gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1965, the black and white hoist was removed, giving the flag its modern form.

The triskelion is an ancient symbol, used by the Mycenaeans and the Lycians.  History  It is not known for definite why the symbol was originally adopted on the Isle of Man. The usage of a triskelion was very popular with Scandinavian cultures, and the symbol may have been introduced to the Isle by the Norse descendants of King Analaf Cuaran, who ruled the island between the 10th century and 1266. The earliest depiction of the triskelion of Mann can be found on the Manx Sword of State which dates back to the early 14th century. Following English domination of the isle in 1346, the triskelion was retained and endured as a symbol of the Isle of Man. By the mid-19th century the Manx flag began appearing on merchant ships from the Isle of Man. However, such usage of the flag was not sanctioned by the Board of Trade and the Admiralty under Section 105 of the 1854 Merchant Shipping Act in favour of the Red Ensign. This decision was reversed by the Admiralty on 4 March 1889 and Manx merchant ships were permitted to fly the Flag of the Isle of Man. The flag was officially adopted between 1928 and 1932, however sources differ. In July 1968 steps were taken to standardise the flag. The feet of the triskelion were all to be facing in a clockwise direction and the symbol was to be balanced on only one leg. On 27 August 1971 a civil ensign for the Isle of Man was approved by royal proclamation. This flag featured a red field with the Union Jack in the canton. The triskelion of Mann is emblazoned off centre towards the fly. Another Manx flag in use is the flag of Tynwald, the legislature of the Isle of Man, which has flown outside the Legislative Buildings since 1971.

Rules and specifications regarding the flag are set forth in the Official Flag of the Marshall Islands Act 1979 (Public Law 1979-1). History The Marshall Islands were part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands administered by the United States, from which the Marshall Islands, Palau, and the Federated States of Micronesia split. In common with other island nations in the region, this flag features the symbolic representation of the islands' place within the ocean. The rising diagonal band represents the equator, the star above representing this Northern Hemisphere archipelago. The white and orange portions of the band represent, respectively, the Ratak Chain (\\"sunrise\\") and the Ralik Chain (\\"sunset\\"), as well as symbolizing peace and courage.

In 1672, he was made Earl of Arlington and Viscount Thetford, and was regranted the title of Baron Arlington, with the same special remainder. Its territorial designation is the birthplace of its first holder Harlington, London, which was also known as Arlington. The first earl died, as anticipated, without male heirs so the titles went to his daughter Isabella. At age five, Isabella was engaged to Henry FitzRoy, the illegitimate son of Charles II of England and his mistress Barbara Villiers. Henry would be created Duke of Grafton in 1679. Co-descent with the dukedom of Grafton As this boy Charles's father was an illegitimate son of King Charles II he, therefore, took the Norman-style surname Fitzroy. Upon the death of his parents, Charles FitzRoy inherited the Arlington and Grafton substantive titles. The two titles continued united until the death of the 9th Duke in a high-speed racecar accident in 1936. Separation from Dukedom The Grafton dukedom passed to a cousin yet the three Arlington/Thetford titles fell into abeyance under the principle of moieties between his two sisters, neither of whom petitioned the Sovereign to terminate this. After the death of the elder sister, her eldest child Jennifer petitioned the Sovereign, and the abeyance of the barony of Arlington was terminated in her favour, restoring it upon her, rather than her aunt's descendants. The earldom of Arlington, however, remains abeyant, along with the viscountcy of Thetford. Abeyance of senior titles In the Peerage of the United Kingdom the earldom (including the viscountcy being a courtesy title) presents a rare example of a hereditary peerage title of a higher rank than baron falling into abeyance, another case being that of the earldom of Cromartie in 1893.

Originally a twm derivative, FVWM has evolved into a powerful and highly configurable environment for Unix-like systems. History SUSE 5.1 FVWM 1.24, an old version from the 1.x series In 1993, during his work analyzing acoustic signatures for the United States Department of Defense, Robert Nation began hacking twm with the intent of simultaneously reducing memory usage and adding support for virtual desktops. Already known for his rxvt terminal emulator, Nation worked on reducing the memory consumption of his new window manager. Deciding to test FVWM's reception, on June 1, 1993, he bundled it with a rxvt release. In 1994 Rob Nation stopped developing FVWM and made Charles Hines the maintainer. Rob Nation's last release of FVWM was fvwm-1.24r. The post-Rob Nation version of FVWM uses a different configuration file format and has a significantly different architecture. Many Linux distributions, as a result, distributed both fvwm-1.24r and later releases of FVWM as separate programs. , fvwm-1.24r still compiles and runs on a modern Linux system without any problems. A small number of users continue to use the older FVWM release. In late 1998 the office of FVWM maintainer was abolished and further development has been conducted by a group of volunteers. Many developers have based their own projects on FVWM in order to benefit from the years of refinement and development. Many of the popular window managers in use today are related to FVWM: Afterstep, Xfce, Enlightenment, Metisse and many more. Name origin Originally, FVWM was the Feeble Virtual Window Manager, which was clearly stated by Robert Nation in a 1997 Linux Journal interview with him, who also claimed the name had been chosen because original releases had almost no user selectable features, so it really was feeble. However, at some point the meaning of the F was lost. When Google published the old news group archives acquired from DejaNews, the original meaning was re-discovered. However, when Chuck Hine was maintaining the official FVWM Frequently Asked Questions, Chuck had never agreed with the 'feeble' explanation, and added alternate possible meanings of F to the FAQ, with many entries coming from mailing list messages.FVWM - History Features FVWM emulating the Motif Window Manager (MWM) FVWM emulating the look of the Common Desktop Environment (CDE) FVWM 2.5 Xsession running on Debian 7 GNU/Linux This is a partial list based on the documentation distributed with FVWM.

It includes the image of an AK-47 with a bayonet attached to the barrel crossed by a hoe, superimposed on an open book. It is one of four national flags among UN member states that features a firearm, along with those of Guatemala, Haiti and Bolivia, but is the only one of the four to feature a modern firearm instead of cannons or muskets. Green stands for the riches of the land, the white fimbriations signify peace, black represents the African continent, yellow symbolises the country's minerals, and red represents the struggle for independence. The rifle stands for defence and vigilance, the open book symbolises the importance of education, the hoe represents the country's agriculture, and the star symbolises Marxism and internationalism. History The flag is based on the flag of the Mozambican Liberation Front (FRELIMO), the leading political party in Mozambique. The FRELIMO flag, used for a brief period after the country gained its independence from Portugal, looks like the current flag but lacking the emblem, with green, black, and yellow horizontal stripes separated by white fimbriations and a red triangle in the hoist. On independence the colours were rearranged to form the national flag, in diagonals emanating from the upper hoist. Over this was a white cogwheel containing the hoe, rifle, book, and star that appear on the present flag. The flag was altered in 1983; the colours were arranged in horizontal stripes, and the star was made larger. Later in the same year the cogwheel was removed, leading to the current form of the flag. 2005 new flag proposal In 2005, a competition was held to design a new flag for Mozambique. This came in the context of a drive to create a new crest and anthem for the country. RENAMO, Mozambique's parliamentary opposition, specifically wanted to see two symbols removed from the flag: the star, which they saw as representative of the country's communist past; and the Kalashnikov assault rifle, which they argued is incompatible with a country trying to be peaceful after the Mozambican Civil War. FRELIMO, the ruling party, argued that the star's resemblance to the communist symbol was coincidental, and that the rifle represented the nation's struggle for independence. 169 entries were received and a winning flag was selected, but was rejected by the FRELIMO-led parliament in December 2005. All 169 proposed flags were turned down, including the current flag without the rifle.

Although the architecture was marketed as a RISC machine, it was actually microprogrammed. It used a \\"sliding window\\" register model based on the Berkeley RISC processor, but memory access instructions had complex operation modes that could require many cycles to run. Many register-to- register scalar instructions were executed in a single machine cycle. Initially, floating point instructions were executed totally in microcode, although an optional floating point unit on a separate circuit board was released later. Microprogramming also allowed other non-RISC luxuries such as block move instructions. Programs had access to 64 registers, and many instructions were triadic. Sixteen registers (registers 48 to 63) were referred to as \\"global registers\\" and they correspond to the registers of a typical CPU, in that they are static and always visible. The other 48 registers were actually the top of the subroutine stack. Thirty-two of them (0‚Äì31) were local registers for the current subroutine, and registers 32‚Äì47 were used to pass up to 16 parameters to the next subroutine called. During a subroutine call, the register stack moved up 32 words, so the caller's registers 32‚Äì47 became the called subroutine's registers 0‚Äì15. The return instruction dropped the stack by 32 words so return parameters would be visible to the caller in registers 32‚Äì47. The stack cache held 16 levels in the CPU and stack overflow and underflow was automatically handled by the microcode of the CPU. The programming model had two stacks, one for the register stack, and one for subroutine local variables. One grew up from a designated address in the middle of the address space, and the other grew down from the top of the user mode address space. The 90x could accommodate four memory boards, initially holding 1 MB each. This was considered to be a lot of memory at the time, but the RISC-like architecture resulted in bigger programs than earlier architectures so most machines were sold with the memory slots full. Fortunately, the 1 MB memory boards had RAM in sockets, so they could be upgraded to 4 MB units when bigger dynamic RAM devices became available shortly after the 90x's initial release. The 90x competed with the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) VAX 11/780 which was the preferred platform for running UNIX in the early 1980s. The 90x processor benchmarked at roughly twice the speed of the VAX, and sold for about half the price. Pyramid was indirectly assisted by DEC's reluctance to sell VAX machines without the VMS operating system, for which they charged a considerable amount of money. Many universities wanted to run UNIX rather than VMS, so Pyramid's higher performance and lower price, coupled with artificial delivery delays or surcharges from DEC, helped them to make the risky decision to buy from a new manufacturer. One of the 90x's biggest advantages over the competition was its asynchronous serial port controller (the ITS or Intelligent Terminal Server) based on a 16-bit bit-slice processor. The ITS interfaced to 16 serial ports, and it could run them at very high speeds, using DMA to feed from daisy- chained output data blocks. A machine could have many ITSs installed, each one with its own I/O processor. Other machines at the time (including the 11/780) required CPU intervention every few bytes for interactive users, which added significantly to the system component of the CPU load. As a result, the 90x scored very well on benchmarks with a realistic amount of serial I/O. The disk and magnetic tape controllers were actually 16-bit third-party Multibus controllers fitted into a socket in a U-shaped bus-adapter board. Most early systems were delivered with the 470 MB Fujitsu Eagle disk drive and a slot- loading reel-to-reel streaming tape drive. The system also had an administrative processor (based on a Motorola 68000) that loaded the microcode from an 8‚Ä≥ floppy disk when the system was started. It was also able to run a suite of diagnostics over the system. It had a modem which allowed remote analysis by the manufacturer. The software run by the administrative processor was initially called the Totally Unrealistic Remote Diagnostic. This name was changed some years later. A minimal system was delivered in a single 19‚Ä≥ rack about 60‚Ä≥ high with the card cage in the bottom, the disk drive in the middle, the tape drive above it, then the 2 inch high control panel with a floppy disk drive and ignition key on the top. This was considered very compact at the time. At least one machine in Australia spend six months installed in a retired outdoor lavatory with an air-conditioner replacing the louvered window and the system console terminal sitting on top of the cabinet. Administration tasks were performed al-fresco. The only indicator on the control panel was an 8 segment bar graph LED display that displayed average CPU usage when the machine was running and a \\"Cylon Eye\\" pattern when the machine stopped unexpectedly. The machine was low enough that the console (a monochrome asynchronous terminal) could rest on top. 98x The 90x was fairly quickly followed by the 98x which was identical except that the processor clock speed was increased to 10 MHz. In late 1985 Pyramid released its first SMP system, 98x, running at 7 MHz. Several machines in the series were released, from the 1-CPU 9815 to the 4-CPU 9845, over a period of years from 1985 to 1987. The fully loaded 9845 ran at about 25 MIPS, a respectable figure for the era, though not competitive with high-end supercomputers. MIServer Like many of the early multiprocessor vendors, Pyramid turned to \\"commodity\\" RISC CPUs when they started to become practical. Pyramid continued to use their own RISC design until the release of the MIServer S product line. Pyramid released a series of register window-based machines as a 9000 line follow on. These were known as the MIServer starting in 1989. They supported up to ten CPUs with performance of about 12 MIPS each. The MIServer was replaced in 1991/2 with the MIServerT and later followed up with the MIServer S and ES, Pyramid's first R3000-based machine. The first machines in the series shipped with anywhere from 4 to 12 R3000s running at 33 MHz, with top-end performance around 140 MIPS. Later high-end MIServer ES machines had up to 24 CPUs, also at 33 MHz. The operating system for the MIPS based systems was DC/OSx, a port of AT&T; System V Release 4 (SVR4). Nile series The release of the 150 MHz 64-bit R4400 led to the 2‚Äì16-CPU Nile series in late 1993. With each CPU capable of 92 MIPS, the Nile systems were true supercomputers. Their last product, the Reliant RM 1000, known internally as the Meshine, was just coming to market when Siemens bought them. The RM1000 was a massive parallel processing (MPP) computer. Each node ran its own instance of Reliant UNIX DC/OSx. This system had a two-axis mesh architecture. The RM1000 used software called ICF to manage the cluster interconnects. ICF went on to provide the cluster foundation in the PrimeCluster HA software which is still developed and available from Fujitsu Siemens. Each compute node in the mesh used a single MIPS R10000 CPU, however enhancements to the RM1000 allowed for the NILE SMP machines to be included into the mesh as \\"fat\\" nodes. The compute nodes were physically installed in the HAAS-3 frames that shipped as drive arrays with the earlier Nile product. Each compute node controlled six SCSI disks as the primary controller and another six disks as a secondary controller. The frame with up to six compute nodes or four compute nodes and two Nile attach gateways was connected to neighboring frames with short ribbon cables. A HAAS-3 frame with compute nodes installed was called a cell. The cells locked together and could be stacked two high and end to end as far as space permitted. Four cells together were known as a ton and systems were referred to by the number of tons they contained. The largest mesh constructed at Pyramid was a test system containing 214 CPUs including four Nile SMP nodes. Although the RM1000 was eventually discontinued and not replaced by Siemens, customers who had large installations such as a large UK telecommunications company took a long time to find suitable replacements for these massively parallel systems due to their massive I/O and computing capabilities.

The band distinguished itself in the hardcore punk scene of the early 1980s through its jangly punk sound and sardonic humor delivered with thick Philadelphia accents. They attracted college radio attention with their 1985 debut album, Big Lizard in My Backyard, and the song \\"Bitchin' Camaro\\". Extensive touring and further releases helped the band garner an underground following. The band enjoyed international success on the strength of \\"Punk Rock Girl\\", a single from their 1988 Beelzebubba album which entered into MTV rotation. After an ill-fated stint with major record label Hollywood Records, health problems and industry frustrations in the wake of their success led to the group's 1995 breakup. The group reunited in 2008, with Dan Stevens replacing the deceased Schulthise. In 2011, they released The King in Yellow, their first studio album in 16 years. The band remained active thereafter, touring sporadically and releasing further records. History=Formative period (1979‚Äì83) Conceptually, the group began in 1979 as Genaro's home-recording project. Then based in Chester County, Pennsylvania, Genaro and his high school friend Garth created an imaginary band called The Dead Milkmen with a mythological back-story, recording homemade cassettes in keeping with their fictional characters. According to Genaro, the band's moniker came from a character named \\"Milkman Dead\\" in Toni Morrison's book Song of Solomon. Linderman, who attended high school with Genaro, later participated in this embryonic stage of the group. The project became inactive when Garth departed to join the United States Air Force and Genaro relocated to the dormitories of Philadelphia's Temple University. While in Philadelphia, Genaro met Schulthise and Sabatino through mutual friends. The three began loosely rehearsing together in 1981, taking their name from Genaro's home- recording project. Sabatino was the only member with experience in rock groups, having played previously in the two-piece new wave band Narthex. Linderman collaborated sporadically with the three during this period. He completed the lineup as lead vocalist in 1983, in time for their first public performance. Early career and albums (1983‚Äì87) The band played frequently in Philadelphia's punk rock circuit and eventually began touring nationally. After several self-released cassettes, their debut LP, Big Lizard in My Backyard, was issued in 1985 on Restless Records, a subsidiary of Enigma Records. The album received college radio play, with the track \\"Bitchin' Camaro\\" becoming especially popular. Because of its improvised dialogue intro, the song remained a favorite at live shows. Eat Your Paisley, their second album, was released the following year. \\"The Thing That Only Eats Hippies\\" became the band's first proper single and music video, and was a hit in Australia in addition to receiving domestic attention. Bucky Fellini followed in 1987, yielding the single \\"Instant Club Hit (You'll Dance to Anything)\\", a genre spoof of electronic dance music. Commercial success (1987‚Äì91) South Street district referenced in the single \\"Punk Rock Girl\\" As the band toured extensively behind their records, they began to accrue increasing attention, which often came through unconventional routes. In 1987, Major League Baseball player Jim Walewander, a Detroit Tigers rookie, became a vocal fan of the band; this was noted on his baseball card (1988 Score, #571), which described the group as \\"an obscure punk-rock band\\". Walewander invited the band to Tiger Stadium to see a game in which he hit his first and only major league home run, and the Milkmen had a short conversation with Tigers manager Sparky Anderson. In 1988, they issued Beelzebubba, a comparatively polished record that yielded their most successful single, \\"Punk Rock Girl\\". Featuring Genaro on lead vocals, the track saw extensive rotation on MTV and propelled the album to number 101 on Billboard's Top 200. They later released the Smokin' Banana Peels EP and music video from this album. The 1990 followup, Metaphysical Graffiti, did not yield a hit, but also charted and helped solidify the group's presence in the independent rock scene. Stint with Hollywood Records; breakup (1991‚Äì95) In 1991, the band left Restless and signed with The Walt Disney Company-owned Hollywood Records. Soul Rotation, their Hollywood debut released the following year, was focused more heavily on Genaro's singing and songwriting, with Linderman used predominantly as a keyboardist. The resulting record was much more pop-oriented than the group's previous efforts, but failed to produce a hit single. Not Richard, But Dick was issued in 1993, and did not fare any better than its predecessor. Relations between the band and label quickly soured, and the two albums went out of print shortly after their initial releases. The band was later unable to feature any of the songs from either of the Hollywood albums on retrospective or compilation CDs, although the group did smuggle an unlisted version of Soul Rotation's \\"If I Had a Gun\\" onto their 1994 live album Chaos Rules: Live at the Trocadero. Later in 1994, The Dead Milkmen announced their decision to break up following a final tour and album. This was due in part to the tendinitis Schulthise began to suffer in his hands, which made performing intensely painful, as well as the band's increasing frustration with commercial and industry struggles. Restless Records released what was planned to be their final studio album in 1995, Stoney's Extra Stout (Pig). Several compilations of both hits and rarities were later released. Post-breakup (1995‚Äì2008) solo career while the Dead Milkmen were inactive. The band then took a 13-year hiatus. During this time, Linderman performed with the gothic, Celtic punk band Burn Witch Burn and worked in journalism and blogging, including writing for the Philadelphia Weekly. Sabatino played with the Big Mess Orchestra and The Hunger Artists, two sporadically active projects, as well as Genaro's post-Milkmen group Butterfly Joe. Genaro remained the most musically active member of the band during its split, consistently recording and performing with groups such as Butterfly Joe, Touch Me Zoo, the Town Managers and The Low Budgets, while also maintaining a low- key solo career. Schulthise attended Indiana University to study Serbo- Croatian language, literature, history, and culture. In 1998 he moved to Novi Sad, Serbia, where he taught English. His writing was published several times in Svetigora, the magazine of the Serbian Orthodox Church. He hoped to contribute to the country‚Äôs regrowth and development, but fled in April 1999 when NATO bombed the country. In 2003, the band issued Now We Are 20, a repackaging of their self-released Now We Are 10 retrospective CD from 1993. They also collected their music video output and released it on the Philadelphia In Love DVD. Talks of reunion shows briefly emerged, but ended when Schulthise died by suicide on March 10, 2004. His death was reported in The New York Times and Rolling Stone. The surviving members reunited for two consecutive shows in November 2004 at the Trocadero Theatre in Philadelphia, with Dan Stevens of The Low Budgets playing bass. The shows were intended to pay tribute to Schulthise, and proceeds were donated to a variety of mental health organizations and to Studenica, a Serbian monastery that he supported. Reunion (2008‚Äìpresent) In late 2008, the band reunited to play their first performances since the Schulthise memorial shows, with Stevens again on bass. After two back-to-back warm-up shows in Philadelphia, including one billed under the pseudonym Les Enfants Du Prague, they played the Fun Fun Fun Fest in Austin, Texas. Following these concerts, they decided to continue as an active group. They spent the following two years composing new material before entering the recording studio late in 2010. On March 19, 2011, a new album, The King in Yellow, was released in digital form on the band's website, with a self-released CD following shortly thereafter. In late 2012, they released \\"Dark Clouds Gather Over Middlemarch\\" and \\"Big Words Make the Baby Jesus Cry\\", the first two installments in a series of limited-run singles. This year they also appeared on nerdcore rapper MC Lars' EP, Edgar Allan Poe EP, for a new recording of Lars' song, \\"Mr. Raven\\", which was originally released on his 2006 album, The Graduate. \\"The Great Boston Molasses Flood\\", the third release in their singles series, was released on March 15, 2013; the fourth, \\"Welcome to Undertown\\", followed on June 21. The band released Pretty Music for Pretty People, their tenth studio album, on October 7, 2014. The following year, SRA Records issued their split 7\\" with the 1980s Philadelphia hardcore band Flag of Democracy (also known as F.O.D.) In July 2017, The Dead Milkmen joined with philanthropic record label the Giving Groove.

Designed by Sir Thomas Slade, she was a prototype for the iconic 74-gun ships of the latter part of the 18th century. \\"The design of the Bellona class was never repeated precisely, but Slade experimented slightly with the lines, and the Arrogant, Ramillies, Egmont, and Elizabeth classes were almost identical in size, layout, and structure, and had only slight variations in the shape of the underwater hull. The Culloden class ship of the line was also similar, but slightly larger. Thus over forty ships were near-sisters of the Bellona.\\"Brian Lavery, Anatomy of the Ship: The 74-gun ship BELLONA, Conway Maritime Press, London 1989, , p.7 Bellona was built at Chatham, starting on 10 May 1758, launched on 19 February 1760, and commissioned three days later. She was the second ship of the Royal Navy to bear the name, and saw service in the Seven Years' War, American Revolutionary War and the Napoleonic Wars. She was captained by Robert (Bob) Faulknor the elder (father of the naval hero Robert Faulknor the younger).Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser 1904, p.183 Bellona left to join the squadron blockading Brest (this being the Seven Years' War) on 8 April 1760. She was later detached to patrol off the Tagus River in Spain, and on 13 August, while sailing with the frigate Brilliant, she sighted the French 74-gun ship Courageux in company with two frigates. The British ships pursued, and after 14 hours, caught up with the French ships and engaged at the Action of 14 August 1761, the Brilliant attacking the frigates, and Bellona taking on the Courageux. The frigates eventually got away, but the Courageux struck her colours, and was later repaired and taken into the Royal Navy. In 1762 Bellona was paid off and did not see action again until 1780, when on 30 December, under command of Captain Richard Onslow, along with Captain Taylor Penny on HMS Marlborough they captured the 54-gun Dutch ship Princess Carolina.https://morethannelson.com/officer/taylor-penny/ She then from 1781 saw action during the American Revolutionary War. She was coppered at this time, one of the first British ships to receive the hull-protecting layer. Until 1783 she cruised in the North Sea and the West Indies, and participated in reliefs of Gibraltar. Bellona was once again paid off, recommissioned briefly in 1789 in expectation of war with Russia, but didn't get into action again until 1793, when she went to the West Indies. On 10 January 1797, Bellona and drove a small French privateer schooner ashore on Deseada. They tried to use the privateer Legere, of six guns and 48 men, which Bellona had captured three days earlier, to retrieve the schooner that was on shore. In the effort, both French privateers were destroyed. Then Babet chased a brig, which had been a prize to the schooner, ashore. The British were unable to get her off so they destroyed her. Babet and Bellona were paid headmoney in 1828, more than 30 years later. Bellona took part in the Action of 18 June 1799, securing the surrender of the frigates Junon and Alceste, and helping HMS Centaur in capturing Courageuse. In 1801 she was in the Battle of Copenhagen, participating despite having grounded on a shoal. She continued to serve in the North Sea and Bay of Biscay until 1814, when she paid off for the last time and was broken up, having served in the navy for over 50 years, an unusually long time for one of the old wooden ships. Bellona in fiction Bellona appears in the Patrick O'Brian novels The Commodore and The Yellow Admiral as the pennant ship of a squadron led by the character Jack Aubrey.

Intended for fleet scouting duties and acting as a flotilla leader, a scout cruiser was typically armed with six to ten destroyer-type guns of 3-inch (76mm) to 4.7-inch (120mm) calibre, plus two to four torpedo tubes. The British were the first to operate scout cruisers, when the Royal Navy acquired 15 ships divided into two distinct groups - the eight vessels all ordered under the 1903 Programme, and the seven later, heavier- armed vessels ordered under the 1907-1910 Programmes. All these ships served in World War I, when the advent of better machinery and larger, faster destroyers and light cruisers had already made them obsolete. The other major operator of scout cruisers was Italy. With no conventional protected cruisers or light cruisers planned between 1900 and 1928, the Regia Marina instead operated a number of scout cruisers (esploratori) from 1912 onwards. Ranging in size from enlarged destroyers to substantial, light cruiser-like ships, these esploratori were also given secondary capabilities as fast minelayers. Later esploratori, such as the Leone class, carried extremely heavy armament for their modest size, capable of outgunning any destroyer of the early 1920s. However, by 1938 the surviving esploratori were re-rated as destroyers.

It is the sequel to Pac-Man (1980), and the first entry in the series to not be made by Namco. Controlling the titular character, the player is tasked with eating all of the pellets in an enclosed maze while avoiding four colored ghosts. Eating large flashing ‚ÄúPower Pellets‚Äù will cause the ghosts to turn blue and flee, which can be consumed for bonus points. General Computer originally made the game as a modification kit for the original Pac-Man, titled Crazy Otto. Following legal action with Atari, GCC was forced to present the project to Midway, the North American distributor of Pac-Man, before release, who purchased the project. Multiple names were considered for the game, including Super Pac-Man, Miss Pac-Man and Mrs. Pac- Man, before the final name was chosen for being easier to pronounce. While the game was reportedly made without Namco's blessing, Namco president Masaya Nakamura provided feedback on the player character's design, and the company collected the same royalties on each cabinet as they had with Pac-Man. Ms. Pac-Man was acclaimed by critics for its improvements to the original gameplay and female protagonist, some labeling it as superior to Pac-Man. It has been listed among the greatest video games of all time and one of the most successful American arcade games ever made. The game's success inspired several ports for home consoles and handheld systems, as well as numerous sequel and remake games, spawning a Ms. Pac-Man spin-off series. The rights to the game are owned by Namco's successor company, Bandai Namco Entertainment. Gameplay Start of the game The gameplay is very similar to that of Pac- Man. The player earns points by eating pellets and avoiding monsters (contact with one causes Ms. Pac-Man to lose a life). Eating an energizer (or \\"power pellet\\") causes the monsters to turn blue, allowing them to be eaten for extra points. Bonus fruits can be eaten for increasing point values, twice per round. As the rounds increase, the speed increases, and energizers generally lessen the duration of the monsters' vulnerability, eventually stopping altogether. Differences from the original Pac-Man * The game has four mazes that appear in different color schemes and alternate after each of the game's intermissions are seen. The pink maze appears in levels one and two; the light blue maze appears in levels three, four, and five; the brown maze appears in levels six to nine; and the dark blue maze appears in levels 10 to 14. After level 14, the maze configurations alternate every fourth level. * Three of the four mazes (the first, second, and fourth ones) have two sets of warp tunnels, as opposed to only one in the original maze. * The walls have a solid color rather than an outline, which makes it easier for a novice player to see where the paths around the mazes are. * The monsters' behavioral patterns are different, and include semi-random movement, which prevents the use of patterns to clear each round. Blinky (red) and Pinky (pink) move randomly in the first several seconds of each level, until the first reversal. Inky (cyan) and Sue (orange) still use the same movement patterns from the previous game to their respective corners, again until the first reversal. * Instead of appearing in the center of the maze, the fruits bounce randomly around the maze, entering and (if not eaten) leaving through the warp tunnels. Once all fruits have been encountered, they appear in random sequence for the rest of the game, starting on the eighth round; a 5000-point banana can be followed by a 100-point pair of cherries. * The orange monster is called Sue, rather than Clyde; her color was later changed to purple in Pac-Land to differentiate her. * When Ms. Pac-Man makes contact with a monster and dies, she spins around, or as the back of the flier says, \\"she dramatically swoons and falls\\" rather than folding in on herself like the original Pac-Man did. * The three intermissions follow the developing relationship between the original Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man (from when they first meet to having a stork drop off their baby). The latter later served as the basis for the attract opening sequence in Jr. Pac-Man. * The sound effects and music are all new. Development Ms. Pac-Man was originally conceived as an enhancement kit for Pac-Man called Crazy Otto, created by programmers employed at the General Computer Corporation (GCC).Ms. Pac-Man Videogame by Midway (1981) - The International Arcade Museum and the KLOV While Crazy Otto was under development, GCC settled a lawsuit with Atari over their Missile Command conversion kit Super Missile Attack. Part of the settlement terms barred GCC from selling future conversion kits without consent from the original game manufacturer.Game Developers' Conference Post-Mortem by original developer Steve Golson Rather than scrapping Crazy Otto entirely, the programmers chose to present the completed game to Midway, Namco's American distributor of Pac- Man. Midway had become impatient in waiting for Namco to release its next Pac- Man game (which would be Super Pac-Man), and were enthusiastic that such a game had come to their attention. They bought the rights to Crazy Otto and worked with GCC and Namco to prepare the game for release. In final development, the game's name and characters experienced multiple changes. Sprites, text, and minor game elements were altered to better reflect the Pac- Man series. The game was initially titled Super Pac-Man, containing Pac-Man as the lead character. Inspired by the cutscenes of Crazy Otto featuring Crazy Otto's female counterpart, the lead character was made female and the game was renamed Pac-Woman. That name was dropped in favor of Miss Pac-Man, but the developers then realized that, given the third intermission showing a stork delivering a baby to Pac-Man and the player's character, confusion could arise about their relationship. In light of this, the name was changed to Mrs. Pac- Man, and then finally to Ms. Pac-Man, which rolled off the tongue easier. Programmer Steve Golson said \\"in the span of just two weeks, it went from Crazy Otto to Super Pac-Man to Miss Pac-Man. These later changes (Miss, Mrs., and Ms.) all occurred within 72 hours of actual production.The Ultimate History of Video Games by Steven L. Kent, pp. 171-172 Release According to one 1982 estimate, a majority of Pac-Man players were women. Shortly before release, Stan Jarocki of Midway stated that Ms. Pac-Man was conceived in response to the original Pac-Man being \\"the first commercial videogame to involve large numbers of women as players\\" and that it is \\"our way of thanking all those lady arcaders who have played and enjoyed Pac-Man.\\" The game was later awarded the Certificate of Merit as runner-up for Coin-Op Game of the Year at the 1982 Arcade Awards held in January 1983. After the game became wildly popular, Midway and GCC undertook a brief legal battle concerning royalties. The Killer List of Videogames notes that the game was produced without Namco's consent, causing both companies to eventually turn over the rights to Namco. Ms. Pac-Man was reportedly the first in a series of unauthorized sequels that eventually led to the termination of the licensing agreement between Namco and Midway.Ms. Pac-Man Videogame by Midway (1981) - The International Arcade Museum and the KLOV However, GCC co-founder Doug Macrae has disputed these reports, noting that Masaya Nakamura, Namco's president at the time, gave him direct feedback on the Ms. Pac-Man character.Doug Macrae from GCC speaks at California Extreme 2010 In an interview, Macrae said, \\"We sent out ROMs to Midway, and they sent them over to Japan for the President of Namco, Masaya Nakamura, to look at. He said, 'Love the concept, get rid of the hair.'\\" He added, \\"There was a little bit of embarrassment [at Namco] of the fact that the sequel was being done somewhere other than in their own laboratories. ... The arrangement that Namco had with Midway was that Namco would still get their royalty on Ms. Pac-Man ... and Midway could choose to do whatever they wanted in paying us a royalty in addition to Namco.\\" Atari, Inc. released versions for the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Atari 7800, and Atari 8-bit family. There were also versions for the VIC-20, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, IBM PC, Apple II, and Texas Instruments TI-99/4A released under the Atarisoft label. Unlike Pac-Man, most home versions of Ms. Pac-Man include all four intermission screens from the arcade game. The Atari 2600 rendition of Pac-Man was infamous for its flashing ghosts, while the 2600 port of Ms. Pac-Man had minimal flicker. A tabletop version of Ms. Pac-Man was released in 1983 by Coleco. The unit was shaped like a miniature arcade cabinet, was controlled with a small built-in joystick, and used a multicolor vacuum fluorescent display.Coleco Ms. Pac-Man It was a runner-up for Stand-Alone Game of the Year at the 1983 Arcade Awards held in January 1984. In 1991, Atari Corporation released a version for the Lynx, introducing new mazes, a fourth intermission, and a power-up that gives the player a temporary speed boost. Tengen would release an unlicensed port of the game in 1988 for the Nintendo Entertainment System. In 1993, Namco released their original port of Ms. Pac-Man in North America themselves, eight years after its original release in Japan.http://nintendoage.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=31&threadid;=59105 The Genesis, Master System, and NES versions, by Tengen, and the Super NES version, by Williams Electronics, took a few liberties. They featured four different sets of mazes: the original arcade mazes, bigger mazes, smaller mazes, and \\"strange\\" mazes. There was also a Pac-Booster option that let players make Ms. Pac-Man move much faster which was only available in the original arcade game from a maintenance menu. These versions also allowed two people to play simultaneously, with player 2 as Pac-Man. The game ends at level 32, with an intermission where Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man say good-bye. It was released for the Game Boy Color with two new mazes and a bonus game (Super Pac-Man). In 2001, Namco released an arcade board featuring both Ms. Pac-Man and Galaga in honor of the 20th anniversary of both games with the subtitle \\"20 Year Reunion / Class of 1981\\". It also features Pac-Man as a hidden bonus game. The later 25th Anniversary Edition allows all three games to be selected at the main menu. Ms. Pac-Man is included in the CD-i Arcade Classics collection (released in Europe, but not in North America). It has all of the extra features of Tengen's ports, even though neither Tengen nor Williams Electronics made this version. It is included in Namco's, Microsoft's and Atari's late 1990s series of classic game anthologies, and is an unlockable minigame in the SNES version of Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures and in Pac-Man World 2. A standalone, battery-powered version of the game released by Jakks Pacific can be plugged directly into a television. Ms. Pac-Man and four other games (Galaga, Mappy, Xevious and Pole Position) are included in a self- contained joystick hand controller.Welcome to JAKKS TV Games >> Ms. Pac-Man Ms. Pac-Man was also a free game bundled with every Xbox Live Arcade disc for the original Xbox. The Xbox 360 XBLA version was released on January 9, 2007, featuring an online leaderboard and twelve achievements.Ms. Pac-Man Game Detail Page, xbox.com Ms. Pac-Man was later released on Namco Museum Volume 3; however, there is no mention of it in Namco's official archives (including the archives on all Namco Museum releases). As of July 11, 2008, Ms. Pac Man is available for Apple's iPhone through the App Store.Ms. PAC-MAN now available for your iPod The game was also released in July for Windows Mobile. As part of Pac-Man's 30th anniversary, Ms. Pac-Man is one of the games included on the home version of Pac-Man's Arcade Party arcade machine. Pac- Man's Arcade Party was succeeded eight years later by Pac-Man's Pixel Bash, which added 19 games to the existing roster, but Ms. Pac-Man was only available if the machine was set to Free Play. It was included as downloadable content in Pac-Man Museum for PlayStation 3, Windows and Xbox 360. In June 2020, Tastemakers' Arcade1Up decided to announce that Ms. Pac-Man would finally be added to their lineup of 3/4 scale arcade cabinets. The unit will also contain a few other Bandai Namco arcade games, including Galaxian, Pac- Mania, and Pac-Man Plus. Reception In January 1984, the Atari 2600 port of Ms. Pac-Man won the Videogame of the Year award at the 1983 Arcade Awards, tied with Lady Bug. InfoWorld stated that Atarisoft's Ms. Pac-Man for the Commodore 64 was as good as the best-selling Atari 8-bit version. The Genesis version of the game sold more than one million copies in the United States. Reviewing the Super NES version, three of Electronic Gaming Monthlys four reviewers said the gameplay is timeless and universally appealing, and the enhancements appealing. The fourth, Sushi-X, felt the original game was a cheap cash-in on the popularity of Pac-Man, and had not aged well. Doctor Devon of GamePro liked the original game but questioned the value of the Super NES port since it has somewhat frustrating controls, and since Ms. Pac-Man had already appeared on the Super NES in the form of an unlockable in Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures. In STart, Clayton Walnum praised the Lynx version's new mazes and the added twist of the lightning power-ups, and found the game transferred well to the small screen. Julian Rignall reviewed the Atari Lynx port for CVG Magazine writing that \\"it offers a fun and non-violent challenge which will appeal to anyone\\" giving a final score of 79 out of 100. Les Ellis reviewed the game for Raze Magazine in February 1991, he liked the \\"neat little between-level scenes\\" and the \\"jolly title tune\\" giving a final score of 79%. Robert A. Jung also reviewed the Lynx version which was published to IGN. He wrote in his final verdict, \\"A decent adaptation overall, and a good game in its own right.\\" Giving a final score of 8 out of 10. Reviewing the Game Gear version, GamePro commented \\"If you loved the Pac-Man games, then you loved Ms. Pac-Man, and if you loved Ms. Pac-Man at the arcades, you'll love her here, too.\\" Legacy In 1996 Electronic Gaming Monthly reported that the Genesis version of Ms. Pac-Man, which was released in 1991, was still among the top 20 best-selling Genesis games. The same year, Next Generation ranked the arcade version as number 12 on their \\"Top 100 Games of All Time\\", saying that it has aged far better than the original Pac-Man due to its smarter monster AI, varied mazes, moving fruits, and intermissions. They added, \\"It has the broadest appeal of any game Next Generation has seen, with the possible exception of Tetris. Women love it. Men Love it. Children love it.\\" In 1997 Electronic Gaming Monthly listed the Genesis and Super NES versions as number 89 on their \\"100 Best Games of All Time\\", stating that the \\"Two-player simultaneous play and new mazes completely revive this classic.\\" Note: Contrary to the title, the intro to the article explicitly states that the list covers console video games only, meaning PC games and arcade games were not eligible. In 1999, Next Generation listed Ms. Pac-Man as number 41 on their \\"Top 50 Games of All Time\\", commenting that, \\"It sounds easier than it is, and it makes the game one we consistently go back to, week after week.\\" In 2009, Game Informer put Ms. Pac-Man 10th on their list of \\"The Top 200 Games of All Time\\", saying that it \\"trumped [the original Pac-Man] in nearly every way\\". This is down one rank from Game Informers previous best games of all- time list. Entertainment Weekly called Ms. Pac-Man one of the top ten games for the Atari 2600 in 2013. In 2016, Ms. Pac-Man placed 5th on Time's The 50 Best Video Games of All Time list. Intellectual rights The GCC group had sold the rights to Ms. Pac-Man to Midway in 1982, as at the time, they held the intellectual property license for Pac-Man from Namco. In the years since, the Ms. Pac-Man license fell back to Namco (now Bandai Namco) after Namco terminated the licensing deal with Midway in 1984. Around 2019, AtGames, a company that specializes in microconsoles featuring older arcade games, had approached the GCC group members about licensing Ms. Pac-Man. AtGames had learned that while some of the ongoing royalties for the Ms. Pac-Man were being met by Bandai Namco, they were not meeting all the terms. Bandai Namco, on learning that AtGames has been seeking these rights for a possible mini- arcade game, filed a lawsuit against AtGames, declaring that AtGames was violating Bandai Namco's control of the license.

A dogfight, or dog fight, is an aerial battle between fighter aircraft conducted at close range. Dogfighting first occurred in Mexico in 1913, shortly after the invention of the airplane. Until at least 1992, it was a component in every major war, despite beliefs after World War II that increasingly greater speeds and longer-range weapons would make dogfighting obsolete.Storm Over Iraq: Air Power and the Gulf War By Richard P. Hallion ‚Äì Smithsonian Institution Press 1992 ‚Äì Page 1-10https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/f-22-and-f-35-will-be-obsolete- what-will-sixth-generation-fighter-look-38412 Modern terminology for air-to- air combat is air combat maneuvering (ACM), which refers to tactical situations requiring the use of individual basic fighter maneuvers (BFM) to attack or evade one or more opponents. This differs from aerial warfare, which deals with the strategy involved in planning and executing various missions.Fighter Combat: Tactics and Maneuvering by Robert Shaw - Pages xi and xii Etymology The term dogfight has been used for centuries to describe a melee: a fierce, fast-paced close quarters battle between two or more opponents. The term gained popularity during World War II, although its origin in air combat can be traced to the latter years of World War I. The first written reference to the modern-day usage of the word appears to be in an account of the death of Baron von Richthofen in The Graphic in May 1918: 'The Baron joined the m√™l√©e, which, scattering into groups, developed into what our men call \\"a dog fight.\\"'. History=Mexican Revolution The first instance of plane on plane combat and the first instance of one plane intercepting another during an aerial conflict occurred during the Mexican Revolution in November 30, 1913, between two American soldiers of fortune fighting for opposing sides, Dean Ivan Lamb and Phil Rader. Both men had orders to kill, but neither pilot wanted to harm the other, so they exchanged multiple volleys of pistol fire, intentionally missing before exhausting their supply of ammunition. World War I An Incident on the Western Front, view of a dogfight involving five aircraft. In the upper foreground a biplane of the Royal Flying Corps flies towards a stricken German biplane, which is falling towards the ground leaving a trail of smoke in its wake (Imperial War Museum). Dogfighting became widespread in World War I. Aircraft were initially used as mobile observation vehicles, and early pilots gave little thought to aerial combat. The new airplanes proved their worth by spotting the hidden German advance on Paris in the second month of the war. Enemy pilots at first simply exchanged waves, or shook their fists at each other. Due to weight restrictions, only small weapons could be carried on board. Intrepid pilots decided to interfere with enemy reconnaissance by improvised means, including throwing bricks, grenades and sometimes rope, which they hoped would entangle the enemy plane's propeller. Pilots quickly began firing hand-held guns at enemy planes, such as pistols and carbines. The first aerial dogfight of the war occurred during the Battle of Cer (August 15‚Äì24, 1914), when Serbian aviator Miodrag Tomiƒá encountered an Austro-Hungarian plane while performing a reconnaissance mission over Austro-Hungarian positions. The Austro-Hungarian pilot initially waved, and Tomiƒá reciprocated. The Austro- Hungarian pilot then fired at Tomiƒá with his revolver. Tomiƒá managed to escape, and within several weeks, all Serbian and Austro-Hungarian planes were fitted with machine-guns. In August 1914, Staff-Captain Pyotr Nesterov, from Russia, became the first pilot to ram his plane into an enemy spotter aircraft. In October 1914, an airplane was shot down by a handgun from another plane for the first time over Reims, France. Once machine guns were mounted to the airplane, either on a flexible mounting or higher on the wings of early biplanes, the era of air combat began. The biggest problem was mounting a machine gun onto an aircraft so that it could be fired forward, through the propeller, and aimed by pointing the nose of the aircraft directly at the enemy. French aviator Roland Garros solved this problem by mounting steel deflector wedges to the propeller of a Morane Saulnier monoplane. He achieved three kills, but was forced down due to engine failure down behind enemy lines, and captured before he could destroy his plane by burning it. The wreckage was brought to Anthony Fokker, a Dutch designer who built aircraft for the Germans. Fokker decided that the wedges were much too risky, and improved the design by connecting the trigger of an MG 08 Maxim machine gun to the timing of the engine. The Germans acquired an early air superiority due to the invention of the synchronization gear in 1915, transforming air combat with the Fokker E.I, the first synchronized, forward-firing fighter plane. On the evening of July 1, 1915, the very first aerial engagement by a fighter plane armed with a synchronized, forward-firing machine gun occurred just to the east of Luneville, France. The German Fokker E.I was flown by Lieutenant Kurt Wintgens, earning the victory over a French two-seat observation monoplane. Later that same month, on July 25, 1915, British Royal Flying Corps (RFC) Major Lanoe Hawker, flying a very early production Bristol Scout C., attacked three separate aircraft during a single sortie, shooting down two with a non-synchronizable Lewis gun which was mounted next to his cockpit at an outwards angle to avoid hitting the propeller. He forced the third one down, and was awarded the Victoria Cross. Battles in the air increased as the technological advantage swung from the British to the Germans, then back again. The Feldflieger Abteilung observation units of the German air service, in 1914‚Äì15, consisted of six two-seat observation aircraft each, with each unit assigned to a particular German Army headquarters location. They had but a single Fokker Eindecker aircraft assigned to each \\"FFA\\" unit for general defensive duties, so pilots such as Max Immelmann and Oswald Boelcke began as lone hunters with each \\"FFA\\" unit, shooting unarmed spotter planes and enemy aircraft out of the sky. During the first part of the war, there was no established tactical doctrine for air-to-air combat. Oswald Boelcke was the first to analyze the tactics of aerial warfare, resulting in a set of rules known as the Dicta Boelcke. Many of Boelcke's concepts, conceived in 1916, are still applicable today, including use of sun and altitude, surprise attack, and turning to meet a threat. British Brigadier General Hugh Trenchard ordered that all reconnaissance aircraft had to be supported by at least three fighters, creating the first use of tactical formations in the air. The Germans responded by forming Jastas, large squadrons of fighters solely dedicated to destroying enemy aircraft, under the supervision of Boelcke. Pilots who shot down five or more fighters became known as aces. One of the most famous dogfights, resulting in the death of Major Hawker, is described by the Red Baron, Manfred von Richthofen, > I WAS extremely proud when, one fine day, I was informed that the airman > whom I had brought down on the twenty- third of November, 1916, was the > English [equivalent of] Immelmann.... First we circled twenty times to the > left, and then thirty times to the right. Each tried to get behind and above > the other. Soon I discovered that I was not meeting a beginner. He had not > the slightest intention of breaking off the fight. He was traveling in a > machine which turned beautifully. However, my own was better at rising than > his, and I succeeded at last in getting above and beyond my English waltzing > partner.... The impertinent fellow was full of cheek and when we had got > down to about 3,000 feet he merrily waved to me as if he would say, \\"Well, > how do you do?\\" The circles which we made around one another were so narrow > that their diameter was probably no more than 250 or 300 feet. I had time to > take a good look at my opponent.... When he had come down to about three > hundred feet he tried to escape by flying in a zig-zag course during which, > as is well known, it is difficult for an observer to shoot. That was my most > favorable moment. I followed him at an altitude of from two hundred and > fifty feet to one hundred and fifty feet, firing all the time. The > Englishman could not help falling. But the jamming of my gun nearly robbed > me of my success. My opponent fell, shot through the head, one hundred and > fifty feet behind our line. Despite the German's early lead in combat tactics and their 'Dicta Boelcke', the Allies were not slow to adapt and develop their own tactics. The Royal Flying Corps' Albert Ball was one of a band of pilots who liked to fly solo and he developed 'stalking' tactics for going after enemy two-seaters. He even used his Lewis gun in its top wing adjustable Foster mounting to fire upwards into the underside of unsuspecting enemy aircraft. Other RFC pilots such as James McCudden and Mick Mannock emphasised mutual support and the advantages of attacking from height. Mannock expressed this in a list of aerial combat rules that were similar to Boelcke's. Memorial erected by German airmen at Sheria, in memory of British and Australian airmen, killed in their lines during 1917 During 1916, aerial reconnaissance patrols had most often been unaccompanied as there had been little if any aerial disputes, between the belligerents. However, just as the Sinai and Palestine Campaign ground war on the Gaza to Beersheba line came to resemble trench warfare on the western front, so too did the air war over southern Palestine come to resemble that being fought over France.Cutlack 1941 p. 65 After the Second Battle of Gaza in April 1917 and during the Stalemate in Southern Palestine which followed, the concentration of Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) and Ottoman Army forces holding established front lines grew, as associated supply dumps and lines of communications were developed. The need to know about these fuelled \\"intense rivalry in the air.\\"Cutlack 1941 pp. 64‚Äì5 Aerial reconnaissance patrols were regularly attacked, so it was necessary for all photography and artillery observation patrols to be accompanied by escort aircraft.Cutlack 1941 p. 71 These special EEF patrols which grew into squadrons, accompanied and protected the reconnaissance aircraft, attacking hostile aircraft wherever they were found, either in the air, or on the ground. However the technically superior German aircraft shot down numbers of EEF aircraft during dog fights. By the end of the war, the underpowered machines from just ten years prior had been transformed into fairly powerful, swift, and heavily armed fighter planes, and the basic tactics for dogfighting had been laid down. Spanish Civil War Airplane technology rapidly increased in sophistication after World War I. By 1936, dogfighting was thought to be a thing of the past, since aircraft were reaching top speeds of over 250 miles per hour (400 km/h).Storm Over Iraq: Air Power and the Gulf War By Richard P. Hallion ‚Äì Smithsonian Institution Press 1992 ‚Äì Page 8 The experiences of the Spanish civil war proved this theory was wrong. At the beginning of the war, new tactics were developed, most notably in the Luftwaffe Condor Legion. Lieutenant Werner M√∂lders advised abandoning the standard ‚ÄúV‚Äù formation used in combat, and pairing fighters in twos, starting the practice of having a wingman at one's side. He advised that pairs of aircraft approaching a fight should increase the distance between them instead of holding tight formations, a precursor to the combat spread maneuver. He also started the practice of training pilots to fly at night, and with instruments only. Using the new tactics, and flying the newest Bf 109 fighters, the Germans shot down 22 Spanish Republican fighters within a five- day period, suffering no losses of their own.Air Power by Stephen Budiansky ‚Äì Viking Penguin Books 2004 ‚Äì Page 213-214 World War IIStrategies for fighter development= Fighter contrails overhead during the Battle of the Philippine Sea During the 1930s two different schools of thought about air-to- air combat began to emerge, resulting in two different trends of monoplane fighter development. In Japan and Italy especially, there continued to be a strong belief that lightly armed, highly maneuverable single seat fighters would still play a primary role in air-to-air combat. Aircraft such as the Nakajima Ki-27 and Nakajima Ki-43 and the Mitsubishi A6M Zero in Japan, and the Fiat G.50 and Macchi C.200 in Italy epitomised a generation of monoplanes designed to this concept. The other stream of thought, which emerged primarily in Britain, Germany, the Soviet Union, and the United States was the belief the high speeds of modern combat aircraft and the g-forces imposed by aerial combat meant that dogfighting in the classic WWI sense would be impossible. Fighters such as the Messerschmitt Bf 109, the Supermarine Spitfire, the Yakovlev Yak-1 and the Curtiss P-40 were all designed for high speeds and a good rate of climb. Good maneuverability was not a primary objective. Immediately following the Spanish Civil War came World War II, during which dogfighting was most prevalent. It was widely believed that strategic bombing alone was synonymous with air power; a fallacy that would not be fully understood until Vietnam.Storm Over Iraq: Air Power and the Gulf War By Richard P. Hallion ‚Äì Smithsonian Institution Press 1992 - Pages 12-17 After the failings in Spain, a greater emphasis was placed on the accuracy of air- to-ground attacks. The need to stop bombers from reaching their targets, or to protect them on their missions, was the primary purpose for most dogfights of the era.Storm Over Iraq: Air Power and the Gulf War By Richard P. Hallion ‚Äì Smithsonian Institution Press 1992 ‚Äì Page 8-13 =Dogfighting over Europe= Dogfighting was very prominent in the skies over Europe. The air force in France, while a major force during World War I, was inadequate and poorly organized, and quickly fell to the German onslaught. As the first battles between the Germans and the British began, the power of the German's anti- aircraft artillery became readily apparent, with 88 millimeter shells capable of firing in the air. General Wolfram von Richthofen noted that these guns were equally destructive when used for ground fire. Adolph Malan compiled a list of aerial combat rules that were widely taught to RAF pilots. The German Bf 109 and the British Spitfire were some of the most common fighters used in the European theater.Air Power by Stephen Budiansky ‚Äì Viking Penguin Books 2004 ‚Äì Page 219-235 A typical dogfight is described by an unnamed pilot, > Pulling up into his blind spot I watched his plane grow larger and larger in > my sight. But this German pilot was not content to fly straight and level. > Before I could open fire his plane slewed to the right, and seeing me on his > tail, he jerked back on the stick into the only defensive maneuver his plane > could make. I banked my 47 over to the right and pulled back on the stick, > striving to get him once more into my ring sight. The violent maneuver > applied terrific G‚Äôs to my body, and I started to black out as the blood > rushed from my head. Fighting every second to overcome this blackness about > me, I pulled back on the stick, further and further, so that the enemy would > just show at the bottom of my ring sight to allow for the correct > deflection. We were both flying in a tight circle. Just a little more and > I‚Äôll have him. Pressing the [trigger] I waited expectantly for the 109 to > explode. I‚Äôve hit his wing.

The 109, > sensing that I was inside him on the turn, slunk into a nearby cloud. > Straightening my plane, I climbed over the top of the bank, and poised on > the other side, waiting for him to appear. But the 109 did not appear, and > not wishing to tempt the gods of fate further, I pushed my stick forward, > entered the protective cover of the clouds, and headed home.Fighter Combat: > Tactics and Maneuvering by Robert Shaw - Pages 19-20 =Soviet fighters= During this time, three new Russian fighters, the LaGG-1, the Yak-1, and the MiG-3 were just coming off of the production line. The Soviet Air Defense Force had been fraught with problems since World War I.Aircraft, Strategy and Operations of the Soviet Air Force by Air Vice Marshal R. A. Mason and John W. R. Taylor - Jane's Publishing Co Ltd. - Page 26 The German Barbarossa offensive on June 22, 1941, destroyed more than 2000 Soviet aircraft on the first day, and more than 5000 before October. With great desperation, the Soviets fought in dogfights over Leningrad, Moscow, and the Ukraine for more than a year. Fireteam, a triple of aircraft (\\"troika\\"), has been the main tactical unit used in battles since the beginning of World War II. The analysis and synthesis of fighting experience resulted in a conclusion that group tactics should have been rejected and replaced by action pairs. However, ramming an opponent was still a common practice among the pilots of the Soviet Union. Another successful maneuver was a \\"Sokolinnyi udar\\" (falcon punch) when a pilot obtained a speed advantage by swooping down on an opponent, characteristically from the direction of the sun in order to hide their fighter within the glare of the brilliant light before and during the attack. This maneuver and many other tactical principles were introduced by Alexander Pokryshkin, one of the greatest tacticians of the Soviet Air Force who showed his worth during World War II. His famous motto sounded as \\"Height, speed, maneuver, fire!\\". It became popular in the air armies and was adopted by pilots. Struggling with morale problems, the Soviets slowly and methodically began to regain air supremacy after the Battle of Stalingrad in 1943.Aircraft, Strategy and Operations of the Soviet Air Force by Air Vice Marshal R. A. Mason and John W. R. Taylor - Jane's Publishing Co Ltd. - Page 28 This theater is notable for including the only female fighter aces in history, Yekaterina Budanova and Lydia Litvyak. =United States and Japan= Mitsubishi A6M3 Zero chases a North American B-25 Mitchell during simulated combat. After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, in the Hawaiian Islands, the United States entered the war. The Japanese used the Mitsubishi A6M Zero, an extremely lightweight fighter known for its exceptional range and maneuverability. The U.S. military tested out the Akutan Zero, a Mitsubishi A6M2 which was captured intact in 1942, advising‚Äîalong the same lines that General Claire Chennault, commander of the Kunming-based Flying Tigers had already advised his pilots over a year before‚Äî\\"Never attempt to dogfight a Zero.\\"Fighter: The World's Greatest Aces and Their Planes by Edwards Park - Thomasson-Grant Inc. 1990 - Page 144 Even though its engine was rather low in power, the Zero had very low wing loading characteristics, a small turn radius, a top speed over , and could climb better than any fighter used by the U.S. at that time, although it was poorly armored compared to U.S. aircraft. A pilot who realized that new tactics had to be devised was Lieutenant Commander John S. \\"Jimmy\\" Thach, commander of Fighting Three in San Diego. He read the early reports coming out of China and wrestled with the problem of his Grumman F4F Wildcats being relatively slower and much less maneuverable than the Japanese planes. Using matchsticks on his kitchen table, he devised a defensive maneuver he called \\"beam defense position\\", but commonly called the \\"Thach Weave.\\" Thach reasoned that, because the Zero had fabric wing-covers that tended to \\"balloon\\" at speeds above 295 mph, which made the plane very hard to turn, he could use high speed and a formation of four planes, consisting of two pairs of aircraft, flying line-abreast (side by side at the same altitude). Keeping the leader of each pair in close formation with their wingman, the pairs could fly about apart (the turn radius of the Wildcat) and adopt a weaving formation when either or both pairs fell under attack by Japanese fighters, allowing each pair to evade the attack while at the same time covering the other pair. Thach made a diagram of the idea and showed it to other pilots, but in trial-runs people like Butch O'Hare found it difficult to make the shot while, at the same time, evading the two friendly planes coming at him head on.Thach Weave by Steve Ewing -- Naval Institute Press 2004 Page 26 Thach later faced the A6M Zero during the Battle of Midway, in June 1942, for the test of his theory. Although outnumbered, he found that a Zero would lock onto the tail of one of the fighters. In response, the two planes would turn toward each other, with one plane's path crossing in front of the other. More importantly, the pursuer would have to follow that path to maintain pursuit, also crossing in front of the American plane's sights. Thus, when the Zero followed its original target through the turn it would come into a position to be fired on by the target's wingman, and the predator would become the prey. His tactic proved to be effective and was soon adopted by other squadrons. The Thach Weave helped make up for the inferiority of the US planes in maneuverability and numbers, until new aircraft could be brought into service. This tactic later morphed into the more fluid and versatile \\"loose-deuce maneuvering\\" that was to prove useful in the Vietnam war. Another effective maneuver used by the U.S. pilots was a simple break, which consisted of turning sharply across an attacker's flight path, which worked well in part because the large nose of the Zero tended to obstruct the pilot's view. Still another good tactic was a high-side guns pass, which consisted of diving upon the Zero, shooting in one high-speed pass, and using the speed to climb back above the fight to dive again.Fighter: The World's Greatest Aces and Their Planes by Edwards Park - Thomasson-Grant Inc. 1990 - Page 136 By 1943 the U.S. began to produce planes that were better matched against the Japanese planes, such as the Grumman F6F Hellcat, and the Vought F4U Corsair.Air Power by Stephen Budiansky ‚Äì Viking Penguin Books 2004 ‚Äì Page 275 =Technology= Technology advanced extremely fast during World War II in ways that would change dogfighting forever. Jet propulsion had been demonstrated long before the war, by German engineer Hans von Ohain in 1934, and by British engineer Frank Whittle in 1937. The Messerschmitt Me 262 was the first jet fighter to be used in battle, with a speed over , and began taking a toll on Allied bombing missions in 1944. The British were testing a jet that same year, the Gloster Meteor, which would later see action in the Korean War. Although U.S. General Hap Arnold test flew the XP-59A in 1942, the plane was never used in combat. Other prime inventions of the era include radar and air-to-air missiles.Fighter: The World's Greatest Aces and Their Planes by Edwards Park - Thomasson-Grant Inc. 1990 - Page 155-160 =Propaganda= Enemy pilots were construed as weak and evil. For example, in World War II, describing the Soviet tactics, the Luftwaffe claimed that, \\"The characteristic feature of the average Soviet fighter pilot were a tendency toward caution and reluctance instead of toughness and stamina, brute strength instead of genuine combat efficiency, abysmal hatred instead of fairness and chivalry....\\" Korean War Gun camera photo of a MiG-15 being attacked by U.S. Air Force F-86 Sabre over Korea in either 1952 or 1953. The Sabre is piloted by Capt. Manuel \\"Pete\\" Fernandez of the 334th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, 4th Fighter- Interceptor Wing. After World War II, the question began to rise about the future usefulness of fighter aircraft. This was especially true for the U.S., where the focus was placed on small, fast, long-range bombers capable of delivering atomic bombs.Storm Over Iraq: Air Power and the Gulf War By Richard P. Hallion ‚Äì Smithsonian Institution Press 1992 - Page 13-15 The Korean War began in June 1950, and the North Koreans were outmatched by the U.S. Air Force. The war was nearly over by October, with the occupation of North Korea when, on November 1, Chinese MiG-15s attacked. The Chinese began supplying North Korea with troops and provisions, and the war quickly resumed. At faster, the MiG-15 was more than a match for the U.S. P-80 Shooting Star, using the same dive and shoot tactic that the Americans found so useful against Japan. The U.S. jets had inferior weaponry, and suffered from problems with production and parts. The U.S. resorted to using mainly the more maneuverable propeller driven fighters during the war, such as the P-51 Mustang which was carried over from World War II.History of the U.S. Air Force by Bill Yenne - Bison Book Corp 1984 - Page 46-51 To combat the MiGs, the F-86 Sabre was put into production. The U.S. pilots had a number of major advantages over the Chinese, including the G-suit. Chinese fighters were often seen spinning off out of control during a hard turn because the pilot had lost consciousness. Other technological advantages included the radar-ranging gunsight and hydraulic controls. Colonel Harrison R. Thyng remarked: > Suddenly you go into a steep turn. Your mach drops off. The MiG turns with > you, and you let him gradually creep up and outturn you. At the critical > moment you reverse your turn. The hydraulic controls [of the F-86] work > beautifully.

Later after the fall of the Soviet Union, Soviet records showed that Russian pilots were indeed in the air. Some at times in the fury of combat reverted to the Russian language over the radio. Vietnam War The Vietnam War \\"was the first 'modern' air war\\"Michel III p. 2 in which air-to-air missiles were the primary weapons during aerial combat, and was the only confrontation between the latest aerial and ground defense technologies between the Soviet Union and the United States.Michel III p. 2, 3 If U.S. air power could successfully conduct war against Soviet doctrine and equipment in the skies over North Vietnam, then it could expect to successfully operate against the Soviet Union during a massive war in Europe. Over the skies of North Vietnam, U.S. aircraft would be attacking the \\"most formidable and most heavily defended targets in the history of aerial warfare.\\"McCarthy p. 22, 145 By this time, dogfighting techniques had fallen out of favor in U.S. training doctrines, as missiles were considered to be all that was necessary to shoot down the big bombers expected to be deployed by the Soviet Union. As a result, air combat methods known by fighter pilots since World War I became all but lost as veterans from WWII and Korea retired and didn't pass them on to succeeding generations. American fighter pilots would meet in the skies in secret to engage in mock combat to try and maintain some level of proficiency. It wasn't until TOPGUN was established for the Navy in 1969 and Red Flag was started for the Air Force in 1975 that pilots were formally trained in dogfighting again. Both U.S. and Soviet-built jet \\"fighters\\" were primarily designed as interceptors: intercepting bomber groups, and then shooting them down with air-to-air missiles. Neither party had a separate designation for interceptor, though: just F- for fighter, A- for attack, and B- for bomber. (For the NATO aircraft) With possibly a few exceptions, such as the F-8 Crusader and the F-100 Super Sabre, which each mounted four 20 mm cannons, jets were not designed for dog fighting other jet aircraft.Michel III p. 16, 79, 157 Soviet doctrine called for their interceptors to be strictly vectored towards their targets by Ground Control Intercept (GCI) operators. As a consequence, U.S. RF-101 Voodoo aircraft conducting reconnaissance missions, or F-102 Delta Daggers, F-104 Starfighters performing MiGCAP duties, and the strike aircraft themselves, such as F-105 Thunderchiefs, A-4 Skyhawks, A-6 Intruders, F-4 Phantoms, and B-52's flying over North Vietnam were met by MiG-17s (or Chicom J-5s), MiG-19s (Chicom J-6s), and MiG-21s being vectored directly to them by GCI operators who worked in conjunction with surface-to-air missile (SAM) crews. U.S. aircraft which successfully made it through the NVAF MiGs were then confronted with the SAMs and AAA batteries. This triad defense system of GCI-controlled MiGs, Missiles (SAMs), and AAA enabled the North Vietnamese MiGs to utilize their aircraft's design capabilities as their designers had intended,Michel III p. 81 that of, in the vernacular of the time, making \\"one pass, and then hauling ass\\",Michel III p. 130, 236 which was, in practice, quickly firing at their targets and then speeding away. By 1967 the Soviets had supplied the NVAF with enough missile-firing MiG-21s to allow the North Vietnamese to routinely engage U.S. aircraft, and to rely less and less on their aged MiG-17s, although many North Vietnamese pilots still preferred the MiG-17s agility and easy maintenance. With the arrival of the additional MiG-21s, and by 1969 MiG-19s (J-6s) imported from China, engagements between U.S. and NVAF jets became generally divided into two arenas; MiG-21s engaged at higher altitudes, while MiG-17s and MiG-19s would try to give battle at lower altitudes where their cannons were more effective.Michel III p. 59 At the conclusion of the air war in 1973, U.S. airmen had downed 202 communist MiGs, including two downed by B-52 tailgunners from their quad .50 caliber machine guns; this at a cost of 90 U.S. aircraft to NVAF MiGs.McCarthy p. 5Hobson p. 246 The USAF claimed 137 MiGs while the USN/USMC brought down 65 in air-to-air combat. From these figures, the USAF had 40 gun kills, and the USN claimed eight cannon victories. This number approached parity with the NVAF MiG's 37 gun kill figures.Hobson p. 271Michel III p. 288 Approximately 612 radar-guided AIM-7 Sparrow missiles were fired during the war, scoring 56 MiG kills, while 454 heat-seeking AIM-9 Sidewinders were launched achieving 81 aerial victories. During Operation Rolling Thunder 54 AIM-4 Falcon missiles were fired, obtaining five kills.Michel III p. 156, 286, 287 By contrast, NVAF MiG-21s obtained 53 air-to-air kills with their AA-2 \\"Atoll\\" missiles, from an unknown number of launchings. At least three MiG-21s, and all of the MiG-17s and MiG-19s (J-6s) made the remaining 37 kills, from their 90 total, with their 23 mm, 30 mm and 37 mm cannons.Hobson 271Michel III p. 159 As part of the North Vietnamese triad system of defense, surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) had become an ever-increasing threat. U.S Air Force Brigadier General Robin Olds describes a typical encounter with surface-to-air missiles, which during a period of time in Vietnam was referred to as either a \\"MiG day\\" or a \\"Sam day\\", this was a Sam day.Michel III p. 91 > Here come the SAMs. The trick is seeing the launch. You can see the steam. > It goes straight up, turns more level, then the booster drops off. If it > maintains a relatively stable position, it's coming right for you and you're > in trouble.

Those that involved dogfighting occurred between 1948 and 1985. The wars escalated on May 14, 1948, the day Israel declared its sovereignty from Britain. The War of Independence was followed by the Suez-Sinai War in 1956, the Six-Day War in 1967, the War of Attrition, the Yom Kippur War in 1973, and the First Lebanon War in 1982. The wars began with both sides using propeller planes, such as Spitfires, Avia S-199s, and P-51s, then progressed to older jets like MiG-15s, Dassault Mysteres and Dassault Mirages. In the latter wars dogfighting ensued between modern aircraft, like F-15s and F-16s against MiG-21s and MiG-25s. Although usually outnumbered, the Israelis managed to defeat the air forces of Egypt, Jordan and Syria in dogfights, often achieving kill ratios ranging from 10:1 to over 20:1, which is usually attributed to better training of the Israeli pilots and a technological advantage.The Lessons of Modern War By Anthony H.

The Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 saw the Indian and Pakistani Air Forces engaged in large-scale aerial combat against each other for the first time since the independence of Pakistan in 1947. The war took place during the course of September 1965 and saw both air forces conduct defensive and offensive operations over Indian and Pakistani airspace. The aerial war saw both sides conducting thousands of sorties in a single month.Singh, Jasjit. \\"The 1965 India-Pakistan War: IAF‚Äôs Ground Reality\\". The Sunday Tribune, 6 May 2007. Both sides claimed victory in the air war; Pakistan claimed to have destroyed 104 aircraft against its own losses of 19, while India claimed to have destroyed 73 enemy aircraft and lost 35 of its own.Van Creveld, 2012, pp. 286‚Äì287. Though the numbers honour the Pakistan Air Force as gaining the upper hand, despite the intense fighting, the conflict was effectively a stalemate.Coggins 2000, pp. 163‚Äì164. Pakistani Ace Fighter Muhammad Mehmood Alam shot down 5 Indian Vampire jets with his old F-86 Sabre Jet in less than a minute which still stands a World Record up to date.

This aircraft still stands as a \\" WAR TROPHY \\" at Pakistan Air Force Museum, Karachi. Indo- Pakistani War of 1971 By late 1971, the intensification of the independence movement in erstwhile East Pakistan led to the Bangladesh Liberation War between India and Pakistan. On November 22, 1971, 10 days before the start of a full-scale war, four PAF F-86 Sabre jets attacked Indian and Mukti Bahini positions at Garibpur, near the international border. Two of the four PAF Sabres were shot down and one damaged by the IAF's Folland Gnats. On December 3, India formally declared war against Pakistan following massive preemptive strikes by the PAF against Indian Air Force installations in Srinagar, Ambala, Sirsa, Halwara and Jodhpur. However, the IAF did not suffer significantly because the leadership had anticipated such a move and precautions were taken. The Indian Air Force was quick to respond to Pakistani air strikes, following which the PAF carried out mostly defensive sorties. Within the first two weeks, the IAF had carried out almost 12,000 sorties over East Pakistan and also provided close air support to the advancing Indian Army. IAF also assisted the Indian Navy in its operations against the Pakistani Navy and Maritime Security Agency in the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea. On the western front, the IAF destroyed more than 20 Pakistani tanks, four APCs and a supply train during the Battle of Longewala. The IAF undertook strategic bombing of West Pakistan by carrying out raids on oil installations in Karachi, the Mangla Dam and a gas plant in Sindh. Similar strategy was also deployed in East Pakistan and as the IAF achieved complete air superiority on the eastern front, the ordnance factories, runways, and other vital areas of East Pakistan were severely damaged. By the time Pakistani forces surrendered, the IAF destroyed 94 PAF aircraft The IAF was able to conduct a wide range of missions ‚Äì troop support; air combat; deep penetration strikes; para-dropping behind enemy lines; feints to draw enemy fighters away from the actual target; bombing; and reconnaissance. In contrast, the Pakistan Air Force, which was solely focused on air combat, was blown out of the subcontinent's skies within the first week of the war. Those PAF aircraft that survived took refuge at Iranian air bases or in concrete bunkers, refusing to offer a fight. Hostilities officially ended at 14:30 GMT on December 17, after the fall of Dacca on December 15. India claimed large gains of territory in West Pakistan (although pre-war boundaries were recognised after the war), and the independence of Pakistan's East wing as Bangladesh was confirmed. The IAF had flown over 16,000 sorties on both East and West fronts; including sorties by transport aircraft and helicopters. while the PAF flew about 30 and 2,840. More than 80 percent of the IAF's sorties were close-support and interdiction, and according to neutral assessments about 45 IAF aircraft were lost while, Pakistan lost 75 aircraft. Not including any F-6s, Mirage IIIs, or the six Jordanian F-104s which failed to return to their donors. But the imbalance in air losses was explained by the IAF's considerably higher sortie rate, and its emphasis on ground-attack missions. On the ground Pakistan suffered most, with 9,000 killed and 25,000 wounded while India lost 3,000 dead and 12,000 wounded. The loss of armoured vehicles was similarly imbalanced. This represented a major defeat for Pakistan.The Encyclopedia of 20th Century Air Warfare, edited by Chris Bishop (Amber publishing 1997, republished 2004 pages 384‚Äì387 ) Towards the end of the war, IAF's transport planes dropped leaflets over Dhaka urging the Pakistani forces to surrender, demoralising Pakistani troops in East Pakistan. Falklands War The Falklands War began on April 2, 1982, when Argentina invaded the Falkland islands, and then the island of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, which were small disputed dependencies. Because Britain had no military bases nearby and few aircraft carriers, the Argentinians did not expect a response from Britain. On April 5, the British sent carriers to the Falklands with Sea Harrier 'Jump-jets' on board. The Harrier was originally designed as a ground-attack plane, and was not equipped for dogfighting, so the aircraft had to undergo many modifications and the pilots given extra training.Rolling Thunder: Jet Combat from World War II to the Gulf War By Ivan Rendall - The Free Press 1997 pp. 245‚Äì269 The Argentinians had superior numbers, but their forces mainly consisted of older jets from the 1960s, such as Dassault Mirage IIIs and Israeli Daggers. The Argentinians were also handicapped by the long distance from mainland airfields and a lack of refuelling tankers. Neither side was ready for war, but both prepared all through April as diplomacy failed. The fighting started on May 1, and was to become the largest naval and air conflict since World War II. By the end of the war, Argentina lost 20 fighters in dogfights, while Britain lost two Sea Harrier to ground fire. The Americans supplied late model Sidewinder missiles to the British; this and the analysis of French Mirage combat tactics made the difference.Rolling Thunder: Jet Combat from World War II to the Gulf War By Ivan Rendall - The Free Press 1997 pp. 245‚Äì269 As of March 2019 David Morgan was the last British pilot to have fought a dogfight when he downed two Argentinian jets on June 8, 1982. Iran‚ÄìIraq War and helicopter dogfight In the Iran‚ÄìIraq War of 1980‚Äì1988, many dogfights occurred between the Iranian Air Force and Saddam Hussein's Iraqi Air Force. During the early years of the war, the IRIAF enjoyed air superiority (see for example Operation Sultan 10 and Operation Morvarid); however, by the end of the war, the Iranian Air Force had lost its superiority due to their increasingly outdated equipment and the lack of spare parts for their US-made aircraft. Iraq, meanwhile, continued to introduce new French and Soviet weapons into its air force. The Iran‚ÄìIraq War also saw helicopter dogfights, with Iranian Army Aviation's AH-1J Internationals (usually the TOW- capable ones) entering combat mostly against Iraqi Army Air Corps' Mil Mi-24 Hind gunships and HOT-armed A√©rospatiale Gazelles. The Hinds proved faster and more robust, while the AH-1Js were more agile. The results of the skirmishes are disputed. There were also engagements between Iranian AH-1Js and Iraqi fixed-wing aircraft: using their 20 mm cannon, the AH-1Js scored three confirmed kills against MiG-21s, claimed an Su-20, and shared in the destruction of a MiG-23. Persian Gulf War In the Gulf War of 1990‚Äì91, dogfighting once again proved its usefulness when the Coalition Air Force had to face off against the Iraqi Air Force, which at the time was the fifth largest in the world. By the second day of the war, the Coalition achieved air superiority. Many dogfights occurred during the short conflict, often involving many planes. By the end of January, 1991, the term \\"furball\\" became a popular word to describe the hectic situation of many dogfights, occurring at the same time within the same relatively small airspace.Safire's Political Dictionary by William Safire. Oxford University Press, 2008, page 270 By the end of the war, the U.S. claimed 39 Iraqi aircraft in air-to-air victories to the loss of only one F/A-18 and one drone. Of the 39 victories, 36 were taken by F-15 Eagles. Balkans conflict During the Balkans conflict, in 1999 (the Kosovo War), five MiG-29s of the Yugoslav Air Force were shot down in dogfights with NATO aircraft. The first was on March 24, by a Dutch F-16AM Falcon, and two were downed on the same night by U.S. F-15s. A day later two more MiG-29's were shot down by an F-16 and F-15.  2019 Indo-Pakistan aerial skirmish  A dogfight between India and Pakistan took place on 27 February 2019, when Pakistani aircraft including Mirage Vs and JF-17 Thunder entered Indian Airspace as a retaliation of the Balakot Airstrike carried out by IAF on 26th February 2019 which was intercepted by Pakistani jets causing the Indian jets to drop its payload and return to India. The PAF Jets bombarded the vicinity of Indian Military installations as a show of capabilities, causing no casualties as Pakistan suffered no casualties in the Balakot Attack which occurred the day prior. In the following Dogfight, one MIG-21 of IAF was shot down. Pakistan Air Force also claims to have shot down an Indian SU-30 combat aircraft on the same day, however India stated that it only lost one MIG-21. It remains uncertain whether an SU-30mki was shot down or not. In a press conference, Indian Air Force officials displayed a metal fragment, proclaiming it to be part of an AMRAAM missile fired by an F-16. After India Lost the Dogfight to Pakistan, Questions Arose About Its 'Vintage' Military. The Indian Government claimed to have shot down a Pakistani F-16 but failed to provide any sort of proof for its claims. This claim was immediately refuted by the Pakistani military. Pakistan's directorate of the Inter‚ÄìServices Public Relations (ISPR) released photographs of the downed Mig-21's wreckage, showing all four of its missile heads intact. Meaning, that the jet had fired no missile, effectively putting the Indian claim to rest. . This was cited as proof that the Indian Mig-21 was shot down before it could fire any of its 4 air-to-air missiles. Later, US government officials also reportedly confirmed that none of Pakistan's F-16 jets were unaccounted for. The pilot of MiG-21, Abhinandan Varthaman was also captured by Pakistani Army. But was later released as a 'peace gesture' by Pakistani prime minister.This gesture was lauded by the international community. . The IAF, in it's frustration, mistook one of it's own Helicopters as a Pakistani Jet and shot it down in an event of friendly fire, killing all the crew members and the pilot. The presence of a rescue helicopter present near the border in during extreme tensions suggests that maybe it was at another crash site, possibly, the SU-30mki which the PAF claimed to have shot down.

Background  Mise √âire is a 1912 Irish-language poem by the Irish poet and Republican revolutionary leader Patrick Pearse.  Political relevance  In the poem, Pearse personifies Ireland as an old woman whose glory is past and who has been sold by her children.  Later use  Described as both a literary and historical text, it was regularly used by Republican prisoners in Long Kesh as a means of learning and teaching Irish. Is Mise continues to be relevant in post-partition Ireland, suggest scholars, as illustrating of the difficulties in identifying \\"Irishness\\" in Northern Ireland. Counter view The title of the poem was used as a title for a 1959 documentary film by George Morrison, which dealt with key figures and events in Irish Nationalism between the 1890s and the 1910s, including Pearse himself. A poem of the same name by Eavan Boland was written as a counter to Pearse's poem, and its treatment of Ireland and her children. Pearse had already written optimistically on the fate of Ireland's strong sons' martyrdom in his poem \\"The Mother\\"; Is Mise takes the opposite, more pessimistic view of the sacrifice. In the words of Boss, Nordin and Orlinder, Boland \\"opposes and corrects Pearse's view on Ireland...No longer, as in the earlier poem, is the personification of the country 'older than the Old Woman of Beare' but 'a sloven‚Äôs mix'. The glory of having born 'Cuchulain the valiant‚Äô is turned into the picture of the woman ‚Äòholding her half-dead baby to her'. Cultural usage In 2016, the poem was set to music composed by Patrick Cassidy and performed by the RT√â Concert Orchestra with vocals by Sib√©al N√≠ Chasaide, for the score of the PBS documentary series 1916: An Irish Rebellion, curated by the Keough-Naughton Institute for Irish Studies at the University of Notre Dame.

It was known in official documentation as the Carrington Spur Road and built to facilitate the transport of hazardous goods from Shell Chemicals' ethylene oxide plant in Carrington and other industrial estates in Carrington and Broadheath. It was unusual in that it was entirely single carriageway, the only motorway of its kind in the UK. The others are dual carriageway for at least some of their length. About 1 mile (2 km) long, the road connected the A6144 road to the M60 at junction 8. It was the highest numbered A-road(M) motorway and one of only two four-digit, Axxxx(M) motorways, the other being the A6127(M) (now A167(M)). The motorway was not a trunk road and not the responsibility of the Highways Agency. The road had no hard shoulder but two emergency lay-bys with SOS phones and lights were provided midway along its length. It was possible to go from the A6144 to the A56 without going on the mainline of the M60 or any other motorway. A reason for its motorway status was that the junction with the M60 had two small roundabouts that were difficult for a driver of a long vehicle prohibited from motorways to perform a U-turn because of their size. The unusual status of the A6144(M) led to its gaining a number of fans, particularly within organisations such as the Society for All British And Irish Road Enthusiasts (SABRE). Revocation of special road status In 2004, work to widen the M60 motorway altered the junction with the A6144(M) which was changed into a single roundabout allowing all motorway-prohibited traffic to turn and not join the M60. Trafford Borough Council confirmed its intention to remove special road status from the A6144(M) when the M60 widening works were completed. The A6144(M) ceased being a special road on 25 May 2006 losing its motorway status. It is now subject to a 50 mph (80 km/h) speed limit and is classified as the A6144. The road through Sale retained the A6144 number, meaning that there are two branches (and two junctions with the M60 motorway) with the same road number. Despite losing motorway status, the road still prohibits pedestrians, cyclists, and horse riders. Preservation Following the change of signage on 25 May 2006, two marker posts, the A6144(M) confirmation sign and a lay-by warning sign are privately preserved.

It is based and inspired on the flag of the Federal Republic of Central America and flag of Argentina. Overview The two Azure bands on the flag and the arms of Nicaragua in use today are the most similar to those used by the United Provinces of Central America. The triangle, volcanoes, rising sun, Cap of Liberty, and rainbow all appeared on the original emblem. The coat of arms used today contains the name of the state, Republica de Nicaragua, whereas in 1823 the title was Provincias Unidas del Centro de America. The decision to revert to the emblems used by the United Provinces of Central America was taken in 1908 and reflected Nicaragua's aspirations for the rebirth of the political entity formed by the 5 nations. Except for the text around the arms, the flag is very similar to that of the United Provinces of Central America. The 5 volcanoes represent the original 5 member states, the Cap of Liberty represents national freedom, and the rays of the sun and the rainbow are symbolic of the bright future to come. The presence of a rainbow in the coat of arms makes the flag of Nicaragua one of only two flags of a sovereign state to include the color purple, alongside the flag of Dominica.

Each highway is assigned a Route (officially State Highway RouteCalifornia Streets and Highways Code, Section 231Caltrans, Other State Highway Routes) number in the Streets and Highways Code (Sections 300-635). Most of these are numbered in a statewide system, and are known as State Route X (abbreviated SR X). United States Numbered Highways are labeled US X, and Interstate Highways are Interstate X. Under the code, the state assigns a unique Route X to each highway, and does not differentiate between state, US, or Interstate highways. The California Highway Patrol (CHP) is tasked with patrolling all state highways to enforce traffic laws. Overview Route shield signs at the intersection of SR 123 and SR 13 in Berkeley California's highway system is governed pursuant to Division 1 of the California Streets and Highways Code, which is one of the 29 California Codes enacted by the state legislature. Since July 1 of 1964, the majority of legislative route numbers, those defined in the Streets and Highways Code, match the sign route numbers. For example, Interstate 5 is listed as \\"Route 5\\" in the code. On the other hand, some short routes are instead signed as parts of other routes ‚Äî for instance, Route 112 and Route 260 are signed as part of the longer State Route 61, and Route 51 is part of Interstate 80 Business. Concurrences are not explicitly codified in the Streets and Highways Code; such highway segments are listed on only one of the corresponding legislative route numbers ‚Äî for example, the I-80/I-580 concurrency, known as the Eastshore Freeway, only falls under the Route 80 description in the highway code while the definition of Route 580 is broken into non-contiguous segments. The state may relinquish segments of highways and turn them over to local control. If the relinquished segment is in the middle of the highway's route, the local jurisdiction is usually required to install and maintain signs directing drivers to the continuation of that highway; they are not generally required to do so if the relinquishment effectively truncates the highway at one end, or is done as part of the process to re-route a highway. The state may also delete a highway completely and turn over an entire state route to local control. Business routes are not maintained by the state unless they are also assigned legislative route numbers. A route or sections of a route may also be considered unrelinquished - a new alignment has been built, or the legislative definition has changed to omit the section, but the state still owns the roadway ‚Äî and are officially Route XU. For example, State Route 14U is an old alignment of State Route 14 whose control has not yet been transferred to the City of Santa Clarita. Some new alignments are considered supplementalMetadata for ST_HWY GIS data layer (PDF) and have a suffix of S. For example, an expressway replacement for State Route 86 between approximately three miles north of the Imperial/Riverside County line and Interstate 10 east of Indio was initially signed as State Route 86S until it was eventually transferred to SR 86. Likewise, the freeway replacement for State Route 180 in Fresno was initially referred to as State Route 180S. History Counties covered by the Automobile Club of Southern California (red) and California State Automobile Association (blue) The first legislative routes were defined by the State Highway Bond Act in 1909, passed by the California State Legislature and signed by Governor James Gillett. These, and later extensions to the system, were numbered sequentially. No signs were erected for these routes. The United States Numbered Highways were assigned by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) in November 1926, but posting did not begin in California until January 1928. These were assigned to some of the main legislative routes in California. Initially, signs were posted by the Automobile Club of Southern California (ACSC) and California State Automobile Association (CSAA), which had been active in signing national auto trails and local roads since the mid-1900s. In 1934, after the major expansion of the state highway system in 1933 by the California Legislature, California sign route numbers were assigned by the California Division of Highways (predecessor to Caltrans). The California sign route numbers were assigned in a geographical system, completely independent of the legislative routes. Odd-numbered routes ran north-south and even- numbered routes ran east-west. The routes were split among southern California (ACSC) and central and northern California (CSAA) as follows: *0 or 1 modulo 4: central and northern California *2 or 3 modulo 4: southern California For instance, State Route 1 and State Route 4 were in central and northern California, and State Route 2 and State Route 3 (since moved) were in southern California. A rough grid was used inside the two regions, with the largest numbers ‚Äî all less than 200 (except for State Route 740, which was related to State Route 74) - in eastern California (north-south) and near the border between the two regions (east-west). The Interstate Highway System numbers were assigned by AASHO in late 1959. In 1963 and 1964, a total renumbering of the legislative routes was made, aligning them with the sign routes. Some changes were also made to the sign routes, mostly related to decommissionings of U.S. Routes in favor of Interstates. Since the 1990s, many non-freeway routes, especially in urban areas, have been deleted and turned over to local control. This transfers the cost of maintaining them from state to local budgets, but also gives local governments direct control over urban arterial roads that carry primarily local traffic. Once transferred, if a local government wants to add landscaping in the center median or install additional traffic lights or other traffic control devices, it can immediately do so itself rather than having to negotiate with Caltrans. Not all cities have been prepared to accept such routes from Caltrans simultaneously, so many have been decommissioned from the state system one fragment at a time. In the case of the San Francisco Bay Area, the Caltrans district responsible for that region is granted permission to retain in the State highway system routes that run on conventional (non freeway or expressway) roadways unless a freeway is built to bypass the surface street route. Nomenclature in California English One cultural difference between Northern and Southern Californians is that the latter tend to put \\"the\\" before highway numbers (e.g. \\"taking the 5 to L.A.\\"), while the former use the number alone (e.g. \\"taking 80 to San Francisco\\") or less frequently, with \\"I-\\" in the case of interstate freeways. When the Southern California freeway system was built in the 1940s and early 1950s, local common usage was primarily the freeway name preceded by the definite article, such as \\"the Hollywood Freeway\\". It took several decades for Southern California locals to start to commonly refer to the freeways with the numerical designations, but usage of the definite article persisted. For example, it evolved to \\"the 605 Freeway\\" and then shortened to \\"the 605\\". This did not occur in Northern California, where usage of the route numbers was more common.

He was studying at Norwich Technical College in London, England, when he saw an advertisement in a newspaper that submissions were being accepted for the design of a new national flag of Nigeria. The original submission had a red radiating sun badge in the central white vertical band with a green vertical band on each side. After the badge was removed by the judges, the flag has remained unchanged. It was first officially used on 1 October 1960, the day Nigeria was granted independence from the United Kingdom.

When executed it invokes a shell without changing the current working directory or the user environment. When the command is used without specifying the new user id as a command line argument, it defaults to using the superuser account (user id 0) of the system. History The command su, including the Unix permissions system and the setuid system call, was part of Version 1 Unix. Encrypted passwords appeared in Version 3. Usage When run from the command line, su asks for the target user's password, and if authenticated, grants the operator access to that account and the files and directories that account is permitted to access. john@localhost:~$ su jane Password: jane@localhost:/home/john$ exit logout john@localhost:~$ When used with a hyphen (\`su -\`) it can be used to start a login shell. In this mode users can assume the user environment of the target user. john@localhost:~$ su - jane Password: jane@localhost:~$ The command sudo is related, and executes a command as another user but observes a set of constraints about which users can execute which commands as which other users (generally in a configuration file named \`/etc/sudoers\`, best editable by the command \`visudo\`). Unlike \`su\`, \`sudo\` authenticates users against their own password rather than that of the target user (to allow the delegation of specific commands to specific users on specific hosts without sharing passwords among them and while mitigating the risk of any unattended terminals). Some Unix-like systems implement the user group wheel, and only allow members to become root with su. This may or may not mitigate these security concerns, since an intruder might first simply break into one of those accounts. GNU su, however, does not support the group wheel for philosophical reasons. Richard Stallman argues that because the group would prevent users from utilizing root passwords leaked to them, the group would allow existing admins to ride roughshod over ordinary users.

The fleet currently consists of nine ships. History=Pre‚ÄìWorld War I The first recorded maritime combat activity in New Zealand occurred when MƒÅori in war waka attacked Dutch explorer Abel Tasman off the northern tip of the South Island in December 1642. The New Zealand Navy did not exist as a separate military force until 1941.Much of this discussion is taken from \\"RNZN History\\" . RNZN Official Website. Accessed 15 April 2006. The association of the Royal Navy with New Zealand began with the arrival of Lieutenant (later Captain) James Cook in 1769, who completed two subsequent journeys to New Zealand in 1773 and 1777. Occasional visits by Royal Navy ships were made from the late 18th century until the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840. William Hobson, a crucial player in the drafting of the treaty, was in New Zealand as a captain in the Royal Navy. The signing of the Treaty of Waitangi made New Zealand a colony in the British Empire, so the defence of the coastline became the responsibility of the Royal Navy. That role was fulfilled until World War I, and the Royal Navy also played a part in the New Zealand Wars: for example, a gunboat shelled fortified MƒÅori pƒÅ from the Waikato River in order to defeat the MƒÅori King Movement. World War I and the Inter-War period In 1909, the New Zealand government decided to fund the purchase of the battlecruiser for the Royal Navy, which saw action throughout World War I in Europe. The passing of the Naval Defence Act 1913 created the New Zealand Naval Forces, still as a part of the Royal Navy. The first purchase by the New Zealand government for the New Zealand Naval Forces was the cruiser , which escorted New Zealand land forces to occupy the German colony of Samoa in 1914. Philomel saw further action under the command of the Royal Navy in the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, and the Persian Gulf. By 1917, she was worn out and dispatched back to New Zealand where she served as a depot ship in Wellington Harbour for minesweepers. In 1921 she was transferred to Auckland for use as a training ship. The New Zealand Naval Forces passed to the control of Commander-in- Chief, China, after the Royal Navy forces in Australia came under Canberra's control in 1911. From 1921 to 1941 the force was known as the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy.McGibbon, Ian (2000). The Oxford Companion to New Zealand Military History. Auckland: Oxford University Press. , pp.45‚Äì46 The cruiser Chatham along with the sloop Veronica arrived in 1920, Philomel was transferred to the Division in 1921, as was the sloop Torch, arrived in 1922 and then in 1924. and the minesweeper HMS Wakakura arrived in 1926. Between World War I and World War II, the New Zealand Division operated a total of 14 ships, including the cruisers HMS Achilles (joined 31 March 1937) and HMS Leander, which replaced Diomede and Dunedin (replaced by Leander in 1937). World War II thumbHMNZS Leander and USS St. Louis fire on Jintsu When Britain went to war against Germany in 1939, New Zealand officially declared war at the same time, backdated to 9.30 pm on 3 September local time. But the gathering in Parliament in Carl Berendsen's room (including Peter Fraser) could not follow Chamberlain's words because of static on the shortwave and waited until the Admiralty notified the fleet that war had broken out before Cabinet approved the declaration of war (the official telegram from Britain was delayed and arrived just before midnight). participated in the first major naval battle of World War II, the Battle of the River Plate off the River Plate estuary between Argentina and Uruguay, in December 1939.The Royal New Zealand Navy, Official History of New Zealand in the Second World War, \\"Chapter 2: Outbreak of War: Cruise of HMS Achilles\\" , Historical Publications Branch, Wellington, 1956. Achilles and two other cruisers, and , severely damaged the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee. The German Captain Hans Langsdorff then scuttled Graf Spee rather than face the loss of many more German seamen's lives. This decision apparently infuriated Hitler. Achilles moved to the Pacific, and was working with the United States Navy (USN) when damaged by a Japanese bomb off New Georgia. Following repair, she served alongside the British Pacific Fleet until the war's end. The New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy became the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) from 1 October 1941, in recognition of the fact that the naval force was now largely self-sufficient and independent of the Royal Navy. The Prime Minister Peter Fraser reluctantly agreed, though saying \\"now was not the time to break away from the old country\\". Ships thereafter were prefixed HMNZS (His/Her Majesty's New Zealand Ship). escorted the New Zealand Expeditionary Force to the Middle East in 1940 and was then deployed in the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, and the Indian Ocean. Leander was subjected to air and naval attack from Axis forces, conducted bombardments, and escorted convoys. In February 1941, Leander sank the Italian auxiliary cruiser in the Indian Ocean. In 1943, after serving further time in the Mediterranean, Leander returned to the Pacific Ocean. She assisted in the destruction of the and being seriously damaged by torpedoes during the Battle of Kolombangara. The extent of the damage to Leander saw her docked for repairs until the end of the war. As the war progressed, the size of the RNZN greatly increased, and by the end of the war, there were over 60 ships in commission. These ships participated as part of the British and Commonwealth effort against the Axis in Europe, and against the Japanese in the Pacific. They also played an important role in the defence of New Zealand, from German raiders, especially when the threat of invasion from Japan appeared imminent in 1942. Many merchant ships were requisitioned and armed for help in defence. One of these was , which saw action against the off Fiji in 1942. In 1941‚Äì1942, it was decided in an agreement between the New Zealand and United States governments that the best role for the RNZN in the Pacific was as part of the United States Navy, so operational control of the RNZN was transferred to the South West Pacific Area command, and its ships joined United States 7th Fleet taskforces. In 1943, the light cruiser was transferred to the RNZN as HMNZS Gambia. In November 1944, the British Pacific Fleet, a joint British Commonwealth military formation, was formed, based in Sydney, Australia. Most RNZN ships were transferred to the BPF, including Gambia and Achilles. They took part in the Battle of Okinawa and operations in the Sakishima Islands, near Japan. In August 1945, HMNZS Gambia was New Zealand's representative at the surrender of Japan. Post-World War II HMNZS Royalist in Waitemata Harbour, 1956 During April 1947 a series of non- violent mutinies occurred amongst the sailors and non-commissioned officers of four RNZN ships and two shore bases. Overall, up to 20% of the sailors in the RNZN were involved in the mutinies. The resulting manpower shortage forced the RNZN to remove the light cruiser , one of their most powerful warships, from service and set the navy's development and expansion back by a decade. Despite this impact, the size and scope of the events have been downplayed over time. RNZN ships participated in the Korean War. On 29 June, just four days after 135,000 North Korean troops crossed the 38th parallel in Korea, the New Zealand government ordered two frigates ‚Äì and to prepare to make for Korean waters, and for the whole of the war, at least two NZ vessels would be on station in the theater.Korean Scholarships ‚Äì Navy Today, Defence Public Relations Unit, Issue 133, 8 June, Page 14-15 On 3 July, these two first ships left Devonport Naval Base, Auckland and joined other Commonwealth forces at Sasebo, Japan, on 2 August. These vessels served under the command of a British flag officer (seemingly Flag Officer Second in Command Far East Fleet)\\"Coalition Air Warfare in the Korean War, 1950‚Äì1953\\": Proceedings, Air Force Historical Foundation Symposium, Andrews AFB, Maryland, 7‚Äì8 May 2002, 142 onwards and formed part of the US Navy screening force during the Battle of Inchon, performing shore raids and inland bombardment. Further RNZN Loch- class frigates joined these later ‚Äì , , and , as well as a number of smaller craft. Only one RNZN sailor was killed during the conflict ‚Äì during the Inchon bombardments. The Navy later participated in the Malayan Emergency. In 1954 a New Zealand frigate, HMNZS Pukaki, carried out a bombardment of a suspected guerilla camp, while operating with the Royal Navy's Far East Fleet ‚Äì the first of a number of bombardments by RNZN ships over the next five years. Jack Welch, later to become Chief of Naval Staff decades later, wrote that in 1959, the RNZN \\"was still very much part of the Royal Navy supported by New Zealand tax-payers. The officer corps and senior specialist ratings were very dependent on loan and exchange RN personnel, while our own [New Zealand] officers and senior ratings were almost exclusively trained in the UK. We simply borrowed the RN's administrative regulations and amended them to local conditions. The Empire was alive and well. Operationally we were still very strongly tied to the UK.\\"Rear Admiral J.E.N.

Later the Navy return to Malayan waters during the Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation. These operations were the RNZN's last large- scale operation with the Royal Navy. In a security crisis and threat to Malaysia and Sarawak and Brunei, two-thirds of the Royal Navy's operational warships were deployed from 1963 to the end of 1966 with , , and , heavily involved in boarding ships, shore patrols, presence, maintaining the use of seaways and support of the RN's amphibious carriers. The commitment, wrote Welch, \\"involved the whole fleet, as ships rotated though Pearl Harbour for workup with the USN before deploying on to the Far East to relieve ships on station.\\"Welch, \\"The Critical Size of Our Combat Fleet.\\" Until the 1960s, the RNZN had, in common with other Dominion navies, flown the White Ensign as a common ensign. After 1945, the foreign policies of the now-independent states had become more distinctive. There was a growing wish and a need for separate identities, particularly if one Dominion was engaged in hostilities where another was not. Thus, in 1968, the RNZN adopted its own ensign, which retained the Union Flag in a top quarter but replaces the St George's Cross with the Southern Cross constellation that is displayed on the national flag. Since 1946, the Navy has policed New Zealand's territorial waters and exclusive economic zone for fisheries protection. It also aids New Zealand's scientific activities in Antarctica, at Scott Base. One of the best-known roles that the RNZN played on the world stage was when the frigates and were sent by the Labour Government of Norman Kirk to Moruroa Atoll in 1973 to protest against French nuclear testing there. The frigates were sent into the potential blast zone of the weapons, where both ships witnessed one airburst test each which forced France to then change to underground testing. In May 1982 Prime Minister Rob Muldoon seconded the frigate Canterbury to the Royal Navy for the duration of the Falklands War. Canterbury was deployed to the Armilla Patrol in the Persian Gulf, to relieve a British frigate for duty in the South Atlantic. Canterbury was herself relieved by in August.Ex RNZN Navy Club ‚Äì HMNZS Canterbury 1981/82 Commission Post-Cold War At the close of the Cold War the RNZN operated a surface combatant force of four frigates (HMNZS Waikato (F55), HMNZS Wellington (F69), HMNZS Canterbury (F421), and HMNZS Southland). Due to the post-Cold War restructuring of the RNZN the frigate fleet was downsized to two frigates, although there was considerable political debate at times during the mid-1990s about whether a third and fourth Anzac-class frigate should be procured.Greener, Timing is everything, p. 86 In the past three decades, the RNZN has operated in the Middle East a number of times.

International participation The RNZN has a role to help prevent any unrest occurring in New Zealand. This can be done by having a presence in overseas waters and assisting redevelopment in troubled countries. For example, any unrest in the Pacific Islands has the potential to affect New Zealand because of the large Pacific Island population. The stability of the South Pacific is considered in the interest of New Zealand. The navy has participated in peace-keeping and peace-making in East Timor, Bougainville and the Solomon Islands, supporting land based operations. Civilian roles The 2002 Maritime Forces Review identified a number of roles that other government agencies required the RNZN to undertake. Approximately 1,400 days at sea are required to fulfil these roles annually. Roles include patrolling the exclusive economic zone, transport to offshore islands, and support for the New Zealand Customs Service. The RNZN formerly produced hydrographic information for Land Information New Zealand under a commercial contract arrangement, however with the decommissioning of the dedicated Hydrographic survey ship HMNZS Resolution this has lapsed and the Navy now focuses on military hydrography. Current deployments Since 2001, both Anzac-class frigates have participated in the United States' Operation Enduring Freedom in the Persian Gulf and have conducted maritime patrol operations in support of American and allied efforts in Afghanistan.

As with the flags of several other Pacific island groups, light blue is the colour used to represent the ocean and the nation's place within it. While this puts Palau in common with the Federated States of Micronesia and other neighboring island groups, the disc on the flag (similar to that on Japan's flag) is off-centre like that of the flag of Bangladesh, but in this case represents the moon instead of the sun. The current flag was introduced in 1981 when Palau became a republic. Previously, the flag of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands was flown jointly with the United Nations and American flags. The flag's very simple design belies the depth of meaning attributed to it. The explanation for the choice of colours is rooted in the history and customs of the Palauan people. The light blue of the field symbolizes the Pacific Ocean, and also represents the transition from foreign domination to self-government.Republic of Palau Convention History of the National Flag The golden disk, which sits slightly off-centre toward the hoist, represents the full moon. The Palauans consider the full moon to be the optimum time for human activity. At this time of the month, celebrations, fishing, sowing, harvesting, tree-felling, and the carving of traditional canoes are carried out. The moon is a symbol of peace, love, and tranquility.

The first flag proposed in 1903 consisted of thirteen horizontal stripes of alternating red and yellow, with a blue canton containing two golden suns, joined by a narrow line to depict the oceans to be united by the Panama Canal (see the depiction below). However, this was not accepted by the Panamanian leader, Manuel Amador Guerrero, whose family designed a new flag. The stars and quarters are said to stand for the rival political parties, and the white is said to stand for the peace in which they operate. Blue was the color of the Conservatives and red was the color of the Liberals.(Flags of the World, published DK Publishing, 1997) History=Bunau-Varilla proposal 23x15px Reconstruction of the Bunau-Varilla design The wife of Philippe-Jean Bunau-Varilla designed the first serious proposal for a Panamanian flag. Bunau-Varilla's design was based on the flag of the United States, possibly on account of that country's hand in Panamanian independence. Retaining the thirteen stripes, she changed the white stripes to yellow, emphasizing the Panamanian connection to Colombia and Spain (whose flags both prominently feature red and yellow). Bunau-Varilla replaced the stars in the blue canton with two interconnected yellow suns; the suns represent North and South America, and are connected because of Panama's position connecting the two continents.Mellander, Gustavo A. (1971) The United States in Panamanian Politics: The Intriguing Formative Years Danville, Illinois: Interstate Publishers, OCLC 138568 Bunau-Varilla's proposal was rejected by Manuel Amador Guerrero and his fellow revolutionaries because it was too similar to the U.S. flag, and they, therefore, gave the task of designing a flag to Guerrero's son. Mar√≠a de la Ossa de Amador proposal The original Panamanian flag was made by Mar√≠a de la Ossa de Amador, the first First Lady of Panama, on November 1, 1903. Manuel Amador Guerrero's son, Manuel Encarnaci√≥n Amador, generally recognized as a skillful drawer, sketched the flag and showed it to Mar√≠a de la Ossa de Amador, who, after much difficulty in avoiding the Colombian army, eventually produced three copies of the flag, with help from her sister-in-law Ang√©lica Bergamonta de la Ossa and niece, Mar√≠a Emilia de la Ossa Bergamonta. All three flags were flown in Panama City upon independence, and distributed widely. The original flag differs from the present flag in that the upper left quadrant was blue. After independence, when blue was chosen as a color of one of the political parties, the quadrants were shifted to make the top left quadrant white. Description The Panamanian government officially described the flag in law on December 15, 1949, as follows: This flag was to reflect the political situation of the time. The blue was intended to represent the Conservative Party and the red to represent the Liberal Party. The white was intended to stand for peace and purity; the blue star stands for the purity and honesty of the life of the country; the red star represents the authority and law in the country, and together the stars stand for the new republic.

The HSR Act was signed into law by president Gerald R. Ford on September 30, 1976. The context in which the HSR Act is usually cited is , title II of the original law. The HSR Act is named after senators Philip A. Hart and Hugh D. Scott, Jr. and representative Peter W. Rodino. The HSR Act provides that parties must not complete certain mergers, acquisitions or transfers of securities or assets, including grants of executive compensation, until they have made a detailed filing with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice and waited for those agencies to determine that the transaction will not adversely affect U.S. commerce under the antitrust laws. While parties can carry out due diligence and plan for post-merger integration, they may not take any steps to integrate operations, such as an acquiring party obtaining operational control of the acquired party. Pre-merger notification and filing fee The Act provides that before certain mergers, tender offers or other acquisition transactions (including certain grants of executive compensation) can be completed, both parties must file a \\"notification and report form\\" with the Federal Trade Commission and the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. The parties then must wait a certain period, usually 30 days (15 days for all-cash tender offers or bankruptcy sales) during which time those regulatory agencies may request further information in order to help them assess whether the proposed transaction violates the antitrust laws of the United States or could cause an anti-competitive effect in the parties' markets. The filing is not made public, but the agencies may disclose some information about the transaction, especially in the case of publicly announced transactions. Failure to file the form carries a civil penalty of up to $41,484 per day against the parties, their officers, directors or partners, and the agencies may obtain an order requiring an acquirer to divest assets or securities acquired in violation of the Act. It is also unlawful to complete the transaction during the waiting period, and the same penalties apply. Although the waiting period is generally 30 days (15 days if the transaction is an all-cash tender offer or a bankruptcy sale), the regulators may request additional time to review additional information and the filing parties may request that the waiting period for a particular transaction be terminated early (\\"early termination\\"). Early terminations are made public in the Federal Register and posted on the Federal Trade Commission website. Some types of transactions are afforded the special treatment of shorter waiting periods. When the notification is required The filing requirement is triggered only if the value of the transaction and, in some cases, the size of the parties, exceeds certain dollar thresholds, which are adjusted periodically under the Act. For the purpose of determining the \\"size of the parties\\", one assesses the size of the party's ultimate parent entity and all subsidiaries of that entity. The general rule is that a filing is required if three tests are met: : (1) the transaction affects U.S. commerce; : (2) either :: (a) one of the parties has annual sales or total assets of $151.7 millionhttp://www.ropesgray.com/news- and-insights/Insights/2014/January/FTC-Announces-Increased-HSR-Thresholds.aspx or more (: in 2012 this threshold amount began increasing periodically under the law), and the other party has sales or assets of $15.2 million or more (: this amount adjusts periodically) (where an acquired person is not engaged in manufacturing, only its total assets, not its sales, are counted, unless its sales are over $151.7 million); or :: (b) the amount of stock the acquirer has is valued at $272.8 million or more (: amount adjusts periodically) at any time; and : (3) the value of the securities or assets of the other party held by the acquirer after the transaction is $68.2 million or more (: amount adjusts periodically).Federal Register report of HSR threshold reporting limits , effective January 29, 2008 The 2018 rules raise this amount to US$84.4 million https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/media-resources/mergers-and- competition/merger-review There is also a rule prohibiting \\"interlocking directorates\\", that is, it prohibits a person from serving on the board of directors of competing companies valued at over a certain size (this amount was $27.7 million in 2012); but does not apply if the two companies have annual sales in competition with each other of less than $2.7 million.Adjusted threshold amounts, as of March 2012 U.S. Federal Register, Vol. 77, No. 18, accessed March 6, 2012 The rules are somewhat overlapping, but all transactions where the acquiring person will hold an aggregate amount of securities and/or assets of $272.8 million or more () require a filing. Also, all transactions worth more than $68.2 million require a filing if one of the parties is worth at least $13.6 million, the other is worth at least $136.4 million and the total amount of assets now owned by the acquirer reaches $272.8 million. If an entity is not sure if the filing requirements apply to it, it can make a request of the Justice Department to determine if it is. Some assets are not counted, generally assets that do not produce income. For example, if one of the parties involved in the transaction is a natural person, for the purposes of determining whether they reach the asset trigger, the value of their primary residence and car are not counted, but the value of a second home that was rented out would be. There are certain exceptions on transaction reporting for usual and customary transactions: such as an airline purchasing planes and certain real estate purchases. An example was given that a merger of two corporations each having a net asset value of $99 million would not require a filing.FTC HSR Introduction In transactions where either the FTC or the Antitrust Division believes there may be significant anti- competitive consequences, either agency may require that the parties submit more background information by means of the second request process. Amount of the filing fee The firm that is making the proposed acquisition is required to pay a substantial filing fee when making its filing; the amount of the fee is tied to the size of the transaction, the fee was $45,000 for transactions of at least $78.2 million but less than $156.3 million; $125,000 for transactions of $156.3 million to $781.5 million; and $280,000 for transactions over $781.5 million.HSR Filing Fee Information, FTC, updated February 25, 2016 The filing fee covers additional transactions, during a period of up to five years after the original transaction, that do not exceed the next threshold. There are also filing requirements based on the percentage of acquisition, at 25% of a company worth $1.36 billion, or 50% of a company where the amount held by the acquirer will be worth at least $68.2 million. However, once 50% or more of the target has been acquired, or the amount of acquisitions reported exceeded $682.1 million, no further reports are required to be filed.

To some extent, however, this effect was mitigated by the availability of state law and congressional passage of the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA),28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1332(d). under which class actions can be removed from state court to federal court but state parens patriae actions cannot. Consequently, state attorneys general can pursue price-fixing cases on behalf of the state's consumers under state law in state courts.See Mississippi ex rel. Hood v. AU Optronics Corp., 134 S.

Historical flags Prior to the First World War, Samoa was a colony of the German Empire. German colonies used the flag of the Imperial Colonial Office, a black-white-red tricolour defaced with the Imperial Eagle. The Imperial German government intended to introduce specific flags for the colonies (also based on the tricolour) and several proposals were created, but the war and the subsequent loss of all overseas territories prevented their official adoption. New Zealand occupied German Samoa in 1914 and officially gained control of the territory in 1919. From the capture by New Zealand forces on August 29, 1914, a defaced ensign with three palm trees encircled, and emblazoned on the fly were used. The defaced Blue Ensign was used by vessels owned by the mandate government, or those operated in the government service, while the defaced Red Ensign was used by locally registered civilian ships.

Adopted in 1975 to replace the flag of Portugal from the colonial period, it has been the flag of the Democratic Republic of S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe since the country gained independence in that same year. The design of the present flag was inspired by and is almost identical to the flag of the Movement for the Liberation of S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe. History Flag of 193px The Portuguese colonized the islands of S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe during the 16th century and incorporated them into their colonial empire. Four centuries later, the Batep√° massacre in 1953 stoked nationalistic sentiment and galvanized a struggle for independence. This was led by the Movement for the Liberation of S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe (MLSTP), which were established seven years later. The Portuguese, however, refused to grant this and continued to fight on until the Carnation Revolution occurred in 1974. The new government decided to withdraw from their remaining colonies, and negotiated on a roadmap for independence with the MLSTP, whom they had recognized as the \\"sole representative\\" of the islands. Several submissions for a new flag were made, all of which utilized the colours of the Pan-Africanist movement. These were all turned down, and a new flag ‚Äì reportedly designed by MLSTP leader and future president Manuel Pinto da Costa ‚Äì was approved of. It was adopted either on July 12, 1975 ‚Äì the day the country became independent ‚Äì or on November 5 of that same year. The flag is almost identical to the flag of the MLSTP, and although they lost their \\"monopoly of power\\" in 1990, the flag remained unchanged. Design Design. Symbolism The colors and symbols of the flag carry cultural, political, and regional meanings. The green alludes to the plentiful vegetation of the country, while the yellow stands for the tropical sun and cocoa, a key agricultural crop for the nation. The red evokes the \\"struggle for independence\\", as well as equality. The two stars on the yellow band represent the two islands that make up the country. Nationally, the flag was inspired by the MLSTP flag; it is almost identical to it except that the widths of the horizontal bands on the national flag are at a ratio of 2:3:2. On the other hand, the three bands on the flag of the political party are of equal width. On a continental level, the yellow, green and red represented the Pan-Africanist movement. These colours are the same as the ones utilized in the flag of Ethiopia. Similarities The national flag is similar to the flags of the Arab Revolt, The Bahamas, Comoros, Ghana and Togo, in its incorporation of the colour red, along with its symbolism of the fight for independence.

In 2002, there were 39 sizeable ships using the flag, despite the fact that S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe does not have any deep-water ports. The lack of regulation has led to \\"irregularities\\", and has resulted in the flag being placed on the blacklist for poor port State control. It was removed from the list in 2004, but only because of a lack of investigations being conducted on ships featuring the country's flag.

The current flag is the third used by the country since its independence from Britain on June 29, 1976. The colours used in the current flag are the official colours of two of the nation's major political parties-Seychelles People's United Party and the Seychelles Democratic Party.  Description  The flag consists of five different coloured bands (blue, yellow, red, white, and green) starting from one end and diverging towards the other end.New National Symbols of the Republic of Seychelles - Republic of Seychelles Ministry of Foreign Affairs The oblique bands symbolize a dynamic new country moving into the future. The colour blue depicts the sky and the sea that surrounds the Seychelles. Yellow is for the sun which gives light and life, red symbolizes the people and their determination to work for the future in unity and love, while the white band represents social justice and harmony. The green depicts the land and natural environment.  History  The original flag was adopted after independence on June 29, 1976. It had alternating blue and red triangles. Coincidentally the flag was almost identical to the Australian United Steam Navigation Company's flag. In 1977, when president James Mancham was overthrown by France-Albert Ren√©, the old flag was abolished and the red, white and green flag based on the flag of the Seychelles People's United Party came into use, which had a distinct wavy white stripe. The only significant difference between the national flag and SPUP's flag was the depiction of the sun in the party's flag which was not used in the country's flag. The flag was also very similar to the combination of the flag of the Lithuanian SSR, Latvian SSR, and the Estonian SSR. When the party lost the majority in the elections, other parties demanded a change in the flag which led to a parliamentary approval of a new proposed design.

Barons Lucas (of Shenfield), first Creation (1645) The title Baron Lucas, of Shenfield in the County of Essex, was created 13 January 1645 for Sir John Lucas, a Royalist army officer. He was succeeded according to a special remainder in the letters patent by his nephew, Charles Lucas. The title became extinct on the death of the third Baron in 1705. * John Lucas, 1st Baron Lucas of Shenfield (1606‚Äì1671), * Charles Lucas, 2nd Baron Lucas (1631‚Äì1688).

Barons Lucas (of Crudwell), second Creation (1663) The title Baron Lucas, of Crudwell in the County of Wiltshire, was created at the request of John Lucas, her father, in 1663 for Mary, Countess of Kent, new wife of the 11th Earl of Kent and only surviving child of the 1st Baron of the first creation above. The title was created with remainder to her heirs male by Lord Kent and failing which to her heirs general without division (the latter being the same way that the Crown passed, i.e. to the eldest daughter in the absence of sons, rather than going into abeyance or to the nearest male-line relative). The 1st Baroness was succeeded by her son, who had already succeeded as 12th Earl of Kent, and who was successively created Marquess of Kent and Duke of Kent. (See Duke of Kent for information on the Kent peerages.) In 1718, the Duke of Kent's elder son, Anthony, Earl of Harold (1695‚Äì1723), was summoned to Parliament by a writ in acceleration as Baron Lucas, and is usually numbered as the 3rd Baron (see note below). In view of the death of both his sons and the consequent extinction of the dukedom at his death the Duke managed to obtain in 1740 (at the cost of his other Grey titles excluding Lucas) only a new marquessate, Marquess Grey. However he obtained a special remainder of the marquessate, in default of his heirs male, to his granddaughter, Jemima Campbell (who was the only surviving child of his eldest daughter, the former Lady Amabel Grey, who was the late wife of Lord Glenorchy (later 3rd Earl of Breadalbane and Holland)). On the Duke's death later that year, the Barony of Lucas, along with the Marquessate of Grey, passed to this granddaughter (by now the wife of the 2nd Earl of Hardwicke), who became 2nd Marchioness Grey and 4th Baroness Lucas of Crudwell. On her death, the Marquessate became extinct and the Barony passed to her eldest daughter, Amabel, Lady Polwarth (widow of Alexander, Lord Polwarth, eldest son of the 3rd Earl of Marchmont), who became 5th Baroness Lucas. In 1816 she was created Countess de Grey, of Wrest in the County of Bedford, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, with a special remainder to her sister (the widow of the 2nd Baron Grantham) and her heirs male. (See Earl de Grey for information on that peerage.) On her death, the Earldom of de Grey and the Barony of Lucas passed under their respective remainders to her nephew, the 3rd Baron Grantham, who became 2nd Earl de Grey and 6th Baron Lucas. On his death, the Earldom of de Grey passed to his nephew, the 2nd Earl of Ripon, and the Barony passed to his daughter, Anne, Countess Cowper (widow of the 6th Earl Cowper), who became 7th Baroness Lucas. On her death, the Barony passed to her son, the 7th Earl Cowper, who became 8th Baron Lucas. He was restored as 3rd Baron Butler in the Peerage of England and 4th Lord Dingwall in the Peerage of Scotland upon the termination of the attainder on those titles. (See Earl Cowper for the Cowper peerages.) On his death, the Earldom of Cowper and its associated titles became extinct, the Barony of Butler became abeyant, and the Barony of Lucas and the Lordship of Dingwall passed to his nephew, Auberon Herbert (a grandson of the 3rd Earl of Carnarvon), who became 9th Baron Lucas and 5th Lord Dingwall. He was confirmed in the titles in 1907 by the Committee for Privileges of the House of Lords. After this, the succession was straightforward, the Barony and Lordship passing to the 9th Baron and 5th Lord's sister Nan Ino Herbert (later Cooper) (the 10th Baroness and 6th Lady), then her daughter (the 11th Baroness and 7th Lady), and then her son (the 12th Baron and 8th Lord), who is the current holder of the titles.

This is the reverse side. The current form of the national flag of the Slovak Republic () was adopted by Slovakia's Constitution, which came into force on 3 September 1992. The flag, in common with many other flags of Slavic nations, uses Pan-Slavic colors ‚Äì red, white and blue. It is defaced with Slovakia's national arms. History Slovakia's flag in its current form (but with another coat of arms on it or without any arms) can be dated back to the revolutionary year 1848 (see: The Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas). It was also used semi-officially in Czechoslovakia before World War II, by the Slovak Republic during World War II. In 1990, the Interior Ministry tasked Ladislav ƒåis√°rik, a painter and heraldic artist, and Ladislav Vrtel, an expert in heraldry, with creating a new coat of arms and national flag. ƒåis√°rik and Vrtel based their designs for a modern coat of arms and flag on an existing 14th Century coat of arms. However, ƒåis√°rik and Vrtel chose to enlarge the double cross three times to emphasize it as a national symbol. In addition to the national coat of arms and the national flag, the duo also designed a new presidential standard, which incorporates the double cross as well. The new flag was finally adopted (initially without ƒåis√°rik's and Vrtel's coat of arms) on 1 March 1990 as the flag of the Slovak Republic within Czechoslovakia. The coat of arms was added on 3 September 1992 and a special law describing the details of the flag followed in February 1993. Design Since the Slovak flag without the coat of arms is identical to the current flag of the Russian Federation, and can also be compared to the modern flag of Slovenia, the Constitution of Slovakia added the national coat of arms in September 1992. It is one of 28 national flags that contain overtly Christian symbols.

The orange line is the India‚ÄìPakistan border. The Indo-Gangetic Plain, also known as the Indus-Ganga Plain and the North Indian River Plain, is a fertile plain encompassing northern regions of the Indian subcontinent, including most of northern and eastern India, the eastern parts of Pakistan, virtually all of Bangladesh and southern plains of Nepal. The region is named after the Indus and the Ganges rivers and encompasses a number of large urban areas. The plain is bound on the north by the Himalayas, which feed its numerous rivers and are the source of the fertile alluvium deposited across the region by the two river systems. The southern edge of the plain is marked by the Chota Nagpur Plateau. On the west rises the Iranian Plateau. History The region is known for the Indus Valley Civilization, which was responsible for the birth of ancient culture of the Indian subcontinent. The flat and fertile terrain has facilitated the repeated rise and expansion of various empires, including the Maurya Empire, Kushan Empire, Gupta Empire, Pala Empire, Imperial Kannauj, Delhi Sultanates, the Mughal Empire and Maratha Empire ‚Äì all of which had their demographic and political centers in the Indo-Gangetic plain. During the Vedic and Epic eras of Indian history, this region was referred to as \\"Aryavarta\\" (Land of the Aryans). According to Manusm·πõti (2.22), 'Aryavarta' is \\"the tract between the Himalaya and the Vindhya ranges, from the Eastern Sea (Bay of Bengal) to the Western Sea (Arabian Sea)\\".Michael Cook (2014), Ancient Religions, Modern Politics: The Islamic Case in Comparative Perspective, Princeton University Press, p. 68: \\"Aryavarta ... is defined by Manu as extending from the Himalayas in the north to the Vindhyas of Central India in the south and from the sea in the west to the sea in the east.\\" The region is also referred to as \\"Hindustan\\" or the Land of the Hindus, as mentioned in the Sanskrit shloka in Vishnu Purana: ‡§π‡§ø‡§Æ‡§æ‡§≤‡§Ø‡§Ç ‡§∏‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∞‡§≠‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§µ‡§§‡•ç ‡§á‡§Ç‡§¶‡•Å ‡§∏‡§∞‡•á‡§æ‡§µ‡§∞‡§Æ‡•ç ‡§§‡§Ç ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡§®‡§ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§ø‡§§‡§Ç ‡§¶‡•á‡§∂‡§Ç ‡§π‡§ø‡§Ç‡§¶‡•Å‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§æ‡§®‡§Ç ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ö‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§§‡•á \\"Starting from Himalayas and extending upto Indian Ocean, this nation created by God is known as Hindusthanam\\". The suffix -stan , in the term Hindustan is variation of the Sanskrit word Sthanam which means \\"land\\". The term was later used to refer to the whole of the Indian subcontinent. The term \\"Hindustani\\" is also used to refer to the people, music, and culture of the region. Geography A part of the Indo-Gangetic Plain over Northern, Central and Eastern India as well as Bangladesh The Indo-Gangetic Plain is divided into two drainage basins by the Delhi Ridge; the western part drains to the Indus, and the eastern part consists of the Ganga‚ÄìBrahmaputra drainage systems. This divide is only 350 metres above sea level, causing the perception that the Indo-Gangetic Plain appears to be continuous from Sindh in the west to Bengal and Assam in the east. A thin strip between the foothills of the Himalayas and the plain, the Bhabar is a region of porous ground consisting of boulders and pebbles that have washed down from the mountains. It is not suitable for crops and is forested. The streams disappear underground here. Below the Bhabar lie the grasslands of Terai and Dooars.Dinerstein, E., Loucks, C. (2001). The many tributaries of the Indus and Ganges divide the plain into doabs, tongues of land that extend to where the tributaries meet. Close to the rivers is khadar land of new alluvium that is subject to flooding. Above the flood limit, bangar land is older alluvium deposited in the middle Pleistocene. The annual rainfall increases from west towards the east. The Lower Ganges Plains and the Assam Valley are more verdant than the middle Ganga plain. The lower Ganga is centered in West Bengal, from which it flows into Bangladesh. After joining the Jamuna, a distributary of Brahmaputra, both rivers form the Ganges Delta. The Brahmaputra rises in Tibet as the Yarlung Zangbo River and flows through Arunachal Pradesh and Assam, before crossing into Bangladesh. Some geographers subdivide the Indo-Gangetic Plain into several parts: the Gujarat, Sindh, Punjab, Doab, Rohilkhand, Awadh, Bihar, Bengal and Assam regions. Roughly, the Indo-Gangetic Plain stretches across: : the Jammu Plains in the north; : the Punjab Plains in eastern Pakistan and northwestern India; : the Sindh Plains in southern Pakistan; : the Indus Delta in southern Pakistan and western India; : the Ganga-Yamuna Doab; : the Rohilkhand (Katehr) Plains; : the Awadh Plains; : the Purvanchal Plains; : the Bihar Plains; : the North Bengal plains; : the Ganges Delta in India and Bangladesh; : and the Brahmaputra Valley in the east. The fertile Terai region is spread across Southern Nepal and Northern India along the foothills of the Himalayas. The rivers encompassed are the Beas, the Chambal, the Chenab, the Ganga, the Gomti, the Indus, the Ravi, the Sutlej and the Yamuna. The soil is rich in silt, making the plain one of the most intensely farmed areas of the world. Even rural areas here are densely populated. The Indus‚ÄìGanga plains, also known as the \\"Great Plains\\", are large floodplains of the Indus, Ganga and the Brahmaputra river systems. They run parallel to the Himalaya mountains, from Jammu and Kashmir and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the west to Assam in the east and draining most of Northern and Eastern India. The plains encompass an area of and vary in width through their length by several hundred kilometres. The major rivers of this system are the Ganga and the Indus along with their tributaries; Beas, Yamuna, Gomti, Ravi, Chambal, Sutlej and Chenab. The Indus-Ganga belt is the world's most extensive expanse of uninterrupted alluvium formed by the deposition of silt by the numerous rivers. The plains are flat and mostly treeless, making it conducive for irrigation through canals. The area is also rich in ground water sources.The plains are the world's most intensely farmed areas. The main crops grown are rice and wheat that are grown in rotation. Others include maize, sugarcane and cotton. The Indo-Gangetic plains rank among the world's most densely populated areas with a total population exceeding 400 million. Fauna Until recent history, the open grasslands of the Indus-Ganga Plain were inhabited by several large species of animal. The open plains were home to large numbers of herbivores which included all three of the Asian rhinoceros (Indian rhinoceros, Javan rhinoceros, Sumatran rhinoceros). The open grasslands were in many ways similar to the landscape of modern Africa. Gazelle, buffalo, rhinos, elephants, lions, and hippo roamed the grasslands as they do in Africa today. Large herds of Indian elephants, gazelles, antelopes and horses lived alongside several species of wild cattle including the now-extinct aurochs. In the forested areas there were several species of wild pig, deer and muntjac. In the wetter regions close to the Ganga, there would have been large herds of water buffalo grazing on the riverbanks along with extinct species of hippopotamus. So many large animals would have supported a large population of predators as well. Indian wolves, dholes, striped hyenas, Asiatic cheetahs and Asiatic lions would have hunted large game on the open plains, while Bengal tigers and leopards would stalk prey in the surrounding woods and sloth bears hunt for termites in both of these areas. In the Ganges there were large concentrations of gharial, mugger crocodile and river dolphin controlling fish stocks and the occasional migrating herd crossing the river. Agriculture Farming on the Indus-Ganga Plain primarily consists of rice and wheat grown in rotation. Other crops include maize, sugarcane, and cotton. The main source of rainfall is the southwest monsoon which is normally sufficient for general agriculture. The many rivers flowing out of the Himalayas provide water for major irrigation works. Due to a rapidly growing population (as well as other factors), this area is considered at high risk for water shortages in the future. The area constitutes the land between the Brahmaputra River and the Aravalli Range. The Ganga and other rivers such as the Yamuna, the Ghaghara and the Chambal flow through the area. Administrative divisions Because it is not fully possible to define the boundaries of the Indo-Gangetic Plain, it is also difficult to give an exact list of which administrative areas are part of the plain. The areas that are completely or more than half in the plain are: *Bangladesh (Excluding the Chittagong Hill Tracts) *Bhutan (Only southern fringes of the country bordering India) *India **Arunachal Pradesh (The southern fringes bordering Assam) **Assam (The Brahmaputra and Barak Valley) **Bihar (Almost entirely) **Chandigarh **Delhi (Almost entirely) **Haryana **Himachal Pradesh (Una district and the southern fringes bordering Punjab and Haryana) **Jammu and Kashmir (3 southernmost districts of the Jammu Division) **Madhya Pradesh (Gird Region Including the Chambal division) **Punjab **Rajasthan (Sri Ganganagar and Hanumangarh districts) **Uttarakhand (Terai Region encompassing Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar districts) **Uttar Pradesh (Excluding the Chitrakoot division) **West Bengal (Excluding the Darjeeling Himalayan hill region) *Nepal **Nepalese Terai *Pakistan **Balochistan (Kacchi Plains) **Punjab (Excluding Salt Range and Cholistan desert) **Sindh (Excluding the Kirthar Range and the Thar desert) **Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (Derajat region and the Peshawar Valley) See also * Doab * Aryavarta * Ecoregions: Lower and Upper Gangetic Plains moist deciduous forests, Terai- Duar savanna and grasslands, Northwestern thorn scrub forest.

The flag day is celebrated on November 24, which is the day it was officially adopted. Design and symbolism The flag of Tajikistan is a tricolour of red, white, and green. The red represents the unity of the nation as well as victory and sunrise. The red also serves as symbolism of the former Russian and Soviet eras, the workers, and the warriors who sacrificed their lives to protect the land. The white represents purity, morality, the snow and ice of the mountains, and cotton.cotton, traditionally the main export commodity of the economy of Tajikistan, accounted for 13% of Tajikistan's exports in 2012 (now the second most important export category, behind aluminum at 55%). The green represents the bountiful generosity of nature, fertile valleys, the religion of Islam, and the celebration of Novruz. Other interpretations of the colours state that the flag symbolically unifies the people of Tajik society, with the red stripe representing the manual labour class, the white stripe representing the intellectual worker class, and the green representing the agricultural class living in Tajikistan's rural or mountainous regions. While the red and green stripes on the top and bottom are equal in size, the center stripe is one-and-a-half times that of the others. The crown and stars are set in a rectangle taking up 80% of the white stripe's height. The crown represents the Tajik people, as the name Tajik is connected with Persian t√¢j \\"crown\\" in popular etymology.The actual etymology of the name is unknown; it derives from a medieval exonym applied to a people of the Transoxania region, used to refer to either \\"Arabs\\" or \\"Persians\\"; according to the Library of Congress's 1997 Country Study of Tajikistan, it is difficult to definitively state the origins of the word 'Tajik' because the term is \\"embroiled in twentieth-century political disputes about whether Turkic or Iranian peoples were the original inhabitants of Central Asia.\\" Library of Congress Call Number DK851 .K34 1997. The supposed connection of Tajik with tajvar \\"crowned\\" can be traced to 1990 (Echo of Islam, Issues 183-193, Ministry of Islamic Guidance, 2000, p. 54). The flag design being based on this etymology was reported in Alfred Znamierowski, The world encyclopedia of flags, Hermes House, 2002, p. 169. The flag of Tajikistan features seven stars due to the significance of the number seven in Tajik traditional legends, representing perfection and happiness. According to traditional belief, the heavens feature seven mountains and seven orchard gardens with a star shining above each mountain. Presidential standard The Standard of the President of Tajikistan was introduced in 2006, on the occasion of the inauguration ceremony for the third term of Emomali Rahmon as head of state. It uses the Tajik tricolour charged with a depiction of the Derafsh KƒÅviƒÅn, the Sassanid royal standard. Inside the Derafsh KƒÅviƒÅn is a depiction of a winged lion against a blue sky under a smaller representation of the crown and seven stars.Based on a Russian-language description of the flag posted at president.tj in 2006 (archived version from 2007). The center of the standard features elements formerly used as symbols of Tajikistan in the Emblem of Tajikistan. The presidential standard also includes a star in each of the four corners to represent the four regions of Tajikistan. Historical flags The flag of Tajikistan under the Soviet Union in use from 1953‚Äì1991. Under Soviet rule, the Union Republic used a flag derived from the flag of the Soviet Union and representing Communism, that was approved in 1953. ' The flag is similar to the Soviet Union design but with the addition of a white and a green stripe. This flag also contains the red-white-green color order where the white stripe is larger than the green, which is currently used in the national flag. As a Soviet republic, the red symbolized the workers' revolution, the white symbolized cotton, and the green symbolized agriculture. This design was the backside of the Soviet Tajik flag before independence and afterwards was used as the national flag from 1991‚Äì1992. The Soviet era flag was two-sided. Its backside was a mirror of the obverse face without the hammer, sickle, and star. Following independence on September 9, 1991, Tajikistan adopted its first post-independence flag by removing the Soviet symbolism from the canton, making the national flag identical to the backside of the Soviet era flag. This design remained in use until the new Tajik flag was adopted, making Tajikistan the last former Soviet country to receive a new flag.

Adopted in 1875 after being officially enshrined into the nation's constitution, it has been the flag of the Kingdom of Tonga since that year. The constitution stipulates that the national flag can never be changed. History The British first arrived in Tonga in the late-18th century, when Captain James Cook made three visits to the islands between 1773 and 1777. Approximately fifty years later, English Wesleyan Methodist missionaries came to Tonga and began converting the islanders to Christianity. In 1831, they succeeded in converting \\"paramount chief\\" Taufa'ahau Tupou, who became King George Tupou I in 1845. It was during this time (circa 1840s) that the first Tongan flag was adopted. It consisted of a white field with a cross (either red or blue in colour) at all four corners, and the letters \\"A\\" (in red) and \\"M\\" (in blue) at the centre that symbolise the king. ' Upon his accession to the throne, the king sought to design a new flag for the nation, one that would represent Christianity. He befriended Shirley Waldemar Baker ‚Äì a member of the United Kingdom's Tongan mission who later became the Prime Minister of Tonga ‚Äì and they worked together to formulate a new flag, coat of arms and national anthem for Tonga. The new design resembled the British Red Ensign, in that three-quarters of it consisted of a simple red field, with a \\"distinctive canton\\" featured in the upper hoist section; this was first used in 1866. A new constitution for the kingdom was formulated and proclaimed on 4 November 1875. It \\"codified\\" the new flag design, and marks when it was adopted as the national flag. Under Article 47 of the Constitution, the flag can \\"never be altered\\" and \\"shall always be the flag\\" of Tonga. Design=Symbolism The colours and symbols of the flag carry cultural, political, and regional meanings. The red couped cross alludes to Christianity, the religion practised by approximately 97% of the country's population. It is one of 28 national flags to contain overtly Christian symbols. The white epitomises purity, while the red evokes the sacrifice of the Blood of Christ, which he shed during his Crucifixion. Similarities The previous design of the flag featured a plain white field charged with the red couped cross. However, it was later discovered that this flag was almost identical to the emblem of the International Red Cross, which had been adopted in 1863. As a result of this finding, the Tongan flag was set at the canton of a red field instead, leading to the present design of the flag. The previous design, nonetheless, remains a national symbol of Tonga. The current flag of Tonga also has some similarities with the flags of Switzerland and Georgia.

Placed upon a green field is a symbolic representation of the country's famous carpet industry. It was introduced as the flag of Turkmenistan on September 27, 1992 to replace the Soviet-era flag which consisted of a red background with two light blue bars in the middle. The modified version with a 2:3 ratio was adopted on January 24, 2001. State Flag and Constitution Day is celebrated on 18 May. Description The flag on a Turkmenistan postage stamp, 1992. It features a green field with a vertical red stripe near the hoist side, containing five carpet guls (designs used in producing rugs) stacked above two crossed olive branches similar to those on the flag of the United Nations; a white waxing crescent moon, typical of Turkic and Islamic symbology, and five white five- pointed stars appear in the upper corner of the field just to the fly side of the red stripe. The green and red colors appear in this flag because they have been venerated historically by the Turkmen. The waxing crescent moon symbolizes the hope of the country for a shining future and the stars represent the five provinces (welayatlar) of Turkmenistan ‚Äì Ahal, Balkan, Dashoguz, Lebap, and Mary. The five traditional carpet designs along the hoist make the flag of Turkmenistan the most complex national flag design in the world. They represent the five major tribes or houses, and form motifs in the country's state emblem and flag. These Turkmen tribes in traditional order (as well as top to bottom) are Teke (Tekke), Yomut (Yomud), Saryk (Saryq), Chowdur (Choudur), and Arsary (Ersary). The middle design may also represent the Salyr (Salor), a tribe that declined as a result of military defeat before the modern period. The wreath was added against the rules of heraldry, breaking up the carpet pattern. It was added as an afterthought to represent the \\"status of permanent neutrality\\", which was accepted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 12, 1995.

Before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Turkmenistan had a flag similar to all other Soviet Republics; see Flag of the Turkmen SSR. After independence in 1991, Turkmenistan adopted a flag very similar to the current design, on February 19, 1992. However, the designs on the left were different. In 1997, an olive branch was added to symbolise the peace-loving nature of the Turkmen people. The positioning of the crescent and stars was also changed, with the crescent positioned roughly to its current position but with the stars in a much more uneven position. In 2001 the flag changed from 1:2 to 2:3 and the green field was made lighter.http://flagspot.net/flags/tm.html Military flags All flags of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Turkmenistan mimic the Soviet era designs.

Best known as co-founder of the Waffle, on whose behalf he ran for the leadership of the New Democratic Party in 1971, he is the author of more than two dozen books, mostly on Canadian political economy and history. Early life and family Laxer was born in Montreal, Quebec, on 22 December 1941 and was the son of Edna May (n√©e Quentin) and Robert Laxer, a psychologist, professor, author, and political activist. His father was Jewish and his mother was from a Protestant family. Both were members of the Communist Party of Canada and its public face, the Labor-Progressive Party, with Robert Laxer being a national organizer for the party. The Laxers left the party, along with many other members, following Khrushchev's Secret Speech revealing Joseph Stalin's crimes, and the 1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary. James Laxer wrote about his experiences growing up during this period in his memoir Red Diaper Baby: A Boyhood in the Age of McCarthyism. His father came to serve as a significant influence on his political worldview. His paternal grandfather was a rabbi and his maternal grandfather was a minister and Christian missionary to China, where Laxer's mother was born. His brother, Gordon Laxer, would become a political economist, author, and founder of the Parkland Institute. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Toronto and Master of Arts (following approval of his thesis French-Canadian Newspapers and Imperial Defence, 1899‚Äì1914 in 1967) and Doctor of Philosophy degrees from Queen's University. He was an active student journalist both at The Varsity at the University of Toronto and later at the Queen's Journal and was elected president of Canadian University Press in 1965. Laxer married three times. He married Diane Taylor in 1965, from whom he was divorced in 1969. He married Krista M√§eots in 1969 with whom he would have two children: Michael and Katherine (known as \\"Kate\\"). They were separated at the time of her death in 1978. Laxer married Sandra Price in 1979 with whom he would have two more children: Emily and Jonathan. Political career In 1969, Laxer, along with his father Robert Laxer, Mel Watkins, and others, founded the Waffle, a left- wing group influenced by the New Left, the anti‚ÄìVietnam War movement, and Canadian economic nationalism, that tried to influence the direction of the New Democratic Party (NDP). Laxer was a principal author of their Manifesto for an Independent Socialist Canada in 1969 alongside Ed Broadbent and Gerald Caplan. The manifesto was debated at the 1969 federal NDP convention and was rejected by the delegates in favour of a more moderate declaration. In 1971, Laxer ran for the leadership of the federal NDP and shocked the convention by winning one-third of the vote on the fourth and final ballot against party stalwart David Lewis. The Waffle was ultimately forced out of the NDP and briefly became a political party under the name Movement for an Independent Socialist Canada. Laxer and other Wafflers unsuccessfully ran for Parliament in 1974. This electoral failure led to the Waffle's demise, and Laxer concentrated on his work at York University, where he was a professor of political science for 47 years, and in broadcasting. In 1981, he was hired as director of research for the federal NDP, but left in controversy in 1983 when he published a report critiquing the party's economic policy as being \\"out of date\\".http://www.hansard.gov.yk.ca/25-legislature/003_March15_1984.pdf Academic, writer, and broadcaster Laxer hosted The Real Story, a nightly half-hour current affairs program on TVOntario in the early 1980s. He also variously wrote a column and op-ed pieces for the Toronto Star from the 1980s until shortly before his death, as well as op-ed pieces for The Globe and Mail. He also played \\"Talleyrand\\", a mock political insider, on CBC Radio's Morningside in the 1980s.http://archivesfa.library.yorku.ca/filelist/2003-009.166.pdf Laxer co- wrote and presented the five-part National Film Board documentary series Reckoning: The Political Economy of Canada in 1986, which examined Canada's economic and political relationships with the United States and Canada's place in the changing global economy. Laxer and his co-writer won a Gemini Award in 1988 for Best Writing in an Information/Documentary Program or Series for episode one of Reckoning titled \\"In Bed with an Elephant\\". The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation refused to air the series due to its critical view of free trade with the United States, which was being negotiated at the time, and it aired instead on TVOntario and other educational channels in Canada as well as a number of PBS stations in the United States. A democratic socialist, Laxer believed that Canadian economic nationalism was a progressive force against the United States and American imperialism. He wrote extensively about the influence of American multinational corporations in the Canadian economy, particularly in the oil and gas industry, and his agitation helped lead to the creation of Petro-Canada. The creation of the Foreign Investment Review Agency, and the Canadian Development Corporation in the 1970s is also attributed in part to the work of Laxer, Watkins, and the Waffle. In the 1980s he strongly opposed the adoption of the Canada‚ÄìUS Free Trade Agreement, though he still believed that free trade agreements were capable of being used to the advantage of the political left through the entrenchment of social charters. Laxer died suddenly and unexpectedly in Paris of heart-related problems on 23 February 2018 while in Europe researching a book on Canada's role in the Second World War.

The flag of Uganda (Luganda: Bendera ya Uganda) was adopted on 9 October 1962, the date that Uganda became independent from the British Empire. It consists of six equal horizontal bands of black (top), yellow, red, black, yellow, and red (bottom); a white disc is superimposed at the centre and depicts the national symbol, a grey crowned crane, facing the hoist side. During the colonial era the British used a British Blue ensign defaced with the colonial badge, as prescribed in 1865 regulations. Buganda, the largest of the traditional kingdoms in the colony of Uganda, had its own flag. However, in order to avoid appearing to give preference to one region of the colony over any other, the British colonial authorities selected the crane emblem for use on the Blue ensign and other official banners. History When the Democratic Party ruled the country, a design for flag was proposed. It had vertical stripes of green- blue-green, separated by narrower yellow stripes, and in the centre had the silhouette of a yellow crane. After the party lost the national elections on 25 April 1962 the newly elected Uganda People's Congress (UPC) rejected the former design and instead proposed the current design. It was based on the flag of UPC ‚Äì a tricolour having horizontal strips of red, yellow and black. The British administration gave their approval to this before the country's independence. The flag was designed by the Ugandan Minister of Justice, Grace Ibingira. Symbolism The three colours are representative of Native ethnic groups of Africa (black), Africa's sunshine (yellow), and African brotherhood (red being the colour of blood, through which all Africans are connected). The grey crowned crane is fabled for its gentle nature and was also the military badge of Ugandan soldiers during British rule. The raised leg of the crane symbolises the forward movement of the country.

He served as an official of the state of Eastern Wu during the Three Kingdoms period of China. Born in the late Eastern Han dynasty, Zhang Zhao started his career as a scholar in his native Xu Province before the chaos towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty forced him to flee south to the Jiangdong (or Wu) region for shelter. In Jiangdong, Zhang Zhao became an adviser to the rising warlord Sun Ce. After Sun Ce's death in the year 200, Zhang Zhao played a key supporting role to Sun Ce's younger brother and successor, Sun Quan, as he consolidated power and his control over the Jiangdong territories. In 208, Zhang Zhao strongly urged Sun Quan to surrender to Cao Cao, a rival warlord, because he believed that they stood no chance against an impending invasion by Cao Cao. However, Sun Quan refused to listen to Zhang Zhao and instead heeded the advice of Lu Su and Zhou Yu. Sun Quan's forces ultimately scored a decisive victory over Cao Cao at the Battle of Red Cliffs in the winter of 208. From 200 until his death in 236, Zhang Zhao served under Sun Quan through the collapse of the Eastern Han dynasty and into the Three Kingdoms period after Sun Quan became the founding emperor of the Eastern Wu state. Throughout his career, Zhang Zhao was known for being a stern, uncompromising and intimidating figure who commanded respect from both his colleagues and Sun Quan. Despite Zhang Zhao's seniority and experience, Sun Quan passed him over twice as a candidate for the position of Imperial Chancellor in 222 and 225 as he believed that Zhang Zhao was so headstrong and stubborn that he would not be able to effectively lead the administration. Nevertheless, Sun Quan paid his due respects to Zhang Zhao as a mentor-like figure who saw him through his formative years to his accession to the throne. Early life Zhang Zhao was born in the late Eastern Han dynasty in the Pengcheng State (), a principality in Xu Province centred around present-day Xuzhou, Jiangsu.(ÂºµÊò≠Â≠óÂ≠êÂ∏ÉÔºåÂΩ≠Âüé‰∫∫‰πü„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 52. As a youth, he was known for being diligent in his studies and for specialising in the clerical script style of calligraphy.

Sometime later, when Tao Qian, the Governor of Xu Province, nominated Zhang Zhao as a maocai (ËåÇÊâç; outstanding candidate) to serve in the government, Zhang Zhao declined the offer again. Tao Qian perceived Zhang Zhao's rejection as an insult, so he ordered the latter's arrest.

Service under Sun Ce When chaos broke out throughout China in the 190s, many people living in Xu Province fled their homes and crossed the Yangtze River to take shelter in Yang Province (or the Jiangdong region) in the south.

Between 194 and 199, the warlord Sun Ce conquered the territories in Jiangdong and established his own regime in the region. During this time, he heard of Zhang Zhao and wanted to recruit him as an adviser. After Zhang Zhao agreed and joined him, he was so delighted that he told Zhang Zhao: \\"Now that I have expanded my domain in all the four corners, I should treat learned and virtuous men with the utmost respect. I won't treat you in any degrading manner.\\" He then appointed Zhang Zhao as a Colonel () and honoured him like a teacher.(Âê≥Êõ∏Êõ∞ÔºöÁ≠ñÂæóÊò≠ÁîöÊÅ±ÔºåË¨ÇÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂêæÊñπÊúâ‰∫ãÂõõÊñπÔºå‰ª•Â£´‰∫∫Ë≥¢ËÄÖ‰∏äÔºåÂêæÊñºÂ≠ê‰∏çÂæóËºïÁü£„ÄÇ„Äç‰πÉ‰∏äÁÇ∫Ê†°Â∞âÔºåÂæÖ‰ª•Â∏´Âèã‰πãÁ¶Æ„ÄÇ) Wu Shu annotation Sanguozhi vol. 52.

Zhang Zhao told him: Sun Quan's biography in the Sanguozhi recorded that Zhang Zhao told the young Sun Quan: Sun Quan heeded Zhang Zhao's advice.

He also noted that Liu Biao, the Governor of Jing Province, was incapable of defending his domain, so it would be better for Sun Quan to seize Jing Province before Cao Cao could do so.

When they encountered animals who left their packs/herds and came very close to the chariot, Sun Quan got out and took pleasure in hand-to-hand combat with the animal.

This event marked the beginning of the Three Kingdoms period in China. In September 221, Sun Quan pledged nominal allegiance to Cao Pi and agreed to become a vassal of Wei. In return, Cao Pi sent an emissary, Xing Zhen (), to confer the title \\"King of Wu\\" () on Sun Quan. On 23 September that year, when Xing Zhen arrived at Wuchang (Ê≠¶Êòå; present-day Ezhou, Hubei), the capital of Sun Quan's domain, for the conferment ceremony, he did not dismount from his carriage when he reached the city gates.(È≠èÈªÉÂàù‰∫åÂπ¥ÔºåÈÅ£‰ΩøËÄÖÈÇ¢Ë≤ûÊãúÊ¨äÁÇ∫Âê≥Áéã„ÄÇË≤ûÂÖ•ÈñÄÔºå‰∏ç‰∏ãËªä„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 52.

Pei Songzhi, in his annotations to Zhang Zhao's biography in the Sanguozhi, argued that Zhang Zhao had never intended to help Sun Ce or Sun Quan become rulers in their own right; all he desired was to assist them in bringing peace to the common people living under their control. When he saw that Cao Cao had pacified northern China and conquered Jing Province just before the Battle of Red Cliffs, he advised Sun Quan to surrender to Cao Cao because he saw that as an opportunity for the fragmented Han Empire to be reunified under Cao Cao's control. If the Han Empire were reunified, there would be no more conflicts among the warlords, and the common people would finally be able to live in peace. Pei Songzhi thus concluded that although Zhang Zhao may not be considered loyal towards Sun Quan, he had the greater interests of the common people at heart.(Ëá£Êùæ‰πã‰ª•ÁÇ∫ÂºµÊò≠Âã∏ËøéÊõπÂÖ¨ÔºåÊâÄÂ≠òË±à‰∏çÈÅ†‰πéÔºüÂ§´ÂÖ∂Êèö‰ºëÊ≠£Ëâ≤ÔºåÂßîË≥™Â≠´Ê∞èÔºåË™†‰ª•ÂéÑÈÅãÂàùÈÅòÔºåÂ°óÁÇ≠ÊñπÂßãÔºåËá™Á≠ñÂèäÊ¨äÔºåÊâçÁï•Ë∂≥ËºîÔºåÊòØ‰ª•Áõ°Ë™†Âå°ÂººÔºå‰ª•ÊàêÂÖ∂Ê•≠Ôºå‰∏äËó©Êº¢ÂÆ§Ôºå‰∏ã‰øùÊ∞ëÁâ©ÔºõÈºéÂ≥ô‰πãË®àÔºåÊú¨ÈùûÂÖ∂Âøó‰πü„ÄÇÊõπÂÖ¨‰ªóÈ†ÜËÄåËµ∑ÔºåÂäü‰ª•Áæ©Á´ãÔºåÂÖæ‰ª•Ê∏Ö‰∏ÄË´∏ËèØÔºåÊãìÂπ≥ËçäÈÉ¢ÔºåÂ§ßÂÆö‰πãÊ©üÔºåÂú®ÊñºÊ≠§ÊúÉ„ÄÇËã•‰ΩøÊò≠Ë≠∞Áç≤ÂæûÔºåÂâáÂÖ≠ÂêàÁÇ∫‰∏ÄÔºåË±àÊúâÂÖµÈÄ£Á¶çÁµêÔºåÈÅÇÁÇ∫Êà∞Âúã‰πãÂºäÂìâÔºÅÈõñÁÑ°ÂäüÊñºÂ≠´Ê∞èÔºåÊúâÂ§ßÁï∂ÊñºÂ§©‰∏ãÁü£„ÄÇÊòîÁ´áËûçÊ≠∏Êº¢ÔºåËàáÂúãÂçáÈôçÔºõÂºµÈ≠ØÈôçÈ≠èÔºåË≥ûÂª∂‰∫é‰∏ñ„ÄÇÊ≥ÅÊ¨äËàâÂÖ®Âê≥ÔºåÊúõÈ¢®È†ÜÊúçÔºåÂØµÈùà‰πãÂéöÔºåÂÖ∂ÂèØÊ∏¨ÈáèÂìâÔºÅÁÑ∂ÂâáÊò≠ÁÇ∫‰∫∫Ë¨ÄÔºåË±à‰∏çÂø†‰∏îÊ≠£‰πéÔºÅ) Pei Songzhi's annotation Sanguozhi vol. 52.

When Sun Quan ultimately sent Zhang Mi and Xu Yan to Liaodong, Zhang Zhao felt so frustrated with the emperor for not heeding his advice that he claimed that he was sick and refused to show up in the imperial court. An angry Sun Quan then ordered the entrance of Zhang Zhao's residence to be sealed by piling up earth in front of it to block people from entering or leaving. In response, Zhang Zhao also ordered his servants to pile up earth too and block the entrance from the inside.(ÁÑ∂ÂçíÈÅ£ÂΩå„ÄÅÊôèÂæÄ„ÄÇÊò≠ÂøøË®Ä‰πã‰∏çÁî®ÔºåÁ®±Áñæ‰∏çÊúù„ÄÇÊ¨äÊÅ®‰πãÔºåÂúüÂ°ûÂÖ∂ÈñÄÔºåÊò≠ÂèàÊñºÂÖß‰ª•ÂúüÂ∞Å‰πã„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 52.

He was loyal, outspoken and upright; his actions were not for his own interests. However, he was feared because he was too stern, and he was shunned by others because he liked to assume the moral high ground. He was given neither the role of a chancellor nor an imperial tutor. Instead, he had a rather unimpressive career and spent his old age in retirement.

The practice of inverting the entire escutcheon of an armiger found guilty of high treason has been attested since the Middle Ages and is generally accepted as reliable, and medieval heraldic sources cite at least one instance of removing an honourable charge from a coat of arms by royal decree as an abatement of honour. Other abatements of honour implied by the addition of dishonourable stains and charges, appearing in late 16th-century texts, have never been reliably attested in actual practice. Additionally, as many heraldic writers note, the use of arms is not compulsory, so armigers are more likely to relinquish a dishonored coat of arms than to advertise their dishonor. Inverted arms The earliest mention in heraldic writing of a dishonorable display of arms (and, according to Fox-Davies, the only one reliably attested in actual use; see historical examples below) was inverting the entire shield, first documented by Johannes de Bado Aureo in his heraldic treatise Tractatus de armis (c. 1394). Contemporary accounts of executions for treason describe the traitor being marched to his execution in a paper tabard displaying his inverted arms, and other accounts tell of displaying the inverted arms of prisoners, released on parole, who refuse to pay their ransom. Note that inverted arms can also indicate the death of the holder, and do not necessarily indicate dishonour. Theoretical abatements Eight other abatements were introduced in the late 16th century, each prescribing a specific charge in a specific stain for a specific offense; though the charges themselves were uncommon but no less honourable than any other charge (if colored in any standard tincture or fur), it was only when displayed in the prescribed position and stain that these charges were supposed to be considered dishonourable. Leigh (1562) enumerated the nine abatements thus: #Point dexter parted tenn√©, for false claims of valor #Point champaine tenn√©, for killing a prisoner who has demanded quarter #Plain point sanguine, for one who lies to his sovereign #Point in point sanguine, for cowardice #Gusset sanguine borne to dexter, for adultery, or to sinister for a drunkard [a truncation of the shield] #Gore sinister tenn√©, for cowardice in the face of the enemy #Delf [shovelful of earth] tenn√©, for revoking a challenge #Inescutcheon reversed sanguine, for any man who \\"discourteously entreateth eyther maid or widow against her will, or flieth from his Soveraignes banner\\"Leigh, G. The Accedence of Armory, 1st ed. (London:1562). Quoted in Woodcock (1988), p.68. #The entire escutcheon inverted, for treason Scottish herald Thomas Innes of Learney mentioned abatements in marital situations: \\"The law of arms provides for abating the arms of an adulterer by two gussets sanguine, and where the bearing of arms is necessary this, and one gusset (they will be close-gussets) for non-adulterous divorcees, are, at least in Patents, applied in the case of divorcees.\\" Several notable modern heraldists have asserted that the execution of this system of abatements has never been attested in fact, and that the whole system was in all likelihood a theoretical exercise created by heralds for the purpose of discouraging armigers from committing dishonourable acts. Breaking or erasing charges A lion couard is said to denote dishonor or cowardice. As another form of abatement, some coats of arms were reportedly modified through breaking or cutting, reversing, or altogether erasing some existing charges, at least as they occur in patents, though the armiger's actual display of these defaced arms has not been documented and is unlikely. In French heraldry the term diffam√© is used to denote a lion or other animal whose tail is cut off, or may refer more broadly to arms which have been altered to signify loss of honor. A lion with its tail between its hind legs is termed \\"couard\\" (coward), and has also been cited as a mark of infamy. Though lions are traditionally depicted with male genitals, a recent trend toward omitting the genitals has been controversial, prodding claims that emasculated lions have also been an historical form of abatement. Commenting on the newly castrated lion in the arms of the Nordic Battle Group in 2007, Vladimir Sagerlund, heraldic artist at the Swedish National Archives since 1994, was critical of the politically motivated decision, stating, \\"once upon a time coats of arms containing lions without genitalia were given to those who betrayed the Crown.\\" The Times in London, however, noted a growing recent trend toward heraldic \\"castration\\", pointing to the lions passant on the royal coat of arms of England, as well as the lions rampant on those of Norway, Finland, Belgium, Luxembourg and Scotland, all of which have recently been depicted without genitals; in conclusion, The Times wrote, \\"some crests are ambiguous, but the message remains clear: the lions are supposed to display courage and nothing else.\\" While such arms are clearly not intended as an abatement in modern times, no known examples of castrated lions have been found in medieval heraldry. Reported historical examples A few examples of historical abatements of arms have been recorded, though none of these reflect the addition of stained ordinaries as detailed above. Rather, these include broken chevrons, disarmed lions, and reversed or erased charges. One of these rare historical examples was Amery of Pavy, who was appointed governor of Calais by King Edward III of England in 1347, and whose arms were abated by royal decree in 1349 after the failed French siege of Calais on the last day of December 1348, which resulted from Sir Amery's attempt to sell Calais to Sir Geffrey Charney, the French governor of nearby Saint-Omer, for 20,000 crowns. As stated by Sir George Mackenzie: \\"And Edward the Third of England ordained two of six stars which a gentleman had in his arms to be effaced, because he had sold a seaport of which he was made governor.\\" Pursuivant of arms John Guillim, writing circa 1610, gave the story in considerable detail, adding that Sir Amery's arms were also inverted for his treachery. Guillim further explained that this humiliation is not inherited by the traitor's heirs, up to and including capital crimes, except in cases of high treason. An example of a lion diffam√©e is that of Jean d'Avesnes who insulted his mother, Margaret II, Countess of Flanders, in the presence of King Louis IX. He is supposed to have seen the lion in his arms diffam√©e (i.e. the tail removed) and morn√© (i.e. the teeth and claws removed).

He was a son of Cao Cao, a warlord who rose to power towards the end of the Han dynasty and laid the foundation of Wei. Cao Zhang was said to have wrestled and killed wild animals with his bare hands. He also served as a general under his father, having led his troops to significant victories against Wuhuan incursions on the northern frontier. Background The second of Cao Cao's four sons by Lady Bian, Cao Zhang was said to excel and obsessed in archery and armed combat in his youth so much so that he would fight fierce beasts with his bare hands. Though Cao Cao criticised his lack of academic knowledge, Cao Zhang had always aspired to pursue a career in the military. Once, his father sent him to the imperial university to study, but Cao Zhang lamented to his aides, saying a real man should command the army to make a name for himself instead of being a Doctor (ÂçöÂ£´)(‰∏àÂ§´‰∏ÄÁÇ∫Ë°õ„ÄÅÈúçÔºåÂ∞áÂçÅËê¨È®éÈ¶≥Ê≤ôÊº†ÔºåÈ©ÖÊàéÁãÑÔºåÁ´ãÂäüÂª∫ËôüËÄ≥Ôºå‰ΩïËÉΩ‰ΩúÂçöÂ£´ÈÇ™Ôºü) Sanguozhi vol. 19. (a Doctor was both an academic degree and an official appointment in many ancient China dynasties). As a general When the Wuhuan tribe rebelled on the northern frontier in 218, Cao Zhang, holding the rank of Northern General of the Household, acting on the authority of General of the Resolute Cavalry (È©çÈ®éÂ∞áËªç), led a force of 1,000 infantry and several hundreds of cavalry from the central government to suppress the revolt.(Â§èÂõõÊúàÔºå‰ª£ÈÉ°„ÄÅ‰∏äË∞∑ÁÉè‰∏∏ÁÑ°Ëá£Ê∞êÁ≠âÂèõÔºåÈÅ£ÈÑ¢Èôµ‰æØÂΩ∞Ë®éÁ†¥‰πã„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 1. Before his departure, Cao Cao summoned him and specially warned him: \\"We are father and son in home, but we are supervisor and subordinate when assigned a task: the law will be applied straightly if you ever made any mistake, keep this in mind.\\" When Cao Zhang arrived the field, his force had not been joined by that of the local government as planned. Outnumbered by the enemy, Cao Zhang took up a passive stance and defended the vital passes and routes. The rebels could not gain an advantage and dissipated. Cao Zhang then led his force out in pursuit, displaying great valour in the ensuing battles. The Sanguozhi says Cao Zhang personally fought against the enemy soldiers at close quarters and shot down many enemy cavalries with arrows. Several arrows were embedded in his armor by the end of a half-day long battle. Despite opposition from his subordinates, he ordered the pursuit be continued after the initial victory. One of his staff came out and reminded him that Cao Cao's order was that the army could not cross the jurisdiction of Dai, and further pursuit was straightly prohibited,(ÂèàÂèóÁØÄÂ∫¶Ôºå‰∏çÂæóÈÅé‰ª£Ôºå‰∏çÂèØÊ∑±ÈÄ≤) Cao Cao's order was that Cao Zhang's force was restricted to retain within the domain of Dai Commandery, and that a pursuit into deep territory of foreign tribes was prohibited. but Cao Zhang argued that a good general did not follow dull orders, and threatened if anyone did not join the pursuit would be penalised with death sentence; thus, they performed a 24-hour dash to catch up with the Wuhuan cavalry, and dealt the latter a major blow which caused a few thousands casualties. The Xianbei tribe leader Kebineng had led a 10,000-strong cavalry force nearby to observe the ongoing war between the Han dynasty and Wuhuan tribes. Having seen the splendid victories Cao Zhang scored, Kebineng submitted to him. Unrest on the northern frontier was then quelled. Cao Zhang then hurried west to take part in the Hanzhong Campaign against Liu Bei. Upon reaching Chang'an, however, he found out that the war had already been lost. Cao Cao then promoted his son to General of the Elite Cavalry (Ë∂äÈ®éÂ∞áËªç) and left him to defend Chang'an against probable advances of Liu Bei. Death Shortly after returning to Luoyang in 220, Cao Cao fell ill. He died as Cao Zhang was en route to see him. His successor Cao Pi then sent all his brothers, including Cao Zhang, back to their individual fiefdoms, for fear that they might contest his position. In 222, Cao Zhang was enfeoffed as the Prince of Rencheng (‰ªªÂüéÁéã). In the following year, Cao Zhang died due to sickness while attending court at the capital. He received the posthumous title \\"Prince Wei\\" (Â®ÅÁéã), literally meaning awe-inspiring prince. Theory of death There are legends surrounding the death of Cao Zhang. The most famous of these legends is that Cao Zhang was poisoned by Cao Pi. After Cao Cao died, Cao Pi summoned Cao Zhang to the palace to meet him. During a casual conversation, Cao Zhang asked his brother if he could see his imperial seal. This got Cao Pi worried that his brother wanted to usurp his throne so Cao Pi decided to kill him. Cao Pi knew that Cao Zhang was their mother's favourite son, so in order to get away with it, he had to make Cao Zhang's death seem natural. A few weeks later, Cao Pi invited his brother to a game of weiqi during their mother's birthday. The match was very close in the middle game when Cao Pi's servants brought some prunes, some that were poisoned. Cao Pi made sure he ate the unmarked ones that were not poisonous and make sure his brother ate the other ones. When Cao Zhang realised that he had been poisoned, he screamed for help. Empress Bian got to the scene on her bare feet and tried to search for water to flush down the poison that was now in Cao Zhang's body. But unfortunately for Cao Zhang, the crafty Cao Pi had secretly placed all the containers away beforehand and so Empress Bian failed to get the water; Cao Zhang then died at the hands of his own brother. FamilyIn Romance of the Three Kingdoms Romance of the Three Kingdoms, a 14th-century historical novel, is a romanticisation of the events that occurred before and during the Three Kingdoms era. The author probably exaggerated the tension between Cao Zhang and his elder brother Cao Pi just after their father Cao Cao's death. Cao Pi, the eldest surviving son of Cao Cao and the rightful heir, succeeded his late father. However, news came that Cao Zhang, leading a 100,000-strong army from Chang'an, was approaching the capital. Cao Pi was gripped by fear that his brother would contest the heirship with the military power he held. Jia Kui, an adviser to Cao Pi, then volunteered to persuade Cao Zhang to desist. Jia Kui then went out of the city to meet Cao Zhang and ask him if he came as a mourner or a rival claimant to the throne. \\"I come as a mourner with no ulterior motive,\\" replied Cao Zhang. \\"That being so, why bring in your soldiers?\\" Jia Kui said, whereupon Cao Zhang ordered his troops to wait outside the city while he entered alone. When the brothers met, they embraced and wept. Cao Zhang then passed the command of his force to Cao Pi and returned to his own fiefdom. Thus Cao Pi's position was more or less secured.

Adopted in 1991 to replace the flag of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic (SSR), it has been the flag of the Republic of Uzbekistan since the country gained independence in that same year. The design of the present flag was partly inspired by the former one.  Design = Symbolism  The symbolism of the National flag of the Republic of Uzbekistan continues the traditions inherent in the flags of major states and empires that existed in the country while reflecting the natural features of Uzbekistan, the national and cultural identity of the peoples of this Central Asian country. The azure color on the flag is a symbol of blue sky and clear water. Azure is revered in the East. Azure is also the color of the Turkic peoples. The majority of the population of Uzbekistan are Turkic peoples who speak Turkic languages. White is a symbol of peace, purity, and kindness. White also means the ancient religion of Zoroastrianism, which was dominant in the territory of this country before the arrival of Islam. 12 stars on the flag are arranged in such a way that visually they form the inscription Allah in Arabic script Green is a symbol of the diverse and rich nature of the country. Green is also one of the colors of the Holy religion Islam, which is practiced by the majority of the population of Uzbekistan. The red stripes are vital forces pulsating in every living creature, a symbol of life, courage, as well as a symbol of national and religious minorities of Uzbekistan. The Crescent corresponds to the centuries-old tradition of the people of Uzbekistan and is also one of the main symbols of Islam. The Crescent moon and stars are also considered a symbol of a cloudless calm sky and peace. The flag of Uzbekistan has 12 stars. The number 12 means 12 zodiac signs, 12 months of the year, and is also considered a symbol of perfection. In Islam, the number 12 is also important, as in 12 years according to Islam, boys become adults. 12 also means the 12 imams. 12 stars on the flag are arranged in such a way that visually they form the inscription Allah in Arabic script.  Legal protection  On December 27, 2010, President Islam Karimov signed an amendment to the law that strengthened the protection of the country's symbols, including its flag and emblem. It banned the utilization of the flag of Uzbekistan for promotional and commercial purposes, including its usage in advertisements and documents. It also forbade any organizations that are not affiliated with the Uzbek government from adopting logos that resemble the national symbols. '  History  Under Soviet rule, the Union Republic ‚Äì situated in what is now modern-day Uzbekistan ‚Äì utilized a flag derived from the flag of the Soviet Union and representing Communism, that was approved in 1952. ' The flag is similar to the Soviet design but with the blue stripe in 1/5 width and the two 1/100 white edges in between. Uzbekistan declared itself independent on September 1, 1991, approximately three months before the dissolution of the Soviet Union. A search for a national flag began soon after, with a contest being held to determine the new design. More than 200 submissions were made, and a commission was formed in order to evaluate these suggestions coming from a variety of stakeholders. The winning design was adopted on November 18, 1991, after being selected at an extraordinary session of the Uzbek Supreme Soviet. ' In doing so, Uzbekistan became the first of the newly independent republics in Central Asia to choose a new flag. Pertaining to its tricolor combination of horizontal stripes of blue, white and green color, it is similar to the flags of Lesotho, an enclaved country within the border of South Africa, and Puntland, a Somali federal state at the tip of the Horn.Knowlton, Steven A. \\"Applying sebeok‚Äôs typology of signs to the study of flags.\\" Raven: A Journal of Vexillology 19 (2012): 57-97.

In 1977 a flag of almost the same colours and symbolism as the future national flag was designed by local artist Kalontas Malon and adopted by the Vanua'aku Pati. When the party led the New Hebrides to independence as Vanuatu in 1980, the colours of the party flag (red, green, black and yellow) were chosen to be the basis for the national flag on Independence Day, 30 July 1980. A parliamentary committee chose the final design based on submissions from local artists. Symbolism Tusk and cycad frond detail The green represents the richness of the islands, the red symbolises blood which unites humanity as humans, and the black the ni-Vanuatu people. The Prime Minister of Vanuatu, Father Walter Lini, requested the inclusion of yellow and black fimbriations to make the black stand out. The yellow Y-shape represents the shape of Vanuatu islands on the map and the light of the gospel going through the pattern of the islands in the Pacific Ocean (approximately 83% of the people of Vanuatu profess Christianity). The emblem in the black is a boar's tusk ‚Äî the symbol of customs and tradition but also prosperity. Its worn as a pendant on the islands ‚Äì along with two leaves of the local namele tree. These leaves are supposed to be a token of peace, and their 39 leaflets represent the original 39 members of the Parliament of Vanuatu. Construction With a flag width of 180 units, the width of the triangle, from hoist to point, should be 84 units. The height of the flag will thus be 95 units, with the yellow band being 5 units tall, the gold fimbriations are each 6 units tall and the upper and lower (red and green) parts of the field are, thus, 39 units tall each.

On occasion his recordings have featured him playing clarinet, violin, banjo and piano. Though perhaps best known as one of the pivotal figures in early European free jazz and free improvisation, Bennink has worked in essentially every school of jazz, and is described by critic Chris Kelsey as \\"one of the unfortunately rare musicians whose abilities and interests span jazz's entire spectrum.\\" Known for often injecting slapstick and absurdist humor into his performances, Bennink has had especially fruitful long-term partnerships with pianist Misha Mengelberg and saxophonist Peter Br√∂tzmann. Han is a brother of saxophonist Peter Bennink.  Early life and education  Bennink was born in Zaandam, the son of a classical percussionist. He played the drums and the clarinet during his teens.  Playing career  Han Bennink awarded (1967) Through the 1960s he drummed with a number of American musicians visiting the Netherlands, including Dexter Gordon, Wes Montgomery, Sonny Rollins and Eric Dolphy (he can be heard on Dolphy's recording, Last Date (1964)). He subsequently became a central figure in the emerging European free improvisation scene. In 1963 he formed a quartet with pianist Misha Mengelberg and saxophonist Piet Noordijk which had a number of different bassists and which played at the 1966 Newport Jazz Festival, and in 1967 he was a co- founder of the Instant Composers Pool with Mengelberg and Willem Breuker, which sponsored Dutch avant garde performances. From the late 1960s he played in a trio with saxophonist Peter Br√∂tzmann and Belgian pianist Fred Van Hove, which became a duo after Van Hove's departure in 1976. Through much of the 1990s he played in Clusone 3 (also known as the Clusone Trio), a trio with saxophonist/clarinetist Michael Moore and cellist Ernst Reijseger. He has often played duos with Mengelberg and collaborated with him alongside other musicians. From the late 1980s through the early 2000s, Bennik collaborated closely with Dutch post-punk band The Ex, appearing on their 1995 album Instant and travelling and playing with them on their first tour to Ethiopia. Recordings As well as playing with these long-standing groups, Bennink has performed and recorded solo (Tempo Comodo (1982) being among his solo recordings) and played with many free improvisation and free jazz luminaries including Derek Bailey, Conny Bauer, Don Cherry and Alexander von Schlippenbach, as well as more conventional jazz musicians like Lee Konitz. In 1983 he collaborated with boogie-woogie pianist and vocalist Little Willie Littlefield for his album I'm in the Mood.Olderen, Martin van, I'm In The Mood, Linernotes OLCD 7002, 1993 Han Bennink in Austin, Texas, April 2006  Style  Bennink's style is wide-ranging, running from conventional jazz drumming to highly unconventional free improvisation, for which he often uses whatever found objects happen to be onstage (chairs, music stands, instrument cases), his own body (a favourite device involves putting a drumstick in his mouth and striking it with the other stick), and the entire performance space‚Äîthe floor, doors, and walls. He makes frequent use of birdcalls and whatever else strikes his fancy (one particularly madcap performance in Toronto in the 1990s involved a deafening fire alarm bell placed on the floor).

Previously, the territory was administered as part of the British Leeward Islands. Description The flag of the British Virgin Islands features a defaced Blue Ensign with the Union Flag in the canton, and defaced with the coat of arms of the British Virgin Islands. The coat of arms, which date to the early nineteenth-century, features Saint Ursula holding a flaming gold oil lamp and surrounded by a further eleven lamps, which represent her 11,000 virgin followers. The islands were named after these virgin followers by Christopher Columbus when he discovered the islands in 1493, the multiplicity of islands reminding him of the numerous followers. The motto present on the flag reads Vigilate, which translated from Latin is be watchful. The flag was modified in 1999, when the shield was enlargened and outlined in white. Etiquette Flag flying over the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London, 2019 The flag of the British Virgin Islands must never been flown above another flag, indicating superiority, or vice versa, indicating inferiority, nor should it be allowed to drag along the ground. The flag must always be flown in good condition, to do otherwise would be to show disrespect to the nation. Due care must be taken to ensure the flag is being flown the correct way up. The flag is flown from sunrise to sunset and all government buildings are encouraged to fly it. When a flag is to be disposed, it must be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning in private with respect. Related flags=Civil ensign The civil ensign (seen below) is a red ensign with the coat of arms of the British Virgin Islands. The red ensign is to be flown on board vessels either registered in the British Virgin Islands or by vessels visiting the British Virgin Islands. The flag was authorised in 2001 and Section 70 of the British Virgin Islands Merchant Shipping Act, 2001 reads: #The red ensign bearing the Virgin Islands‚Äô coat of arms usually worn by merchant ships, or without the coat of arms, is hereby declared to be the proper national colours for all Virgin Islands ships, except in the case of Her Majesty's ships, or in the case of any other ship for the time being allowed to wear any other national colours in pursuance of a warrant from Her Majesty or from the Admiralty. #If any distinctive national colours, except the red ensign or the Union Jack with a white border or any colours usually worn by Her Majesty's ships or resembling those of Her Majesty, or the pendant usually carried by Her Majesty's ships or any pendant resembling that pendant, are or is hoisted on board any Virgin Islands ship without warrant from Her Majesty or from the Admiralty, the master of the ship, the owner if on board the ship, and every other person hoisting the colours or pendant, each commits an offence and for each such offence is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding twenty-five thousand dollars. The blue ensign shall only be used on vessels which belong to or are in the service of the government. Gubernatorial flag The Governor of the British Virgin Islands has a separate flag (also seen below), a Union Flag defaced with the coat of arms. This design is similar to flags of the other Governors in British overseas territories. The gubernatorial flag is for use at Government House when the governor is in residence or within the territory. It is also on the bonnet of the motor-car in which the governor travels on official business. The current governor, in office since 15 August 2014, is John Duncan.

The flag of the United States Virgin Islands was adopted on May 17, 1921. It consists of a simplified version of the coat of arms of the United States between the letters V and I (for 'Virgin Islands'). The yellow-colored eagle holds a sprig of laurel in one talon, which symbolizes victory, and three blue arrows in the other (unlike the thirteen arrows in the US coat of arms), which represent the three major islands that make up the U.S. Virgin Islands: Saint Croix, Saint Thomas, and Saint John. When the Virgin Islands were owned by Denmark, the flag was a blue ensign with the Danish flag, or Dannebrog ('cloth of the Danes'), in the canton. History Colonial flag used in the Danish West Indies up until 1917. Prior to Transfer Day 1917, the Danish colonial administration used a simple flag modeled on the blue ensign with the flag of Denmark in its canton. The Danish flag is popularly said to have fallen from the sky during a 1219 battle of the Danish king Valdemar II during the Livonian Crusade against the Estonians. The Scandinavian cross on the flag represents Christianity. Inge Adriansen, Nationale symboler, Museum Tusculanum Press, 2003, p. 129: \\"Fra begyndelsen af 1400-tallet kan Dannebrog med sikkerhed dokumenteres som rigsflag, det vil sige statsmagtens og kongens flag\\" (English: \\"Dannebrog can with certainty be documented as flag of the realm, that is the flag of the authority of state and of the king, from the beginning of the 1400s\\") The idea of a U.S. Virgin Islands flag began with the administration of Rear Admiral Sumner Ely Wetmore Kittelle, who was sworn in as governor of the islands on April 26, 1921. He approached Mr. White, captain of the Grebe, and Percival Wilson Sparks, a cartoonist, and asked them for suggestions for a flag design. Sparks immediately drew a design on paper. Afterwards, Sparks transferred it on heavy cotton material, then asked his wife Grace and her sister Blanche Joseph to embroider the design. The later result was what became the United States Virgin Islands flag.  Transfer Day  Transfer Day commemorates the transfer of sovereignty over the islands from Denmark to the United States, which was first marked at an official ceremony in 1917 by the lowering of the Danish flag and the raising of the American flag in Charlotte Amalie. The United States had bought the Virgin Islands from Denmark for $25 million, which eventually meant changing the flag to represent the United States.

Etymology Deccan plateau, Hyderabad, India The name Deccan is an anglicised form of the Prakrit word ' or ' derived from Sanskrit dak·π£i·πáa ( \\"south\\"),Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary, p. 498 (scanned image at SriPedia Initiative): Sanskrit dak·π£i·πáa meaning 'southern'. as the region was located just south of North India.  Extent  The extent of the geopolitical area covered by the term \\"Deccan\\" has varied throughout history. Geographers have attempted to define the region using indices such as rainfall, vegetation, soil type or physical features. According to one geographical definition, it is the peninsular tableland lying to the south of the Tropic of Cancer. Its outer boundary is marked by the 300 m contour line, with Vindhya- Kaimur watersheds in the north. This area can be sub-divided into two major geologic-physiographic regions: an igneous rock plateau with fertile black soil, and a gneiss peneplain with infertile red soil, interrupted by several hills. Historians have defined the term Deccan differently. These definitions range from a narrow one by R. G. Bhandarkar (1920), who defines Deccan as the Marathi-speaking area lying between the Godavari and the Krishna rivers, to a broad one by K. M. Panikkar (1969), who defines it as the entire Indian peninsula to the south of the Vindhyas. Firishta (16th century) defined Deccan as the territory inhabited by the native speakers of Kannada, Marathi, and Telugu languages. Richard M. Eaton (2005) settles on this linguistic definition for a discussion of the region's geopolitical history. Stewart N. Gordon (1998) notes that historically, the term \\"Deccan\\" had the overtones of an area considered suitable for conquest by northern kingdoms: the northern border of Deccan has thus varied from Tapti River in north to Godavari River in south, depending on the southern boundary of the northern empires. Therefore, while discussing the history of the Marathas, Gordon uses Deccan as a \\"relational term\\", defining it as \\"the area beyond the southern border of a northern-based kingdom\\" of India. Geography Topographic map of the Deccan peninsula showing the locations of major cities and towns. Hogenakal Falls, Tamil Nadu Tiruvannamalai hill, often regarded as the southern tip of Deccan plateau and the city of Tiruvannamalai is called as Gateway of Deccan plateau at Tamil Nadu Near Hampi, Karnataka Rock formations at Hyderabad, Telangana Hills of granite boulders are a common feature of the landscape on the Deccan plateau. Deccan Traps in Maharashtra The Deccan plateau is a topographically variegated region located south of the Gangetic plains-the portion lying between the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal-and includes a substantial area to the north of the Satpura Range, which has popularly been regarded as the divide between northern India and the Deccan. The plateau is bounded on the east and west by the Ghats, while its northern extremity is the Vindhya Range. The Deccan's average elevation is about 2,000 feet (600 m), sloping generally eastward; its principal rivers, the Godavari, Krishna, and Kaveri, flow from the Western Ghats eastward to the Bay of Bengal. Tiruvannamalai in Tamil Nadu is often regarded as the Southern gateway of Deccan plateau. The Western Ghats mountain range is very massive and blocks the moisture from the southwest monsoon from reaching the Deccan Plateau, so the region receives very little rainfall. The eastern Deccan Plateau is at a lower elevation spanning the southeastern coast of India. Its forests are also relatively dry but serve to retain the rain to form streams that feed into rivers that flow into basins and then into the Bay of Bengal. Most Deccan plateau rivers flow south. Most of the northern part of the plateau is drained by the Godavari River and its tributaries, including the Indravati River, starting from the Western Ghats and flowing east towards the Bay of Bengal. Most of the central plateau is drained by the Tungabhadra River, Krishna River and its tributaries, including the Bhima River, which also run east. The southernmost part of the plateau is drained by the Kaveri River, which rises in the Western Ghats of Karnataka and bends south to break through the Nilgiri Hills at the island town of Shivanasamudra and then falls into Tamil Nadu at Hogenakal Falls before flowing into the Stanley Reservoir and the Mettur Dam that created the reservoir, and finally emptying into the Bay of Bengal. On the western edge of the plateau lie the Sahyadri, the Nilgiri, the Anaimalai and the Elamalai Hills, commonly known as Western Ghats. The average height of the Western Ghats, which run along the Arabian Sea, goes on increasing towards the south. Anaimudi Peak in Kerala, with a height of 2,695 m above sea level, is the highest peak of peninsular India. In the Nilgiris lie Ootacamund, the well- known hill station of southern India. The western coastal plain is uneven and swift rivers flow through it that forms beautiful lagoons and backwaters, examples of which can be found in the state of Kerala. The east coast is wide with deltas formed by the rivers Godavari, Mahanadi and Kaveri. Flanking the Indian peninsula on the western side are the Lakshadweep Islands in the Arabian Sea and on the eastern side lies the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal. The eastern Deccan plateau, called Telangana and Rayalaseema, is made of vast sheets of massive granite rock, which effectively traps rainwater. Under the thin surface layer of soil is the impervious gray granite bedrock. It rains here only during some months. Comprising the northeastern part of the Deccan Plateau, the Telangana Plateau has an area of about 148,000 km2, a north-south length of about 770 km, and an east-west width of about 515 km. The plateau is drained by the Godavari River taking a southeasterly course; by the Krishna River, which divides the peneplain into two regions; and by the Pennai Aaru River flowing in a northerly direction. The plateau's forests are moist deciduous, dry deciduous, and tropical thorn. Most of the population of the region is engaged in agriculture; cereals, oilseeds, cotton, and pulses (legumes) are the major crops. There are multipurpose irrigation and hydroelectric-power projects, including the Pochampad, Bhaira Vanitippa, and Upper Pennai Aaru. Industries (located in Hyderabad, Warangal, and Kurnool) produce cotton textiles, sugar, foodstuffs, tobacco, paper, machine tools, and pharmaceuticals. Cottage industries are forest-based (timber, firewood, charcoal, bamboo products) and mineral-based (asbestos, coal, chromite, iron ore, mica, and kyanite). Having once constituted a segment of the ancient continent of Gondwanaland, this land is the oldest and most stable in India. The Deccan plateau consists of dry tropical forests that experience only seasonal rainfall. The large cities in the Deccan are Hyderabad, the capital of Telangana, Bangalore, the capital of Karnataka, Pune, the cultural hub of Maharashtra and Nashik, the wine capital of Maharashtra. Other major cities include Mysore, Gulbarga and Bellary in Karnataka; Satara, Amravati, Akola, Kolhapur, Latur, Nanded, Sangli, and Aurangabad in Maharashtra; Hosur, Krishnagiri, Tiruvannamalai, Vellore and Ambur in Tamil Nadu; Amaravati, Visakhapatnam, Kurnool, Anantapur, Rajahmundry, Eluru, in Andhra Pradesh; and Warangal, Karimnagar, Ramagundam, Nizamabad, Suryapet, Siddipet, Jammikunta, Mahbubnagar in present-day Telangana. Climate The climate of the region varies from semi-arid in the north to tropical in most of the region with distinct wet and dry seasons. Rain falls during the monsoon season from about June to October. March to June can be very dry and hot, with temperatures regularly exceeding 40 ¬∞C. The plateau's climate is drier than that on the coasts and is arid in places. Although sometimes used to mean all of India south of the Narmada River, the word Deccan relates more specifically to that area of rich volcanic soils and lava-covered plateaus in the northern part of the peninsula between the Narmada and Krishna rivers. The Deccan Traps The Deccan Plateau, a pre- cambrian shield, is partially covered by the Deccan Traps, a large igneous province. The northwestern part of the plateau is made up of lava flows or igneous rocks known as the Deccan Traps. The rocks are spread over the whole of Maharashtra and parts of Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, thereby making it one of the largest volcanic provinces in the world. It consists of more than of flat-lying basalt lava flows and covers an area of nearly in west-central India. Estimates of the original area covered by the lava flows are as high as . The volume of basalt is estimated to be 511,000 cubic km. The thick dark soil (called silt) found here is suitable for cotton cultivation. Geology The volcanic basalt beds of the Deccan were laid down in the massive Deccan Traps eruption, which occurred towards the end of the Cretaceous period between 67 and 66 million years ago. Some paleontologists speculate that this eruption may have accelerated the extinction of the dinosaurs. Layer after layer was formed by the volcanic activity that lasted many thousands of years, and when the volcanoes became extinct, they left a region of highlands with typically vast stretches of flat areas on top like a table. The volcanic hotspot that produced the Deccan traps is hypothesized to lie under the present day island of R√©union in the Indian Ocean. Typically the Deccan Plateau is made up of basalt extending up to Bhor Ghat near Karjat. This is an extrusive igneous rock. Also in certain sections of the region, we can find granite, which is an intrusive igneous rock. The difference between these two rock types is: basalt rock forms on eruption of lava, that is, on the surface (either out of a volcano, or through massive fissures‚Äîas in the Deccan basalts‚Äîin the ground), while granite forms deep within the Earth. Granite is a felsic rock, meaning it is rich in potassium feldspar and quartz. This composition is continental in origin (meaning it is the primary composition of the continental crust). Since it cooled relatively slowly, it has large visible crystals. Basalt, on the other hand, is mafic in composition‚Äîmeaning it is rich in pyroxene and, in some cases, olivine, both of which are Mg-Fe rich minerals. Basalt is similar in composition to mantle rocks, indicating that it came from the mantle and did not mix with continental rocks. Basalt forms in areas that are spreading, whereas granite forms mostly in areas that are colliding. Since both rocks are found in the Deccan Plateau, it indicates two different environments of formation. The Deccan is rich in minerals. Primary mineral ores found in this region are mica and iron ore in the Chhota Nagpur region, and diamonds, gold and other metals in the Golconda region. Fauna The large areas of remaining forest on the plateau are still home to a variety of grazing animals from the four-horned antelope (Tetracerus quadricornis), chinkara (Gazella bennettii), and blackbuck (Antilope cervicapra) to the large gaur and wild water buffalo (Bubalus arnee). People The Deccan is home to many languages and people. Bhil and Gond people live in the hills along the northern and northeastern edges of the plateau, and speak various languages that belong to both the Indo-Aryan and Dravidian families of languages. Marathi, an Indo-Aryan language, is the main language of the north-western Deccan in the state of Maharashtra. Speakers of the Dravidian languages Telugu and Kannada, the predominant languages of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and Karnataka respectively, occupy those states' portions of the plateau. The city of Hyderabad is an important center of the Urdu language in the Deccan; its surrounding areas also host a notable population of Urdu speakers. The Urdu dialect spoken in this region is also known as Dakhini or as Deccani, named after the region itself. Tamil is spoken in the southernmost parts of the Deccan, in the areas occupied by the state of Tamil Nadu. Northeastern parts of the Deccan are in the state of Odisha. Odia, another Indo-Aryan language, is spoken in this part of Deccan. The chief crop is cotton; also common are sugarcane, rice, and other crops. Apart from the states already mentioned, the state of Chhattisgarh is found in the northeast corner of the plateau. The large cities in the Deccan are Hyderabad, the capital of Telangana, Bangalore, the capital of Karnataka, Pune, the cultural hub of Maharashtra and Nashik, the wine capital of Maharashtra. Other major cities include Mysore, Gulbarga and Bellary in Karnataka; Satara, Amravati, Akola, Kolhapur, Latur, Nanded, Sangli, and Aurangabad in Maharashtra; Hosur, Krishnagiri, Dharmapuri, Tiruvannamalai, Vellore, Ambur in Tamil Nadu; Amaravati, Visakhapatnam, Kurnool, Anantapur, Rajahmundry, Eluru, in Andhra Pradesh; and Warangal, Jangaon, Karimnagar, Ramagundam, Nizamabad, Suryapet, Siddipet, Jammikunta, Mahbubnagar in present Telangana. History The Deccan produced some of the most significant dynasties in Indian History like the Vijayanagara Empire, Rashtrakuta dynasty, Chola dynasty, Thagadur dynasty, Adhiyamans Pallavas, The Tondaiman, Satavahana dynasty, Vakataka dynasty, Kadamba dynasty, Chalukya dynasty, Western Chalukya Empire and Maratha Empire. Of the early history, the main facts established are the growth of the Mauryan empire (300 BC) and after that the Deccan was ruled by the Satavahana dynasty which protected the Deccan against the Scythian invaders, the Western Satraps.History of Asia by B.V. Rao p.288 Prominent dynasties of this time include the Cholas (3rd century BC to 12th century AD), Chalukyas (6th to 12th centuries), Rashtrakutas (753‚Äì982), Hoysalas (10th to 14th centuries), Kakatiya (1083 to 1323 AD), Kamma Nayakas (13th to 17th century AD) and Vijayanagara Empire (1336‚Äì1646). Ahir Kings once ruled over the Deccan. A cave inscription at Nasik refers to the reign of an Abhira prince named Ishwarsena, son of Shivadatta.The Castes and Tribes of H.E.H. the Nizam's Dominions, Volume 1, by Syed Siraj ul Hassan-page-12 After the collapse of the Satavahana dynasty the Deccan was ruled by the Vakataka dynasty from the 3rd century to 5th century. From the 6th to 8th century the Deccan was ruled by the Chalukya dynasty which produced great rulers like Pulakesi II who defeated the north India Emperor Harsha or Vikramaditya II whose general defeated the Arab invaders in the 8th century. From the 8th to 10th century the Rashtrakuta dynasty ruled this region. It led successful military campaigns into northern India and was described by Arab scholars as one of the four great empires of the world.Portraits of a Nation: History of Ancient India by kamlesh kapur p.584-585 In the 10th century the Western Chalukya Empire was established which produced scholars like the social reformer Basavanna, Vij√±ƒÅne≈õvara, the mathematician BhƒÅskara II and Someshwara III who wrote the text Manasollasa. From the early 11th century to the 12th century the Deccan Plateau was dominated by the Western Chalukya Empire and the Chola dynasty. The Penguin History of Early India: From the Origins to AD 1300 by Romila Thapar: p.365-366 Several battles were fought between the Western Chalukya Empire and the Chola dynasty in the Deccan Plateau during the reigns of Raja Raja Chola I, Rajendra Chola I, Jayasimha II, Someshvara I and Vikramaditya VI and Kulottunga I.Ancient Indian History and Civilization by Sailendra Nath Sen: p.383-384 In 1294, Alauddin Khalji, emperor of Delhi, invaded the Deccan, stormed Devagiri, and reduced the Yadava rajas of Maharashtra to the position of tributary princes (see Daulatabad), then proceeding southward to conquer the Andhra, Carnatic. In 1307, a fresh series of incursions led by Malik Kafur began in response to unpaid tributes, resulting in the final ruin of the Yadava clan; and in 1338 the conquest of the Deccan was completed by Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq. The imperial hegemony was brief, as soon Andhra and Karnataka reverted to their former masters. These defections by the states was soon followed by a general revolt of the foreign governors, resulting in the establishment in 1347 of the independent Bahmani dynasty.Marshall Cavendish Corporation (2008). India and Its Neighbors, Part 1, p. 335. Tarreytown, New York: Marshall Cavendish Corporation. The power of the Delhi sultanate evaporated south of the Narmada River. The southern Deccan came under the rule of the famous Vijayanagara Empire which reached its zenith during the reign of Emperor Krishnadevaraya. In the power struggles which ensued, the Hindu kingdom of Karnataka fell bit by bit to the Bahamani dynasty, who advanced their frontier to Golkonda in 1373, to Warangal in 1421, and to the Bay of Bengal in 1472. Krishnadevaraya of the Vijayanagara Empire defeated the last remnant of Bahmani Sultanate power after which the Bahmani Sultanate collapsed. When the Bahmani empire dissolved in 1518, its dominions were distributed into the five Muslim states of Golkonda, Bijapur, Ahmednagar, Bidar and Berar, giving rise to the Deccan sultanates. South of these, the Hindu state of Carnatic or Vijayanagar still survived; but this, too, was defeated, at the Battle of Talikota (1565) by a league of the Muslim powers. Berar had already been annexed by Ahmednagar in 1572, and Bidar was absorbed by Bijapur in 1619. Mughal interest in the Deccan also rose at this time. Partially incorporated into the Empire in 1598, Ahmadnagar was fully annexed in 1636; Bijapur in 1686, and Golkonda in 1687. In 1645, Shivaji laid the foundation of the Maratha Empire. The Marathas under Shivaji directly challenged the Bijapur Sultanate and ultimately the mighty Mughal empire. Once the Bijapur Sultanate stopped being a threat to the Maratha Empire, Marathas became much more aggressive and began to frequently raid Mughal territory. These raids however angered the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb and by 1680 he moved his capital from Delhi to Aurangabad in Deccan to conquer Maratha held territories. After Shivaji died, his son Sambhaji defended the Maratha empire from the Mughal onslaught but he was captured by the Mughals and executed. By 1698 the last Maratha stronghold at Jinji fell and Mughals now controlling all Maratha held territories. In 1707, Emperor Aurangzeb died of sickness at the age of 89 and this allowed Marathas to reacquired their lost territories and established their authority in much of modern Maharashtra. After the death of Chhatrapati Shahu, the Peshwas became the de facto leaders of the Empire from 1749 to 1761, while Shivaji's successors continued as nominal rulers from their base in Satara. The Marathas kept the British at bay during the 18th century. By 1760, with the defeat of the Nizam in the Deccan, Maratha power had reached its zenith. However, dissension between the Peshwa and their sardars (army commanders) saw a gradual downfall of the empire leading to its eventual annexation by the British East India Company in 1818 after the three Anglo-Maratha wars. A few years later, Aurangzeb's viceroy in Ahmednagar, Nizam-ul-Mulk, established the seat of an independent government at Hyderabad in 1724. Mysore was ruled by Hyder Ali. During the contests for power which ensued from about the middle of the 18th century between the powers on the plateau, the French and British took opposite sides. After a brief course of triumph, the interests of France declined, and a new empire in India was established by the British. Mysore formed one of their earliest conquests in the Deccan. Tanjore and the Carnatic were soon annexed to their dominions, followed by the Peshwa territories in 1818. In British India, the plateau was largely divided between the presidencies of Bombay and Madras. The two largest native states at that time were Hyderabad and Mysore; many smaller states existed at the time, including Kolhapur, and Sawantwari. After independence in 1947, almost all native states were incorporated into the Republic of India. The Indian Army occupied Hyderabad in Operation Polo in 1948 when it refused to join.Benichou, Lucien D. (2000). From Autocracy to Integration: Political Developments in Hyderabad State (1938‚Äì1948), p. 232. Chennai: Orient Longman Limited. In 1956, the States Reorganisation Act reorganized states along linguistic lines, leading to the states currently found on the plateau.  Economy  The Deccan plateau is very rich in minerals and precious stones. The plateau's mineral wealth led many lowland rulers, including those of the Mauryan (4th‚Äì2nd century BCE) and Gupta (4th‚Äì6th century CE) dynasties, to fight over it. Major minerals found here include coal, iron ore, asbestos, chromite, mica, and kyanite. Since March 2011, large deposits of uranium have been discovered in the Tummalapalle belt and in the Bhima basin at Gogi in Karnataka. The Tummalapalle belt uranium reserve promises to be one of the top 20uranium reserve discoveries of the world. Low rainfall made farming difficult until the introduction of irrigation. Currently, the area under cultivation is quite low, ranging from 60% in Maharashtra to about 10% in Western Ghats. Except in developed areas of certain river valleys, double- cropping is rare. Rice is the predominant crop in high-rainfall areas and sorghum in low-rainfall areas. Other crops of significance include cotton, tobacco, oilseeds, and sugar cane. Coffee, tea, coconuts, areca, pepper, rubber, cashew nuts, tapioca, and cardamom are widely grown on plantations in the Nilgiri Hills and on the western slopes of the Western Ghats. Cultivation of Jatropha has recently received more attention due to the Jatropha incentives in India.

Another million or more make up the Lithuanian diaspora, largely found in countries such as the United States, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Russia, United Kingdom and Ireland. Their native language is Lithuanian, one of only two surviving members of the Baltic language family. According to the census conducted in 2001, 83.45% of the population of Lithuania identified themselves as Lithuanians, 6.74% as Poles, 6.31% as Russians, 1.23% as Belarusians, and 2.27% as members of other ethnic groups. Most Lithuanians belong to the Roman Catholic Church, while the Lietuvininkai who lived in the northern part of East Prussia prior to World War II, were mostly Evangelical Lutherans. History The territory of the Balts, including modern Lithuania, was once inhabited by several Baltic tribal entities (Auk≈°taitians, Sudovians, Old Lithuanians, Curonians, Semigallians, Selonians, Samogitians, Skalvians, Old Prussians (Nadruvians)), as attested by ancient sources and dating from prehistoric times. Over the centuries, and especially under the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, some of these tribes consolidated into the Lithuanian nation, mainly as a defence against the marauding Teutonic Order and Eastern Slavs. The last Pagan peoples in Europe, they were eventually converted to Christianity in 1387. The territory inhabited by the ethnic Lithuanians has shrunk over centuries; once Lithuanians made up a majority of the population not only in what is now Lithuania, but also in northwestern Belarus, in large areas of the territory of the modern Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia, and in some parts of modern Latvia and Poland.Glanville Price. Encyclopedia of the languages of Europe, 2000, pp.304‚Äì306 However, there is a current argument that the Lithuanian language was considered non-prestigious enough by some elements in Lithuanian society, and a preference for the Polish language in certain territories of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, as well as a preference for the German language in territories of the former East Prussia (now Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia) caused the number of Lithuanian speakers to decrease. The subsequent imperial Russian occupation accelerated this process; it pursued a policy of Russification, which included a ban on public speaking and writing in Lithuanian (see, e.g., Knygne≈°iai, the actions against the Catholic Church). It was believed by some at the time that the nation as such, along with its language, would become extinct within a few generations. At the end of the 19th century, a Lithuanian cultural and linguistic revival occurred. Some of the Polish- and Belarusian-speaking persons from the lands of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania expressed their affiliation with the modern Lithuanian nation in the early 20th century, including Micha≈Ç Pius R√∂mer, Stanis≈Çaw Narutowicz, Oscar Milosz and Tadas Ivanauskas. Lithuania declared independence after World War I, which helped its national consolidation. A standardised Lithuanian language was approved. However, the eastern parts of Lithuania, including the Vilnius Region, were annexed by Poland, while the Klaipƒóda Region was taken over by Nazi Germany in 1939. In 1940, Lithuania was invaded and occupied by the Soviet Union, and forced to join it as the Lithuanian SSR. The Germans and their allies attacked the USSR in June 1941, and from 1941 to 1944, Lithuania was occupied by Germany. The Germans retreated in 1944, and Lithuania fell under Soviet rule once again. The long-standing communities of Lithuanians in the Kaliningrad Oblast (Lithuania Minor) were almost destroyed as a result. The Lithuanian nation as such remained primarily in Lithuania, few villages in northeastern Poland, southern Latvia and also in the diaspora of emigrants. Some indigenous Lithuanians still remain in Belarus and the Kaliningrad Oblast, but their number is small compared to what they used to be. Lithuania regained its independence in 1990, and was recognized by most countries in 1991. It became a member of the European Union on May 1, 2004. Ethnic composition of Lithuania Among the Baltic states, Lithuania has the most homogeneous population. According to the census conducted in 2001, 83.45% of the population identified themselves as ethnic Lithuanians, 6.74% as Poles, 6.31% as Russians, 1.23% as Belarusians, and 2.27% as members of other ethnic groups such as Ukrainians, Jews, Germans, Tatars, Latvians, Romani, Estonians, Crimean Karaites, Scandinavians etc. Poles are mostly concentrated in the Vilnius Region. Especially large Polish communities are located in the Vilnius District Municipality and the ≈†alƒçininkai District Municipality. This concentration allows Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania, an ethnic minority-based political party, to exert political influence. Due to the excessive pro-Pole political agenda, the party is known to cause friction between Lithuanians and Poles. However, it has only held 1 or 2 seats in the parliament of Lithuania for the past decade. Thus, it is more active in local politics by having a majority in a few minor municipality councils. Russians, even though they are almost as numerous as Poles, are much more evenly scattered and do not have a strong political party. The most prominent community lives in the Visaginas Municipality (52%). Most of them are workers who moved from Russia to work at the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant. A number of ethnic Russians left Lithuania after the declaration of independence in 1990. In the past, the ethnic composition of Lithuania has varied dramatically. The most prominent change was the extermination of the Jewish population during the Holocaust. Before World War II, about 7.5% of the population was Jewish; they were concentrated in cities and towns and had a significant influence on crafts and business. They were called Litvaks and had a strong culture. The population of Vilnius, which was sometimes nicknamed the northern Jerusalem, was about 30% Jewish. Almost all its Jews were killed during the Holocaust in Nazi-occupied Lithuania, some 75,000 alone between the years 1941 ‚Äì 1942,S√∂nke Neitzel & Harald Welzer, Soldaten (Protokolle vom K√§mpfen, T√∂ten und Sterben), Frankfurt am Main 2011, pp. 118‚Äì120 (Hebrew edition translated from the German) while others later immigrated to the United States and Israel. Now there are about 3,200 Jews living in Lithuania. Historical ethnographic regions Cultural subgroups Apart from the various religious and ethnic groups currently residing in Lithuania, Lithuanians themselves retain and differentiate between their regional identities; there are 5 historic regional groups: ≈Ωemaiƒçiai, Suvalkieƒçiai, Auk≈°taiƒçiai, Dz≈´kai and Pr≈´sai, the last of which is virtually extinct. City dwellers are usually considered just Lithuanians, especially ones from large cities such as Vilnius or Kaunas. The four groups are delineated according to certain region-specific traditions, dialects, and historical divisions. There are some stereotypes used in jokes about these subgroups, for example, Sudovians are supposedly frugal while Samogitians are stubborn. Genetics Genetic distance of Balto-Slavs by A (atDNA), B (Y-DNA) and C (mtDNA plot). Since the late Neolithic period the native inhabitants of the Lithuanian territory have not been replaced by migrations from outside, so there is a high probability that the inhabitants of present-day Lithuania have preserved the genetic composition of their forebears relatively undisturbed by the major demographic movements,ƒåesnys G.

Y-chromosome SNP haplogroup analysis showed Lithuanians to be closest to fellow Balts (Latvians), Estonians, Belarusians and Finnish people. This is the result of Iron Age. Autosomal SNP analysis situates Lithuanians most proximal to Latvians, followed by the westernmost East Slavs, furthermore, all Slavic peoples and Germans are situated more proximal to Lithuanians than Finns and northern Russians. Lithuanian Ashkenazi Jews also have interesting genetics, since they display a number of unique genetic characteristics; the utility of these variations has been the subject of debate.Genetic diseases among the Ashkenazi One variation, which is implicated in familial hypercholesterolemia, has been dated to the 14th century, corresponding to the establishment of Ashkenazi settlements in response to the invitation extended by Vytautas the Great in 1388.

Diaspora thumbright400pxCountries with largest Lithuanian populations. Lithuanian settlement extends into adjacent countries that are now outside the modern Lithuanian state. A small Lithuanian community exists in the vicinity of Pu≈Ñsk and Sejny in the Suwa≈Çki area of Poland, an area associated with the Lithuanian writer and cleric Antanas Baranauskas. Although most of the Lithuanian inhabitants in the region of Lithuania Minor that formed part of East Prussia were expelled when the area was annexed by the Soviet Union as the Kaliningrad Oblast, small groups of Lithuanians subsequently settled that area as it was repopulated with new Soviet citizens. Apart from the traditional communities in Lithuania and its neighboring countries, Lithuanians have emigrated to other continents during the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries. * Communities in the United States make up the largest part of this diaspora; as many as one million Americans can claim Lithuanian descent. Emigration to America began in the 19th century, with the generation calling itself the ‚Äúgrynoriai‚Äù (derived from ‚Äúgreenhorn‚Äù meaning new and inexperienced). The migration flow was interrupted during the Soviet occupation, when travel and emigration were severely restricted. The largest concentrations of Lithuanian Americans are in the Great Lakes area and the Northeast. Nearly 20,000 Lithuanians have immigrated to the United States since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.Immigration Statistics  Homeland Security * Lithuanian communities in Canada are among the largest in the world along with the United States (See Lithuanian Canadian). * Lithuanian communities in Mexico and South America (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Uruguay) developed before World War II, beginning in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Currently, there is no longer a flow of emigrants to these destinations, since economic conditions in those countries are not better than those in Lithuania (see Lithuanians in Brazil). * Lithuanian communities were formed in South Africa during the late 19th and 20th century, the majority being Jewish. * Lithuanian communities in other regions of the former Soviet Union were formed during the Soviet occupation; the numbers of Lithuanians in Siberia and Central Asia increased dramatically when a large portion of Lithuanians were involuntarily deported into these areas. After de- Stalinization, however, most of them returned. Later, some Lithuanians were relocated to work in other areas of the Soviet Union; some of them did not return to Lithuania, after it became independent. * The Lithuanian communities in Northwestern Europe (the United Kingdom, Ireland, Sweden, Norway and Iceland) are very new and began to appear after the restoration of independence to Lithuania in 1990; this emigration intensified after Lithuania became part of the European Union in 2004. London and Glasgow (especially the Bellshill and Coatbridge areas of Greater Glasgow) have long had large Catholic and Jewish Lithuanian populations. The Republic of Ireland probably has the highest concentration of Lithuanians relative to its total population size in Western Europe; its estimated 45,000 Lithuanians (about half of whom are registered) form over 1% of Ireland's total population. In Norway there are 45,415 Lithuanians living in the country and it has in a short time become the second largest ethnic minority in the country, making up 0.85% of Norway's total population, and 4.81% of all foreign residents in Norway. There are around 3,500 Lithuanians in Iceland, making around 1% of the total population. *Lithuanian communities in Germany began to appear after World War II. In 1950 they founded the Lithuanian High School in Diepholz, which was a private school for children of Lithuanian refugees. For decades the Lithuanian High School was the only full-time high school outside the Eastern Bloc offering courses in Lithuanian history, language, and culture. In 1954, the Lithuanian Community acquired Rennhof Manor House with its twelve-acre park in the town of Lampertheim-H√ºttenfeld. The school was relocated there and still exists today. * Lithuanian communities in Australia exist as well; due to its great distance from Europe, however, emigration there was minuscule. There are Lithuanian communities in Melbourne, Geelong, Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane, Hobart and Perth. Culture and traditions The Lithuanian national sport is usually considered to be basketball (krep≈°inis), which is popular among Lithuanians in Lithuania as well as in the diasporic communities. Basketball came to Lithuania through the Lithuanian-American community in the 1930s. Lithuanian basketball teams were bronze medal winners in the 1992, 1996, and 2000 Summer Olympics. Joninƒós (also known as Rasos) is a traditional national holiday, celebrated on the summer solstice. It has pagan origins. U≈ægavƒónƒós (Shrove Tuesday) takes place on the day before Ash Wednesday, and is meant to urge the retreat of winter. There are also national traditions for Christian holidays such as Easter and Christmas. Cuisine Lithuanian cuisine has much in common with other European cuisines and features the products suited to its cool and moist northern climate: barley, potatoes, rye, beets, greens, and mushrooms are locally grown, and dairy products are one of its specialties. Nevertheless, it has its own distinguishing features, which were formed by a variety of influences during the country's rich history. Since shared similarities in history and heritage, Lithuanians, Jews and Poles have developed many similar dishes and beverages: dumplings ( kold≈´nai), doughnuts (spurgos), and crepes (lietiniai blynai). German traditions also influenced Lithuanian cuisine, introducing pork and potato dishes, such as potato pudding (kugelis) and potato sausages (vƒódarai), as well as the baroque tree cake known as ≈°akotis. Traditional dishes of Lithuanian Tatars and Lithuanian Karaites like Kibinai and ƒçeburekai, that are similar to pasty, are popular in Lithuania. For Lithuanian Americans both traditional Lithuanian dishes of virtinukai (cabbage and noodles) and balandƒóliai (rolled cabbage) are growing increasingly more popular. There are also regional cuisine dishes, e.g. traditional kastinys in ≈Ωemaitija, Western Lithuania, Skilandis in Western and Central Lithuania, Kindziukas in Eastern and Southern Lithuania (Dz≈´kija). Lithuanian ≈°akotis Cepelinai, a stuffed potato creation, is the most popular national dish. It is popular among Lithuanians all over the world. Other national foods include dark rye bread, cold beet soup (≈°altibar≈°ƒçiai), and kugelis (a baked potato pudding). Some of these foods are also common in neighboring countries. Lithuanian cuisine is generally unknown outside Lithuanian communities. Most Lithuanian restaurants outside Lithuania are located in cities with a heavy Lithuanian presence. Lithuanians in the early 20th century were among the thinnest people in the developed countries of the world. In Lithuanian cuisine there is some emphasis on attractive presentation of freshly prepared foods. Lithuanian has been brewing Midus, a type of Lithuanian Mead for thousands of years.Antanas Astrauskas (2008), ‚ÄûPer barzdƒÖ varvƒójo...‚Äú: svaigi≈≥j≈≥ gƒórim≈≥ istorija Lietuvoje Locally brewed beer (alus), vodka (degtinƒó), and kvass (gira) are popular drinks in Lithuania. Lithuanian traditional beer of Northern Lithuania, Bir≈æai, Pasvalys regions is well appreciated in Lithuania and abroad.The NY Times picks beer trail in Lithuania among 46 places to visit in 2013 Starka is a part of the Lithuanian heritage, still produced in Lithuania. Literature When the ban against printing the Lithuanian language was lifted in 1904, various European literary movements such as Symbolism, impressionism, and expressionism each in turn influenced the work of Lithuanian writers. The first period of Lithuanian independence (1918‚Äì40) gave them the opportunity to examine themselves and their characters more deeply, as their primary concerns were no longer political. An outstanding figure of the early 20th century was Vincas Krƒóvƒó- Mickeviƒçius, a novelist and dramatist. His many works include Dainavos ≈°alies sen≈≥ ≈æmoni≈≥ padavimai (Old Folks Tales of Dainava, 1912) and the historical dramas ≈†ar≈´nas (1911), Skirgaila (1925), and Mindaugo mirtis (The Death of Mindaugas, 1935). Petras Vaiƒçi≈´nas was another popular playwright, producing one play each year during the 1920s and 1930s. Vincas Mykolaitis-Putinas wrote lyric poetry, plays, and novels, including the novel Altori≈≥ ≈°e≈°ƒóly (In the Shadows of the Altars, 3 vol., 1933), a remarkably powerful autobiographical novel. Keturi vƒójai movement started with publication of The Prophet of the Four Winds by talented poet Kazys Binkis (1893‚Äî1942). It was rebellion against traditional poetry. The theoretical basis of Keturi vƒójai initially was futurism which arrived through Russia from the West and later cubism, dadaism, surrealism, unanimism, and German expressionism. The most influensive futurist for Lithuanian writers was Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovsky. Oskaras Mila≈°ius (1877‚Äì1939) is a paradoxical and interesting phenomenon in Lithuanian culture. He never lived in Lithuania but was born and spent his childhood in Cereja (near Mogilev, Belarus) and graduated from Lyc√©e Janson de Sailly in Paris. His longing for his fatherland was more metaphysical. Having to choose between two conflicting countries ‚Äî Lithuania and Poland ‚Äî he preferred Lithuania which for him was an idea even more than a fatherland. In 1920 when France recognized the independence of Lithuania, he was appointed officially as Charg√© d'Affaires for Lithuania. He published: 1928, a collection of 26 Lithuanian songs; 1930, Lithuanian Tales and Stories; 1933, Lithuanian Tales; 1937, The origin of the Lithuanian Nation. Folk music Kulgrinda performing in Vilnius Lithuanian folk music is based around songs (dainos), which include romantic and wedding songs, as well as work songs and archaic war songs. These songs used to be performed either in groups or alone, and in parallel chords or unison. Duophonic songs are common in the renowned sutartinƒós tradition of Auk≈°taitija. Another style of Lithuanian folk music is called rateliai, a kind of round dance. Instrumentation includes kanklƒós, a kind of zither that accompanies sutartinƒós, rateliai, waltzes, quadrilles and polkas, and fiddles, (including a bass fiddle called the basetle) and a kind of whistle called the Lamzdeliai lumzdelis; recent importations, beginning in the late 19th century, including the concertina, accordion and bandoneon. Sutartinƒó can be accompanied by skuduƒçiai, a form of panpipes played by a group of people, as well as wooden trumpets (ragai and dandytƒós). Kanklƒós is an extremely important folk instrument, which differs in the number of strings and performance techniques across the country. Other traditional instruments include ≈°vilpas whistle, drums and tabalas (a percussion instrument like a gong), sekmini≈≥ ragelis (bagpipe) and the p≈´slinƒó, a musical bow made from a pig's bladder filled with dried peas.Cronshaw, Andrew (2000). ¬´Singing Revolutions¬ª, Broughton, Simon and Ellingham, Mark with McConnachie, James and Duane, Orla (Ed.)

Organizations in exile * Ateitis ‚Äì a Catholic youth organization whose members are called ateitininkai, started in Lithuania in 1910: During the occupation of Lithuania by the Soviet Union between 1945 and 1990 no Catholic organizations were allowed in Lithuania.

After Lithuania regained its independence in 1990, Ateitis returned to Lithuania as an official youth organization.Homepage of Ateitis: Mission and Vision Many of the branches outside Lithuania continue to function serving Lithuanian emigrees and descendants.

He occupied the northern territories of China during the civil wars that occurred towards the end of the Han dynasty. He was also an elder half-brother of Yuan Shu, a warlord who controlled the Huai River region, though the two were not on good terms with each other. One of the most powerful warlords of his time, Yuan Shao spearheaded a coalition of warlords against Dong Zhuo, who held Emperor Xian hostage in the imperial capital, Luoyang, but failed due to internal disunity. In 200, he launched a campaign against his rival Cao Cao but was defeated at the Battle of Guandu. He died of illness two years later in Ye. His eventual failure despite his illustrious family background and geographical advantages was commonly blamed on his indecisiveness and inability to heed the advice of his advisors.  Family background  Yuan Shao was born in Ruyang County (), Runan Commandery, which is in present-day Shangshui County, Henan. His family had for over four generations been a prominent force in the Han civil service, having produced numerous members in high positions since the first century CE. Descended from Yuan An, who served during the reign of Emperor Zhang, Yuan Shao's exact parentage was the source of some controversy, being one of the primary points of contention between himself and his half-brother, or cousin, Yuan Shu. Yuan Shao was a son of Yuan Feng () and the eldest sibling, supposedly to the ire of Yuan Shu. Both Yuan Shao and Yuan Shu are recognised as great-grandsons of Yuan An, as recorded in Wang Shen's Book of Wei (). Yuan Shao's mother was originally a servant of Yuan Feng. Since Yuan Feng lacked male heirs, the birth of Yuan Shao elevated his mother to the status of a concubine. The Records of the Three Kingdoms contend that Yuan Shao was in fact an older cousin of Yuan Shu, and was adopted by the elder brother of Yuan Feng, Yuan Cheng, who also lacked male heirs. The act of adopting Yuan Shao would have infuriated Yuan Shu, because his own mother, a concubine of Yuan Feng, held a higher status than that of Yuan Shao's mother; however, by Yuan Cheng's adoption of Yuan Shao, Yuan Shu was no longer the eldest son of the Yuan family. Yuan Shao enjoyed more privileges than Yuan Shu, despite the latter being a blood-related member of the clan. When Yuan Shao and Yuan Shu became involved in disputes later, Yuan Shu used Yuan Shao's mother as an excuse to claim that he was not a \\"true son\\" of the Yuan family. When compared to Yuan Shu, Yuan Shao had a more serious appearance and respected men of talent regardless of their background; as such, he was welcomed by many since his childhood, including Cao Cao and Zhang Miao.  Service under the Han dynasty (‚Äì189)  When Yuan Shao was young, he participated in saving some of the \\"partisans\\" from death or other terrible fates during the second of the Disasters of Partisan Prohibitions. After he entered the civil service, Yuan Shao initially served as an aide to General-in-Chief He Jin, who deeply trusted him. After the death of Emperor Ling in 189, He Jin and Yuan Shao plotted to eliminate the eunuch faction, but Empress Dowager He was against their idea. He Jin then summoned Dong Zhuo to lead troops into the imperial capital, Luoyang, to pressure the empress dowager. The eunuchs became fearful and they forged an edict in the empress dowager's name, summoning He Jin into the inner palace. Yuan Shao cautioned He Jin, reminding him that he should order an attack on the eunuchs instead of entering the palace. After He Jin refused to accept his advice thrice, Yuan Shao and Yuan Shu led 200 elite troops to wait outside. On 22 September 189,de Crespigny, Rafe (2007), p. 312. inside the palace, He Jin was ambushed and assassinated by the eunuchs, who tossed his severed head over the wall. He Jin's angered followers set fire to the palace and charged in, slaughtering every person (except females) without facial hair; to the extreme that many young men without facial hair had to show their genitals to avoid being mistaken for eunuchs and killed.Sanguozhi vol. 6. Over 2,000 people were killed in the massacre, while the young Emperor Shao and Prince of Chenliu (future Emperor Xian) escaped during the chaos. The resulting power vacuum provided Dong Zhuo, who found and rescued the emperor and prince, with an opportunity to seize control of the imperial capital when he arrived. Dong Zhuo then discussed with Yuan Shao about his plan to depose Emperor Shao and replace him with the Prince of Chenliu, but Yuan Shao disagreed. Relations between the two deteriorated and Yuan Shao fled from Luoyang to Ji Province (present day southern Hebei). At the time, Yuan Shao just got out through the city gates of Luoyang, Dong Zhuo thought about sending men after him, but Zhou Bi, Wu Qiong and He Yong secretly helped Yuan Shao by convincing Dong Zhuo to let him go. As suggested by the three men, Dong Zhuo appointed Yuan Shao as the Administrator of Bohai Commandery in a bid to appease him.  Coalition against Dong Zhuo (190‚Äì191) = Sun Jian's advancement  By early 190, however, Yuan became openly hostile. A coalition of regional officials and commanders from the eastern provinces, including Cao Cao, Yuan Shu, Han Fu, Zhang Miao and Bao Xin, formed up behind him in a campaign to oust Dong Zhuo. Yuan Shao declared himself General of Chariots and Cavalry () and camped at Henei (), near a ford on the Yellow River just north of Luoyang. Dong Zhuo ordered the execution of all members of the Yuan clan in Luoyang, and sent out emissaries with imperial edicts ordering the regional officials to disband. However, members of the coalition listened to Yuan Shao, and had all the emissaries executed instead (except Han Rong). Dong Zhuo then sent Hu Zhen, L√º Bu and Hua Xiong to deter the coalition vanguard led by Sun Jian. Despite initial success, Sun was able to capitalise on the internal conflict between Hu Zhen and L√º Bu and defeated them at Yangren. After that loss, Dong Zhuo decided to move the imperial capital to Chang'an, where his home base of Liang Province was nearby. A year later, Dong Zhuo burnt Luoyang to the ground and withdrew to the west with the mass of refugees. Although lacking a logistical base, Sun Jian and Cao Cao requested to pursue Dong Zhuo's retreating force, but Yuan Shao and other members largely disagreed with their opinion.(ÂçìËá™Âá∫ËàáÂ†ÖÊà∞...ÊïóËµ∞...Â†ÖÈÄ≤Ê¥õÈôΩ...Êõ¥ÊìäÂëÇÂ∏É...‰πÉÂüΩÈô§ÂÆóÂªüÔºåÂπ≥Â°ûË´∏ÈôµÔºåÂàÜÂÖµÂá∫ÂáΩË∞∑ÈóúÔºåËá≥Êñ∞ÂÆâ„ÄÅÈªΩÊ±†ÈñíÔºå‰ª•‚ñ°ÂçìÂæå„ÄÇ) Houhanshu vol. 72.(Ë´∏ËªçÂÖµÂçÅÈ§òËê¨ÔºåÊó•ÁΩÆÈÖíÈ´òÊúÉÔºå‰∏çÂúñÈÄ≤Âèñ„ÄÇÂ§™Á•ñË≤¨ËÆì‰πãÔºå...ÈÇàÁ≠â‰∏çËÉΩÁî®„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 1. Sun Jian was ordered to rendezvous with Yuan Shu, so Cao Cao led his own men to go on the pursuit alone, and was soundly defeated by Dong Zhuo's subordinate, Xu Rong.  Dissolution  During this time, Yuan Shao and Han Fu had intended to establish the legitimacy of the coalition by declaring Liu Yu, the governor of You Province (present day northern Hebei), the new emperor to replace Emperor Xian. However, believing that it would be faithless to Emperor Xian for him to accept, Liu Yu declined the offer. When the scene of the ruined capital coming into their eyes, the disunited leaders of the coalition realised that the Han dynasty was coming to an end, and started planning on strengthening their position, and soon returned to their respective home bases.  Unifying northern China (191‚Äì199) = Acquisition and consolidation of Ji Province (191)  Map showing the major warlords of the Han dynasty in the 190s, including Yuan Shao As many volunteers from different provinces had flocked to join Yuan Shao, Bohai Commandery would be far from sufficient to supply his army. Thus, Pang Ji suggested to Yuan Shao to form a secret alliance with the warlord Gongsun Zan and incite the latter to attack Han Fu's Ji Province.Houhanshu vol. 74. Facing an imminent attack from Gongsun Zan, Han Fu was terrified so he listened to Yuan Shao's lobbyists, Gao Gan (Yuan Shao's nephew)de Crespigny, Rafe (2007), p. 241. and Xun Chen, to give up the governorship of Ji Province to Yuan Shao in order to drive back Gongsun Zan. Yuan Shao then began to build a warlord state from Ye, the capital of Ji Province. In order to curtail Yuan Shu's sphere of influence, Yuan Shao formed an alliance with Cao Cao and Zhang Miao, and named his follower, Zhou Yu () as the Inspector of Yu Province, a title to which Sun Jian had already been entitled, and sent him to attack Sun Jian's territories in Yu Province while the latter was on his way back from Luoyang. In response, Yuan Shu allied with Gongsun Zan and Tao Qian, and ordered Sun Jian to fight his half-brother. Although Zhou Yu managed to defeat the forces of Sun Jian in the Battle of Yangcheng, he lost to Sun Jian in the following battles. The first battles between the brothers ended in Yuan Shu's favour: he had engaged and defeated Yuan Shao's forces in both Yangcheng and Jiujiang, restored the position in Yingchuan Commandery under Sun Jian, and eliminated Zhou Yu as a threat once and for all although Jiujiang was not yet conquered. For Yuan Shao, on the other hand, the situation was extremely difficult: besides the failure in the south, he was also under threat from Gongsun Zan, who held Yuan Shao responsible for the death of his cousin Gongsun Yue () in battle and formally declared war against him, rejecting all of Yuan Shao's protestations of goodwill.de Crespigny (1996), p. 123 This led to the clash between Yuan Shao and Gongsun in the Battle of Jieqiao. The Battle of Yangcheng, being the first move in the struggle between the two Yuans, marked the beginning of a new stage in the confusion of wars which brought about the end of the Han dynasty. This internecine struggle confirmed the undoing of the alliance against Dong Zhuo as the warlords of the North China Plain started to battle each other for the ultimate dominion of China. In order to focus on the conflicts with Gongsun Zan, Yuan Shao entered into a general alliance with Liu Biao against Yuan Shu. In the winter of that year, Yuan Shao defeated Gongsun Zan's elite cavalry at the Battle of Jieqiao with the use of massed crossbowmen. The Han imperial court issued an edict ordering Yuan Shao and Gongsun Zan to cease fire. Yuan Shao then returned to Ye and started targeting the Heishan bandits, who had been causing trouble in Ji Province. With temporary aid from L√º Bu, Yuan Shao managed to defeat the Heishan bandits despite suffering heavy casualties. In any case, Yuan Shao succeeded in drastically reducing the threat posed by the Heishan bandits to his western flank.  Conquest of Qing Province (192‚Äì196)  Despite warnings from Ju Shou that the move could sow seeds for future trouble, Yuan Shao insisted on sending his first-born son, Yuan Tan, away to \\"govern\\" Qing Province. In subsequent years, Yuan Shao achieved considerable success in consolidating his domain. At the same time, Yuan Tan also achieved exceptional success on expanding his territories in Qing Province, driving out Gongsun Zan's general Tian Kai in 193de Crespigny, Rafe (2007), p. 272. and defeating Beihai chancellor Kong Rong in 196.  Refusal to host the emperor (195‚Äì196)  In 195, Ju Shou suggested to Yuan Shao to welcome Emperor Xian to Ji Province so he could effectively control the Han central government and use the emperor as a figurehead to enhance his legitimacy. However, Guo Tu and Chunyu Qiong opposed this move under the faulty logic that if Yuan Shao were to do so, he would have to yield to Emperor Xian on key decisions. Yuan Shao, valuing his autonomy, listened to Guo Tu and Chunyu Qiong and let the opportunity pass by. In contrast, his would-be rival, Cao Cao used the opportunity to welcome Emperor Xian to his base in Xuchang, where the new imperial capital was established. In 196, the Han imperial court, under Cao Cao's control, awarded Yuan Shao the appointment of Grand Commandant. However, Yuan Shao rejected the appointment because Grand Commandant ranked below General-in-Chief, the position held by Cao Cao. As a result, Cao Cao gave up his position and offered it to Yuan Shao, who readily accepted it. Yuan Shao was also enfeoffed as the Marquis of Ye.  Annihilation of Gongsun Zan (198‚Äì199)  In 198, Yuan Shao advanced against Gongsun Zan and encircled his remaining force at Yijing (present-day Xiong County, Hebei). By early 199, Yuan Shao had completely defeated Gongsun Zan at the Battle of Yijing and held absolute power over the four provinces north of the Yellow River. Then, after establishing an alliance with the Wuhuan tribes on the northern frontier, Yuan Shao turned his attention to Cao Cao, who had consolidated his own power base to the south of the Yellow River.  Guandu Campaign (199‚Äì201)  200pxthumbChina's provinces in 199: Both sides made preparations for a decisive battle. Towards the end of 199, both sides had already engaged in skirmishes at Liyang (northwest of present-day Xun County, Henan), a major crossing point of the Yellow River. Cao Cao prepared his defences around Guandu (northeast of present-day Zhongmu County, Henan), slightly south of the river. When Liu Bei defected from Cao Cao in the first month of 200 and planted a foothold in Xu Province, Cao Cao left his northern front exposed to Yuan Shao and turned east to deal with Liu Bei. Tian Feng urged Yuan Shao to seize the opportunity to attack Cao Cao while he was away, but Yuan Shao refused to launch an all-out offensive. Instead, he sent small detachments to harass his enemy. Yu Jin, the general appointed by Cao Cao to defend Yan Ford, defeated Yuan Shao's detachments. Shortly after Cao Cao returned to Guandu, Yuan Shao had Chen Lin draft a document condemning Cao Cao in what was essentially a declaration of war. He then marched his main army towards the forward base of Liyang north of the Yellow River. At the time, Yuan Shao's main veteran army boasted of numbers over 100,000, supplemented with hundreds of thousands of less skilled militia units. Heavily outnumbering Cao Cao and holding large cavalry force, Yuan Shao's initial attacks almost overwhelmed his enemy's positions. It is recorded in the Records of the Three Kingdoms that Cao Cao on several occasions considered relinquishing his position, and consulted his chief strategist, Xun Yu on that decision, which Xun strongly opposed and further encouraged Cao to hold on. Following an unexpected defection of one of Yuan Shao's strategists and personal friends, Xu You, Cao Cao received confidential information on the whereabouts of Yuan Shao's food storage. In late 200, Cao Cao and Yue Jin led a strike force to attack Yuan Shao's supply depot at Wuchao and burnt it down, inflicting severe damage on the morale of Yuan Shao's army. Two of Yuan Shao's officers, Zhang He and Gao Lan, immediately defected to Cao Cao's side once they got wind of what happened in Wuchao, and many others followed suit. Yuan Shao was unable to stop the trend and fled north across the Yellow River with only hundreds of loyalists. Yuan Shao's first major defeat was also a decisive one. Thereafter, he lost the advantage over Cao Cao and never regained it. In 201, Cao Cao defeated him again at the Battle of Cangting and proceeded to capture several of Yuan Shao's territories in Ji Province.  Futile effort to turn the tide and death (201‚Äì202)  After the Battle of Cangting, Cao Cao's exhausted troops returned to the south for a rest. Meanwhile, Yuan Shao was able to reorganise his defeated armies to settle the rebellions in his own domain, soon reestablishing order and restored the status quo ante bellum.Leban, p. 375 Yuan Shao had three sons, and he favoured his third son, Yuan Shang, due to his good looks, and both Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang were his choice for succession. However, Yuan was never able to finalise his decision regarding who should succeed him before he died in on 28 June 202, leaving his domain to be contested by his sons and Cao Cao. Immediately after Yuan Shao's death, Shen Pei and Pang Ji, two influential advisers, supported Yuan Shang and pushed for him to succeed Yuan Shao, despite opposition from Yuan Tan. Yuan Shao's wife, Lady Liu, supported Yuan Shang, and Yuan Tan could not do anything to change the outcome when he rushed back from Qing Province. Then, Lady Liu, being in control of the Yuan household after her husband's death, killed Yuan Shao's other five consorts out of jealousy and disfigured them. True to Ju Shou's previous warning, chaos ensued within Yuan Shao's forces. Cao Cao exploited the internal turmoil within the Yuan family to his advantage and completely eliminated Yuan Shao's heirs and remnants by 207. Cao Cao paid his respects at Yuan Shao's tomb after conquering Ye city in 204. He wept bitterly for his old friend in front of his followers and gave Yuan Shao's family consolatory gifts and a government pension.de Crespigny (1996), p. 328  Family  * Ancestors: ** Yuan An, great-great-grandfather, served as Excellency over the Masses, and Excellency of Works ** Yuan Jing (), great- grandfather, served as Excellency of Works ** Yuan Tang (), grandfather, served as Excellency over the Masses, Excellency of Works, and Grand Commandant * Father: Yuan Feng (), served as Excellency of Works * Siblings: ** Yuan Ji (), elder half-brother, served as Minister Coachman ** Yuan Shu, younger half-brother, warlord, declared himself Emperor of Zhong later * Spouses: ** Principal wife, bore Yuan Tan and Yuan Xi ** Lady Liu (), bore Yuan Shang ** Five other concubines, all killed by Lady Liu * Children: ** Yuan Tan, eldest son, waged war on Yuan Shang after his father's death, killed by Cao Cao ** Yuan Xi, second son, moved to You Province after Yuan Shao's death, later fled to Liaodong with Yuan Shang, killed by Gongsun Kang ** Yuan Shang, third son, Yuan Shao's successor, waged war on Yuan Tan after his father's death, fled to Liaodong with Yuan Xi, killed by Gongsun Kang * Relatives: ** Yuan Wei (), uncle, served as Excellency over the Masses, and Grand Tutor ** Yuan Cheng (), uncle ** Yuan Yi, elder cousin, served as Prefect of Chang'an, and Inspector of Yang Province ** Yuan Xu (), younger cousin ** Yuan Yin (), younger cousin, served as Administrator of Danyang ** Yuan Manlai (), cousin ** Yuan Yida (), cousin ** Yuan Renda (), cousin ** Gao Gan, nephew In popular culture Yuan Shao is featured as a playable character in Koei's Dynasty Warriors and Warriors Orochi video game series.

Executed for murder in 1541 when title was forfeit. Arms of Fiennes, Barons Dacre: Azure, three lions rampant orFox- Davies, Armorial Families Baron Dacre is a title that has been created three times in the Peerage of England, every time by writ. History The first creation came in 1321 when Ralph Dacre was summoned to Parliament as Lord Dacre. He married Margaret, 2nd Baroness Multon of Gilsland, heiress of a large estate in Cumbria centred on Naworth Castle and lands in North Yorkshire around what is now Castle Howard. However, the status of the Multon barony is uncertain after Margaret's death in 1361. Lord Dacre's younger son, the third Baron, was murdered in 1375. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the fourth Baron. The latter's grandson was Thomas Dacre, the sixth Baron. The second creation was when Thomas's second son Ralph was summoned to Parliament as Lord Dacre (of Gilsland) in 1459 (see below). However, this new creation became extinct on his death in 1461. The third creation was when Thomas's fifth son, Humphrey, was summoned to Parliament as Lord Dacre of Gilsland in 1482 (for more information on this creation, see below). Gregory Fiennes, 10th Baron Dacre (1539‚Äì94), son of Thomas 9th Baron. He was restored to the title in 1558. By Hans Eworth (d.1574) (detail) Thomas was succeeded by his granddaughter Joan, the seventh Baroness, the only surviving child of Lord Dacre's eldest son Sir Thomas Dacre (1410‚Äì1448). She was the wife of Sir Richard Fiennes of Herstmonceux Castle, Sussex. In 1459 Richard was summoned to Parliament as Lord Dacre in right of his wife. While there were two Barons Dacre simultaneously, the Fiennes peers, seated in Sussex, were commonly called Baron Dacre of the South, while their counterparts, seated at Naworth Castle and Gilsland in Cumberland were Baron Dacre of the North. This distinction came to an end in 1569, when the Gilsland title became extinct. The great-great-grandson of the 7th Baroness, the ninth Baron, is notable for his conviction for murder in 1541, when his title was forfeited. However, his son Gregory was restored to the title in 1558. He was succeeded by his sister Margaret, the eleventh Baroness, the wife of Sampson Lennard. Their great- grandson, the fourteenth Baron, married Elizabeth Bayning, daughter of Paul Bayning, first Viscount Bayning of Sudbury, who in 1674 (after the title had become extinct) was created Viscountess Bayning for life. Their son, Thomas Lennard, 15th Baron Dacre, was created Earl of Sussex in 1674. However, his earldom became extinct on his death in 1715, while the barony of Dacre fell into abeyance between his two daughters the Hon. Barbara and the Hon. Anne. Barbara died childless in 1741 and the abeyance was terminated the same year in favour of Anne, the 16th Baroness. She was married three times, firstly to Richard Barrett, secondly to Henry Roper, 8th Baron Teynham, and thirdly to the Hon. Robert Moore, son of Henry Moore, 3rd Earl of Drogheda. She was succeeded by Thomas Lennard, the 17th Baron, her son from her first marriage. He died without legitimate issue and was succeeded by his nephew, the 18th Baron. He was the son of Hon. Charles Roper, the son of the late Lady Dacre's second marriage to Lord Teynham (the barony of Teynham had been passed on to a son from an earlier marriage of Lord Teynham). On his death the title passed to his sister Gertrude, the 19th Baroness. She was the wife of Thomas Brand. Arms of the Roper family & 18th Baron Dacre: Per fesse azure and or a pale counterchanged and three buck's heads erased of the second; crest: a lion rampant sable holding in the dexter paw a coronet orFox-Davies, Armorial families; As seen on several hatchments in Church of St Peter & St Paul, Lynsted, Kent She was succeeded by her son, the 20th Baron. He notably represented Hertfordshire in the House of Commons. His younger brother, the 21st Baron, was a General in the Army. In 1824 he assumed by Royal licence the surname of Trevor in lieu of Brand. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the 22nd Baron. He sat as Member of Parliament for Hertfordshire and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Essex. When he died the title passed to his younger brother, the former Speaker of the House of Commons, Henry Brand, 1st Viscount Hampden, who became the 23rd Baron Dacre as well. The barony remained a subsidiary title of the viscountcy until the death of his great-grandson, the fourth Viscount and 26th Baron, in 1965. The late Viscount was succeeded in the viscountcy by his younger brother while the barony fell into abeyance between his two surviving daughters the Hon. Rachel Leila Douglas-Home and the Hon. Tessa Mary Thompson. The abeyance was terminated in 1970 in favour of the elder daughter, the 27th holder of the title. She married the Hon. William Douglas-Home, second son of Charles Cospatrick Archibald Douglas-Home, 13th Earl of Home and younger brother of Prime Minister Sir Alec Douglas-Home. the title is held by her granddaughter, the 29th Baroness, who succeeded her father in 2014. As mentioned above the second creation of the barony came in 1459 in favour of Ralph Dacre, second son of the sixth Baron of the first creation, and became extinct on his death in 1461. The third creation came in 1482 in favour of Humphrey Dacre, third son of the sixth Baron of the first creation. This title fell into abeyance on the death of the fifth Baron in 1569. In 1651 the title of Baron Dacre of Gilsland was recreated for Charles Howard, who was made Earl of Carlisle at the same time. He was the great- grandson of Elizabeth Dacre, daughter of the 4th Baron Dacre of the 1482 creation. For more information on this creation, see Earl of Carlisle. The noted historian Hugh Trevor-Roper, Baron Dacre of Glanton, was the great- great-great-grandson of Reverend the Hon. Richard Henry Roper, second and youngest son of Anne, 16th Baroness Dacre, from her second marriage to Henry Roper, 8th Baron Teynham. For this reason he chose Dacre of Glanton as the title of the life peerage which he was awarded in 1979 and which he held until it expired upon his death in 2003. Thomas Barrett-Lennard, illegitimate son of Thomas Barrett-Lennard, 17th Baron Dacre, was created a Baronet in 1801 (see Barrett-Lennard baronets of Belhus for more information).

He was first elected as a Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) Member of Parliament (MP) in 1945 and was the last leader of the party, from 1960 to 1961. He crossed the floor to the Liberal Party in 1962 and was defeated in 1963. In 1966 he was appointed to the Senate. He entered the federal cabinet in 1980, as the only Saskatchewan representative, with responsibilities for the Canadian Wheat Board. He is well known for being a strong proponent of the proposed Canadian annexation of the Turks and Caicos Islands. He was the first senator ever to have been charged with fraud, in 1989. The charges were eventually dropped as he had been suffering from cancer for a year; he died shortly thereafter in 1991. CCF/NDP MP His family owned a farm, which he worked until he entered the House of Commons. He was first elected to Parliament in 1945 as a member of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF). At 24 years of age, he was the youngest MP at that time. After the Diefenbaker sweep of 1958, Argue was one of only eight CCFers remaining in Parliament, and the only one from Saskatchewan. Party leader M. J. Coldwell lost his seat, and the CCF parliamentary caucus chose Argue as their House Leader. After Coldwell resigned as the national CCF leader in 1960, Argue was elected leader at the party's last convention in the summer of 1960. At the time, the CCF was engaged in a three-year plan to create a new party from the union between itself and organized labour forces as represented by the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC). Both the CCF and CLC executives approved going down this route starting in April 1958. Argue, like many grassroot CCFers, was not convinced that this merger was necessarily the best route to revitalizing the party. As an organizing tool during this period, the organization was called the New Party. New Party clubs sprung up around the country between 1958 and 1961. On October 31, 1960, Walter Pitman won a stunning by-election victory in Peterborough under the banner of the New Party. This gave credibility to the forces organizing to remodel the CCF along the British Labour Party model. Argue became a candidate in the race to be the first leader of the newly formed NDP at their August 3, 1961 leadership convention. He was up against long-time Saskatchewan Premier, and CCF favourite-son, Tommy Douglas. Douglas had the support of the CLC, its president Claude Jodoin and CCF president David Lewis. Douglas easily defeated him 1,391 votes to 380 votes on a single ballot. In his concession speech, Argue declared, \\"No matter what my role is in the years ahead, I shall speak for you. I shall work for you, I shall never let you down.\\" He remained in the party's caucus, in the House of Commons, for the rest of the year, having little contact with Douglas in that time. Liberal Party MP and Senator Six months later, Argue crossed the floor to join the Liberal Party; he argued that divisions were rife in the NDP and that farmers' interests were overwhelmed by those of labour. He was re-elected as a Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) in 1962 but was defeated in 1963 and again in 1965. In 1966, Argue was appointed to the Senate as a Liberal. After the 1980 election, in which the Liberal Party failed to win any seats west of Winnipeg, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau appointed Argue to Cabinet as Minister of State (Canada Wheat Board). In 1989, he became the first senator ever charged with misuse of public funds and fraud. The RCMP alleged that he used public funds to help his wife's bid to obtain the Liberal Party nomination in their Ottawa-area riding for the 1988 Canadian federal election. The charges were dropped in 1991 by the crown prosecutor when it became apparent that Argue was near death, as he had been bedridden for most of the year with cancer. He died three months later in Regina, on October 2, 1991. Argue is the only former leader of the CCF or NDP whose portrait is not on the walls of NDP headquarters.

He was slain by Guan Yu at the Battle of Boma. Life Little is known about Yan's life. The only historical records about him could be found in the Records of the Three Kingdoms, in the biographies of Yuan Shao, Guan Yu and Cao Cao. It was implied that Yan Liang was one of the higher-ranking military officers under Yuan Shao. In 200, Yuan Shao mustered an army boasting 100,000 in strength and declared to march on Xuchang, the base of his rival, Cao Cao. To ensure a safe crossing of the Yellow River, he intended to send Yan Liang to attack Boma (northeast of present-day Hua County, Henan) and set a foothold on the southern bank of the river, but his adviser Ju Shou warned him that Yan Liang was too frivolous to handle the responsibility alone. Yuan Shao thus sent Guo Tu and Chunyu Qiong to supervise Yan Liang's operation. Before Ju Shou was stripped of power, he was responsible for the whole army. Yuan Shao later divided Ju Shou's command between him, Guo Tu and Chunyu Qiong. In a counter- tactic, Cao Cao moved his main force westwards along the Yellow River, diverting Yuan Shao's army in the same direction, but sent Guan Yu and Zhang Liao east to relieve the attack on Boma. During the ensuing battle, Guan Yu identified Yan Liang in the enemy ranks and killed him. In Romance of the Three Kingdoms In the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Yuan Shao praises Yan Liang's prowess in battle when he laments, while under attack by Hua Xiong, that \\"If I had either Yan Liang or Wen Chou here, I would have nothing to fear.\\" This comment foreshadows Yan Liang's first appearance in Chapter 25, where Yuan Shao deploys him as the commander of a vanguard force to take Boma in a conflict with rival warlord Cao Cao. Cao Cao quickly leads a lightly armed force and come to Boma's defence. True to his lord's compliments, Yan Liang slays two of Cao Cao's warriors, Song Xian (ÂÆãÊÜ≤) and Wei Xu (È≠èÁ∫å), and injures Xu Huang in the first encounter. Following Cheng Yu's advice, Cao Cao then summons Guan Yu to the frontline to deal with Yan Liang. The next day, as Yan Liang's troops line up on the battlefield, Guan Yu sits beside Cao Cao on a hilltop to observe the enemy. From afar, Guan Yu sees Yan Liang in a chariot under a banner. Leaping onto the Red Hare, Guan Yu charges right through the enemy ranks towards Yan Liang, decapitates him in a swift stroke and returns to Cao Cao's camp in triumph with Yan Liang's head.

Another old ryokan called H≈çshi Ryokan was founded in 718 A.D. and was also known as the world's second oldest hotel. Such inns also served travelers along Japan's highways. Ryokan are difficult to find in Tokyo and other large cities because many are usually much more expensive compared to modern hotels and hostels. As elsewhere in the world, hotels have become a standard in Japanese urban tourism. Nonetheless, some major cities do offer ryokan with competitive rates. Traditional ryokan are more commonly found in scenic rural areas,Japan National Tourism Organization and in recent years, many ryokan have been redeveloped to their original style, particularly by resort chains Hoshino Resorts, whose first ryokan opened in Karuizawa in 1914. Features A typical ryokan has a relatively large entrance hall, with couches and chairs where guests can sit and talk; a modernized ryokan often has a television in the hall as well. Guest rooms are constructed using traditional Japanese methods: flooring is tatami, and doors are sliding doors. Even if the inn uses hinged doors for security, it usually opens into a small entranceway where guests can take off their shoes before stepping onto the tatami floor, which would be separated by a sliding door. Many ryokan rooms also feature a porch or balcony, also set off with a sliding door. Almost all ryokan feature common bathing areas or ofuro, usually segregated by gender, using the water from a hot spring (onsen) if any are nearby. (Areas with natural hot springs tend to attract high concentrations of ryokan). High-end ryokan may provide private bathing facilities as well. Typically ryokan provide guests with a yukata to wear; they might also have games such as table tennis, and possibly geta that visitors can borrow for strolls outside. Bedding is a futon spread out on the tatami floor. When guests first enter their room, they usually find a table and some supplies for making tea. The table is also used for meals when guests take them in their room. While guests are out, staff (usually called nakai) will move the table aside and set out the futon. Meals A traditional breakfast at a Kyoto ryokan Most ryokan offer dinner and breakfast, which are often included in the price of the room. Most visitors take their meals at the ryokan, which usually promote themselves on the quality of their food. Meals typically consist of traditional Japanese cuisine known as kaiseki, which features seasonal and regional specialties. (Kaiseki originally referred to light meals served during a tea ceremony, and today refers to a meal consisting of a number of small, varied dishes.) Some ryokan instead serve local specialties such as basashi or food cooked in an irori hearth. In order for each dish to be enjoyed at the proper temperature, ryokan stress that guests should be punctual for their meals. For this reason, most ryokan ask guests to confirm the time they want to take their meals. Some ryokan have a communal dining area, but most serve meals in the guests' rooms. Ryokan which are likely to serve non-Japanese guests may also have a selection of Western food. Minshuku are a low-budget version of ryokan, roughly equivalent to a British boarding house or a bed and breakfast. The facilities are similar to a hotel or may simply consist of spare rooms in a family home. Minshuku often serve as the only type of accommodation in towns or villages too small to warrant a dedicated hotel or ryokan. The overall experience is much the same, but the food is simpler, dining may be optional and is often communal, rooms don't usually have a private toilet, and guests may have to lay out their own bedding.

Early life Xun Yu was from Yingchuan Commandery (around present-day Xuchang, Henan), and was born in a family of government officials. He was described in historical records as a tall and handsome gentleman. His grandfather, Xun Shu, served as a local governor and had eight sons who were nicknamed the \\"Eight Dragons of the Xun Family\\"; an uncle of Xun Yu, Xun Shuang, served as one of the Three Ducal Ministers, while Xun Yu's father Xun Fan was the chancellor of the principality of Jibei. Xun Yu proved to be a talented youth, and was evaluated by the scholar He Yong as \\"someone capable of assisting kings\\" (). In 189, he was nominated as a xiaolian (civil service candidate) and began his career in the civil service. When the warlord Dong Zhuo seized control of the capital Luoyang, Xun Yu feared for his safety and resigned, returning to Ji Province (present day Hebei). In the subsequent years, warlords quickly rose in each region; Xun Yu first served Yuan Shao, whose power base was in Ji Province, but later left him and went to serve Cao Cao in 191. Cao Cao recognised Xun Yu's talent and he exclaimed, \\"Here comes my Zifang!\\"Zifang\\" was the courtesy name of Zhang Liang, a prominent advisor to Emperor Gao. Zhang Liang contributed greatly to the founding of the Han dynasty.\\" when Xun Yu arrived, and he appointed Xun as an army commandant. Service under Cao Cao Xun Yu's contributions to Cao Cao's forces and administration are immense. On one hand he recommended many other men of calibre to Cao Cao, including Xun You (his second cousin-nephew), Chen Qun, Zhong Yao, Guo Jia and Sima Yi, creating a body of advisors around Cao; at the same time he participated in several battles and major events of the era, often giving timely advice to his lord. Cao Cao, in turn, respected Xun Yu greatly and placed great store in his advice. In 194, as Cao Cao led a campaign against Tao Qian in Xu Province, his home base at Yan Province was suddenly attacked by L√º Bu, and two of Cao's officials, Chen Gong and Zhang Miao, chose to defect to L√º Bu. At that time Xun Yu was in charge of the defences of Juancheng (), and his firm actions saved the city from capture, allowing Cao Cao's armies to return and drive away L√º Bu. Subsequently, on the death of Tao Qian, Cao Cao was tempted to turn around and move on Xu Province before returning to deal with L√º Bu; it was Xun Yu who dissuaded him from this, reminding him that Yan Province was his heartland and power base and should be secured first before launching campaigns abroad. It was also at Xun Yu's suggestion that Cao Cao chose to escort Emperor Xian, who was then living in the ruins of Luoyang, to his own base at Xu (present-day Xuchang, Henan) in 196, taking on the role of protecting the emperor. Xun Yu's plan was to \\"control the rebellious in the name of the emperor\\" (); the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms subtly distorts this to \\"hold the emperor hostage to control the warlords\\" (). In the long run, this strategy would give Cao Cao a considerable political advantage over his rivals, allowing him to legitimise his actions by taking them in the name of the emperor. In 200, Cao Cao was locked in a stalemate against Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu for months, eventually exhausting his food supply; while contemplating retreat he sent a letter to Xun Yu (who was then defending Xu) for advice. Xun Yu dissuaded Cao Cao with a letter, highlighting several advantages that his army held over Yuan Shao's forces and urging him to stand fast; the eventual result was a decisive victory for Cao Cao, which was crucial to his domination of northern China. Death In 211, Dong Zhao and a group of Cao Cao loyalists submitted a memorial to Emperor Xian proposing that Cao should be granted the title of a duke. This proposal was significant as it would allow Cao Cao to set up a self-contained feudal state within the Han dynasty. Up to this point, Cao Cao's political legitimacy was only underpinned by his position as the chancellor. Xun Yu, whose ideals were for Cao Cao to continue being the protector of the Han dynasty, opposed Dong Zhao's proposal. Knowing that Dong Zhao was probably a conduit for Cao Cao, when approached by the former for his support, Xun Yu told Dong that Cao's personal mission was one of restoring the Han dynasty and would not approve of such a move ‚Äì thus possibly hinting to Cao that he should abandon the idea. Xun Yu's remarks greatly displeased Cao Cao. Following this, Xun Yu was sent to Qiao to reward the soldiers who took part in a military campaign against Sun Quan. While there, Xun Yu was said to have fallen sick and brought to Shouchun (ÂØøÊò•; present-day Shou County, Anhui) for treatment and recuperation. He died in the following year in 212. The circumstances of his death aroused great suspicion and is a matter of debate as it came closely after his opposition towards Cao Cao's ascension to duke.

The species name lambertiana was given by the British botanist David Douglas, who named the tree in honour of the English botanist, Aylmer Bourke Lambert. It is native to the mountains of the Pacific coast of North America, from Oregon through California to Baja California. The massive 31 Gigabase mega- genome of sugar pine has been sequenced in 2016 by the large PineRefSeq consortium. Description= Growth  The Sugar Pine is the tallest and largest Pinus species, commonly growing to tall, exceptionally to tall, with a trunk diameter of , exceptionally . The tallest recorded specimen is tall, is located in Yosemite National Park, and was discovered in 2015. The second tallest recorded was \\"Yosemite Giant\\", an tall specimen in Yosemite National Park, which died from a bark beetle attack in 2007. The tallest, known, living specimens today grow in southern Oregon and Yosemite National Park: one in Umpqua National Forest is tall and another in Siskiyou National Forest is tall. Yosemite National Park also has the third tallest, measured to tall as of June 2013; the Rim Fire affected this specimen, but it survived. Pinus lambertiana is a member of the white pine group (Pinus subgenus Strobus) and, like all members of that group, the leaves (\\"needles\\") grow in fascicles (\\"bundles\\") of five, with a deciduous sheath. They are long. Sugar pine is notable for having the longest cones of any conifer, mostly long, exceptionally to long, although the cones of the Coulter pine are more massive. The seeds are long, with a long wing that aids their dispersal by wind. Sugar pine never grows in pure stands, always in a mixed forest and is shade tolerant in youth.  Distribution  The sugar pine occurs in the mountains of Oregon and California in the western United States, and Baja California in northwestern Mexico; specifically the Cascade Range, Sierra Nevada, Coast Ranges, and Sierra San Pedro Martir.  White pine blister rust  The sugar pine has been severely affected by the white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola), a fungus that was accidentally introduced from Europe in 1909. A high proportion of sugar pines have been killed by the blister rust, particularly in the northern part of the species' range that has experienced the rust for a longer period of time. The rust has also destroyed much of the Western white pine and whitebark pine throughout their ranges. The U.S. Forest Service has a program (see link below) for developing rust- resistant sugar pine and western white pine. Seedlings of these trees have been introduced into the wild. The Sugar Pine Foundation in the Lake Tahoe Basin has been successful in finding resistant sugar pine seed trees and has demonstrated that it is important for the public to assist the U.S. Forest Service in restoring this species. However, blister rust is much less common in California, and sugar, Western white and whitebark pines still survive in great numbers there. Etymology Naturalist John Muir considered sugar pine to be the \\"king of the conifers\\". The common name comes from the sweet resin, which Native Americans used as a sweetener. John Muir found it preferable to maple sugar. It is also known as the great sugar pine. The scientific name was assigned by David Douglas in honor of Aylmer Bourke Lambert. Uses According to David Douglas, Native Americans ate the sweetish seeds. Native Americans also ate the sweet sap, but in small quantities due to its laxative properties. The odorless wood is also preferred for packing fruit, as well as storing drugs and other goods. Its straight grain also makes it a useful organ pipe material. Folklore In the Achomawi creation myth, Annikadel, the creator, makes one of the 'First People' by intentionally dropping a sugar pine seed in a place where it can grow. One of the descendants in this ancestry is Sugarpine-Cone man, who has a handsome son named Ahsoballache. After Ahsoballache marries the daughter of To'kis the Chipmunk-woman, his grandfather insists that the new couple have a child. To this end, the grandfather breaks open a scale from a sugar pine cone, and secretly instructs Ahsoballache to immerse the scale's contents in spring water, then hide them inside a covered basket. Ahsoballache performs the tasks that night; at the next dawn, he and his wife discover the infant Edechewe near their bed.

Along with Carl Vogel, Pickering discovered the first spectroscopic binary stars. He wrote Elements of Physical Manipulations (2 vol., 1873‚Äì76). Education and early life Pickering was born in Boston on 19 July 1846 the son of Edward Pickering and his wife, Charlotte Hammond. Pickering was interested in the stars as a boy and constructed his own telescope with an age of 12. He was educated at Boston Latin School, and then studied Science at Harvard, where he received his Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in 1865. Career and research Soon after graduating from Harvard, Pickering taught physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Daintith, John. (1999) A Dictionary of Scientists. Oxford: Oxford University Press. During the 10 years he was there, he created the first physics lab in America that was designed for students to publish their own findings and research. Later, he served as director of Harvard College Observatory from 1877 to his death in 1919, where he made great leaps forward in the gathering of stellar spectra through the use of photography. Pickering and the Harvard Computers, standing in front of Building C at the Harvard College Observatory, 13 May 1913 At Harvard, he recruited over 80 women to work for him, including Annie Jump Cannon, Henrietta Swan Leavitt, Antonia Maury, and Florence Cushman. It was very unusual for such an accomplished scientist to work with this many women, but it has been said that \\"he became so exasperated with his male assistant's inefficiency, that even his maid could do a better job of copying and computing\\". These women, the Harvard Computers (also described as \\"Pickering's Harem\\" by the scientific community at the time), made several important discoveries at HCO.The 19th century women who catalogued the cosmos, Michelle Starr, Cnet News, March 7, 2016 Leavitt's discovery of the period-luminosity relationship for Cepheids, published by Pickering,Miss Leavitt in Pickering, Edward C. \\"Periods of 25 Variable Stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud\\" Harvard College Observatory Circular 173 (1912) 1‚Äì3. would prove the foundation for the modern understanding of cosmological distances. In 1882, Pickering developed a method to photograph the spectra of multiple stars simultaneously by putting a large prism in front of the photographic plate.Bunch, Bryan H. and Hellemans, Alexander (2004) The History of Science and Technology: A Browser's Guide to the Great Discoveries, Inventions, and the People Who Made Them, from the Dawn of Time to Today. Boston: Houghton Mifflin. In 1882 he started his appeals for international variable star observations. This was met with opposition, but eventually such a cooperation was realized in the Variable Star Section of the British Astronomical Association and the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO). Pickering had a good relationship with the AAVSO and received a gold paper knife with precious stones. He also, along with Williamina Fleming and Annie Jump Cannon designed a stellar classification system based on an alphabetic system for spectral classes that was first known as the Harvard Stellar Classification and became the basis for the Henry Draper Catalog. In 1896, Pickering published observations of previously unknown lines in the spectra of the star Œ∂-Puppis. Also published as: These lines became known as the Pickering series (or the Pickering‚ÄìFowler series) and Pickering attributed them to hydrogen in 1897. Alfred Fowler gave the same attribution to similar lines that he observed in a hydrogen-helium mixture in 1912. Analysis by Niels Bohr included in his 'trilogy' on atomic structure argued that the spectral lines arose from ionised helium, He+, and not from hydrogen. Fowler was initially-skeptical but was ultimately convinced that Bohr was correct, and by 1915 \\"spectroscopists had transferred [the Pickering series] definitively [from hydrogen] to helium.\\" Bohr's theoretical work on the Pickering series had demonstrated the need for \\"a re-examination of problems that seemed already to have been solved within classical theories\\" and provided important confirmation for his atomic theory.

His force was defeated by that of rival warlord Cao Cao in the Battle of Yan Ford and he was killed in the midst of battle. Life Historical records pertaining to Wen Chou are scarce. References to him could be found in the Records of the Three Kingdoms in the biographies of Yuan Shao, Cao Cao, Xun Yu and Xun You, from where it could be gathered that Wen Chou was a fierce warrior whose prowess in battle matched that of his counterpart, Yan Liang. In 200, after Yan Liang was killed in the Battle of Boma, Yuan Shao brought his main army south of the Yellow River and launched a full-fledged attack on Cao Cao. Wen Chou and Liu Bei were sent forth with a vanguard force of more than 5,000 riders to pursue Cao Cao's retreating forces. Making a stand atop a knoll, Cao Cao retained less than 600 cavalry and let loose the remaining horses. As Wen Chou's troops arrived, many broke ranks to loot the horses and other supplies. Cao Cao then gave order for a counterattack. The small but elite cavalry force scored a brilliant victory over the disorganised enemy and killed Wen Chou in battle. In Romance of the Three Kingdoms In the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Wen Chou is said to have a face like that of the xiezhi. In Chapter 5, Yuan Shao praises Wen Chou's prowess in battle when he laments, while under attack by Hua Xiong, that \\"If I had either Yan Liang or Wen Chou here, I would have nothing to fear.\\" This comment foreshadows the appearance of Wen Chou in chapter 26, where he volunteers to avenge his close friend Yan Liang, who is killed in the Battle of Boma by Guan Yu. Given 70,000 troops, Wen Chou crosses the Yellow River and heads straight towards Cao Cao's camp. In an unusual move, Cao Cao turns his entire formation around, placing the supplies in front. While Wen Chou's soldiers are busy looting the supplies, Cao Cao directs his men south onto a knoll, from where they allow their horses to graze. Wen Chou's soldiers pounce upon the horses as they approach the knoll and become disorganised. Cao Cao then gives the order for a counterattack, forcing the enemy to retreat. Zhang Liao and Xu Huang, two of Cao Cao's best generals, give chase. Wen Chou fires two arrows from atop his horse, one of which slices off the feather on Zhang Liao's helmet and the other hits his horse in the face. Brandishing his poleaxe, Xu Huang charges towards Wen Chou but has to retreat when a band of enemy soldiers come to their commander's rescue. Leading a dozen riders, Guan Yu then cuts off Wen Chou's escape and engaged him in a duel. Within three bouts, Wen Chou withdraws and attempts to evade. However, Guan Yu's horse, the Red Hare, is of a superior breed and soon catches up with him. Guan Yu then kills Wen Chou from behind.

He played a significant part in the Battle of Guandu in 200. Life Little is known about Chunyu's background other than that in 188, he was the Right Colonel (Âè≥Ê†°Â∞â) in the newly created Army of the Western Garden along with Yuan Shao and Cao Cao. He may have left the capital at around the same time as Yuan Shao and joined the coalition against Dong Zhuo in 190. It is clear that by the end of the decade, Chunyu Qiong had become one of Yuan Shao's leading and most trusted military officers. In a later memorial submitted by Cao Cao, he is referred to as \\"a great officer under Yuan Shao\\". In 195, Yuan Shao's strategist Ju Shou suggested that he welcome Emperor Xian to his province so that he could effectively be in control of the imperial government, but Chunyu Qiong opposed ‚Äî under the faulty logic that if he did, he would have to yield to Emperor Xian on key decisions. Yuan Shao listened to Chunyu Qiong and gave up the chance to Cao Cao. In 200, Cao Cao had become Yuan Shao's main rival for domination of northern China. In the preparations for the clash, Chunyu Qiong sided with Guo Tu against Ju Shou, calling for a more aggressive strategy against Cao Cao. As a result, he was given command of a third of Yuan Shao's army along with Guo. In the spring of 200, he joined Guo Tu and Yan Liang in an attack on Boma, held by Cao Cao's general Liu Yan. In the latter stages of the Battle of Guandu, Chunyu Qiong led more than 10,000 troops to Wuchao (ÁÉèÂ∑¢), about 40 li north of Yuan Shao's main camp, to receive a new shipment of grain supplies. In early dawn, he was surprised by a raid led by Cao Cao himself. Yuan Shao's cavalry were routed, Wuchao was captured, and Chunyu Qiong was beheaded after the battle. According to the Cao Man Zhuan, during the battle, his nose was cut off, and he was brought to Cao Cao, who asked him, \\"What do you have to say for yourself?\\" Chunyu Qiong replied: \\"Heaven decides the victor, what need have you to ask?\\" Impressed by the answer, Cao Cao wanted to spare his life, but Xu You urged Cao Cao to kill Chunyu Qiong, saying that Chunyu Qiong would take revenge later on him for cutting off his nose. Cao Cao then ordered Chunyu Qiong to be executed. With the fall of Wuchao, Yuan Shao's positions collapsed and a number of his commanders, such as Gao Lan (È´òË¶Ω) and Zhang He, defected to Cao Cao. Chunyu Qiong's defeat at Wuchao has earned him a reputation in Chinese folklore as a commander without any real ability. In Romance of the Three Kingdoms In the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Chunyu Qiong was described as a heavy drinker and often seen with a bottle of wine. During the Battle of Guandu, Yuan Shao left Chunyu Qiong as the overseer of the important supply depot in Wuchao. When Cao Cao, who listened to Xu You's advice, found the depot, Chunyu Qiong was drunk at the time and failed to put up any significant defence. This resulted in Cao Cao succeeding in burning down the supply depot. Afterwards, Cao Cao mutilated Chunyu Qiong's face and sent him back to Yuan Shao. The furious Yuan Shao ordered Chunyu Qiong's execution. See also * Lists of people of the Three Kingdoms References * Chen, Shou (3rd century).

A ternary operation on a set A takes any given three elements of A and combines them to form a single element of A. In computer science, a ternary operator is an operator that takes three arguments.  Examples  Given A, B and point P, geometric construction yields V, the projective harmonic conjugate of P with respect to A and B. If F is a field, the function T(a,\\\\ b,\\\\ c) \\\\ =\\\\ ab + c is an example of a ternary operator on F. Properties of this ternary operation have been used to define planar ternary rings in the foundations of projective geometry. In the Euclidean plane with points a, b, c referred to an origin, the ternary operation [a, b, c] \\\\ = \\\\ a - b + c has been used to define free vectors.Jeremiah Certaine (1943) The ternary operation (abc) = a b‚àí1c of a group, Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society 49: 868‚Äì77 Since (abc) = d implies a ‚Äì b = c ‚Äì d, these directed segments are equipollent and are associated with the same free vector. Any three points in the plane a, b, c thus determine a parallelogram with d at the fourth vertex. In projective geometry, the process of finding a projective harmonic conjugate is a ternary operation on three points. In the diagram, points A, B and P determine point V, the harmonic conjugate of P with respect to A and B. Point R and the line through P can be selected arbitrarily, determining C and D. Drawing AC and BD produces the intersection Q, and RQ then yields V. Suppose A and B are given sets and \\\\mathcal{B}(A, B) is the collection of binary relations between A and B. Composition of relations is always defined when A = B, but otherwise a ternary composition can be defined by [p,\\\\ q,\\\\ r] \\\\ =\\\\ p q^T r \\\\ \\\\ \\\\text{where}\\\\ \\\\ q^T is the converse relation of q.

The arguments and result can be of different types. Many programming languages that use C-like syntax feature a ternary operator, \`?:\`, which defines a conditional expression.

The origin of the name stems from a pilot being able to view information with the head positioned \\"up\\" and looking forward, instead of angled down looking at lower instruments. A HUD also has the advantage that the pilot's eyes do not need to refocus to view the outside after looking at the optically nearer instruments. Although they were initially developed for military aviation, HUDs are now used in commercial aircraft, automobiles, and other (mostly professional) applications.  Overview  HUD mounted in a PZL TS-11 Iskra jet trainer aircraft with a glass plate combiner and a convex collimating lens just below it A typical HUD contains three primary components: a projector unit, a combiner, and a video generation computer. The projection unit in a typical HUD is an optical collimator setup: a convex lens or concave mirror with a cathode ray tube, light emitting diode display, or liquid crystal display at its focus. This setup (a design that has been around since the invention of the reflector sight in 1900) produces an image where the light is collimated, i.e. the focal point is perceived to be at infinity. The combiner is typically an angled flat piece of glass (a beam splitter) located directly in front of the viewer, that redirects the projected image from projector in such a way as to see the field of view and the projected infinity image at the same time. Combiners may have special coatings that reflect the monochromatic light projected onto it from the projector unit while allowing all other wavelengths of light to pass through. In some optical layouts combiners may also have a curved surface to refocus the image from the projector. The computer provides the interface between the HUD (i.e. the projection unit) and the systems/data to be displayed and generates the imagery and symbology to be displayed by the projection unit .  Types  Other than fixed mounted HUD, there are also head-mounted displays (HMDs). Including helmet-mounted displays (both abbreviated HMD), forms of HUD that features a display element that moves with the orientation of the user's head. Many modern fighters (such as the F/A-18, F-16, and Eurofighter) use both a HUD and HMD concurrently. The F-35 Lightning II was designed without a HUD, relying solely on the HMD, making it the first modern military fighter not to have a fixed HUD.  Generations  HUDs are split into four generations reflecting the technology used to generate the images. * First Generation‚ÄîUse a CRT to generate an image on a phosphor screen, having the disadvantage of the phosphor screen coating degrading over time. The majority of HUDs in operation today are of this type. * Second Generation‚ÄîUse a solid state light source, for example LED, which is modulated by an LCD screen to display an image. These systems do not fade or require the high voltages of first generation systems. These systems are on commercial aircraft. * Third Generation‚ÄîUse optical waveguides to produce images directly in the combiner rather than use a projection system. * Fourth Generation‚ÄîUse a scanning laser to display images and even video imagery on a clear transparent medium. Newer micro-display imaging technologies are being introduced, including liquid crystal display (LCD), liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS), digital micro-mirrors (DMD), and organic light-emitting diode (OLED).  History  Longitudinal cross-section of a basic reflector sight (1937 German Revi C12/A). Copilot's HUD of a C-130J HUDs evolved from the reflector sight, a pre-World War II parallax-free optical sight technology for military fighter aircraft. The gyro gunsight added a reticle that moved based on the speed and turn rate to solve for the amount of lead needed to hit a target while maneuvering. During the early 1940s, the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE), in charge of UK radar development, found that Royal Air Force (RAF) night fighter pilots were having a hard time reacting to the verbal instruction of the radar operator as they approached their targets. They experimented with the addition of a second radar display for the pilot, but found they had trouble looking up from the lit screen into the dark sky in order to find the target. In October 1942 they had successfully combined the image from the radar tube with a projection from their standard GGS Mk. II gyro gunsight on a flat area of the windscreen, and later in the gunsight itself.Ian White, \\"The History of Air Intercept Radar & the British Nightfigher\\", Pen & Sword, 2007, p. 207 A key upgrade was the move from the original AI Mk. IV radar to the microwave-frequency AI Mk. VIII radar found on the de Havilland Mosquito night fighter. This set produced an artificial horizon that further eased head-up flying. In 1955 the US Navy's Office of Naval Research and Development did some research with a mockup HUD concept unit along with a sidestick controller in an attempt to ease the pilot's burden flying modern jet aircraft and make the instrumentation less complicated during flight. While their research was never incorporated in any aircraft of that time, the crude HUD mockup they built had all the features of today's modern HUD units.\\"Windshield TV Screen To Aid Blind Flying.\\" Popular Mechanics, March 1955, p. 101. HUD technology was next advanced by the Royal Navy in the Buccaneer, the prototype of which first flew on 1958. The aircraft was designed to fly at very low altitudes at very high speeds and drop bombs in engagements lasting seconds. As such, there was no time for the pilot to look up from the instruments to a bombsight. This led to the concept of a \\"Strike Sight\\" that would combine altitude, airspeed and the gun/bombsight into a single gunsight-like display. There was fierce competition between supporters of the new HUD design and supporters of the old electro-mechanical gunsight, with the HUD being described as a radical, even foolhardy option. The Air Arm branch of the UK Ministry of Defence sponsored the development of a Strike Sight. The Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) designed the equipment and the earliest usage of the term \\"head-up-display\\" can be traced to this time.John Kim, Rupture of the Virtual, Digital Commons Macalester College, 2016, p. 54 Production units were built by Cintel, and the system was first integrated in 1958. The Cintel HUD business was taken over by Elliott Flight Automation and the Buccaneer HUD was manufactured and further developed, continuing up to a Mark III version with a total of 375 systems made; it was given a 'fit and forget' title by the Royal Navy and it was still in service nearly 25 years later. BAE Systems, as successor to Elliotts via GEC-Marconi Avionics, thus has a claim to the world's first Head Up Display in operational service.Rochester Avionics Archives A similar version that replaced the bombing modes with missile-attack modes was part of the AIRPASS HUD fit to the English Electric Lightning. In the United Kingdom, it was soon noted that pilots flying with the new gun-sights were becoming better at piloting their aircraft. At this point, the HUD expanded its purpose beyond weapon aiming to general piloting. In the 1960s, French test-pilot Gilbert Klopfstein created the first modern HUD and a standardized system of HUD symbols so that pilots would only have to learn one system and could more easily transition between aircraft. The modern HUD used in instrument flight rules approaches to landing was developed in 1975.Spitzer, Cary R., ed. \\"Digital Avionics Handbook\\". Head- Up Displays. Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press, 2001 Klopfstein pioneered HUD technology in military fighter jets and helicopters, aiming to centralize critical flight data within the pilot's field of vision. This approach sought to increase the pilot's scan efficiency and reduce \\"task saturation\\" and information overload. Use of HUDs then expanded beyond military aircraft. In the 1970s, the HUD was introduced to commercial aviation, and in 1988, the Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme became the first production car with a head-up display. Until a few years ago, the Embraer 190, Saab 2000, Boeing 727, and Boeing 737 Classic (737-300/400/500) and Next Generation aircraft (737-600/700/800/900 series) were the only commercial passenger aircraft available with HUDs. However, the technology is becoming more common with aircraft such as the Canadair RJ, Airbus A318 and several business jets featuring the displays. HUDs have become standard equipment on the Boeing 787. Furthermore, the Airbus A320, A330, A340 and A380 families are currently undergoing the certification process for a HUD. HUDs were also added to the Space Shuttle orbiter.  Design factors  There are several factors that interplay in the design of a HUD: * Field of View ‚Äì also \\"FOV\\", indicates the angle(s), vertically as well as horizontally, subtended at the pilot's eye, that the combiner displays symbology in relation to the outside view. A narrow FOV means that the view (of a runway, for example) through the combiner might include little additional information beyond the perimeters of the runway environment; whereas a wide FOV would allow a 'broader' view. For aviation applications, the major benefit of a wide FOV is that an aircraft approaching the runway in a crosswind might still have the runway in view through the combiner, even though the aircraft is pointed well away from the runway threshold; where a narrow FOV the runway would be 'off the edge' of the combiner, out of the HUD's view. Because the human eyes are separated, each eye receives a different image. The HUD image is viewable by one or both eyes, depending on technical and budget limitations in the design process. Modern expectations are that both eyes view the same image, in other words a \\"binocular Field of View (FOV)\\". * Collimation ‚Äì The projected image is collimated which makes the light rays parallel. Because the light rays are parallel the lens of the human eye focuses on infinity to get a clear image. Collimated images on the HUD combiner are perceived as existing at or near optical infinity. This means that the pilot's eyes do not need to refocus to view the outside world and the HUD display...the image appears to be \\"out there\\", overlaying the outside world. This feature is critical for effective HUDs: not having to refocus between HUD-displayed symbolic information and the outside world onto which that information is overlaid is one of the main advantages of collimated HUDs. It gives HUDs special consideration in safety- critical and time-critical manoeuvers, when the few seconds a pilot needs in order to re-focus inside the cockpit, and then back outside, are very critical: for example, in the final stages of landing. Collimation is therefore a primary distinguishing feature of high-performance HUDs and differentiates them from consumer-quality systems that, for example, simply reflect uncollimated information off a car's windshield (causing drivers to refocus and shift attention from the road ahead). * Eyebox ‚Äì The optical collimator produces a cylinder of parallel light so the display can only be viewed while the viewer's eyes are somewhere within that cylinder, a three- dimensional area called the head motion box or eyebox. Modern HUD eyeboxes are usually about 5 lateral by 3 vertical by 6 longitudinal inches. This allows the viewer some freedom of head movement but movement too far up/down left/right will cause the display to vanish off the edge of the collimator and movement too far back will cause it to crop off around the edge (vignette). The pilot is able to view the entire display as long as one of the eyes is inside the eyebox. * Luminance/contrast ‚Äì Displays have adjustments in luminance and contrast to account for ambient lighting, which can vary widely (e.g., from the glare of bright clouds to moonless night approaches to minimally lit fields). * Boresight ‚Äì Aircraft HUD components are very accurately aligned with the aircraft's three axes ‚Äì a process called boresighting ‚Äì so that displayed data conforms to reality typically with an accuracy of ¬±7.0 milliradians (¬±24 minutes of arc), and may vary across the HUD's FOV. In this case the word \\"conform\\" means, \\"when an object is projected on the combiner and the actual object is visible, they will be aligned\\". This allows the display to show the pilot exactly where the artificial horizon is, as well as the aircraft's projected path with great accuracy. When Enhanced Vision is used, for example, the display of runway lights are aligned with the actual runway lights when the real lights become visible. Boresighting is done during the aircraft's building process and can also be performed in the field on many aircraft. * Scaling ‚Äì The displayed image (flight path, pitch and yaw scaling, etc.), are scaled to present to the pilot a picture that overlays the outside world in an exact 1:1 relationship. For example, objects (such as a runway threshold) that are 3 degrees below the horizon as viewed from the cockpit must appear at the ‚àí3 degree index on the HUD display. * Compatibility ‚Äì HUD components are designed to be compatible with other avionics, displays, etc.  Aircraft  On aircraft avionics systems, HUDs typically operate from dual independent redundant computer systems. They receive input directly from the sensors (pitot-static, gyroscopic, navigation, etc.) aboard the aircraft and perform their own computations rather than receiving previously computed data from the flight computers. On other aircraft (the Boeing 787, for example) the HUD guidance computation for Low Visibility Take-off (LVTO) and low visibility approach comes from the same flight guidance computer that drives the autopilot. Computers are integrated with the aircraft's systems and allow connectivity onto several different data buses such as the ARINC 429, ARINC 629, and MIL-STD-1553.  Displayed data  Typical aircraft HUDs display airspeed, altitude, a horizon line, heading, turn/bank and slip/skid indicators. These instruments are the minimum required by 14 CFR Part 91. Other symbols and data are also available in some HUDs: * boresight or waterline symbol‚Äîis fixed on the display and shows where the nose of the aircraft is actually pointing. * flight path vector (FPV) or velocity vector symbol‚Äîshows where the aircraft is actually going, as opposed to merely where it is pointed as with the boresight. For example, if the aircraft is pitched up but descending as may occur in high angle of attack flight or in flight through descending air, then the FPV symbol will be below the horizon even though the boresight symbol is above the horizon. During approach and landing, a pilot can fly the approach by keeping the FPV symbol at the desired descent angle and touchdown point on the runway. * acceleration indicator or energy cue‚Äîtypically to the left of the FPV symbol, it is above it if the aircraft is accelerating, and below the FPV symbol if decelerating. * angle of attack indicator‚Äîshows the wing's angle relative to the airflow, often displayed as \\"Œ±\\". * navigation data and symbols‚Äîfor approaches and landings, the flight guidance systems can provide visual cues based on navigation aids such as an Instrument Landing System or augmented Global Positioning System such as the Wide Area Augmentation System. Typically this is a circle which fits inside the flight path vector symbol. Pilots can fly along the correct flight path by \\"flying to\\" the guidance cue. Since being introduced on HUDs, both the FPV and acceleration symbols are becoming standard on head-down displays (HDD). The actual form of the FPV symbol on an HDD is not standardized but is usually a simple aircraft drawing, such as a circle with two short angled lines, (180 ¬± 30 degrees) and \\"wings\\" on the ends of the descending line. Keeping the FPV on the horizon allows the pilot to fly level turns in various angles of bank.  Military aircraft specific applications  FA-18 HUD while engaged in a mock dogfight In addition to the generic information described above, military applications include weapons system and sensor data such as: * target designation (TD) indicator‚Äîplaces a cue over an air or ground target (which is typically derived from radar or inertial navigation system data). * Vc‚Äîclosing velocity with target. * Range‚Äîto target, waypoint, etc. * weapon seeker or sensor line of sight‚Äîshows where a seeker or sensor is pointing. * weapon status‚Äîincludes type and number of weapons selected, available, arming, etc.  VTOL/STOL approaches and landings  During the 1980s, the military tested the use of HUDs in vertical take off and landings (VTOL) and short take off and landing (STOL) aircraft. A HUD format was developed at NASA Ames Research Center to provide pilots of V/STOL aircraft with complete flight guidance and control information for Category III C terminal-area flight operations. This includes a large variety of flight operations, from STOL flights on land-based runways to VTOL operations on aircraft carriers. The principal features of this display format are the integration of the flightpath and pursuit guidance information into a narrow field of view, easily assimilated by the pilot with a single glance, and the superposition of vertical and horizontal situation information. The display is a derivative of a successful design developed for conventional transport aircraft.Vernon K. Merrick, Glenn G. Farris, and Andrejs A. Vanags. \\"A Head Up Display for Application to V/STOL Aircraft Approach and Landing\\". NASA Ames Research Center 1990.  Civil aircraft specific applications  The cockpit of NASA's Gulfstream GV with a synthetic vision system display. The HUD combiner is in front of the pilot (with a projector mounted above it). This combiner uses a curved surface to focus the image. The use of head-up displays allows commercial aircraft substantial flexibility in their operations. Systems have been approved which allow reduced-visibility takeoffs, and landings, as well as full Category III A landings and roll-outs.Order: 8700.1 Appendix: 3 Bulletin Type: Flight Standards Handbook Bulletin for General Aviation (HBGA) Bulletin Number: HBGA 99-16 Bulletin Title: Category III Authorization for Parts 91 and 125 Operators with Head-Up Guidance Systems (HGS); LOA and Operations Effective Date: 8-31-99 Falcon 2000 Becomes First Business Jet Certified Category III A by JAA and FAA; Aviation Weeks Show News Online September 7, 1998 Studies have shown that the use of a HUD during landings decreases the lateral deviation from centerline in all landing conditions, although the touchdown point along the centerline is not changed.

Enhanced flight vision systems  thermal image viewed through a head-up display In more advanced systems, such as the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-labeled 'Enhanced Flight Vision System',U.S. DOT/FAA ‚Äì Final Rule: Enhanced Flight Vision Systems www.regulations.gov a real-world visual image can be overlaid onto the combiner. Typically an infrared camera (either single or multi-band) is installed in the nose of the aircraft to display a conformed image to the pilot. 'EVS Enhanced Vision System' is an industry accepted term which the FAA decided not to use because \\"the FAA believes [it] could be confused with the system definition and operational concept found in 91.175(l) and (m)\\" In one EVS installation, the camera is actually installed at the top of the vertical stabilizer rather than \\"as close as practical to the pilots eye position\\". When used with a HUD however, the camera must be mounted as close as possible to the pilots eye point as the image is expected to \\"overlay\\" the real world as the pilot looks through the combiner. \\"Registration,\\" or the accurate overlay of the EVS image with the real world image, is one feature closely examined by authorities prior to approval of a HUD based EVS. This is because of the importance of the HUD matching the real world. While the EVS display can greatly help, the FAA has only relaxed operating regulations14 CFR Part 91.175 change 281 \\"Takeoff and Landing under IFR\\" so an aircraft with EVS can perform a CATEGORY I approach to CATEGORY II minimums. In all other cases the flight crew must comply with all \\"unaided\\" visual restrictions. (For example, if the runway visibility is restricted because of fog, even though EVS may provide a clear visual image it is not appropriate (or legal) to maneuver the aircraft using only the EVS below 100 feet above ground level.)  Synthetic vision systems  A synthetic vision system display HUD systems are also being designed to display a synthetic vision system (SVS) graphic image, which uses high precision navigation, attitude, altitude and terrain databases to create realistic and intuitive views of the outside world.For additional information see Evaluation of Alternate Concepts for Synthetic Vision Flight Displays with Weather-Penetrating Sensor Image Inserts During Simulated Landing Approaches, NASA/TP-2003-212643 In the 1st SVS head down image shown on the right, immediately visible indicators include the airspeed tape on the left, altitude tape on the right, and turn/bank/slip/skid displays at the top center. The boresight symbol (-v-) is in the center and directly below that is the flight path vector (FPV) symbol (the circle with short wings and a vertical stabilizer). The horizon line is visible running across the display with a break at the center, and directly to the left are numbers at ¬±10 degrees with a short line at ¬±5 degrees (the +5 degree line is easier to see) which, along with the horizon line, show the pitch of the aircraft. Unlike this color depiction of SVS on a head down primary flight display, the SVS displayed on a HUD is monochrome ‚Äì that is, typically, in shades of green. The image indicates a wings level aircraft (i.e. the flight path vector symbol is flat relative to the horizon line and there is zero roll on the turn/bank indicator). Airspeed is 140 knots, altitude is 9,450 feet, heading is 343 degrees (the number below the turn/bank indicator). Close inspection of the image shows a small purple circle which is displaced from the flight path vector slightly to the lower right. This is the guidance cue coming from the Flight Guidance System. When stabilized on the approach, this purple symbol should be centered within the FPV. The terrain is entirely computer generated from a high resolution terrain database. In some systems, the SVS will calculate the aircraft's current flight path, or possible flight path (based on an aircraft performance model, the aircraft's current energy, and surrounding terrain) and then turn any obstructions red to alert the flight crew. Such a system might have helped prevent the crash of American Airlines Flight 965 into a mountain in December 1995. On the left side of the display is an SVS-unique symbol, with the appearance of a purple, diminishing sideways ladder, and which continues on the right of the display. The two lines define a \\"tunnel in the sky\\". This symbol defines the desired trajectory of the aircraft in three dimensions. For example, if the pilot had selected an airport to the left, then this symbol would curve off to the left and down. If the pilot keeps the flight path vector alongside the trajectory symbol, the craft will fly the optimum path. This path would be based on information stored in the Flight Management System's database and would show the FAA- approved approach for that airport. The tunnel in the sky can also greatly assist the pilot when more precise four-dimensional flying is required, such as the decreased vertical or horizontal clearance requirements of Required Navigation Performance (RNP). Under such conditions the pilot is given a graphical depiction of where the aircraft should be and where it should be going rather than the pilot having to mentally integrate altitude, airspeed, heading, energy and longitude and latitude to correctly fly the aircraft.  Tanks  In mid-2017, the Israel Defense Forces will begin trials of Elbit's Iron Vision, the world's first helmet-mounted head-up display for tanks. Israel's Elbit, which developed the helmet-mounted display system for the F-35, plans Iron Vision to use a number of externally mounted cameras to project the 360¬∞ view of a tank's surroundings onto the helmet-mounted visors of its crew members. This allows the crew members to stay inside the tank, without having to open the hatches to see outside.IDF to trial Elbit's IronVision in Merkava MBT Peter Felstead, Tel Aviv - IHS Jane's Defence Weekly, 27 March 2017  Automobiles  HUD in a BMW E60 The green arrow on the windshield near the top of this picture is a Head-Up Display on a 2013 Toyota Prius. It toggles between the GPS navigation instruction arrow and the speedometer. The arrow is animated to appear scrolling forward as the car approaches the turn. The image is projected without any kind of glass combiner. These displays are becoming increasingly available in production cars, and usually offer speedometer, tachometer, and navigation system displays. Night vision information is also displayed via HUD on certain automobiles. In contrast to most HUDs found in aircraft, automotive head-up displays are not parallax-free. Add-on HUD systems also exist, projecting the display onto a glass combiner mounted above or below the windshield, or using the windshield itself as the combiner. In 2012 Pioneer Corporation introduced a HUD navigation system that replaces the driver side sun visor and visually overlays animations of conditions ahead; a form of augmented reality (AR).Pioneer launches car navigation with augmented reality, heads-up displays System also uses dash cams to share images of street conditions across Japan.

AR-HUD's core technology involves a miniature laser beam scanning display developed by MicroVision, Inc.Freeman, Champion, Madhaven‚ÄîScanned Laser Pico-Projectors: Seeing the Big Picture (with a Small Device) http://www.microvision.com/wp- content/uploads/2014/07/OPN_Article.pdf. Motorcycle helmet HUDs are also commercially available. Uniti electric city car will replace the dashboard with a large HUD to display information directly on the windscreen. The purpose is to increase safety as the driver will not have to move his eyes out from the road to look at the speed or the GPS screen. In recent years, it has been argued that conventional HUDs will be replaced by holographic AR technologies, such as the ones developed by WayRay that use holographic optical elements (HOE). The HOE allows for a wider field of view while reducing the size of the device and making the solution customizable for any car model. Mercedes Benz introduced an Augmented Reality based Head Up Displayhttps://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/07/augmented-reality-heads-up- displays-for-cars-are-finally-a-real-thing/ while Faurecia invested in an eye gaze and finger controlled head up display.  Developmental / experimental uses  HUDs have been proposed or are being experimentally developed for a number of other applications. In the military, a HUD can be used to overlay tactical information such as the output of a laser rangefinder or squadmate locations to infantrymen. A prototype HUD has also been developed that displays information on the inside of a swimmer's goggles or of a scuba diver's mask. HUD systems that project information directly onto the wearer's retina with a low-powered laser (virtual retinal display) are also in experimentation.

The Rossby number is the ratio of inertial force to Coriolis force, terms \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\cdot abla \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\sim U^2 / L and \\\\Omega \\\\times \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\sim U\\\\Omega in the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations respectively. It is commonly used in geophysical phenomena in the oceans and atmosphere, where it characterizes the importance of Coriolis accelerations arising from planetary rotation. It is also known as the Kibel number. The Rossby number (Ro, not Ro) is defined as : \\\\text{Ro} = \\\\frac{U}{Lf}, where U and L are respectively characteristic velocity and length scales of the phenomenon, and f = 2\\\\Omega \\\\sin \\\\phi is the Coriolis frequency, with \\\\Omega being the angular frequency of planetary rotation, and \\\\phi the latitude. A small Rossby number signifies a system strongly affected by Coriolis forces, and a large Rossby number signifies a system, in which inertial and centrifugal forces dominate. For example, in tornadoes, the Rossby number is large (‚âà 103), in low-pressure systems it is low (‚âà 0.1‚Äì1), and in oceanic systems it is of the order of unity, but depending on the phenomena can range over several orders of magnitude (‚âà 10‚àí2‚Äì102). As a result, in tornadoes the Coriolis force is negligible, and balance is between pressure and centrifugal forces (called cyclostrophic balance). Cyclostrophic balance also commonly occurs in the inner core of a tropical cyclone. In low- pressure systems, centrifugal force is negligible, and balance is between Coriolis and pressure forces (called geostrophic balance). In the oceans all three forces are comparable (called cyclogeostrophic balance). For a figure showing spatial and temporal scales of motions in the atmosphere and oceans, see Kantha and Clayson. When the Rossby number is large (either because f is small, such as in the tropics and at lower latitudes; or because L is small, that is, for small-scale motions such as flow in a bathtub; or for large speeds), the effects of planetary rotation are unimportant and can be neglected. When the Rossby number is small, then the effects of planetary rotation are large, and the net acceleration is comparably small, allowing the use of the geostrophic approximation.

Baron Dudley is a title in the Peerage of England. It was created in circa 1440 for John Sutton, a soldier who served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. The title descended in the Sutton family until the 17th century when Frances Sutton, the heir apparent to the title, married Humble Ward, who, himself, was granted the title Baron Ward in 1644. Their heirs inherited both titles until 1740 when the differing rules of inheritance meant that the Barony of Dudley descended on Ferdinando Dudley Lea, who became the 11th Baron whilst the Barony of Ward went to John Ward, who later became 1st Viscount Dudley and Ward. On Ferdinando's death in 1757, the title fell into abeyance. The title was revived in 1916. History Baron Dudley is a title in the Peerage of England. It was created in circa 1440 for John Sutton, a soldier who served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. According to Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage he was actually summoned to Parliament as \\"Johanni de Sutton de Duddeley militi\\", whereby he is held to have become Baron Dudley. The title is sometime referred to as Baron Sutton of Dudley. The peerage was created by writ, which means that it can descend through both male and female lines. It is in fact arguable that the title arose even earlier, as his ancestor John Sutton (died 1359) had a writ of summons to the Council on 25 February 1342, but neither he nor his son (died ), grandson (died 10 March 1396) or great grandson (all called John Sutton of Dudley) were summoned,Burkes' Peerage s.v. Dudley, Baron; Cokayne, The Complete Peerage, new edition. so that they can probably not be regarded as peers. Lord Dudley's great grandson, the third Baron, managed to get himself severely into debt and lost the family seat of Dudley Castle to his cousin John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland. He became known as \\"Lord Quondam\\" (\\"Lord Has-been\\" or \\"Lord Formerly\\"). However, Dudley Castle and the other family estates were restored to his son, the fourth Baron. He was succeeded by his son, the fifth Baron, who like his grandfather came heavily into debt. To clear his debts he married off his granddaughter and heir, Frances, to Sir Humble Ward, the son of a wealthy jeweller. Frances succeeded him and became the sixth holder of the title. In 1644 her husband Humble Ward was created Baron Ward, of Birmingham in the County of Warwick, by letters patent. They were both succeeded by their son, the seventh and second Baron respectively. On the death in 1740 of the latter's grandson, the tenth Baron Dudley and fifth Baron Ward, the two titles separated. The barony of Ward, which could only be inherited by males, was passed on to the late Baron's kinsman, the sixth Baron (see the Earl of Dudley for later history of this title). The barony of Dudley was inherited by the Baron's nephew, Ferdinando Dudley Lea, 11th Baron Dudley. He was the son of Frances, sister of the tenth Baron, and her husband William Lea. However, on Ferdinando's death in 1757 the peerage fell into abeyance between his sisters. The title remained in abeyance for 159 years. In 1869, Bernard Burke, who researched some of the co-heirs of the title during the period of abeyance, wrote of the Barony: \\"where can we find a more striking contrast than this mournful tale of the Barony of Dudley? The history of that famous title would, in its first chapter, speak of chivalry, warlike achievement, and magnificent hospitality in the ancient castle from which the Barony took its name. The last chapter would tell the story of the Halesowen farmer, the custom-house clerk, and the toll-bar-keeper, all resident within range of that very castle.\\" In 1916 the abeyance was terminated in favour of Ferdinando Dudley William Lea Smith, who became the twelfth Baron. He was the great-great- grandson of Anne, sister of the eleventh Baron, and her husband William Smith. the title is held by his grandson, the fifteenth Baron, who succeeded his mother in 2002 (who in her turn had succeeded her younger brother). The holders of the title (until 1740) were the owners of Dudley Castle and an extensive estate around it, including the manors of Dudley, Sedgley, Kingswinford and Rowley Somery in Rowley Regis. By the 16th century, their main home was Himley Hall. On the death of the tenth Baron in 1740, the barony of Dudley passed to a female-line heir (see above), whereas the main estates were entailed to follow the barony of Ward and passed to a cousin. However, certain estates that had recently been purchased passed with the title Lord Dudley to the aforementioned Ferdinando Dudley Lea, the eleventh Baron Dudley. The family surname of the first five barons was formally 'Sutton', but in practice they seem always to have been called 'Dudley'. In title deeds and other formal documents, the surname often appears as 'Sutton otherwise Dudley'.

He was born in the late Eastern Han dynasty and used to be a vigilante swordsman in his early life. However, after running into trouble with the authorities, he renounced his old ways and took up scholarly pursuits. He lived a reclusive life from the 190s to mid-200s in Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan provinces), where he met and befriended Zhuge Liang. In late 207, he became an adviser to the warlord Liu Bei and served under Liu for about a year. He also recommended Zhuge Liang to Liu Bei during this period of time. In late 208, Liu Bei was defeated at the Battle of Changban by his rival Cao Cao. Xu Shu's mother was captured by Cao Cao's forces during the battle. Feeling lost and without a sense of direction, Xu Shu eventually left Liu Bei and joined Cao Cao. He continued serving in the state of Cao Wei ‚Äì founded by Cao Cao's son and successor, Cao Pi, who ended the Eastern Han dynasty ‚Äì and died of illness in office. Xu Shu's defection from Liu Bei to Cao Cao was fictionalised in the historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms. In the novel, he was Liu Bei's chief strategist before Zhuge Liang came along, and he once helped Liu Bei repel two attacks from Cao Cao's general Cao Ren.

In Romance of the Three Kingdoms An illustration \\"Xu Shu recommends Zhuge (Liang) while on horseback\\" (Ëµ∞È¶¨Ëñ¶Ë´∏Ëëõ) at the Long Corridor of the Summer Palace, Beijing. Xu Shu is featured as a fairly prominent character in the historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which romanticises the historical events before and during the Three Kingdoms period. He appeared mainly in chapters 35‚Äì36, in which he served as Liu Bei's strategist before Zhuge Liang came along. Xu Shu was singing on the streets of Xinye when Liu Bei noticed him and asked him if he was either the \\"Crouching Dragon\\" or the \\"Young Phoenix\\" that Sima Hui spoke of. However, Xu Shu told Liu Bei that he was neither of them. He agreed to become Liu Bei's strategist and helped Liu counter an invading army led by Cao Cao's general Cao Ren. Cao Ren deployed his troops in an \\"Eight Gates Golden Locks Formation\\" (ÂÖ´ÈñÄÈáëÈéñÈô£) outside Xinye, but Xu Shu pointed out the weaknesses in the formation and instructed Liu's general Zhao Yun on how to break it. Zhao Yun led his men to attack the formation and succeeded in breaking it and defeating Cao Ren. Xu Shu also accurately predicted that Cao Ren would launch a surprise attack that night after his defeat. Liu Bei defeated Cao Ren again in the night battle and forced Cao Ren to retreat. Cao Cao was impressed when he heard about Xu Shu and was eager to recruit Xu as an adviser. He invited Xu Shu's mother to meet him and asked her to write a letter to her son, requesting that her son come to join him. Xu Shu's mother refused, denounced Cao Cao as a treacherous villain, and threw an ink stone at him. The furious Cao Cao ordered Xu Shu's mother to be executed but changed his mind when Cheng Yu reminded him that Xu Shu would be more determined to help Liu Bei oppose him if he killed his mother. Cao Cao then had Xu Shu's mother detained and asked Cheng Yu to pretend to be Xu Shu's sworn brother to win the trust of Xu's mother. After some time, Cheng Yu got close to Xu Shu's mother and learnt to mimic her handwriting. He wrote a letter to Xu Shu in the handwriting of Xu's mother, telling Xu that she was in trouble and urging him to come to the imperial capital Xu (Ë®±; present-day Xuchang, Henan) quickly. Xu Shu was a filial son so he immediately left for Xu after reading the letter. Xu Shu was in a hurry when he sped off on horseback. On the way, he suddenly remembered something and immediately turned back to meet Liu Bei and recommend Zhuge Liang to him. He then resumed his journey to Xu. When he arrived at his destination, he was shocked to discover that he had been tricked. His mother was furious with her son's failure to discern between truth and deception, and ashamed by the fact that her son joined Cao Cao instead of Liu Bei. She committed suicide. Xu Shu remained with Cao Cao, but he swore never to give advice to Cao.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 35-36. The Chinese saying \\"His body is in (Cao) Cao's camp, but his heart is actually with the Han (dynasty)\\" () is derived from this story about Xu Shu and another story about Guan Yu in Romance of the Three Kingdoms. It is used to describe a situation where a person who ostensibly works for a \\"bad\\" organisation is actually loyal towards another \\"good\\" organisation. In popular culture Xu Shu is first introduced as a playable character in Dynasty Warriors 7: Empires of Koei's Dynasty Warriors video game series.

He has spent his entire career at the BBC from where he stepped down as Creative Director in December 2015 and served as chairman of the board of trustees for Kids Company from 2003 until the collapse of the charity in 2015. Early life Alan Yentob was born into an Iraqi Jewish family in Stepney, London. Soon after he was born, his family moved to Manchester where his father was in business with his wife's family the Khazams. One example of this collaboration were dealings in Haighton Holdings, published 1951, that shows involvement of his mother Flora, father Isaac and uncle Nadji Khazam. Together they were involved in the UK with various other textile manufacturers plus wholesalers such as Spencer, Turner & Boldero and Jeremiah Rotherham & Co. The families also had dealings in South Africa with their holding company Anglo-African Investments.Don Wilkinson Local takeover of Khazam Yentob group rumoured The Citizen, Johannesburg, DTIC ADA346221: Sub-Saharan Africa Report, No. 2830, P.111' 28 June 1983 The public companies were eventually shed and a few consolidated into Dewhurst Dent, in which Alan Yentob still owns a 10% share. He grew up in Didsbury, a suburb of Manchester, and returned to London with his family when he was 12 to live in a flat on Park Lane. He was a boarder at the independent King's School in Ely, Cambridgeshire. He passed his A Levels and studied at the Sorbonne in Paris and spent a year at Grenoble University. He went on to study Law at Leeds University, where he got involved in student drama. He graduated with a lower second class degree (2:2) in 1967. Career Yentob joined the BBC as a trainee in the BBC World Service in 1968 as its only non-Oxbridge graduate of that year. Nine months later he moved into TV to become an assistant director on arts programmes. In 1973, he became a producer and director, working on the high-profile documentary series Omnibus, for which, in 1975, he made a film called Cracked Actor about the musician David Bowie. In 1975, he helped initiate another BBC documentary series, Arena, of which he was to remain the editor until 1985. The series still returns for semi-regular editions . He left Arena to become the BBC's head of Music and Arts, a position he occupied until 1987, when he was promoted to controller of BBC 2, one of the youngest channel controllers in the BBC's history. Under Yentob's five-year stewardship BBC2 was re-vitalised and he introduced many innovations in programming such as The Late Show, Have I Got News for You, Absolutely Fabulous and Wallace and Gromits The Wrong Trousers. In 1993 he was promoted to Controller of BBC 1, responsible for the output of the BBC's premier channel. He remained in the post for three years until 1996, when he was promoted again to become BBC Television's overall Director of Programmes. This appointment was only a brief one, however, before a re-organisation of the BBC's Executive Committee led to the creation of a new post, filled by Yentob, of Director of Drama, Entertainment and Children's.\\"Alan Yentob, Creative Director\\", BBC. Retrieved 4 January 2018. This placed Yentob in overall supervision of the BBC's output in these three genres across all media ‚Äì radio, television and Internet. He occupied this post until June 2004, when new BBC Director-General Mark Thompson re-organised the BBC's executive committee and promoted Yentob to the new post of BBC Creative Director, responsible for overseeing BBC creative output across television, radio and interactive services. He also began to present BBC programmes. These have included a series on the life of Leonardo da Vinci and, from 2003, a new regular arts series, Imagine. One episode of Imagine has Yentob explore the World Wide Web, blogging, user-created content, and even the use of English Wikipedia, exploring people's motives and satisfaction that can be had from sharing information on such a large scale. His own blog, created during the making of the episode, was subsequently deleted and purged. In 2007, Yentob appeared as the 'host' of the satirical Imagine a Mildly Amusing Panel Show, a spoof Imagine... episode focused on the comedy panel game Never Mind the Buzzcocks. Yentob's reputation was affected when it was revealed that his participation in some of the interviews for Imagine had been faked. Yentob has been warned not to do this again, but otherwise not disciplined, much to the disgruntlement of some who have seen more junior staff lose their jobs for lesser misdemeanours. In 2005, Yentob was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Letters from De Montfort University, Leicester. On 17 March 2010, Yentob and Nigella Lawson opened the Jewish Museum London in Camden Town. In July 2009 he was revealed to have accumulated a pension worth ¬£6.3m, giving an annual retirement income of ¬£216,667 for the rest of his life. This is one of the biggest pensions in the public sector. He earns ¬£200,000 ‚Äì ¬£249,999 as a BBC contributor and presenter. He is paid a declared salary of ¬£183,000 by the BBC, but additional income from the BBC for presenting and other roles is reputed to earn him an extra ¬£150,000, bringing his BBC income to an estimated ¬£330,000. He has been on the Board of Trustees of the Architecture Foundation. He has been involved with several charities, including the posts of chairman and trustee of Kids Company. Yentob resigned as the BBC's creative director on 3 December 2015 in the wake of allegations that he had sought to influence the BBC's coverage of the Kids Company scandal. Kids Company Yentob's role as chairman of the board of trustees for Kids Company (founded by Camila Batmanghelidjh) has come under close scrutiny since the collapse of the charity in early August 2015. He has been accused of multiple shortcomings in oversight and financial management, and of failing to ensure that he avoided a conflict of interest with his position at the BBC. It has been alleged that he intervened there in an attempt to deflect criticism of Kids Company and its founder Batmanghelidjh. Yentob vigorously defended his actions and stated in August 2015 that he was \\"not remotely considering\\" resigning over his behaviour. However, he resigned on 3 December 2015. Interventions at the BBC Yentob has acknowledged that he stood in the studio of the Today programme while Batmanghelidjih was being interviewed in July, later saying that he wished to hear what she had to say and was not attempting to intimidate staff. He also telephoned a senior member of staff at Newsnight, asking the programme to \\"delay a report critical of financial management at Kids Company\\", and telephoned the Radio 4 presenter Ed Stourton before a report in The World at One. The BBC Trust, under chairwoman Rona Fairhead, investigated these interventions, although senior BBC management were reported to have reassured the Trust that they did not compromise editorial independence at the BBC. \\"Descent into savagery\\" Yentob has acknowledged signing an email from Kids Company to the government which sought millions in further funding by suggesting certain communities in London might \\"descend into savagery\\" if Kids Company ceased its operations. The email, which was subsequently leaked to BuzzFeed News and the BBC's Newsnight programme, spoke of \\"looting, rioting and arson attacks on government buildings\\" and warned of possible sharp spikes in \\"starvation and modern-day slavery\\". It said that these concerns were \\"not hypothetical, but based on a deep understanding of the socio-psychological background that these children operate within\\". Yentob said this email \\"was not intended in any way as a threat.\\" Appearance before select committee On 15 October 2015 Yentob and Batmangheldijh made a joint appearance before a parliamentary select committee investigating the charity's collapse. Their performance was widely described as disastrous. In the New Statesman, the political commentator Anoosh Chakelian said they were a \\"duo of epically proportioned egos\\" who made \\"as little sense ‚Äì and as many accusations ‚Äì as possible\\" before the panel of MPs. In The Daily Telegraph, the parliamentary sketch writer Michael Deacon called their appearance the \\"single weirdest event in recent parliamentary history\\" and wrote of \\"three solid hours of bewildering excuses, recriminations and non-sequiturs\\". Criticism from PACAC The Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee report heavily criticised Yentob. He was described as someone who condoned excessive spending and lacked proper attention to his duties. The BBC is also accused of poor leadership for failing to take action against him when he tried to make suggestions about the BBC's reporting of Kids Company. Personal life Yentob is married to Philippa Walker, a television producer. He has two children, Isabella and Jacob.15 November 2004 The Alan Yentob Experience, Media, News, The Independent ReferencesExternal links * * BBC Imagine site Category:Alumni of the University of Leeds Category:English Jews Category:1947 births Category:Living people Category:BBC executives Category:BBC One controllers Category:BBC Two controllers Category:People from Stepney Category:English people of Iraqi-Jewish descent Category:Businesspeople from London Category:People educated at The King's School, Ely Category:Grenoble Alpes University alumni ","title":"Alan Yentob"},{"id":"459440","text":"The Sierra de San Pedro M√°rtir, with Picacho del Diablo (center).

Elsewhere in Canada, the titular designation \\"Member of Provincial Parliament\\" has also been used to refer to the members of the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada from 1791 to 1838, and the members of the Legislative Assembly of Quebec from 1955 to 1968.  Ontario  The titular designation \\"Member of Provincial Parliament\\" and the initialism \\"MPP\\" were formally adopted by the Legislature on April 7, 1938. Prior to the adoption of this resolution, members had no fixed designation. Prior to Confederation members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada had been known by various titles including MPP, MLA and MHA and this confusion persisted after 1867 with members of the Ontario legislature using the titles Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) or Members of Provincial Parliament (MPPs) interchangeably. In 1938, Frederick Fraser Hunter, the Member for St. Patrick, introduced a private member's bill to designate members as Members of Parliament (MPs) arguing that the titles of MPP or MLA were confusing, inaccurate, and undignified. However, his original proposal failed to pass and as an alternative a resolution was adopted fixing the title as Members of Provincial Parliament (MPP). The text of the resolution passed by the House on that day is as follows: > On motion of Mr. Hunter, seconded by Mr. Miller, > > Resolved, That in all matters of address, titular distinction, formal > correspondence, official proceedings and all similar matters having to do > with and coming under the jurisdiction of the Legislature of Ontario, the > members of the Legislative Assembly shall be entitled to the designation > \\"Member of Provincial Parliament\\" and its abbreviation \\"M.P.P.\\"Journals of > the Legislative Assembly of Ontario (April 7, 1938)  Quebec  In Quebec, a bill to adopt the titular designation \\"Member of Provincial Parliament\\" (fr:membre du Parlement provincial) and the initialism \\"MPP\\" (fr:M.P.P.) was assented on December 15, 1955. Like in Ontario, members had no fixed designation prior to this bill's adoption, although they were usually referred to as \\"Members of the Legislative Assembly\\" (MLAs) (fr:membres de l'Assembl√©e l√©gislative (M.A.L.s)). The bill to change the titular designation was supported by Quebec premier Maurice Duplessis, who gave a speech in support of it in the legislative assembly. The reasons he gave for this change were the following: # The French acronym for \\"Member of the Legislative Assembly\\" (M.A.L.) can sometimes be pronounced as \\"mal\\", which means \\"evil\\" in French. # Quebec's legislature has all the fiscal and constitutional prerogatives to be considered a \\"Parliament\\", and the new designation would better reflect that. # The new designation would be a return to the original designation used before confederation. # The Acronym MPP is the same in French and in English. The designation was changed again in 1968 when the National Assembly of Quebec was renamed. The member's titular designation was \\"Member of the Quebec Parliament\\" (MQP)(fr:membre du Parlement du Qu√©bec (M.P.Q)) from 1968 to 1971, then \\"Member of the National Assembly\\" (MNA) (fr:membres de l'Assembl√©e Nationale (M.A.N.) from 1971 to 1982. The designation \\"Member of the National Assembly\\" is still used in English, but the French titular designation was abolished, and MNAs are now simply referred to as \\"d√©put√©\\".

For most of his life, he was active in Liang Province (Ê∂ºÂ∑û; covering parts of present-day Shaanxi and Gansu) and was involved in several rebellions against the Han government and the warlord Cao Cao. Life Map showing the major warlords of the Han dynasty in the 190s, including Han Sui With the backing of the Qiang people who populated much of Liang Province, Han Sui participated in the Liang Province Rebellion against the Han dynasty during the rule of Emperor Ling. He joined forces with others in the area, such as Bian Zhang, Beigong Yu (ÂåóÂÆ´Áéâ) and Liwen Hou (ÊùéÊñá‰æØ). Despite suffering a defeat by government forces under Dong Zhuo, Han Sui maintained the support of the Qiang people and maintained his territory in Liang Province. Han Sui is thought to have preferred to remain somewhat behind the scenes, placing someone else in the position of leadership while holding real power himself. When Bian Zhang and the other leaders passed from the scene, he placed Wang Guo (ÁéãÂúã) in power with the help of his ally Ma Teng, whom he pledged a pact of brotherhood with. The arrangement did not last long, however, and Wang Guo was removed from power after being defeated by the Han general Huangfu Song. It was at this point that Ma Teng and Han Sui declared themselves co-rulers of Liang Province, now mostly autonomous due to turmoil in the Han dynasty. Early in 192, the two of them submitted to the Han central government, then under Dong Zhuo's control, but Dong Zhuo was assassinated by L√º Bu and Wang Yun in April. After Li Jue, Guo Si and other former followers of Dong Zhuo seized control of the Han central government later that year, Han Sui and Ma Teng allied themselves with Liu Yan and led their armies to attack the Han imperial capital, Chang'an. After suffering a major defeat 13 miles west of Chang'an, and running short on supplies, the warlords retreated back to Liang Province. Not long afterward, however, Han Sui and Ma Teng's relationship soured and the two of them battled each other for control of Liang Province. Their battle escalated to the point where both were killing each other's wives and children. Cao Cao, having achieved victory at the Battle of Guandu in 200CE, sent Zhong Yao to broker a peace between the two sides and to place Liang Province under Cao Cao's authority. After the terms were agreed to, Han Sui and Ma Teng would give assistance to Cao Cao in the remainder of his battles against Yuan Shao. After this, Ma Teng was forcibly summoned to Ye and Han Sui placed Ma Teng's son Ma Chao in charge of Liang Province. When Cao Cao began gathering armies with the intent of invading Hanzhong Commandery, then under the rule of Zhang Lu, Han Sui and Ma Chao suspected that it was they, and not Zhang Lu who would be attacked. The two of them gathered warlords from the western regions and went to war against Cao Cao. In the course of the conflict, however, Cao Cao managed to turn Ma Chao and Han Sui against each other. Han Sui realised that there was no hope for victory with the forces divided against each other in suspicion, and retreated once again to Liang Province. Cao Cao captured and killed Han Sui's children and grandchildren. When Xiahou Yuan began his subjugation of Liang Province, Han Sui fought against this, but was ultimately defeated and forced to retreat. He discussed the idea of retreating to Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing), but his subordinate Cheng Gongying encouraged him to continue his fight against Cao Cao instead. At this point, he was either murdered by some of his own followers or died of illness. In either case, his head was brought to Cao Cao by Han Sui's subordinates as they all surrendered. He was believed to have been over 70 years old at the time of his death. In Romance of the Three Kingdoms In the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Han Sui is depicted as Ma Teng's sworn brother and subordinate, when historically he was actually a warlord of equal footing as Ma Teng. Han Sui's preference to remain out of the scenes may have been a reason for this depiction. In the novel, during Ma Chao's battles against Cao Cao's forces, Han Sui has eight elite officers serving under him. After Cao Cao successfully used a scheme to turn Ma Chao and Han Sui against each other, Ma Chao grew suspicious of Han Sui and attacked him, cutting off his left arm in the process. Han Sui managed to escape and defect to Cao Cao, who accepted his surrender and allowed him to continue serving as a general in Liang Province alongside Xiahou Yuan.

The first castle on the site was built by the Normans after 1081, to protect the newly conquered town of Cardiff and control the route along the Taff Gorge. Abandoned shortly afterwards, the castle's earth motte was reused by Gilbert de Clare as the basis for a new stone fortification, which he built between 1267 and 1277 to control his freshly annexed Welsh lands. This castle was likely destroyed in the native Welsh rebellion of 1314. In 1760, the castle ruins were acquired by John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute, as part of a marriage settlement that brought the family vast estates in South Wales. John Crichton-Stuart, the 3rd Marquess of Bute, inherited the castle in 1848. One of Britain's wealthiest men, with interests in architecture and antiquarian studies, he employed the architect William Burges to reconstruct the castle, \\"as a country residence for occasional occupation in the summer\\", using the medieval remains as a basis for the design. Burges rebuilt the outside of the castle between 1875 and 1879, before turning to the interior; he died in 1881 and the work was finished by Burges's remaining team in 1891. Bute reintroduced commercial viticulture into Britain, planting a vineyard just below the castle, and wine production continued until the First World War. The Marquess made little use of his new retreat and in 1950 his grandson, the 5th Marquess of Bute, placed it into the care of the state. It is now controlled by the Welsh heritage agency Cadw. Castell Coch's external features and the High Victorian interiors led the historian David McLees to describe it as \\"one of the greatest Victorian triumphs of architectural composition.\\" The exterior, based on 19th- century studies by the antiquarian George Clark, is relatively authentic in style, although its three stone towers were adapted by Burges to present a dramatic silhouette, closer in design to mainland European castles such as Chillon than native British fortifications. The interiors were elaborately decorated, with specially designed furniture and fittings; the designs include extensive use of symbolism drawing on classical and legendary themes. Joseph Mordaunt Crook wrote that the castle represented \\"the learned dream world of a great patron and his favourite architect, recreating from a heap of rubble a fairy-tale castle which seems almost to have materialised from the margins of a medieval manuscript.\\" The surrounding beech woods contain rare plant species and unusual geological features and are protected as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. History=11th‚Äì14th centuries Julius Caesar Ibbetson's 1808 painting of the medieval ruins, based on his 1792 watercolour The first castle on the Castell Coch site was probably built after 1081, during the Norman invasion of Wales. It formed one of a string of eight fortifications intended to defend the newly conquered town of Cardiff and control the route along the Taff Gorge. It took the form of a raised, earth- work motte, about across at the base and on the top, protected by the surrounding steep slopes. The 16th-century historian Rice Merrick claimed that the castle was built by the Welsh lord Ifor ap Meurig, but there are no records of this phase of the castle's history and modern historians doubt this account. The first castle was probably abandoned after 1093 when the Norman lordship of Glamorgan was created, changing the line of the frontier. In 1267, Gilbert de Clare, who held the Lordship of Glamorgan, seized the lands around the town of Senghenydd in the north of Glamorgan from their native Welsh ruler. Caerphilly Castle was built to control the new territory and Castell Coch‚Äîstrategically located between Cardiff and Caerphilly‚Äîwas reoccupied. A new castle was built in stone around the motte, comprising a shell-wall, a projecting circular tower, a gatehouse and a square hall above an undercroft. The north-west section of the walls was protected by a talus and the sides of the motte were scarped to increase their angle, all producing a small but powerful fortification. Further work followed between 1268 and 1277, which added two large towers, a turning-bridge for the gatehouse and further protection to the north-west walls. On Gilbert's death, the castle passed to his widow Joan and around this time it was referred to as Castrum Rubeum, Latin for \\"the Red Castle\\", probably after the colour of the Red sandstone defences. Gilbert's son, also named Gilbert, inherited the property in 1307. He died at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, triggering an uprising of the native Welsh in the region. Castell Coch was probably destroyed by the rebels in July 1314, and possibly slighted to put it beyond any further use; it was not rebuilt and the site was abandoned. 15th‚Äì19th centuriesBute ownership= William Burges's plans for the reconstruction, showing the surviving medieval features (bottom) and his intentions for the new building (top) Castell Coch remained derelict; the antiquarian John Leland, visiting around 1536, described it as \\"all in ruin, no big thing but high\\". The artist and illustrator Julius Caesar Ibbetson painted the castle in 1792, depicting substantial remains and a prominent tower, with a lime kiln in operation alongside the fortification. Stone from the castle may have been robbed and used to feed the kilns during this period. A similar view was sketched by an unknown artist in the early 19th century, showing more trees around the ruins; a few years later, Robert Drane recommended the site as a place for picnics and noted its abundance in wild garlic. The ruins were acquired by the Earls of Bute in 1760, when John Stuart, the 3rd Earl and, from 1794, the 1st Marquess, married Lady Charlotte Windsor, adding her estates in South Wales to his inheritance. John's grandson, John Crichton-Stuart, developed the Cardiff Docks in the first half of the 19th century; although the docks were not especially profitable, they opened opportunities for the expansion of the coal industry in the South Wales valleys, making the Bute family extremely wealthy. The 2nd Marquess carried out exploration for iron ore at Castell Coch in 1827 and considered establishing an ironworks there. The 3rd Marquess of Bute, another John Crichton-Stuart, inherited the castle and the family estates as a child in 1848. On his coming of age, Bute's landed estates and industrial inheritance made him one of the wealthiest men in the world. He had a wide range of interests including archaeology, theology, linguistics and history. Interest in medieval architecture increased in Britain during the 19th century, and in 1850 the antiquarian George Clark surveyed Castell Coch and published his findings, the first major scholarly work about the castle. The ruins were covered in rubble, ivy, brushwood and weeds; the keep had been largely destroyed and the gatehouse was so covered with debris that Clark failed to discover it. Nonetheless, Clark considered the external walls \\"tolerably perfect\\" and advised that the castle be conserved, complete with the ivy-covered stonework. In 1871, Bute asked his chief Cardiff engineer, John McConnochie, to excavate and clear the castle ruins. The report on the investigations was produced by William Burges, an architect with an interest in medieval architecture who had met Bute in 1865. The Marquess subsequently employed him to redevelop Cardiff Castle in the late 1860s, and the two men became close collaborators. Burges's lavishly illustrated report, which drew extensively on Clark's earlier work, laid out two options: either conserve the ruins or rebuild the castle to create a house for occasional occupation in the summer. On receipt of the report, Bute commissioned Burges to rebuild Castle Coch in a Gothic Revival style. =Reconstruction= Reconstruction of the castle in 1875, with a temporary bridge across the ditch (left) and the ruined Well Tower (right) The reconstruction of Castell Coch was delayed until 1875, because of the demands of work at Cardiff Castle and an unfounded concern by the Marquess's trustees that he was facing bankruptcy. On commencement, the Kitchen Tower, Hall Block and shell wall were rebuilt first, followed by the Well Tower and the Gatehouse, and the Keep Tower last. Burges's drawings for the proposed rebuilding survive at the Bute seat of Mount Stuart. The drawings were supplemented by a large number of wooden and plaster models, from smaller pieces to full-size models of furniture. The bulk of the external work was complete by the end of 1879. The result closely followed Burges's original plans, with the exception of an additional watch tower intended to resemble a minaret, and some defensive timber hoardings, both of which were not undertaken. Clark continued to advise Burges on historical aspects of the reconstruction and the architect tested the details of proposed features, such as the drawbridge and portcullis, against surviving designs at other British castles. Burges's team of craftsmen at Castell Coch included many who had worked with him at Cardiff Castle and elsewhere. John Chapple, his office manager, designed most of the furnishings and furniture, and William Frame acted as clerk of works. Horatio Lonsdale was Burges's chief artist, painting extensive murals at the castle. His main sculptor was Thomas Nicholls, together with another long-time collaborator, the Italian sculptor Ceccardo Fucigna. Stimulated by antiquarian writings about British viticulture, Bute decided to reintroduce commercial grape vines into Britain in 1873. He sent his gardener Andrew Pettigrew to France for training and planted a vineyard just beneath the castle in 1875. The first harvests were poor and the initial harvest in 1877 produced only 240 bottles. Punch magazine claimed that any wine produced would be so unpleasant that \\"it would take four men to drink it‚Äîtwo to hold the victim and one to pour the wine down his throat\\". By 1887, the output was 3,000 bottles of sweet white wine of reasonable quality. Bute persevered, commercial success followed and 40 hogsheads of wine, including a red varietal using Gamay grapes, were produced annually by 1894 to positive reviews. Burges died in 1881 after catching a severe chill during a site visit to the castle. His brother-in-law, the architect Richard Pullan, took over the commission and delegated most of the work to Frame, who directed the work on the interior until its completion in 1891. Bute and his wife Gwendolen were consulted over the details of the interior decoration; replica family portraits based on those at Cardiff were commissioned to hang on the walls. Clark approved of the result, commenting in 1884 that the restoration was in \\"excellent taste\\". An oratory originally built on the roof of the Well Tower was removed before 1891 but in other respects the completed castle was left unaltered. The castle was not greatly used; the Marquess rarely visited after its completion. The property had probably only been intended for limited, informal use, for example as a retreat following picnics. Although it had reception rooms suitable for large gatherings, it had only three bedrooms and was too far from Cardiff for casual visits. The restored castle initially received little interest from the architectural community, possibly because the total rebuilding of the castle ran counter to the increasingly popular late-Victorian philosophy of conserving older buildings and monuments. 20th‚Äì21st centuries The courtyard Bute died in 1900 and his widow, the Marchioness, was given a life interest in Castell Coch; during her mourning, she and her daughter, Lady Margaret Crichton-Stuart, occupied the castle and made occasional visits thereafter. Production in the castle vineyards ceased during the First World War due to the shortages of the sugar needed for the fermentation process, and in 1920 the vineyards were uprooted. John, the 4th Marquess, acquired the castle in 1932 but made little use of it. He also began to reduce the family's investments in South Wales. The coal trade had declined after 1918 and industry had suffered during the depression of the 1920s; by 1938, the great majority of the family interests, including the coal mines and docks, had been sold off or nationalised. The 5th Marquess of Bute, another John, succeeded in 1947 and, in 1950, he placed the castle in the care of the Ministry of Works. The Marquess also disposed of Cardiff Castle, which he gave to the city, removing the family portraits from the castle before doing so. In turn, the paintings in Castell Coch were removed by the ministry and sent to Cardiff, the National Museum of Wales providing alternatives from their collection for Castell Coch. Academic interest in the property grew, with publications in the 1950s and 1960s exploring its artistic and architectural value. Since 1984, the property has been administered by Cadw, an agency of the Welsh Government, and is open to the public; it received 69,466 visitors in 2011. The Drawing Room is available for wedding ceremonies. The castle has also been used as a location for filming. The castle's exposed position causes it to suffer from penetrating damp and periodic restoration work has been necessary. The stone tiles on the roof were replaced by slate in 1972, a major programme was carried out on the Keep in 2007 and interior conservation work was undertaken in 2011 to address problems in Lady Bute's Bedroom, where damp had begun to damage the finishings. The original furnishings, many of which the Marquess removed in 1950, have mostly been recovered and returned to their original locations in the castle. Two stained-glass panels from the demolished chapel, lost since 1901, were rediscovered at an auction in 2010 and were bought by Cadw for ¬£125,000 in 2011. Architecture=Overview Castell Coch occupies a stretch of woodland on the slopes above the village of Tongwynlais and the River Taff, about north-west of the centre of Cardiff.Google Maps, Google Inc., Retrieved 7 April 2015 The architecture is High Victorian Gothic Revival in style, influenced by contemporary 19th- century French restorations. Its design combines the surviving elements of the medieval castle with 19th-century additions to produce a building which the historian Charles Kightly considered \\"the crowning glory of the Gothic Revival\\" in Britain. It is protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building due to its exceptional architectural and historical interest. Exterior Diagram of the castle in the 21st century; A ‚Äì Kitchen Tower; B ‚Äì Courtyard; C ‚Äì Hall Block; D ‚Äì Well Tower; E ‚Äì Gatehouse; F ‚Äì Keep The castle comprises three circular towers‚Äîthe Keep, the Kitchen Tower and the Well Tower‚Äîalong with the Hall Block, the Gatehouse and a shell wall; the buildings almost entirely encase the original motte in stone. The older parts of the castle are constructed from crudely laid red sandstone rubble and grey limestone, the 19th-century additions in more precisely cut red Pennant sandstone. A ditch is cut out of the rock in front of the Gatehouse and leads to an eastern approach road. The castle is surrounded by woodland and the 19th-century vineyards below it have been converted into a golf course. In 1850, George Clark recorded an \\"outer court\\" of which nothing remains; this may, in fact, have been the traces of the earlier lime kiln operations around the site. The Gatehouse is reached across a wooden bridge, incorporating a drawbridge. Burges intended the bridge to copy those of medieval castles, which he believed were designed to be easily set on fire in the event of attack. The Gatehouse was fitted with a wooden defensive bret√®che and, above the entrance, Burges sited a portcullis and a glazed statue of the Madonna and Child sculpted by Ceccardo Fucigna. The Keep is in diameter with a square, spurred base; in the 13th century there would have been an adjacent turret, on the south-west side, containing latrines, but few traces remain. There is no evidence that the tower that Burges termed a keep would have fulfilled this function in the medieval period and he appears to have chosen the name because of his initial decision to locate the bedrooms of Lord and Lady Bute in the rebuilt tower. The Kitchen Tower is also across and rests on a square, spurred base. It was originally two storeys high and contained the medieval kitchen; Burgess raised its height and gave it a conical roof and chimneys. The walls of these two towers are around thick at the base, thinning to at the top. The Well Tower at in diameter is slightly narrower than the Keep or Kitchen Tower, with a well in its lowest chamber sunk into the ground. The Well Tower lacks the spurs of the other two towers and has a flat rather than curved back, facing onto the courtyard, similar to some of the towers built at Caerphilly by the de Clares. The conical roofs of the Well Tower (left) and Keep (right), topped by elaborate weather vanes and chimneys The towers contribute to what the architectural writer Charles Handley-Read considered the castle's \\"sculptural and dramatic exterior\\". Almost equal in diameter, but of differing conical roof designs and heights, and topped with copper-gilt weather vanes, they combine to produce a romantic appearance, which Matthew Williams described as bringing \\"a Wagnerian to the Taff Valley\\". The design of the towers was influenced by the work of the contemporary French architect Eug√®ne Viollet-le-Duc, including his restorations of Carcassone and the ch√¢teaus of Aigle and Chillon. While the exterior of Castell Coch is relatively true to English 13th-century medieval design‚Äîalbeit heavily influenced by the Gothic Revival movement‚Äîthe inclusion of the conical roofs, which more closely resemble those of fortifications in France or Switzerland than Britain, is historically inaccurate. Although he mounted a historical defence (see box), Burges chose the roofs mainly for architectural effect, arguing that they appeared \\"more picturesque\\", and to provide additional room for accommodation in the castle. The three towers lead into a small oval courtyard that sits on the top of the motte, about across lengthways. Cantilevered galleries and wall-walks run around the inside of the courtyard with neat and orderly woodwork; the historian Peter Floud critiqued it as \\"perhaps too much like the backcloth for an historical pageant\\". Burges reconstructed the shell wall that runs along the north-west side of the courtyard thick, complete with arrow holes and a battlement. Interior The Keep, the Well Tower and the Kitchen Tower incorporate a series of apartments, of which the main sequence, the Castellan's Rooms, lies within the Keep. The Hall, the Drawing Room, Lord Bute's Bedroom and Lady Bute's Bedroom form a suite of rooms that exemplify the High Victorian Gothic style of 19th century Britain. Unlike the exterior of the castle, which deliberately imitated the architecture of the 13th century, the interior was purely High Victorian in style. On Burges's decoration of Cardiff Castle and Castell Coch, Handley-Read wrote: \\"I have yet to see any High Victorian interiors from the hand, very largely, of one designer, to equal either in homogeneity or completeness, in quality of execution or originality of conception the best of the interiors of the Welsh castles. For sheer power of intoxication, Burges stand[s] unrivalled.\\" =The Banqueting Hall= The Banqueting Hall The Banqueting Hall is across with an ceiling, and occupies the whole of the first floor of the Hall Block. Burges persuaded Bute and the antiquarian George Clark that the medieval hall would have stood on the first floor. His original plan saw access via one of two equally circuitous routes through the Well Tower or around the entire internal gallery to enter the hall through a passage next to the Drawing Room. Neither approach was acceptable to Bute and at a late stage, around 1878/9, the present entrance was created by expanding a window at the head of the internal gallery. The hall is austere; the architectural historian John Newman critiqued its decoration as \\"dilute\\" and \\"unfocused\\", Crook as \\"anaemic\\". It features stencilled ceilings and murals which resemble medieval manuscripts. The murals were designed by Horatio Lonsdale and executed by Campbell, Smith & Company. The furniture is by John Chapple, made in Lord Bute's workshops at Cardiff. The tapered chimney of the room, modelled on 15th-century French equivalents, contains a statue carved by Thomas Nicholls. Although the architectural historian Mark Girouard suggested that the statue depicts the Hebrew King David, most historians believe that it shows Lucius of Britain, according to legend the founder of the diocese of Llandaff in nearby Cardiff. =The Drawing Room= The Drawing Room The octagonal Drawing Room occupies the first and second floors of the Keep. The ceiling is supported by vaulted stone ribs modelled on Viollet-Le-Duc's work at Ch√¢teau de Coucy and the lower and upper halves of the room are divided by a minstrels' gallery. The original plans for the space involved two chambers, one on each floor, and the new design was adopted only in 1879, Burges noting at the time that he intended to \\"indulge in a little more ornament\\" than elsewhere in the castle. The decoration of the room focuses on what Newman described as the \\"intertwined themes [of] the fecundity of nature and the fragility of life\\". A fireplace by Thomas Nicholls features the Three Fates, the trio of Greek goddesses who are depicted spinning, measuring and cutting the thread of life. The ceiling's vaulting is carved with butterflies, reaching up to a golden sunburst at the apex of the room, while plumed birds fly up into a starry sky in the intervening sections. Around the room, 58 panels, each depicting one or more unique plants, are surmounted by a mural showing animals from twenty-four of Aesop's Fables. The plants are wild flowers from the Mediterranean, where Lord Bute spent his winter months each year. Carved birds, lizards and other wildlife decorate the doorways. The historian Terry Measham wrote that the Drawing Room and Lady Bute's Bedroom, \\"so powerful in their effect, are the two most important interiors in the castle.\\" The architectural writer Andrew Lilwall-Smith considered the Drawing Room to be \\"Burges's pi√®ce de r√©sistance\\", encapsulating his \\"romantic vision of the Middle Ages\\". The decoration of the ceiling, which was carried out while Burges was alive, differs in tone from the treatment of the murals, and the decoration of Lady Bute's Bedroom, which were both completed, under the direction of William Frame and Horatio Lonsdale respectively, after Burges's death. Burges's work is distinctively High Gothic in style, while the later efforts are more influenced by the softer colours and character of the Aesthetic movement, which had grown in popularity by the 1880s. =Lord Bute's Bedroom= In comparison to other rooms within the castle, Lord Bute's Bedroom, sited above the Winch Room, is relatively small and simple. The original plan had Bute's personal accommodation in the Keep but the expansion of the Drawing Room to a double-height room in 1879 required a late change of plan. The bedroom contains an ornately carved fireplace. Doors lead off the room to an internal balcony overlooking the courtyard and to the bretache over the gate arch. The furniture is mainly by Chapple and post-dates Burges, although the washstand and dressing table are pared-down versions of two pieces ‚Äì the Narcissus Washstand and the Crocker Dressing Table ‚Äì that Burges made for his own home in London, The Tower House. This bedroom is also less richly ornamented than many in the castle, making extensive use of plain, stencilled geometrical patterns on the walls. Crook suggested this provided some \\"spartan\\" relief before the culmination of the castle in Lady Bute's Bedroom but Floud considered the result \\"thin\\" and drab in comparison with the more richly decorated chambers. The bedroom would have been impractical for regular use, lacking wardrobes and other storage. =Lady Bute's Bedroom= Lady Bute's Bedroom Lady Bute's Bedroom comprises the upper two floors of the Keep, with a coffered, double-dome ceiling that rises up into the tower's conical roof. The room was completed after Burges's death and, although he had created an outline model for the room's structure, which survives, he did not undertake detailed plans for its decoration. His team attempted to fulfil his vision for the room‚Äî\\"would Mr Burges have done it?\\" William Frame asked Nicholls in a letter of 1887‚Äîbut the interior decoration was the work of Lonsdale between 1887 and 1888, with considerable involvement from Bute and his wife. The room is circular, with the window embrasures forming a sequence of arches around the outside. It is richly decorated, with love as the theme, displaying carved monkeys, pomegranates and grapevines on the ceiling, and nesting birds topping the pillars. Lord Bute thought the monkeys inappropriately \\"lascivious\\". Above the fireplace is a winged statue of Psyche, the Greek goddess of the soul, carrying a heart-shaped shield which displays the arms of the Bute family. The washbasin, designed by John Chapple, has a dragon tap, and cisterns for hot and cold water covered with crenellated towers. The Marchioness's scarlet and gold bed is the most notable piece of furniture in the room, modelled on a medieval original drawn by Viollet-le-Duc. Crook described the bed as being \\"medieval to the point of acute discomfort\\". The bedroom is Moorish in style, a popular inspiration in mid-Victorian interior design, and echoes earlier work by Burges in the Arab Room at Cardiff Castle and in the chancel at St Mary's Church at Studley Royal in Yorkshire. Lilwall-Smith likened the chamber, with its \\"Moorish-looking dome, maroon-and-gold painted furniture and large, low bed decorated with glass crystal orbs\\", to a scene from the Arabian Nights. Peter Floud criticised the eclectic nature of this Moorish theme and contrasted it unfavourably with the more consistent style Burges applied to the Arab Room, suggesting that it gave the bedroom an overly theatrical, even pantomime-like, character. The historian Matthew Williams considered that Lonsdale's efforts lack the imagination and flair that Burges himself might have brought to the room. =Other rooms= The Windlass Room, or Winch Room, is in the Gatehouse, entered from the Drawing Room. It contains a working mechanism for operating the drawbridge and the portcullis. The equipment was originally intended for the second floor, which Burges considered the most historically authentic location. When later design modifications led him to move Lord Bute's Bedroom into that space, the equipment was simplified and placed on the first floor. The Windlass Room includes murder holes, which Burges thought would have enabled medieval inhabitants of the castle to pour boiling water and oil on attackers. An oratory, originally fitted to the roof of the Well Tower but removed before 1891, was decorated with twenty stained glass windows. Ten of these windows are displayed at Cardiff Castle, while the other ten are displayed on site; two missing windows having been returned to the castle in 2011. Other rooms in the castle include Lady Margaret Bute's Bedroom, the servants' hall and the kitchen.

They contain dog's mercury, ransoms, sanicles, bird's-nest orchid, greater butterfly-orchid and yellow bird's nest plants. The area has unusual rock outcrops, which show the point where Devonian Old Red Sandstone and Carboniferous Limestone beds meet; the Castell Coch Quarry is in the vicinity. To the southeast of the castle, a nine-hole golf course occupies the site of the former vineyard. The area is protected as the Castell Coch Woodlands and Road Section Site of Special Scientific Interest.

In this model a linear sequence of tokens are divided into two classes: operators and operands. Operands are objects upon which the operators operate. These include literal numbers and other constants as well as identifiers (names) which may represent anything from simple scalar variables to complex aggregated structures and objects, depending on the complexity and capability of the language at hand as well as usage context. One special type of operand is the parenthesis group. An expression enclosed in parentheses is typically recursively evaluated to be treated as a single operand on the next evaluation level. Each operator is given a position, precedence, and an associativity. The operator precedence is a number (from high to low or vice versa) that defines which operator that takes an operand surrounded by two operators of different precedence (or priority). Multiplication normally has higher precedence than addition, for example, so 3+4√ó5 = 3+(4√ó5) ‚â† (3+4)√ó5. In terms of operator position, an operator may be prefix, postfix, or infix. A prefix operator immediately precedes its operand, as in ‚àíx. A postfix operator immediately succeeds its operand, as in x! for instance. An infix operator is positioned in between a left and a right operand, as in x+y. Some languages, most notably the C-syntax family, stretches this conventional terminology and speaks also of ternary infix operators (a?b:c). Theoretically it would even be possible (but not necessarily practical) to define parenthesization as a unary bifix operation.  Operator associativity  Operator associativity determines what happens when an operand is surrounded by operators of the same precedence, as in 1-2-3: An operator can be left-associative, right-associative, or non- associative. Left-associative operators are applied to operands in left-to- right order while right-associative operators are the other way round. The basic arithmetic operators are normally all left-associative, which means that 1-2-3 = (1-2)-3 ‚â† 1-(2-3), for instance. This does not hold true for higher operators. For example, exponentiation is normally right-associative in mathematics, but is implemented as left-associative in some computer applications like Excel. In programming languages where assignment is implemented as an operator, that operator is often right-associative. If so, a statement like would be equivalent to , which means that the value of c is copied to b which is then copied to a. An operator which is non-associative cannot compete for operands with operators of equal precedence. In Prolog for example, the infix operator is non-associative, so constructs such as are syntax errors. Unary prefix operators such as ‚àí (negation) or sin (trigonometric function) are typically associative prefix operators. When more than one associative prefix or postfix operator of equal precedence precedes or succeeds an operand, the operators closest to the operand goes first. So ‚àísin x = ‚àí(sin x), and sin -x = sin(-x). Mathematically oriented languages (such as on scientific calculators) sometimes allow implicit multiplication with higher priority than prefix operators (such as sin), so that sin 2x+1 = (sin(2x))+1, for instance. However, prefix (and postfix) operators do not necessarily have higher precedence than all infix operators. Some (hypothetical) programming language may well have an operator called sin with a precedence lower than √ó but higher than + for instance. In such a language, sin 2¬∑x+1 = sin(2¬∑x)+1 would be true, instead of (sin 2)¬∑x+1, as would normally be the case. The rules for expression evaluation are usually three- fold: # Treat any sub-expression in parentheses as a single recursively- evaluated operand (there may be different kinds of parentheses though, with different semantics). # Bind operands to operators of higher precedence before those of lower precedence. # For equal precedence, bind operands to operators according to the associativity of the operators. Some more examples: : : Generalizations of Common Operator Notation The use of operator precedence classes and associativities is just one way. However, it is not the most general way: this model cannot give an operator more precedence when competing with '‚àí' than it can when competing with '+', while still giving '+' and '‚àí' equivalent precedences and associativities. A generalized version of this model (in which each operator can be given independent left and right precedences) can be found at .

The Borgias became prominent in ecclesiastical and political affairs in the 15th and 16th centuries, producing two popes: Alfons de Borja, who ruled as Pope Callixtus III during 1455-1458, and Rodrigo Lanzol Borgia, as Pope Alexander VI, during 1492-1503\\\\. Especially during the reign of Alexander VI, they were suspected of many crimes, including adultery, incest, simony, theft, bribery, and murder (especially murder by arsenic poisoning).Arsenic: A Murderous History. Dartmouth Toxic Metals Research Program, 2009 Because of their grasping for power, they made enemies of the Medici, the Sforza, and the Dominican friar Girolamo Savonarola, among others. They were also patrons of the arts who contributed to the development of Renaissance art. The Borgia family stands out in history as being infamously steeped in sin and immorality, yet there is evidence to suggest that this one-dimensional characterization is a result of undeserved contemporary critiques.  History = Early history  The Borja was a noble house with origin in the town of Borja (Zaragoza) in the then Crown of Aragon. There were numerous unsubstantiated claims that the family was of Jewish origin. These underground rumours were propagated by, among others, Giuliano della Rovere, and the family was frequently described as marranos by political opponents. The rumours have persisted in popular culture for centuries, listed in the Semi-Gotha of 1912.The Menorah journal, Volumes 20-23, Intercollegiate Menorah Association, 1932, page 163The Borgias: or, At the feet of Venus, Vicente Blasco Ib√°√±ez, P.

Alfons  Alfons de Borja (1378‚Äì1458) was born to Francina Llan√ßol and Domingo de Borja in La Torreta, Canals, which was then situated in the Kingdom of Valencia. Alfons de Borja was a professor of law at the University of Lleida, then a diplomat for the Kings of Aragon before becoming a cardinal. At an advanced age, he was elected Pope Callixtus III in 1455 as a compromise candidate and reigned as Pope for just 3 years, until his death in 1458.  Rodrigo  Rodrigo Borgia (1431‚Äì1503) was born in X√†tiva, also in the Kingdom of Valencia, to Isabel de Borja i Cavanilles and Jofr√© Llan√ßol i Escriv√†. He studied law at Bologna and was appointed as cardinal by his uncle, Alfons Borgia, Pope Callixtus III. He was elected Pope in 1492, taking the regnal name Alexander VI. While a cardinal, he maintained a long-term illicit relationship with Vannozza dei Cattanei, with whom he had four children: Giovanni; Cesare; Lucrezia; and Gioffre. Rodrigo also had children by other women, including one daughter with his mistress, Giulia Farnese. As Alexander VI, Rodrigo was recognized as a skilled politician and diplomat. However, he was widely criticized during his reign for his over-spending, sale of Church offices (simony), lasciviousness, and nepotism. As Pope, he sought to acquire more personal and papal power and wealth, often ennobling and enriching the Borgia family directly. He appointed his son, Giovanni, as captain-general of the papal army, his foremost military representative, and established another son, Cesare, as a cardinal. Alexander used the marriages of his children to build alliances with powerful families in Italy and Spain. At the time, the Sforza family, which comprised the Milanese faction, was one of the most powerful in Europe, so Alexander united the two families by marrying Lucrezia to Giovanni Sforza. He also married Gioffre, his youngest son from Vannozza, to Sancha of Aragon of the Crown of Aragon and Naples. He established a second familial link to the Spanish royal house through Giovanni's marriage during what was a period of on-again/off-again conflict between France and Spain over the Kingdom of Naples. It is reported that under Alexander VI's rule the Borgia hosted orgies in the Vatican palace. The \\"Banquet of Chestnuts\\" is considered one of the most disreputable balls of this kind. Johann Burchard reports that fifty courtesans were in attendance for the entertainment of the banquet guests.Johann Burchard, Pope Alexander VI and His Court: Extracts from the Latin Diary of Johannes Burchardus, 1921, F.L. Glaser, ed., New York, N.L. Brown, pp. 154-155. It is alleged not only was the Pope present, but also two of his children, Lucrezia and Cesare. Other researchers however, such as Monsignor Peter de Roo (1839‚Äì1926), have rejected the rumors of the \\"fifty courtesans\\" as being at odds with Alexander VI's essentially decent but much maligned character.In 5 volumes totaling nearly 3 thousand pages, and including many unpublished documents,* Msgr. de Roo labors to defend his thesis that pope Alexander, far from being a monster of vice (as he has so often been portrayed) was, on the contrary, \\"a man of good moral character and an excellent Pope.\\" Material, vol. 1, preface, xi. * \\"[Peter de Roo] must have devoted to his task many years of research among the Vatican archives and elsewhere. As he tells us himself in a characteristic passage: \\"We continued our search after facts and proofs from country to country, and spared neither labour nor money in order to thoroughly investigate who was Alexander VI., of what he had been accused, and especially what he had done.\\" Whether all this toil has been profitably expended is a matter upon which opinions are likely to differ. But we must in any case do Mgr. de Roo the justice of admitting that he has succeeded in compiling from original and often unpublished sources a much more copious record of the pontiff's creditable activities than has ever been presented to the world before.\\" -- Pope Alexander VI and His Latest Biographer, in The Month, April, 1925, Volume 145, p. 289. Pope Alexander VI died in Rome in 1503 after contracting a disease, generally believed to have been malaria. Two of Alexander's successors, Sixtus V and Urban VIII, described him as one of the most outstanding popes since St. Peter.Mallett, M. The Borgias (1969) Granada edition. 1981. p. 9.  Cesare  John Collier, \\"A glass of wine with Caesar Borgia\\", from left: Cesare Borgia, Lucrezia, Pope Alexander, and a young man holding an empty glass. The painting represents the popular view of the treacherous nature of the Borgias - the implication being that the young man cannot be sure that the wine is not poisoned. Cesare was Rodrigo Borgia's second son with Vannozza dei Cattanei. Cesare's education was precisely planned by his father: he was educated by tutors in Rome until his 12th birthday. He grew up to become a charming man skilled at war and politics. He studied law and the humanities at the University of Perugia, then went to the University of Pisa to study theology. As soon as he graduated from the university, his father made him a cardinal. Cesare was suspected of murdering his brother Giovanni, but there is no clear evidence to confirm this. However, Giovanni's death cleared the path for Cesare to become a layman and gain the honors his brother received from their father, Pope Alexander VI. Although Cesare had been a cardinal, he left the holy orders to gain power and take over the position Giovanni once held: a condottiero. He was finally married to French princess Charlotte d'Albret. After Alexander's death in 1503, Cesare affected the choice of a next Pope. He needed a candidate who would not threaten his plans to create his own principality in Central Italy. Cesare's candidate (Pius III) did become Pope, but he died a month after the selection. Cesare was then forced to support Giuliano della Rovere. The cardinal promised Cesare that he could keep all of his titles and honors. Later, della Rovere betrayed him and became his fiercest enemy. Cesare died in 1507, at Viana Castle in Navarre, Spain, while besieging the rebellious army of Count de Ler√≠n. The castle was held by Louis de Beaumont at the time it was besieged by Cesare Borgia and King John's army of 10,000 men in 1507. In order to attempt to breach the extremely strong, natural fortification of the castle, Cesare counted on a desperate surprise attack. He was killed during the battle, in which his army failed to take the castle.  Lucrezia  Lucrezia was born in Subiaco, Italy to Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia and Roman mistress Vannozza dei Catanei. Before the age of 13, she was engaged to two Spanish princes. After her father became Pope she was married to Giovanni Sforza in 1493 at the age of 13. It was a typical political marriage to improve Alexander's power; however, when Pope Alexander VI no longer needed the Sforzas, the marriage was annulled in 1497 on the dubious grounds that it had never been consummated. Shortly afterwards she was involved in a scandal involving her alleged relationship with Pedro Calder√≥n, a Spaniard generally known as Perotto. His body was found in the Tiber on February 14, 1498, along with the body of one of Lucrezia's ladies. It is likely that Cesare had them killed as an affair would have damaged the negotiations being conducted for another marriage. During this time rumors were also spread suggesting that a child born at this time, Giovanni Borgia, also known as the Infans Romanus (child of Rome) was Lucrezia's. Lucrezia's second marriage, to wealthy young Prince Alfonso of Aragon, allowed the Borgias to form an alliance with another powerful family. However, this relationship did not last long either. Cesare wished to strengthen his relations with France and completely break with the Kingdom of Naples. As Alfonso's father was the ruler of the Kingdom of Naples, the young husband was in great danger. Although the first attempt at murder did not succeed, Alfonso was eventually strangled in his own quarters. Lucrezia's third and final husband was Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara. After her father died in 1503, she lived a life of freedom in Ferrara with her husband and children. Unfortunately, her pregnancies were difficult and she lost several babies after birth. She died in 1519, 10 days after the birth and death of her last child, Isabella Maria. She was buried in a tomb with Isabella and Alfonso. Lucrezia was rumored to be a notorious poisoner and she became famous for her skill at political intrigue. However, recently historians have started to look at her in a more sympathetic light: she is often seen as a victim of her family's deceptions.Lucrezia Borgia: A Biography.

In the year 200, when Sun Quan had just taken over the reins of power, his adviser Zhou Yu recommended Lu Su as a talent to Sun Quan. As one of Sun Quan's most important advisers in the warlord's early career, Lu Su is best known for making some significant contributions. Firstly, in 200 he drafted a long-term strategy for Sun Quan's power bloc to emerge as one of three major contending powers in China ‚Äì a plan similar to Zhuge Liang's Longzhong Plan, which was proposed about seven years later. Secondly, before the Battle of Red Cliffs in late 208, he was the first person to persuade Sun Quan to ally with Liu Bei against Cao Cao. Thirdly, he succeeded Zhou Yu as the frontline commander of Sun Quan's forces in 210 after Zhou's death and maintained the Sun‚ÄìLiu alliance. Fourthly, in 215, he represented Sun Quan at the negotiations with Liu Bei's general Guan Yu during the Sun‚ÄìLiu territorial dispute over Jing Province. Early life Lu Su was from Dongcheng County (), Linhuai Commandery (), which is located southeast of present-day Dingyuan County, Anhui.(È≠ØËÇÖÂ≠óÂ≠êÊï¨ÔºåËá®Ê∑ÆÊù±Âüé‰∫∫‰πü„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 54. He lost his father not long after he was born, so he lived with his grandmother. Lu Su was very generous with his family's wealth as he used it to help the needy. Wei Zhao's Book of Wu () described Lu Su as having a stalwart and extraordinary appearance. He had great ambitions since he was young and was very fond of strategy.(Âê≥Êõ∏Êõ∞ÔºöËÇÖÈ´îË≤åÈ≠ÅÂ•áÔºåÂ∞ëÊúâÂ£ØÁØÄÔºåÂ•ΩÁÇ∫Â•áË®à„ÄÇ) Wu Shu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 54. Towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty, when chaos broke out throughout China due to the Yellow Turban Rebellion and Dong Zhuo's tyranny, Lu Su sold his family's lands and properties and used the money to help the poor. He also spent his time associating with other reputable and talented persons. He was well-loved by his fellow townsfolk.(ÁîüËÄåÂ§±Áà∂ÔºåËàáÁ•ñÊØçÂ±Ö„ÄÇÂÆ∂ÂØåÊñºË≤°ÔºåÊÄßÂ•ΩÊñΩËàá„ÄÇÁàæÊôÇÂ§©‰∏ãÂ∑≤‰∫ÇÔºåËÇÖ‰∏çÊ≤ªÂÆ∂‰∫ãÔºåÂ§ßÊï£Ë≤°Ë≤®ÔºåÊëΩË≥£Áî∞Âú∞Ôºå‰ª•Ë≥ëÁ™ÆÂºäÁµêÂ£´ÁÇ∫ÂãôÔºåÁîöÂæóÈÑâÈÇëÊ≠°ÂøÉ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 54. The Book of Wu gave another account of Lu Su's life during that chaotic period. Apart from practising sword-fighting, horse-riding and archery, he also hired a group of young men as his retainers, and provided them with clothing and food. They often went to the hills to hunt and practise military arts. The elders of the clan remarked: \\"We got this wild boy because the Lu clan is in decline!\\"(Â§©‰∏ãÂ∞á‰∫ÇÔºå‰πÉÂ≠∏ÊìäÂäíÈ®éÂ∞ÑÔºåÊãõËÅöÂ∞ëÂπ¥ÔºåÁµ¶ÂÖ∂Ë°£È£üÔºåÂæÄ‰æÜÂçóÂ±±‰∏≠Â∞ÑÁçµÔºåÈô∞Áõ∏ÈÉ®ÂãíÔºåË¨õÊ≠¶ÁøíÂÖµ„ÄÇÁà∂ËÄÅÂí∏Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÈ≠ØÊ∞è‰∏ñË°∞Ôºå‰πÉÁîüÊ≠§ÁãÇÂÖíÔºÅ„Äç) Wu Shu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 54. Moving to Jiangdong Around 196, when Zhou Yu was nominally serving as the Chief () of Juchao County under the warlord Yuan Shu, he wanted to leave Yuan Shu and travel east to the Jiangdong (or Wu) region to join Sun Ce, who had recently conquered some territories in Jiangdong over the past few years. Along the way, Zhou Yu and his militia, numbering a few hundred men, visited Lu Su and requested for supplies. At the time, Lu Su owned two large granaries, each capable of storing 3,000 hu of grain. He pointed at one granary and gave it to Zhou Yu. Realising that Lu Su was no ordinary person, Zhou Yu thanked and befriended him. The third-century historian Chen Shou compared their friendship to that of Gongsun Qiao and Ji Zha () during the Spring and Autumn period.(Âë®ÁëúÁÇ∫Â±ÖÂ∑¢Èï∑ÔºåÂ∞áÊï∏Áôæ‰∫∫ÊïÖÈÅéÂÄôËÇÖÔºåÂπ∂Ê±ÇË≥áÁ≥ß„ÄÇËÇÖÂÆ∂ÊúâÂÖ©Âõ∑Á±≥ÔºåÂêÑ‰∏âÂçÉÊñõÔºåËÇÖ‰πÉÊåá‰∏ÄÂõ∑ËàáÂë®ÁëúÔºåÁëúÁõäÁü•ÂÖ∂Â•á‰πüÔºåÈÅÇÁõ∏Ë¶™ÁµêÔºåÂÆöÂÉë„ÄÅÊú≠‰πãÂàÜ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 54. The Chinese idiom \\"pointing at a granary and presenting it\\" (), which means to generously provide aid to someone, originated from this anecdote. When Yuan Shu heard of Lu Su's fame, he wanted to recruit him to serve as the Chief of Dongcheng County (Êù±ÂüéÁ∏£; present-day Suining County, Jiangsu). However, Lu Su refused because he saw that Yuan Shu's administration was ill-disciplined and predicted that Yuan Shu would ultimately meet his downfall. He told his followers, \\"The central government has collapsed. Robbers and bandits are rampant. The areas around the Huai and Si rivers are no longer safe. I heard the lands in Jiangdong are fertile and they have a prosperous population and powerful armed forces. We can take shelter there. Are you willing to accompany me to that paradise and wait until stability is restored in central China?\\" They unanimously agreed to follow him.(ÂæåÈõÑÂÇë‰∏¶Ëµ∑Ôºå‰∏≠Â∑ûÊìæ‰∫ÇÔºåËÇÖ‰πÉÂëΩÂÖ∂Â±¨Êõ∞Ôºö„Äå‰∏≠ÂúãÂ§±Á∂±ÔºåÂØáË≥äÊ©´Êö¥ÔºåÊ∑Æ„ÄÅÊ≥óÈñìÈùûÈÅ∫Á®Æ‰πãÂú∞ÔºåÂêæËÅûÊ±üÊù±Ê≤ÉÈáéËê¨ÈáåÔºåÊ∞ëÂØåÂÖµÂΩäÔºåÂèØ‰ª•ÈÅøÂÆ≥ÔºåÂØßËÇØÁõ∏Èö®‰ø±Ëá≥Ê®ÇÂúüÔºå‰ª•ËßÄÊôÇËÆä‰πéÔºü„ÄçÂÖ∂Â±¨ÁöÜÂæûÂëΩ„ÄÇ) Wu Shu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 54. Lu Su led his followers and some civilians southward to Juchao County to join Zhou Yu. He ordered able-bodied young men to guard the rear while the others continued moving forward. The local authorities sent some armed horsemen to stop Lu Su and his followers from leaving. When the riders caught up with them, Lu Su turned back and said, \\"All of you are capable men, so you should understand what's going on. The Empire is now in a state of chaos. While you won't be rewarded for your efforts (even if you manage to stop us), you will also not be punished for failing to stop us. Do you really want to force us to fight?\\" He then placed a shield upright on the ground and fired an arrow at it. The arrow pierced through the shield. The horsemen realised that they could not stop Lu Su so they gave up and left. Lu Su and his followers then crossed the Yangtze River with Zhou Yu and arrived in Jiangdong, where they met Sun Ce, who also saw great potential in Lu Su.(‰πÉ‰ΩøÁ¥∞Âº±Âú®ÂâçÔºåÂΩäÂ£ØÂú®ÂæåÔºåÁî∑Â•≥‰∏âÁôæÈ§ò‰∫∫Ë°å„ÄÇÂ∑ûËøΩÈ®éËá≥ÔºåËÇÖÁ≠âÂæêË°åÔºåÂãíÂÖµÊåÅÊªøÔºåË¨Ç‰πãÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂçøÁ≠â‰∏àÂ§´ÔºåÁï∂Ëß£Â§ßÊï∏„ÄÇ‰ªäÊó•Â§©‰∏ãÂÖµ‰∫ÇÔºåÊúâÂäüÂºóË≥ûÔºå‰∏çËøΩÁÑ°ÁΩ∞Ôºå‰ΩïÁÇ∫Áõ∏ÂÅ™‰πéÔºü„ÄçÂèàËá™Ê§çÁõæÔºåÂºïÂºìÂ∞Ñ‰πãÔºåÁü¢ÁöÜÊ¥ûË≤´„ÄÇÈ®éÊó£ÂòâËÇÖË®ÄÔºå‰∏îÂ∫¶‰∏çËÉΩÂà∂Ôºå‰πÉÁõ∏ÁéáÈÇÑ„ÄÇËÇÖÊ∏°Ê±üÂæÄË¶ãÁ≠ñÔºåÁ≠ñ‰∫¶ÈõÖÂ•á‰πã„ÄÇ) Wu Shu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 54.

Nearly leaving Jiangdong Liu Ye, a friend of Lu Su, once wrote a letter to him: \\"Warlords and heroes have emerged all over the Empire. I believe the time has come for me to put my talents to good use. I am in a rush to fetch my mother but I will be stopping at Dongcheng County for a while. I heard that recently there is one Zheng Bao (ÈÑ≠ÂØ∂) who has rallied thousands of followers in Chaohu and gained control over some very fertile lands. Many people in Lujiang Commandery are planning to join him ‚Äì including myself. As of now, he is still gathering followers. You should act fast and not miss this opportunity.\\" Lu Su agreed with what Liu Ye told him. After his grandmother's funeral, Lu Su returned to Qu'e County and planned to leave Jiangdong and head north to join Zheng Bao. However, after he found out that Zhou Yu had fetched his mother to Wu Commandery (around present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu), he gave up his plan to leave Jiangdong and headed to Wu Commandery to meet Zhou Yu.(ÂäâÂ≠êÊèöËàáËÇÖÂèãÂñÑÔºåÈÅ∫ËÇÖÊõ∏Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÊñπ‰ªäÂ§©‰∏ãË±™ÂÇë‰∏¶Ëµ∑ÔºåÂêæÂ≠êÂßøÊâçÔºåÂ∞§ÂÆú‰ªäÊó•„ÄÇÊÄ•ÈÇÑËøéËÄÅÊØçÔºåÁÑ°‰∫ãÊªØÊñºÊù±Âüé„ÄÇËøëÈÑ≠ÂØ∂ËÄÖÔºå‰ªäÂú®Â∑¢ÊπñÔºåÊìÅË°ÜËê¨È§òÔºåËôïÂú∞ËÇ•È•íÔºåÂª¨Ê±üÈñí‰∫∫Â§ö‰æùÂ∞±‰πãÔºåÊ≥ÅÂêæÂæí‰πéÔºüËßÄÂÖ∂ÂΩ¢Âã¢ÔºåÂèàÂèØÂçöÈõÜÔºåÊôÇ‰∏çÂèØÂ§±ÔºåË∂≥‰∏ãÈÄü‰πã„ÄÇ„ÄçËÇÖËçÖÁÑ∂ÂÖ∂Ë®à„ÄÇ ...

In 200, after Sun Ce was assassinated, his younger brother Sun Quan succeeded him as the warlord controlling the Jiangdong territories. When Lu Su arrived in Wu Commandery, Zhou Yu told him, \\"In the past, Ma Yuan once told Emperor Guangwu, 'In this era, not only do lords choose their subjects; subjects also choose the lords they wish to serve.' The new lord [Sun Quan] welcomes and respects persons of virtue and talent. He has recruited many extraordinary people. Besides, I also heard a saying that in the past, philosophers predicted that the successor to the Liu clan's empire [the Han dynasty] will rise in the southeast. As you can see, these events are already in motion. This is the time for heroes to rise up and showcase their talents and abilities, and contribute to the construction of a new empire to receive the Mandate of Heaven.

However, Sun Quan ignored Zhang Zhao and continued to treat Lu Su respectfully and regard him highly.

When he arrived at Nan Commandery (ÂçóÈÉ°; around present-day Jingzhou, Hubei), he received news that Liu Cong had already surrendered to Cao Cao, and that Jing Province was now under Cao Cao's control. At the same time, Liu Bei had been defeated at the Battle of Changban and was trying to cross the Yangtze and head further south. Lu Su met Liu Bei at Changban (Èï∑Èò™; in present-day Dangyang, Hubei), where he conveyed Sun Quan's intentions to Liu Bei and pointed out that Jiangdong was very stable. Liu Bei was delighted. Lu Su also met and befriended Liu Bei's adviser Zhuge Liang; he told Zhuge Liang that he was a friend of Zhuge Jin, Zhuge Liang's elder brother. Liu Bei moved to Xiakou, where he instructed Zhuge Liang to follow Lu Su to meet Sun Quan and discuss the formation of a Sun‚ÄìLiu alliance against Cao Cao.(Âà∞Â§èÂè£ÔºåËÅûÊõπÂÖ¨Â∑≤ÂêëËçäÂ∑ûÔºåÊô®Â§úÂÖºÈÅì„ÄÇÊØîËá≥ÂçóÈÉ°ÔºåËÄåË°®Â≠êÁêÆÂ∑≤ÈôçÊõπÂÖ¨ÔºåÂÇôÊÉ∂ÈÅΩÂ•îËµ∞ÔºåÊ¨≤ÂçóÊ∏°Ê±ü„ÄÇËÇÖÂæëËøé‰πãÔºåÂà∞Áï∂ÈôΩÈï∑Èò™ÔºåËàáÂÇôÊúÉÔºåÂÆ£È®∞Ê¨äÊó®ÔºåÂèäÈô≥Ê±üÊù±ÂΩäÂõ∫ÔºåÂã∏ÂÇôËàáÊ¨ä‰ΩµÂäõ„ÄÇÂÇôÁîöÊ≠°ÊÅ±„ÄÇÊôÇË´∏Ëëõ‰∫ÆËàáÂÇôÁõ∏Èö®ÔºåËÇÖË¨Ç‰∫ÆÊõ∞„ÄåÊàëÂ≠êÁëúÂèã‰πü„ÄçÔºåÂç≥ÂÖ±ÂÆö‰∫§„ÄÇÂÇôÈÅÇÂà∞Â§èÂè£ÔºåÈÅ£‰∫Æ‰ΩøÊ¨äÔºåËÇÖ‰∫¶ÂèçÂëΩ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 54. Contradiction Pei Songzhi, who annotated Lu Su's biography, argued that Lu Su was actually the first person to propose forming a Sun‚ÄìLiu alliance against Cao Cao. When Lu Su told Zhuge Liang that he was Zhuge Jin's friend, Zhuge Liang would probably have already heard of Lu Su but had yet to meet him in person. Pei Songzhi pointed out that Zhuge Liang's biography in the Shu Shu (ËúÄÊõ∏; Book of Shu) recorded: \\"Zhuge Liang persuaded Sun Quan with his argument on forming an alliance. Sun Quan was very pleased.\\" Going by the Shu Shu account, the first person who suggested the Sun‚ÄìLiu alliance should be Zhuge Liang instead of Lu Su. Pei Songzhi commented that the historians in Eastern Wu and Shu Han gave conflicting accounts on who was the first person who conceived the idea of the Sun‚ÄìLiu alliance because they wanted their respective states to claim that credit. Pei Songzhi also remarked that this was one of the flaws in the Sanguozhi because the author Chen Shou wrote both Lu Su and Zhuge Liang's biographies but the two biographies contradict each other on this point.(Ëá£Êùæ‰πãÊ°àÔºöÂäâÂÇôËàáÊ¨ä‰ΩµÂäõÔºåÂÖ±Êãí‰∏≠ÂúãÔºåÁöÜËÇÖ‰πãÊú¨Ë¨Ä„ÄÇÂèàË™ûË´∏Ëëõ‰∫ÆÊõ∞„ÄåÊàëÂ≠êÁëúÂèã‰πü„ÄçÔºåÂâá‰∫ÆÂ∑≤‰∫üËÅûËÇÖË®ÄÁü£„ÄÇËÄåËúÄÊõ∏‰∫ÆÂÇ≥‰∫ëÔºö„Äå‰∫Æ‰ª•ÈÄ£Ê©´‰πãÁï•Ë™™Ê¨äÔºåÊ¨ä‰πÉÂ§ßÂñú„ÄÇ„ÄçÂ¶Ç‰ººÊ≠§Ë®àÂßãÂá∫Êñº‰∫Æ„ÄÇËã•‰∫åÂúãÂè≤ÂÆòÔºåÂêÑË®òÊâÄËÅûÔºåÁ´∂Ê¨≤Á®±ÊèöÊú¨ÂúãÂÆπÁæéÔºåÂêÑÂèñÂÖ∂Âäü„ÄÇ‰ªäÊ≠§‰∫åÊõ∏ÔºåÂêåÂá∫‰∏Ä‰∫∫ÔºåËÄåËàõ‰∫íËã•Ê≠§ÔºåÈùûËºâËø∞‰πãÈ´î‰πü„ÄÇ) Pei Songzhi's annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 54. Urging Sun Quan to resist Cao Cao In late 208, when Sun Quan received news that Cao Cao was planning to lead his forces across the Yangtze to invade Jiangdong, he discussed with his subjects on how to deal with Cao Cao. Everyone present at the meeting advised Sun Quan to surrender and welcome Cao Cao; only Lu Su remained silent. When Sun Quan left the meeting for a change of clothes, Lu Su hurriedly left his seat and followed his lord. Sun Quan sensed that Lu Su had something to say so he held Lu Su's hand and asked him,(ÊúÉÊ¨äÂæóÊõπÂÖ¨Ê¨≤Êù±‰πãÂïèÔºåËàáË´∏Â∞áË≠∞ÔºåÁöÜÂã∏Ê¨äËøé‰πãÔºåËÄåËÇÖÁç®‰∏çË®Ä„ÄÇÊ¨äËµ∑Êõ¥Ë°£ÔºåËÇÖËøΩÊñºÂÆá‰∏ãÔºåÊ¨äÁü•ÂÖ∂ÊÑèÔºåÂü∑ËÇÖÊâãÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂçøÊ¨≤‰ΩïË®ÄÔºü„Äç) Sanguozhi vol. 54. \\"What do you want to tell me?\\" Lu Su replied, Sun Quan sighed, \\"I am very disappointed with those gentlemen.

Alternative accounts The Wei Shu (È≠èÊõ∏; Book of Wei) and the Jiuzhou Chunqiu () gave different accounts on how Lu Su urged Sun Quan to go to war with Cao Cao. They recorded that Lu Su attempted to use reverse psychology to persuade Sun Quan by saying, \\"Cao Cao is truly a formidable foe. He has engulfed Yuan Shao's territories and his forces are very powerful. If he uses the might of a victorious army to invade a weak and chaotic state, he'll definitely win. Why don't we dispatch our troops to assist him, while you send your family to Ye (Cao Cao's base in northern China)? If not, we'll be in danger.\\" When a furious Sun Quan wanted to execute Lu Su, the latter said, \\"We are in dire straits.

The fourth- century historian Sun Sheng commented that both Wei Zhao's Book of Wu and the Jiang Biao Zhuan () recorded that Lu Su urged Sun Quan to resist Cao Cao and build his own empire. When Liu Biao died, Lu Su advised Sun Quan to observe the developments. There was no mention of Lu Su using reverse psychology to persuade Sun Quan to go to war with Cao Cao. Sun Sheng pointed out that there were many others among Sun Quan's subjects who urged their lord to surrender, so it made no sense for Sun Quan to single out Lu Su. He concluded that the accounts on Lu Su's use of reverse psychology are absurd and unreliable.(Â≠´ÁõõÊõ∞ÔºöÂê≥Êõ∏ÂèäÊ±üË°®ÂÇ≥ÔºåÈ≠ØËÇÖ‰∏ÄË¶ãÂ≠´Ê¨ä‰æøË™™ÊãíÊõπÂÖ¨ËÄåË´ñÂ∏ùÁéã‰πãÁï•ÔºåÂäâË°®‰πãÊ≠ª‰πüÔºåÂèàË´ã‰ΩøËßÄËÆäÔºåÁÑ°Á∑£ÊñπÂæ©ÊøÄË™™Âã∏ËøéÊõπÂÖ¨‰πü„ÄÇÂèàÊòØÊôÇÂã∏ËøéËÄÖË°ÜÔºåËÄå‰∫ëÁç®Ê¨≤Êñ¨ËÇÖÔºåÈùûÂÖ∂Ë´ñ‰πü„ÄÇ) Sun Sheng's annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 54.

When Zhou Yu returned, he also urged Sun Quan to resist Cao Cao. This resulted in Sun Quan arriving at his final decision to go to war with Cao Cao. Sun Quan put Zhou Yu in command of his military forces and appointed Lu Su as Colonel Who Praises the Army () to assist Zhou Yu in formulating the battle plan.(ÊôÇÂë®ÁëúÂèó‰ΩøËá≥ÈÑ±ÈôΩÔºåËÇÖÂã∏ËøΩÂè¨ÁëúÈÇÑ„ÄÇ ...

Is this enough to illuminate your glory?\\" Lu Su replied: \\"No.\\" All the others present at the scene were startled by Lu Su's response. After taking his seat, Lu Su raised his horsewhip and said: \\"I hope that our lord will spread his might and virtues throughout the Four Seas, expand his territories to cover the Nine Provinces, and successfully build an empire.

Sun‚ÄìLiu territorial dispute=Background Before Zhou Yu died, he, along with Gan Ning and others, had constantly urged Sun Quan to seize Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) from its governor, Liu Zhang. However, Zhou Yu died of illness while making preparations for an invasion of Yi Province. When Sun Quan asked Liu Bei for his opinion, Liu Bei, who secretly had the intention of seizing Yi Province for himself, lied to Sun Quan: \\"Liu Zhang and I are members of the imperial clan, so we should strive to uphold the Han dynasty with the aid of our ancestors' blessings. Now, when I heard that Liu Zhang has offended his neighbours, I feel afraid and don't dare to probe further. I hope you can show leniency towards him. If you don't, I will retire and return to the countryside.\\" Liu Bei revealed his true intentions later when he attacked Liu Zhang himself and eventually seized control of Yi Province. During the campaign against Liu Zhang, Liu Bei left his general Guan Yu behind to guard Jing Province in his absence. When Sun Quan heard about Liu Bei's takeover of Yi Province, he angrily remarked: \\"This cunning barbarian dares to trick me!\\"(ÂÖàÊòØÔºåÁõäÂ∑ûÁâßÂäâÁíãÁ∂±Á∂≠È†πÂºõÔºåÂë®Áëú„ÄÅÁîòÂØß‰∏¶Âã∏Ê¨äÂèñËúÄÔºåÊ¨ä‰ª•Âí®ÂÇôÔºåÂÇôÂÖßÊ¨≤Ëá™Ë¶èÔºå‰πÉÂÅΩÂ†±Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂÇôËàáÁíãË®óÁÇ∫ÂÆóÂÆ§ÔºåÂÖæÊÜëËã±ÈùàÔºå‰ª•Âå°Êº¢Êúù„ÄÇ‰ªäÁíãÂæóÁΩ™Â∑¶Âè≥ÔºåÂÇôÁç®Á´¶ÊáºÔºåÈùûÊâÄÊï¢ËÅûÔºåÈ°òÂä†ÂØ¨Ë≤∏„ÄÇËã•‰∏çÁç≤Ë´ãÔºåÂÇôÁï∂ÊîæÈ´ÆÊ≠∏ÊñºÂ±±Êûó„ÄÇ„ÄçÂæåÂÇôË•øÂúñÁíãÔºåÁïôÈóúÁæΩÂÆàÔºåÊ¨äÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÁåæËôú‰πÉÊï¢ÊåæË©êÔºÅ„Äç) Sanguozhi vol. 54. At the same time, tensions were rising at the Sun‚ÄìLiu border in Jing Province as both sides became more suspicious of each other.

In Romance of the Three Kingdoms Lu Su talks with Zhuge Liang (left) before the Battle of Red Cliffs, from a Peking opera performance in Tianchan Theatre by Shanghai Jingju Theatre Company on January 17, 2015. Lu Su appeared as a character in the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which romanticises the historical events before and during the Three Kingdoms period. In the novel, Lu Su's role is significantly downplayed as compared to his historical counterpart, such that he is mainly used as a foil between Zhuge Liang and Zhou Yu to highlight their intelligence, especially for the former. He is also used to add minor comic relief to the rivalry between Zhuge Liang and Zhou Yu, particularly in the events leading to the Battle of Red Cliffs. Besides, he is also portrayed as an honest and sententious man who is often easily cheated and taken advantage of, resulting in his maladroit handling of the territorial dispute over Jing Province between Liu Bei and Sun Quan. In popular culture Lu Su was first introduced as a playable character in the eighth instalment of Koei's Dynasty Warriors video game series. Chinese actor Hou Yong portrayed Lu Su in the two-part epic war film Red Cliff (2008-2009) directed by John Woo.

Throughout his 11 years of service, Guo Jia aided Cao Cao greatly with his brilliance and foresight, and his strategies were instrumental to Cao Cao's triumphs over rival warlords such as L√º Bu and Yuan Shao. For example, four years before Cao Cao's decisive victory over Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu, Guo Jia already foresaw that Cao Cao would win when he pointed out ten advantages Cao Cao had over Yuan Shao. Historical sources on Guo Jia's life The authoritative historical source on Guo Jia's life is the Records of the Three Kingdoms (Sanguozhi), which was written by Chen Shou in the third century. In the fifth century, Pei Songzhi annotated the Sanguozhi by incorporating information from other sources to Chen Shou's original work and adding his personal commentary. Some alternative texts used in the annotations to Guo Jia's biography include: Fu Zi, by Fu Xuan; Wei Shu (Book of Wei), by Wang Chen, Xun Yi and Ruan Ji; Shiyu (Accounts of this Generation), by Guo Song.

As a youth, he was famous for his intelligence and foresight. Since reaching adulthood at around the age of 19, Guo Jia had been travelling around the country and befriending members of the scholar-gentry and other talented persons. He did not associate himself with the hoi polloi and was thus not very well known outside of his circles. However, all those who knew him recognised his talent and felt that he was extraordinary. When he was 26, he served in the Han government as a minor official in the office of the Minister over the Masses ().(ÂÇÖÂ≠êÊõ∞ÔºöÂòâÂ∞ëÊúâÈÅ†Èáè„ÄÇÊº¢Êú´Â§©‰∏ãÂ∞á‰∫Ç„ÄÇËá™Âº±ÂÜ†ÂåøÂêçËøπÔºåÂØÜ‰∫§ÁµêËã±ÂÑÅÔºå‰∏çËàá‰øóÊé•ÔºåÊïÖÊôÇ‰∫∫Â§öËé´Áü•ÔºåÊÉüË≠òÈÅîËÄÖÂ•á‰πã„ÄÇÂπ¥‰∫åÂçÅ‰∏ÉÔºåËæüÂè∏ÂæíÂ∫ú„ÄÇ) Fu Zi annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 14. Guo Jia once travelled to Hebei to meet Yuan Shao, an influential warlord who controlled most of northern China at the time. He later told Yuan Shao's advisers Xin Ping and Guo Tu, \\"An intelligent adviser should be prudent when he chooses which lord he wishes to serve so that his lord will heed every piece of advice he gives. The adviser can then establish his reputation. Lord Yuan (Yuan Shao) wishes to mimic the Duke of Zhou by recruiting men of talent to serve under him but he does not know how to tap into their abilities. He focuses too much on unnecessary details and neglects the main points; he likes to listen to many ideas but is indecisive. It is difficult for him to save the Empire from its troubles and achieve hegemony over the various warlords!\\" Guo Jia then left Yuan Shao.(ÂàùÔºåÂåóË¶ãË¢ÅÁ¥πÔºåË¨ÇÁ¥πË¨ÄËá£ËæõË©ï„ÄÅÈÉ≠ÂúñÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂ§´Êô∫ËÄÖÂØ©ÊñºÈáè‰∏ªÔºåÊïÖÁôæËàâÁôæÂÖ®ËÄåÂäüÂêçÂèØÁ´ã‰πü„ÄÇË¢ÅÂÖ¨ÂæíÊ¨≤ÊïàÂë®ÂÖ¨‰πã‰∏ãÂ£´ÔºåËÄåÊú™Áü•Áî®‰∫∫‰πãÊ©ü„ÄÇÂ§öÁ´ØÂØ°Ë¶ÅÔºåÂ•ΩË¨ÄÁÑ°Ê±∫ÔºåÊ¨≤ËàáÂÖ±ÊøüÂ§©‰∏ãÂ§ßÈõ£ÔºåÂÆöÈú∏Áéã‰πãÊ•≠ÔºåÈõ£Áü£ÔºÅ„ÄçÊñºÊòØÈÅÇÂéª‰πã„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 14.

Who can replace Xi Zhicai?\\" Xun Yu recommended Guo Jia to Cao Cao. Cao Cao and Guo Jia had a discussion on the affairs of their time, after which the former remarked: \\"This must be the man who will help me achieve greatness.\\" Guo Jia also happily said, \\"He's truly the lord I wish to serve.\\" Guo Jia was then appointed as a Libationer () in the army of Cao Cao, who then held the position of Minister over the Masses () in the Han imperial court.(ÂÖàÊòØÊôÇÔºåÊΩÅÂ∑ùÊà≤ÂøóÊâçÔºåÁ±åÁï´Â£´‰πüÔºåÂ§™Á•ñÁîöÂô®‰πã„ÄÇÊó©Âçí„ÄÇÂ§™Á•ñËàáËçÄÂΩßÊõ∏Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåËá™ÂøóÊâç‰∫°ÂæåÔºåËé´ÂèØËàáË®à‰∫ãËÄÖ„ÄÇÊ±ù„ÄÅÊΩÅÂõ∫Â§öÂ•áÂ£´ÔºåË™∞ÂèØ‰ª•Áπº‰πãÔºü„ÄçÂΩßËñ¶Âòâ„ÄÇÂè¨Ë¶ãÔºåË´ñÂ§©‰∏ã‰∫ã„ÄÇÂ§™Á•ñÊõ∞Ôºö„Äå‰ΩøÂ≠§ÊàêÂ§ßÊ•≠ËÄÖÔºåÂøÖÊ≠§‰∫∫‰πü„ÄÇ„ÄçÂòâÂá∫Ôºå‰∫¶ÂñúÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÁúüÂêæ‰∏ª‰πü„ÄÇ„ÄçË°®ÁÇ∫Âè∏Á©∫ËªçÁ•≠ÈÖí„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 14.

Cao Cao's campaign against L√º Bu In 198, Cao Cao launched a campaign against his rival L√º Bu in Xu Province, leading to the Battle of Xiapi. L√º Bu lost three battles and retreated to Xiapi (‰∏ãÈÇ≥; present-day Pizhou, Jiangsu). Cao Cao's forces besieged the city for months but they still could not conquer it because L√º Bu and his men resisted firmly. By then, Cao Cao's troops were tired and weary of battle, so Cao intended to withdraw his forces. However, Guo Jia and Xun You told Cao Cao, \\"L√º Bu is courageous but foolhardy. His army's morale is low because he has already lost three battles. The troops look up to their commander. If their commander shows any sign of weakness, the men will lose their fighting spirit. L√º Bu may have Chen Gong as an intelligent adviser but the latter's strategies always come late. Now, we should take advantage of this situation, when the morale of L√º Bu's forces is low and when Chen Gong has yet to think of a solution, to press on a fierce attack and we'll achieve victory.\\" Cao Cao heeded their advice and directed the waters of the Yi () and Si rivers to flood Xiapi, resulting in his triumph over L√º Bu.(ÂæÅÂëÇÂ∏ÉÔºå‰∏âÊà∞Á†¥‰πãÔºåÂ∏ÉÈÄÄÂõ∫ÂÆà„ÄÇÊôÇÂ£´ÂçíÁñ≤ÂÄ¶ÔºåÂ§™Á•ñÊ¨≤ÂºïËªçÈÇÑÔºåÂòâË™™Â§™Á•ñÊÄ•Êîª‰πãÔºåÈÅÇÁ¶ΩÂ∏É„ÄÇË™ûÂú®ËçÄÊî∏ÂÇ≥„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 14.(Âª∫ÂÆâ‰∏âÂπ¥Ôºå ...

The Fu Zi recorded another piece of advice Guo Jia gave to Cao Cao during the Battle of Xiapi: \\"In the past, Xiang Yu never lost any of the over 70 battles he fought in, but once the tide turned against him, he ended up in death and destruction. This was due to his reliance on his personal courage and his negligence towards strategy. L√º Bu has lost three consecutive battles and his army's morale is low and his defences are weakening.

Advice to Cao Cao on how to handle Liu Bei According to the Wei Shu, Guo Jia advised Cao Cao on how to handle Liu Bei when Liu Bei came to join Cao Cao in 196, after L√º Bu seized control of Xu Province from Liu's general Zhang Fei. On Cao Cao's suggestion, Emperor Xian appointed Liu Bei as the Governor () of Yu Province (). Someone told Cao Cao, \\"Liu Bei has the ambition of a hero. If you don't eliminate him now, he'll become a threat to you in the future.\\" Cao Cao asked Guo Jia for his opinion, to which Guo replied, \\"That's true. However, when you raised an army in the name of righteousness and pledged to help the common people eliminate tyrants, you attracted talented and capable people to serve under you based on your sincerity and integrity. Liu Bei is known to be a hero, so if you kill him when he comes to serve you, you will be viewed as someone who harms men of virtue. Other talented persons will start to doubt you and may even change their minds about serving you. If that happens, who will help you achieve your goals? Therefore, it's imperative that you carefully consider the consequences of ruining your good reputation for the sake of eliminating one man who poses a threat to you.\\" Cao Cao laughed and said, \\"I understand.\\"(È≠èÊõ∏Êõ∞ÔºöÂäâÂÇô‰æÜÂ•îÔºå‰ª•ÁÇ∫Ë±´Â∑ûÁâß„ÄÇÊàñË¨ÇÂ§™Á•ñÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂÇôÊúâËã±ÈõÑÂøóÔºå‰ªä‰∏çÊó©ÂúñÔºåÂæåÂøÖÁÇ∫ÊÇ£„ÄÇ„ÄçÂ§™Á•ñ‰ª•ÂïèÂòâÔºåÂòâÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÊúâÊòØ„ÄÇÁÑ∂ÂÖ¨ÊèêÂäíËµ∑Áæ©ÂÖµÔºåÁÇ∫ÁôæÂßìÈô§Êö¥ÔºåÊé®Ë™†Êùñ‰ø°‰ª•Êãõ‰øäÊ°ÄÔºåÁå∂ÊáºÂÖ∂Êú™‰πü„ÄÇ‰ªäÂÇôÊúâËã±ÈõÑÂêçÔºå‰ª•Á™ÆÊ≠∏Â∑±ËÄåÂÆ≥‰πãÔºåÊòØ‰ª•ÂÆ≥Ë≥¢ÁÇ∫ÂêçÔºåÂâáÊô∫Â£´Â∞áËá™ÁñëÔºåÂõûÂøÉÊìá‰∏ªÔºåÂÖ¨Ë™∞ËàáÂÆöÂ§©‰∏ãÔºüÂ§´Èô§‰∏Ä‰∫∫‰πãÊÇ£Ôºå‰ª•Ê≤ÆÂõõÊµ∑‰πãÊúõÔºåÂÆâÂç±‰πãÊ©üÔºå‰∏çÂèØ‰∏çÂØüÔºÅ„ÄçÂ§™Á•ñÁ¨ëÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂêõÂæó‰πãÁü£„ÄÇ„Äç) Wei Shu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 14. However, the Fu Zi gave a completely different account of Guo's advice to Cao Cao on how to handle Liu Bei. Guo Jia told Cao Cao, \\"Liu Bei has great ambitions and has won the hearts of many people. Zhang Fei and Guan Yu are formidable fighters and they have pledged to serve him with their lives. From what I observe, Liu Bei will never truly submit to anyone, and his intentions are unclear. The people in the past once said, 'If you let the enemy off today, they will become a threat to you for a long time.' You should settle (Liu Bei) soon.\\" At the time, Cao Cao was using Emperor Xian as a figurehead to command respect and had attracted many heroes to serve under him so he did not heed Guo Jia's advice. When Cao Cao later sent Liu Bei with an army to attack Yuan Shu, Guo Jia and Cheng Yu warned Cao, \\"Liu Bei will rebel if you let him go!\\" By then, Liu Bei had already left and he really did rebel against Cao Cao as he later seized control of Xu Province from Che Zhou, the provincial governor appointed by Cao Cao. Cao Cao regretted not following Guo Jia's advice.(ÂÇÖÂ≠êÊõ∞ÔºöÂàùÔºåÂäâÂÇô‰æÜÈôçÔºåÂ§™Á•ñ‰ª•ÂÆ¢Á¶ÆÂæÖ‰πãÔºå‰ΩøÁÇ∫Ë±´Â∑ûÁâß„ÄÇÂòâË®ÄÊñºÂ§™Á•ñÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂÇôÊúâÈõÑÊâçËÄåÁîöÂæóË°ÜÂøÉ„ÄÇÂºµÈ£õ„ÄÅÈóúÁæΩËÄÖÔºåÁöÜËê¨‰∫∫‰πãÊïµ‰πüÔºåÁÇ∫‰πãÊ≠ªÁî®„ÄÇÂòâËßÄ‰πãÔºåÂÇôÁµÇ‰∏çÁÇ∫‰∫∫‰∏ãÔºåÂÖ∂Ë¨ÄÊú™ÂèØÊ∏¨‰πü„ÄÇÂè§‰∫∫ÊúâË®ÄÔºö„Äé‰∏ÄÊó•Á∏±ÊïµÔºåÊï∏‰∏ñ‰πãÊÇ£„ÄÇ„ÄèÂÆúÊó©ÁÇ∫‰πãÊâÄ„ÄÇ„ÄçÊòØÊôÇÔºåÂ§™Á•ñÂ•âÂ§©Â≠ê‰ª•Ëôü‰ª§Â§©‰∏ãÔºåÊñπÊãõÊá∑Ëã±ÈõÑ‰ª•ÊòéÂ§ß‰ø°ÔºåÊú™ÂæóÂæûÂòâË¨Ä„ÄÇÊúÉÂ§™Á•ñ‰ΩøÂÇôË¶ÅÊìäË¢ÅË°ìÔºåÂòâËàáÁ®ãÊò±‰ø±ÈßïËÄåË´´Â§™Á•ñÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÊîæÂÇôÔºåËÆä‰ΩúÁü£ÔºÅ„ÄçÊôÇÂÇôÂ∑≤ÂéªÔºåÈÅÇËàâÂÖµ‰ª•Âèõ„ÄÇÂ§™Á•ñÊÅ®‰∏çÁî®Âòâ‰πãË®Ä„ÄÇ) Fu Zi annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 14.

Prediction of Sun Ce's death Between 194 and 199, the warlord Sun Ce embarked on a series of conquests in Jiangdong and seized control of most of the territories in the region. Around 200, Cao Cao finally engaged Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu. When Sun Ce heard that Cao Cao was locked in a stalemate with Yuan Shao at Guandu, he planned to lead an army across the Yangtze River and launch a surprise attack on the imperial capital Xu (Ë®±; present-day Xuchang, Henan), which was Cao Cao's base. When Cao Cao's men received news of the impending assault, they were all shocked and frightened, but Guo Jia said, \\"Sun Ce had newly conquered the lands in Jiangdong and he killed many heroes whose followers were willing to die for them. Besides, Sun Ce is overly confident and is unprepared, so even though he has thousands of troops, the situation is not much different from him setting out to conquer the Central Plains all by himself.

Pei Songzhi commented that Guo Jia's accurate prediction of Sun Ce's assassination was a display of Guo's foresight, but not a good gauge of Guo's brilliance because Guo did not manage to predict which year Sun Ce would die.

Suggestion to Cao Cao to attack Liu Bei first before attacking Yuan Shao According to the Fu Zi, before the Battle of Guandu, Cao Cao wanted to attack Liu Bei (who had rebelled and seized control of Xu Province) first before dealing with Yuan Shao. However, some of Cao Cao's advisers expressed their worries that Yuan Shao would take advantage of their absence to attack them, rendering them trapped between Yuan and Liu Bei. Cao Cao faced a dilemma so he asked Guo Jia for his opinion. Guo Jia suggested, \\"Yuan Shao is suspicious and he hesitates before he makes any decision, so he won't make his move fast. Liu Bei had just taken control of Xu Province so his situation isn't stable yet. He can be easily defeated if we attack him fast and hard. This is a critical opportunity, we mustn't lose it.\\" Cao Cao agreed and immediately led an army east to attack Liu Bei and defeated the latter. After his defeat, Liu Bei fled to Hebei to join Yuan Shao. Throughout that period of time, Yuan Shao did not make any move.(ÂÇÖÂ≠êÊõ∞ÔºöÂ§™Á•ñÊ¨≤ÈÄüÂæÅÂäâÂÇôÔºåË≠∞ËÄÖÊáºËªçÂá∫ÔºåË¢ÅÁ¥πÊìäÂÖ∂ÂæåÔºåÈÄ≤‰∏çÂæóÊà∞ËÄåÈÄÄÂ§±ÊâÄÊìö„ÄÇË™ûÂú®Ê≠¶Á¥Ä„ÄÇÂ§™Á•ñÁñëÔºå‰ª•ÂïèÂòâ„ÄÇÂòâÂã∏Â§™Á•ñÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÁ¥πÊÄßÈÅ≤ËÄåÂ§öÁñëÔºå‰æÜÂøÖ‰∏çÈÄü„ÄÇÂÇôÊñ∞Ëµ∑ÔºåË°ÜÂøÉÊú™ÈôÑÔºåÊÄ•Êìä‰πãÂøÖÊïó„ÄÇÊ≠§Â≠ò‰∫°‰πãÊ©üÔºå‰∏çÂèØÂ§±‰πü„ÄÇ„ÄçÂ§™Á•ñÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂñÑ„ÄÇ„ÄçÈÅÇÊù±ÂæÅÂÇô„ÄÇÂÇôÊïóÂ•îÁ¥πÔºåÁ¥πÊûú‰∏çÂá∫„ÄÇ) Fu Zi annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 14. However, Pei Songzhi commented that Guo Jia was not the one who pointed out Yuan Shao's weakness and suggested to launch a swift attack on Liu Bei.

Cao Cao's campaigns against Yuan Shao's sons Cao Cao scored a decisive victory over Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu in 200. Yuan Shao died two years after his defeat and his sons Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang started fighting each other for control over their father's vast domain. Cao Cao defeated Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang at the Battle of Liyang in 202‚Äì203 and won several consecutive battles. At the time, many of Cao Cao's generals urged Cao to take advantage of his successes to continue attacking the Yuans, but Guo Jia said, \\"Yuan Shao loved both sons so he couldn't decide between them who would succeed him. With advisers like Guo Tu and Pang Ji to assist the Yuans, internal conflict will definitely break out between them. If we press on our attacks, the Yuans will unite to resist us. If we withdraw our forces, the Yuans will start fighting among themselves. Why don't we turn south and attack Liu Biao in Jing Province first? We should wait until the Yuan brothers start fighting each other and then attack them. We'll achieve victory in this way.\\" Cao Cao agreed and prepared for a campaign against Liu Biao.(ÂæûÁ†¥Ë¢ÅÁ¥πÔºåÁ¥πÊ≠ªÔºåÂèàÂæûË®éË≠ö„ÄÅÂ∞öÊñºÈªéÈôΩÔºåÈÄ£Êà∞Êï∏ÂÖã„ÄÇË´∏Â∞áÊ¨≤‰πòÂãùÈÅÇÊîª‰πãÔºåÂòâÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåË¢ÅÁ¥πÊÑõÊ≠§‰∫åÂ≠êÔºåËé´ÈÅ©Á´ã‰πü„ÄÇÊúâÈÉ≠Âúñ„ÄÅÈÄ¢Á¥ÄÁÇ∫‰πãË¨ÄËá£ÔºåÂøÖ‰∫§È¨¨ÂÖ∂ÈñíÔºåÈÇÑÁõ∏Èõ¢‰πü„ÄÇÊÄ•‰πãÂâáÁõ∏ÊåÅÔºåÁ∑©‰πãËÄåÂæåÁà≠ÂøÉÁîü„ÄÇ‰∏çÂ¶ÇÂçóÂêëËçäÂ∑ûËã•ÂæÅÂäâË°®ËÄÖÔºå‰ª•ÂæÖÂÖ∂‰∏ÄËÆäÊàêËÄåÂæåÊìä‰πãÔºåÂèØ‰∏ÄËàâÂÆö‰πü„ÄÇ„ÄçÂ§™Á•ñÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂñÑ„ÄÇ„Äç‰πÉÂçóÂæÅ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 14. Internal conflict did break out between Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang later, which resulted in Yuan Tan being defeated by his younger brother. Yuan Tan retreated to Pingyuan () and sent Xin Pi to meet Cao Cao, agreeing to surrender to Cao and requesting for assistance in dealing with Yuan Shang. Cao Cao led his forces north and defeated Yuan Shang at the Battle of Ye in 204. In 205, Cao Cao attacked Yuan Tan on some pretence and defeated him at the Battle of Nanpi. By then, Cao Cao had pacified most of Ji Province in northern China. In recognition of his contributions, the Han imperial court enfeoffed Guo Jia as the Marquis of Weiyang Village ().(ËªçËá≥Ë•øÂπ≥ÔºåË≠ö„ÄÅÂ∞öÊûúÁà≠ÂÖæÂ∑û„ÄÇË≠öÁÇ∫Â∞öËªçÊâÄÊïóÔºåËµ∞‰øùÂπ≥ÂéüÔºåÈÅ£ËæõÊØó‰πûÈôç„ÄÇÂ§™Á•ñÈÇÑÊïë‰πãÔºåÈÅÇÂæûÂÆöÈÑ¥„ÄÇÂèàÂæûÊîªË≠öÊñºÂçóÁöÆÔºåÂÖæÂ∑ûÂπ≥„ÄÇÂ∞ÅÂòâÊ¥ßÈôΩ‰∫≠‰æØ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 14. Battle of White Wolf Mountain When Cao Cao was preparing for another campaign against Yuan Shang (who had fled to join his second brother Yuan Xi and the Wuhuan tribes), many of his followers were worried that Liu Biao might send Liu Bei (who had become a vassal under Liu Biao) to attack Cao Cao's base, the imperial capital Xu (Ë®±; present-day Xuchang, Henan). However, Guo Jia said to Cao Cao, \\"Your military might may be very well known now, but the Wuhuan will definitely not set up defences because they are deluded by a false sense of security since they are far away from you. As such, if you seize this opportunity to launch a surprise attack on them, you can eliminate them. Besides, Yuan Shao treated the ethnic minorities well and the Yuan brothers are still alive. Now, the people of northern China submit to you because they fear your military might, and you've yet to pacify them through benevolent governance. If you abandon the campaign and head south instead, the Wuhuan and Yuan Shao's former followers might rally the support of the people in northern China, who are likely to respond to their call. When that happens, the attention of Tadun (a Wuhuan chieftain) will be aroused and he may think of attacking you, and by then we would have lost Qing and Ji provinces. Liu Biao is a person who does nothing but sit and talk. He also does not trust Liu Bei as the latter is more capable than him ‚Äì if he entrusts Liu Bei with important responsibilities, he will be worried that the latter will no longer submit to him; if he gives Liu Bei trivial tasks to do, the latter will be reluctant to serve him. Even if you empty your territories to campaign far away, you have no worries.\\" Cao Cao proceeded with his campaign against the Yuan brothers and the Wuhuan.(Â§™Á•ñÂ∞áÂæÅË¢ÅÂ∞öÂèä‰∏âÈÉ°ÁÉè‰∏∏ÔºåË´∏‰∏ãÂ§öÊáºÂäâË°®‰ΩøÂäâÂÇôË•≤Ë®±‰ª•Ë®éÂ§™Á•ñÔºåÂòâÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂÖ¨ÈõñÂ®ÅÈúáÂ§©‰∏ãÔºåËÉ°ÊÅÉÂÖ∂ÈÅ†ÔºåÂøÖ‰∏çË®≠ÂÇô„ÄÇÂõ†ÂÖ∂ÁÑ°ÂÇôÔºåÂçíÁÑ∂Êìä‰πãÔºåÂèØÁ†¥ÊªÖ‰πü„ÄÇ‰∏îË¢ÅÁ¥πÊúâÊÅ©ÊñºÊ∞ëÂ§∑ÔºåËÄåÂ∞öÂÖÑÂºüÁîüÂ≠ò„ÄÇ‰ªäÂõõÂ∑û‰πãÊ∞ëÔºåÂæí‰ª•Â®ÅÈôÑÔºåÂæ∑ÊñΩÊú™Âä†ÔºåËàçËÄåÂçóÂæÅÔºåÂ∞öÂõ†ÁÉè‰∏∏‰πãË≥áÔºåÊãõÂÖ∂Ê≠ª‰∏ª‰πãËá£ÔºåËÉ°‰∫∫‰∏ÄÂãïÔºåÊ∞ëÂ§∑‰ø±ÊáâÔºå‰ª•ÁîüËπãÈ†ì‰πãÂøÉÔºåÊàêË¶¨Ë¶¶‰πãË®àÔºåÊÅêÈùí„ÄÅÂÖæÈùûÂ∑±‰πãÊúâ‰πü„ÄÇË°®ÔºåÂùêË´áÂÆ¢ËÄ≥ÔºåËá™Áü•Êâç‰∏çË∂≥‰ª•Âæ°ÂÇôÔºåÈáç‰ªª‰πãÂâáÊÅê‰∏çËÉΩÂà∂ÔºåËºï‰ªª‰πãÂâáÂÇô‰∏çÁÇ∫Áî®ÔºåÈõñËôõÂúãÈÅ†ÂæÅÔºåÂÖ¨ÁÑ°ÊÜÇÁü£„ÄÇ„ÄçÂ§™Á•ñÈÅÇË°å„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 14. When Cao Cao's forces arrived at Yi (), Guo Jia said, \\"A swift army is powerful. Now, as we've travelled a long distance, we have much heavy baggage so we cannot launch a swift attack. If the enemy learns of our approach, they will definitely prepare defences. Why don't we leave the heavy baggage behind and send our light forces to take a shortcut and launch a surprise attack?\\" Cao Cao led his army through a secret passage at Lulong Pass () and headed directly towards the Wuhuan chieftains' headquarters. The Wuhuan were shocked when they heard of Cao Cao's approach and they hastily assembled their army, but were defeated by Cao Cao at the Battle of White Wolf Mountain. Tadun was killed in battle. The Yuan brothers fled to Liaodong to join the warlord Gongsun Kang, who captured and executed them and then sent their heads to Cao Cao.(Ëá≥ÊòìÔºåÂòâË®ÄÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂÖµË≤¥Á•ûÈÄü„ÄÇ‰ªäÂçÉÈáåË•≤‰∫∫ÔºåËºúÈáçÂ§öÔºåÈõ£‰ª•Ë∂®Âà©Ôºå‰∏îÂΩºËÅû‰πãÔºåÂøÖÁÇ∫ÂÇôÔºõ‰∏çÂ¶ÇÁïôËºúÈáçÔºåËºïÂÖµÂÖºÈÅì‰ª•Âá∫ÔºåÊé©ÂÖ∂‰∏çÊÑè„ÄÇ„ÄçÂ§™Á•ñ‰πÉÂØÜÂá∫ÁõßÈæçÂ°ûÔºåÁõ¥ÊåáÂñÆ‰∫éÂ∫≠„ÄÇËôúÂçíËÅûÂ§™Á•ñËá≥ÔºåÊÉ∂ÊÄñÂêàÊà∞„ÄÇÂ§ßÁ†¥‰πãÔºåÊñ¨ËπãÈ†ìÂèäÂêçÁéãÂ∑≤‰∏ã„ÄÇÂ∞öÂèäÂÖÑÁÜàËµ∞ÈÅºÊù±„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 14.

In Romance of the Three Kingdoms Guo Jia appears as a character in the historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (Sanguo Yanyi) by Luo Guanzhong, which romanticises the historical events before and during the Three Kingdoms period. In chapter 33 of the novel, Guo Jia was accompanying Cao Cao on his campaign against the Yuan brothers (Yuan Shang and Yuan Xi) and the Wuhuan when he fell sick because he could not adjust to the climate. He advised Cao Cao to leave the heavy baggage behind and launch a swift attack on the enemy with a light force, which resulted in Cao's victory later at the Battle of White Wolf Mountain. Guo Jia remained in Yizhou () to recover and did not follow Cao Cao to the frontline. When Cao Cao returned to Yizhou later, he was deeply grieved to hear that Guo Jia had already died several days ago. Before his death, Guo Jia wrote Cao Cao a note, whose contents were not revealed until later in the chapter.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 33. When Cao Cao received news that Yuan Shang and Yuan Xi had fled to Liaodong to join the warlord Gongsun Kang, his subordinates urged him to either attack Liaodong or return to Xu (Ë®±; present-day Xuchang, Henan), but Cao told them to wait until they had received the Yuan brothers' heads. Just then, Cao Cao heard that Gongsun Kang had captured and killed the Yuan brothers and sent their heads to him, and his followers were very surprised. Cao Cao then revealed Guo Jia's note, which stated: \\"I heard that Yuan Xi and Yuan Shang had fled to Liaodong. You should not mobilise the army. Gongsun Kang had long feared that the Yuans would conquer his territory so he would definitely feel suspicious when the Yuan brothers join him. If you attack them, they will unite to resist you and you cannot overcome them quickly; if you do not move, Gongsun Kang and the Yuans will fight each other, and this is definite.\\" In popular culture Guo Jia is first introduced as a playable character in the Xtreme Legends version of the seventh instalment in Koei's Dynasty Warriors video game series. He also appears in Koei's Dynasty Tactics and Romance of the Three Kingdoms series. Guo Jia is the protagonist of the manga by .

It was created on 30 June 1615 for Sir Robert Dormer, 1st Baronet. He had, only twenty days earlier on 10 June 1615, been created a baronet \\"of Wing in the County of Buckingham\\", in the Baronetage of England. His grandson, the 2nd Baron Dormer was raised to Viscount Ascot in the County of Hertford, and Earl of Carnarvon in 1628, and later became a prominent Royalist commander in the Civil War. On the death of his son, the second Earl, in 1707, the viscountcy and earldom became extinct. However, the late Earl was succeeded in the baronetcy and barony by his second cousin, the fourth Baron. He was the grandson of The Hon. Anthony Dormer, second son of the first Baron. On his death this line of the family also failed and the titles passed to his second cousin, the fifth Baron. He was the grandson of The Hon. Robert Dormer, third son of the first Baron. He was succeeded by his son, the sixth Baron. He was a Roman Catholic priest and did not assume the title. On his death the title passed to his younger brother, the seventh Baron. His grandson, the tenth Baron, who succeeded his half-brother in 1819, was, like many of the recusant Dormer family, a Roman Catholic. However, he converted to the Church of England and took his seat in the House of Lords. He was succeeded by his first cousin, the eleventh Baron. He was the son of The Hon.

The bill was introduced as S. 1559, the Job Training and Community Services Act, by Senator Gaylord Nelson (Democrat of Wisconsin) and co-sponsored by Senator Jacob Javits (Republican of New York). CETA funds were administered in a decentralized fashion by state and local governments, on the assumption that they could best determine local needs. The program offered work to those with low incomes and the long term unemployed as well as summer jobs to low income high school students. Full-time jobs were provided for a period of 12 to 24 months in public agencies or private not for profit organizations. The intent was to impart a marketable skill that would allow participants to move to an unsubsidized job. It was an extension of the Works Progress Administration program from the 1930s. Inspired by the WPA's employment of artists in the service to the community in the 1930s, the San Francisco Arts Commission initiated the CETA/Neighborhood Arts Program in the 1970s, which employed painters, muralists, musicians, performing artists, poets and gardeners to work in schools, community centers, prisons and wherever their skills and services were of value to the community. The idea for CETA/Neighborhood Arts Program came from John Kreidler, then working with the Arts Commission as an intern, with the Arts Commission's Neighborhood Arts Program under the direction of Stephen Goldstine.http://www.sfgate.com/education/article/S-F-Neighborhood- Arts-40-years-of-art-for-all-3287194.php The program was so successful in San Francisco that it became a model for similar programs, nationally. The Cultural Council Foundation Artists Project in New York City was one of the largest. Nine years later, CETA was replaced by the Job Training Partnership Act.

If an operand is both preceded and followed by operators (for example, \`^ 3 ^\`), and those operators have equal precedence, then the operand may be used as input to two different operations (i.e. the two operations indicated by the two operators). The choice of which operations to apply the operand to, is determined by the associativity of the operators. Operators may be associative (meaning the operations can be grouped arbitrarily), left- associative (meaning the operations are grouped from the left), right- associative (meaning the operations are grouped from the right) or non- associative (meaning operations cannot be chained, often because the output type is incompatible with the input types). The associativity and precedence of an operator is a part of the definition of the programming language; different programming languages may have different associativity and precedence for the same type of operator. Consider the expression \`a ~ b ~ c\`. If the operator \`~\` has left associativity, this expression would be interpreted as \`(a ~ b) ~ c\`. If the operator has right associativity, the expression would be interpreted as \`a ~ (b ~ c)\`. If the operator is non- associative, the expression might be a syntax error, or it might have some special meaning. Some mathematical operators have inherent associativity. For example, subtraction and division, as used in conventional math notation, are inherently left-associative. Addition and multiplication, by contrast, are both left and right associative. (e.g. \`(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)\`). Many programming language manuals provide a table of operator precedence and associativity; see, for example, the table for C and C++. The concept of notational associativity described here is related to, but different from the mathematical associativity. An operation that is mathematically associative, by definition requires no notational associativity. (For example, addition has the associative property, therefore it does not have to be either left associative or right associative.) An operation that is not mathematically associative, however, must be notationally left-, right-, or non-associative. (For example, subtraction does not have the associative property, therefore it must have notational associativity.)  Examples  Associativity is only needed when the operators in an expression have the same precedence. Usually \`+\` and \`-\` have the same precedence. Consider the expression \`7 ‚àí 4 + 2\`. The result could be either \`(7 ‚àí 4) + 2 = 5\` or \`7 ‚àí (4 + 2) = 1\`. The former result corresponds to the case when \`+\` and \`‚àí\` are left-associative, the latter to when \`+\` and \`-\` are right-associative. In order to reflect normal usage, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operators are usually left-associative,Chemnitz University of Technology: Priority and associativity of operators (archived translation)Education Place: The Order of OperationsKhan Academy: The Order of Operations, timestamp 5m40sVirginia Department of Education: Using Order of Operations and Exploring Properties, section 9 while for an exponentiation operator (if present)Exponentiation Associativity and Standard Math Notation Codeplea. 23 Aug 2016. Retrieved 20 Sep 2016. and Knuth's up-arrow operators there is no general agreement. Any assignment operators are typically right-associative. To prevent cases where operands would be associated with two operators, or no operator at all, operators with the same precedence must have the same associativity.  A detailed example  Consider the expression \`5^4^3^2\`, in which \`^\` is taken to be a right-associative exponentiation operator. A parser reading the tokens from left to right would apply the associativity rule to a branch, because of the right-associativity of \`^\`, in the following way: # Term \`5\` is read. # Nonterminal \`^\` is read. Node: \\"\`5^\`\\". # Term \`4\` is read. Node: \\"\`5^4\`\\". # Nonterminal \`^\` is read, triggering the right-associativity rule. Associativity decides node: \\"\`5^(4^\`\\". # Term \`3\` is read. Node: \\"\`5^(4^3\`\\". # Nonterminal \`^\` is read, triggering the re-application of the right- associativity rule. Node \\"\`5^(4^(3^\`\\". # Term \`2\` is read. Node \\"\`5^(4^(3^2\`\\". # No tokens to read. Apply associativity to produce parse tree \\"\`5^(4^(3^2))\`\\". This can then be evaluated depth-first, starting at the top node (the first \`^\`): # The evaluator walks down the tree, from the first, over the second, to the third \`^\` expression. # It evaluates as: 32 = 9. The result replaces the expression branch as the second operand of the second \`^\`. # Evaluation continues one level up the parse tree as: 49 = 262144. Again, the result replaces the expression branch as the second operand of the first \`^\`. # Again, the evaluator steps up the tree to the root expression and evaluates as: 5262144 ‚âà 6.2060699 √ó 10183230. The last remaining branch collapses and the result becomes the overall result, therefore completing overall evaluation. A left-associative evaluation would have resulted in the parse tree \`((5^4)^3)^2\` and the completely different results 625, 244140625 and finally ~5.9604645 √ó 1016.  Right-associativity of assignment operators  In many imperative programming languages, the assignment operator is defined to be right-associative, and assignment is defined to be an expression (with a value), not just a statement. This allows chained assignment by using the value of one assignment expression as the input (right operand) of the next. For example, in C, the assignment \`a = b\` is an expression that returns a value (namely, \`b\` converted to the type of \`a\`) with the side effect of setting \`a\` to this value. An assignment can be performed in the middle of an expression. The right-associativity of the \`=\` operator allows expressions such as \`a = b = c\` to be interpreted as \`a = (b = c)\`, thereby setting both \`a\` and \`b\` to the value of \`c\`. In C, the alternative \`(a = b) = c\` does not make sense because \`a = b\` is not an l-Value, just an r-value. However, in C++ an assignment \`a = b\` returns a value referring to the left term in the assignment. Therefore, \`(a = b) = c\` can be interpreted as \`a = b; a = c;\`.  Non-associative operators  Non-associative operators are operators that have no defined behavior when used in sequence in an expression. In Prolog the infix operator \`:-\` is non-associative because constructs such as \\"\`a :- b :- c\`\\" constitute syntax errors. Another possibility is that sequences of certain operators are interpreted in some other way, which cannot be expressed as associativity. This generally means that syntactically, there is a special rule for sequences of these operations, and semantically the behavior is different. A good example is in Python, which has several such constructs.The Python Language Reference, \\"6. Expressions\\" Since assignments are statements, not operations, the assignment operator does not have a value and is not associative. Chained assignment is instead implemented by having a grammar rule for sequences of assignments \`a = b = c\`, which are then assigned left- to-right. Further, combinations of assignment and augmented assignment, like \`a = b += c\` are not legal in Python, though they are legal C. Another example are comparison operators, such as \`>\`, \`\`, and \`<=\`. A chained comparison like \`a < b < c\` is interpreted as \`(a < b) and (b < c)\`, not equivalent to either \`(a < b) < c\` or \`a < (b < c)\`.The Python Language Reference, \\"6.

It is part of the National Museums Liverpool group and is promoted as \\"the National Gallery of the North\\". It is funded directly by the UK government. History of Gallery and origins of the collection Arthur Devis - Mr and Mrs Atherton The Walker Art Gallery's collection dates from 1819 when the Liverpool Royal Institution acquired 37 paintings from the collection of William Roscoe, who had to sell his collection following the failure of his banking business, though it was saved from being broken up by his friends and associates. In 1843, the Royal Institution‚Äôs collection was displayed in a purpose-built gallery next to the Institution‚Äôs main premises. In 1850 negotiations by an association of citizens to take over the Institution‚Äôs collection, for display in a proposed art gallery, library and museum, came to nothing. The collection grew over the following decades: in 1851 Liverpool Town Council bought Liverpool Academy‚Äôs diploma collection and further works were acquired from the Liverpool Society for the Fine Arts, founded in 1858. The competition between the Academy and Society eventually led to both collapsing. William Brown Library and Museum opened in 1860, named after a Liverpool merchant whose generosity enabled the Town Council to act upon an 1852 Act of Parliament which allowed the establishment of a public library, museum and art gallery, and in 1871 the council organised the first Liverpool Autumn Exhibition, held at the new library and museum. The success of the exhibition enabled the Library, Museum and Arts Committee to purchase works for the council‚Äôs permanent collection, buying around 150 works between 1871 and 1910. Works acquired included WF Yeames‚Äô And when did you last see your father? and Dante Gabriel Rossetti‚Äôs Dante‚Äôs Dream.\\"The origins of the collection, 1819-1871\\", National Museums Liverpool Retrieved 25 June 2010 Foundation and development of the gallery Martin Archer Shee - William Roscoe, whose collection was the first founding collection of the gallery Designed by local architects Cornelius Sherlock and H. H. Vale, the Walker Art Gallery was opened on 6 September 1877 by Edward Henry Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby. It is named after its founding benefactor, Sir Andrew Barclay Walker (1824‚Äì1893), a former mayor of Liverpool and wealthy brewer born in Ayrshire who expanded the family business to England and moved to live in Gateacre. In 1893, the Liverpool Royal Institution placed its collection on long-term loan to the gallery and in 1948 presented William Roscoe's collection and other works. This occurred during post-war reconstruction when the gallery was closed, re-opening in 1951. During the Second World War the gallery was taken over by the Ministry of Food and the collection was dispersed for safety. Extensions to the gallery were opened in 1884 and 1933 (following a two-year closure) when the gallery re-opened with an exhibition including Picasso and Gauguin. In 2002 the gallery re-opened following a major refurbishment.

It was created in 1332 for John Darcy (or D'Arcy) with remainder to his heirs general, allowing daughters to inherit. At the death of the sixth baron, the barony fell into abeyance between his two daughters, which the Sovereign terminated in 1641 in favour of Conyers Darcy, as he was also an heir of the abeyant Barony Darcy de Darcy (created 1509). He also successfully petitioned for the termination of the abeyance of the Barony of Conyers in his favour, and both baronies were considered new creations, with remainder to his heirs male. He was called to parliament as Baron Darcy and Conyers. His son, also named Conyers Darcy, was granted the title of Earl of Holderness. The two titles remained united until the death of the fourth earl, when the earldom became extinct, while the baronies were claimed by his daughter, Lady Amelia. Lady Amelia was briefly married to the future fifth Duke of Leeds, and the sixth and seventh Dukes held the baronies de jure. At the death of the seventh Duke of Leeds in 1859, the two baronies separated from the dukedom. Sackville Lane-Fox, eldest son of the 7th Duke of Leeds' eldest daughter, claimed the baronies de jure, which again became abeyant upon his death in 1888. The abeyance for the Barony of Conyers was terminated in 1892 in favour of Lane-Fox's eldest daughter Marcia Pelham, Countess of Yarborough. On 29 September 1903, the abeyance of the Barony of Darcy de Knayth was terminated in favour of Lane-Fox's younger daughter, Violet Herbert, Countess of Powis. At the same time, the 1641 ruling, considering the titles new creations only for the heirs male of Conyers Darcy, was reversed, and the it was ruled that both baronies were to be held in remainder for heirs general.

The concept originates from and is most usually associated with the United States, especially with New York City. Outside the United States, ticker tape is often associated with the 1978 FIFA World Cup held in Argentina. History The term originated in New York City after a spontaneous celebration held on October 28, 1886, during the dedication of the Statue of Liberty and is still most closely associated with New York City. The term ticker tape originally referred to the use of the paper output of ticker tape machines, which were remotely driven devices used in brokerages to provide updated stock market quotes. The term ticker came from the sound made by the machine as it printed. In New York City, ticker tape parades are reserved for special occasions. Soon after the first such parade in 1886, city officials realized the utility of such events and began to hold them on triumphal occasions, such as the return of Theodore Roosevelt from his African safari, Gertrude Ederle swimming the English Channel, and Charles Lindbergh's trans- Atlantic flight. The first individual to be honored with a ticker tape parade was Admiral George Dewey, hero of the battle of Manila Bay, in 1899, when two million people came out to New York City.Laura Fitzpatrick \\"Brief History Ticker-Tape Parades.\\" Time Magazine 6 November 2009 Following World War II, several ticker tape parades were given in honor of victorious generals and admirals, including General Dwight D. Eisenhower and Admiral Chester Nimitz. Two of the longest and largest ticker tape parades were given for World War II and Korean War General Douglas MacArthur in 1951, after he was relieved of duty by President Harry S. Truman, and for astronaut John Glenn in 1962. Golfing greats Bobby Jones (1921 and 1930) and Ben Hogan (1953) were honored with ticker tape parades after their British Open triumphs. The section of lower Broadway through the Financial District that serves as the parade route for these events is colloquially called the \\"Canyon of Heroes\\". More than 200 black granite strips embedded in the sidewalks along the Canyon of Heroes list honorees of past ticker-tape parades. By the early 21st century, such parades became far more infrequent, largely limited to championship sports teams, and celebrations of the return of astronauts and military troops. Ticker tape technology became obsolete in the 1960s, as television and computers came into use for transmitting financial information. Modern parades utilize waste office paper and toilet paper that have been cut using conventional paper shredders.NYC Ticker-Tape Parade for U.S. Women‚Äôs Soccer Steps Off Friday The city also distributes paper confetti.Belson, Ken (February 7, 2008). \\"They Don‚Äôt Throw Paper Like They Used To\\".

It started as four-frame comic strips back in 1968 and evolved into fully sized collector books by the 1990s. The series continued until the early 2000s.  Subject  Sturmtruppen concerns the misadventures of an anonymous German army unit (which is implied to be a battalion) in various war theatres of World War II, by portraying the daily life, sufferings, problems and joys of the average, anonymous soldier. The Sturmtruppen never see a single enemy soldier in the course of decades of comic strips, though the enemy's presence is felt through sniper- tank- and artillery fire, whose lethal effects rake all too often through the ranks of the Sturmtruppen's forgotten soldiers. The series never explicitly mentioned that the war being fought is actually World War II, since no specific date is ever mentioned. There are, however, occasional references to specific battle theaters, place names as well as the mostly accurate portrayal of vehicles, weapons and uniforms of the period. Several deliberate anachronisms such as mentions of the Kaiser appear throughout the series, giving the impression that the war in question wages on endlessly, and that the stories told could be, in fact, referring to any war.  Language  A trademark of the comic is the use of an improper, German-mocking Italian, usually achieved by adding a final \\"-en\\" to most Italian words, or by exchanging \\"q\\"s with \\"k\\"s, and \\"v\\"s with \\"f\\"s to achieve a \\"German-sounding\\" Italian.  Themes  The stories and characters themselves are based partly on the military experience of the author himself, and partly on military literature (Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front, Guy Sajer's The Forgotten Soldier, Sven Hassel's books, etc...), folklore and of course stereotypes. Bonvi was also an expert in World War II German uniforms and equipment and, despite some cartoonish deformations, all of the Sturmtruppen hardware is historically faithful: from iconic objects and vehicles (MP40, Stielhandgranaten, personal harnesses, kubelwagens, stukas), to more obscure and esoteric weapons (like Brummbar assault guns). The subject of the stories themselves carry a lot of criticism against war and the absurdity of military bureaucracy and mentality and (also by references to Joseph Heller's Catch-22 and to Robert Altman's M*A*S*H) also the message that \\"civilian\\" life isn't much different from military life, disguised. But criticism can subtly extend to today life's aspects, including TV predominance, class divisions and Roman Church's dogma. The monologue of an anonymous soldier muttering to himself: :\\"Kuesta maledetta najen dovr√† pur finiren. Ne ho piene le tasken di dofer dire 'Signors√¨' a un kvalsiasi graduaten. Non fedo l'oren di ridifentaren un cifilen kvalsiasi e poter diren 'Sissisignore' a un kvalsiasi superioren\\", which can be translated (preserving the Pseudo-Germanisms) more or less as: :\\"Zis damned military service vill haff to end sometime. I've grown tired of hafing to say 'sir yes' to anyone with a higher ranken. I kan barely vait to return to being an anonymous civilian and being able to zay 'Yes,sir' to any of my superiors...\\" This gives a clear idea of the black humour and Kafkaesque atmosphere of this comic book.  Characters  Most characters don't have proper names but, rather, are called by their military rank or position. Most simple soldiers are given generic \\"German\\" names such as Otto, Franz, Fritz, etc. Recurring characters include: *The \\"Sergenten\\" (Sergeant), a cruel veteran completely absorbed into the system and obsessed with \\"duty\\" and \\"discipline\\". He frequently abuses his position by beating up soldiers for no reason and using them as living barbed wire poles and barricades, ordering them to run into a minefield or to remove their gas masks in the middle of a gas attack to \\"check out if it's safe\\", etc. Although he is referred to as a Sergeant, his arm rank chevrons are those of a Wehrmacht obergefreiter, which would be equivalent to a conscript corporal and not a feldwebel. *The \\"Kapitanen\\" (Captain) is sometimes one of the few characters representing sanity in an otherwise completely insane environment. He usually stays calm and rational even when dealing with the most bizarre and peculiar (or hilarious) situations. However, he is also hopelessly tied to the system and unable to think outside it. He is also easily drawn to dangerous tasks in order to advance his rank (the dangers are of course for the soldiers only). Even if he is just a Captain, he is often mentioned as commanding a battalion. Rarely, throughout the series his commanded unit is mentioned as being the \\"3rd Battalion\\". His character is also one of the most variable throughout the series, to adapt to new situations. Most of the time he is portrayed as no- nonsense, grumpy and distanced from his subordinates, while at the other extreme he has been portrayed as a chronic alcoholic with disregard even for personal danger, caring for his soldiers even after his death. When more than one higher officer were present in the same strip they ALL shared the same features (hawkish nose, taller stature, eyes obscured by the cap's visor) as if to reinforce Bonvi's 'class warfare' statement that 'superiors' are a kind of 'separate race' from 'common people'. *The \\"Mediken Militaren\\" (Military Medic), a Major of the medical corps who had actually studied as a veterinarian, but because \\"...animals refused to be treated by him, he was assigned to the closest human category: the soldiers.\\" From time to time the doctor becomes obsessed with things such as vampires, researching the elixir of invisibility or some \\"revolutionary\\" battlefield medicine procedure, usually at the expense of the poor soldiers and his fellow officers. His rank of Major is rarely ever mentioned in the series, with the most famous case being the episode with Captain asking for the doctor's urgent recovery in a psychiatric clinic due to his obsession with invisibility, only to be reminded by the higher command that \\"Since the doctor has a higher rank than him, he has the right to consider himself invisible as he wishes\\". *The \\"Sottotenenten di Komplementen\\" (Complement Second Lieutenant), an incompetent young officer who has obtained his rank through nepotism and bureaucracy inside the army itself. While he willingly offers to carry out the most dangerous and responsible tasks to prove himself, he usually ends up failing miserably. *The so-called Italian ally, \\"Il Fiero Alleaten Galeazzo Musolesi\\" (The Proud Ally Galeazzo Musolesi), with a name clearly mocking both Benito Mussolini and Galeazzo Ciano. The character is a dishonest and cowardly man always trying to steal from and take advantage of his \\"allies\\", willing to perform any task as long as it's not too hard and he can somehow cheat on it. He also has strange fixations like posing in front of the enemy in order to \\"demoralize them\\" (but only when the enemy lines are to his back) or cultivating small \\"war gardens\\" with vegetables. His name derives from a prank Bonvi played in high school when he wrote a letter to a local paper pretending to be a World War I veteran and signing it \\"Galeazzo Musolesi\\". *The prostitute (oft referred as \\"Lili Marlenen\\" in a nod to the famous Lili Marleen) is a leggy beauty (very 70-ish in appearance) clad in a trenchcoat and leaning to a bomb-distorted lamp-post. She's naturally ready to sell out her services to anyone but also has a naive and good-natured \\"admirer\\" who constantly brings her flowers and chocolates instead of the money she demands. *The \\"Kuoken Militaren\\" (Military Cook) is the battalion's cook, always being criticized for the quality of his food and usually having to deal with an eternal lack of food and supplies or administration problems. These problems usually result in him serving horrible food such as dried peas instead of pea soup \\"because there's no water\\", frozen soup, soup made of motor oil and boiled tires, or even from dirty laundry water. At one point there is a meat shortage, but the shortage is resolved after the mysterious disappearance of several young soldiers... The cook is also in constant battle with the \\"Sergenten\\" and the \\"Proud Ally\\" who always try to either sabotage his kitchen or steal his food. Common running jokes in the series involve the cook's experiments with \\"foods\\" such as pieces of cadavers or even Frankenstein-like ingredients that actually become alive and attack the soldiers. *The \\"Alleaten del Sol Levante\\" (The Ally from the Rising Sun) is a clear satire of the Japanese soldier, partly based on stereotypes such as a self-sacrificing attitude, sense of honor, etcetera. He is also portrayed as a sex maniac and exchanges racist taunts with Musolesi, whom he despises. Because of his short stature, for a long time he is believed to be the son of a gay couple of German soldiers. *The 27th Armoured Battalion (of Discipline) is a duo of hardened veterans who embody Bonvi's homage to Sven Hassel picturesque war novels. The unkempt, tough-as-nails grognards are the only soldiers not to be intimidated by the cruel sergeant and often manage to scare him away. They spend time defusing aircraft bombs with impromptu equipment (such as bottle-openers) and telling colorful anecdotes of their previous experiences in Penal units and military jails (often lifted 'as-is' from Hassel's novels). *The Uffizialen Superioren (Superior Officers) represent the remote source of supreme authority, which occasionally materializes as colonels, generals or other inspecting officers. In one series, an aging general finds himself stripped off his uniform and, by extension, of all his authority and might. He is rudely treated as a senile old man, until he manages to get his uniform back, along with all his respect and authority. *The SS execution squad and the Jew are one of the many examples of dark humour in Sturmtruppen: the SS must \\"exterminate\\" the Jew, but they are so bad at shooting that they always miss; the SS commander blames the Jew for moving. On his side, the Jew is very collaborative, trying to cheer up the SS commander when he suffers a nervous breakdown by telling him the details of his execution and cremation. *The Eroiken Portaferiten (combat medics) are tasked with recovering wounded soldiers from the battlefield with their stretcher. However, they are often clumsy and end up aggravating the conditions of the wounded themselves, when they are not actually looting the fallen and wounded for golden watches, golden teeth, wallets, et cetera. *Private Bekkinen Franz (Undertaker Franz) is the battalion's undertaker, with the grim task of burying the dead. Doing so has turned himself into a grim, insensitive man, down to the point of interpreting the noise and complaints made by men buried still alive as \\"interference with his work\\" and \\"disrespect for the defunct\\". *Soldaten Humbert (Private Humbert) is a caveman-like soldier covered in a thick fur and having very poor personal hygiene and revolting habits, taken to grotesque extremes such as eating his own lice, forcing anyone near him to wear a gas mask, and eating with his bare hands claiming that \\"this way, flies stick to the fingers and don't enter the mouth\\". He is implied to never have bathed in his life (but this is also implied of the Sergenten), and an attempt to shave off his fur results in him disappearing under a large pile of hair, raising doubts as to his actually being human. He often is shown as only capable of grunting and screaming, but in some strips he can talk normally and drive a motorcycle. *Soldaten Sigfried von Nibelunghen (Private Sigfried von Nibelunghen) is a young recruit who proudly admits having falsified his birth certificate in order to enlist voluntarily. He eagerly volunteers to perform all sorts of dangerous or tedious tasks, such as accepting \\"the extraordinary honour\\" of performing five consecutive watch turns, or laying minefields blindfolded so that \\"even under torture, he would not be able to give the mines' positions away to the enemy\\". He also pesters the Captain to order an attack on a sun-bathed field of golden crops, so that he can die a \\"heroic death\\". He falls victim to one of his own mines, and loses all ability to communicate, rendering him a prisoner in his own body. In the end, as he considers the harsh reality of his condition against the idealized vision of war he had been led to believe, he thinks to himself, \\"I fear that I have been duped\\".  Film adaptations  Sturmtruppens success spurred two cinema adaptations. The first one, Sturmtruppen (1976), was co-written by Bonvicini and directed by Salvatore Samperi. In 1982 a sequel, ', was released, again directed by Samperi and featuring Renato Pozzetto, Massimo Boldi and Teo Teocoli. Bonvi had a small part as a German officer. On 16 August 2006 Miramax moved forward with plans to create a live- action movie based on Sturmtruppen. Videogame adaptations There has been only one officially licensed video game based on the Sturmtruppen comics, on the Amiga platform, called Sturmtruppen: The Videogame published by the Italian software publisher iDea in 1992. The game was not critically well received, getting a 44% score by Amiga Joker magazine in November 1992, and 3/5 stars from Amiga Power in 1994.

Indoor soccer, as it is most often known in the United States and Canada, was originally developed in these two countries as a way to play soccer during the winter months, when snow would make outdoor play difficult. In those countries, gymnasiums are adapted for indoor soccer play. In other countries the game is played in either indoor or outdoor arenas surrounded by walls, and is referred to by different names (such as \\"fast football\\" (futbol rapido) in Mexico, Futebol Society or showbol in South America,https://pantelas.com.br/futebol- society-historia-e-regras/ and \\"indoor football\\" (futbol indoor) in Spain). Indoor soccer has different regulations from other versions of association football designed for indoor play, such as futsal and five-a-side football. Unlike futsal, which is played on wooden or ceramic surfaces, indoor soccer is played on synthetic turf (or, in the case of the British Masters Football variety, synthetic carpet).http://mastersfootball.com/uk/ Indoor soccer courts are either delimited by walls or lines, and there are no player throw-ins. FIFA, the international body that oversees international association football competitions, does not sanction the synthetic turf version of indoor soccer, having developed its own code of indoor football (which they refer to as futsal). Indoor soccer is most popular in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, with several amateur, collegiate and professional leagues functioning. While internationally less popular than futsal, indoor soccer is also played at the league level in many countries outside North America. The World Minifootball Federation (WMF) is the governing body of indoor soccer at the international level, having replaced the International Fast Football Federation (FIFRA). The term minifootball, which was originally coined in Europe, has been adopted by the WMF as a standard international name for the sport.  Indoor soccer around the world =International competitions Indoor soccer is played throughout the world. Currently, the international federation dedicated to promoting the sport is the World Minifootball Federation (WMF) based in Switzerland. The WMF replaced the International Fast Football Federation (FIFRA), which had been based in Mexico and later, the United States. There are also regional federations who govern the sport including: African Minifootball Federation (AMF), Asian Minifootball Confederation (AMC), Confederaci√≥n Panamericana de Minif√∫tbol (CPM), European Minifootball Federation (EMF), Oceania Minifootball Federation (OMF). During its existence, FIFRA organized several indoor soccer tournaments for national teams, including the Indoor Soccer World Championship. The only edition of this tournament took place in Mexico in 1997.http://futbolweb.mx.tripod.com/ No other world championship was played until 2015, when the first WMF World Cup was held in the United States. As of 2019 three WMF World Cups have been organized, with Mexico being the current world champion. A World Cup for Under-21 players was held in Prague in 2018, with the Czech team taking the title.http://www.minifootball.com/divisions/26646/brackets?logged_out=true A World Cup for women is planned for 2021 in Kyiv, Ukraine.http://www.minifootball.com/ Star Sixes, an indoor six-a-side football tournament for national teams from around the world, was held in the O2 Arena in London in 2017. Held outside the auspices of the WMF, this tournament featured players which formerly played in the association football national teams of their home countries. A total of twelve teams participated, with France winning the title.http://starsixes.com/france-win-inaugural-betsafe- star-sixes/ It is intended to make Star Sixes a recurring event;https://www.theguardian.com/football/the-agony-and-the- ecstasy/2017/mar/28/five-a-side-futsal-star-sixes-football- tournamenthttps://www.list.co.uk/event/660411-star-sixes/ a second edition took place in 2019, with England winning the title. United States and Canada Indoor soccer is a common sport in the United States and especially Canada, with both amateur and professional leagues, due to the short season for outdoor soccer in Canada and the Northern United States, and the ubiquity of arenas built for ice hockey and basketball which can easily be converted to indoor soccer (similar reasons as to why indoor lacrosse is more popular in Canada, field lacrosse in the United States). Indoor soccer is especially popular in Northern Canada due to the often unplayable outdoor conditions and its appearance in the Arctic Winter Games. Mexico Indoor soccer or futbol rapido has also become a popular sport in Mexico, being included as part of the Universiada (University National Games) and the CONADEIP (Private School Tournament), in which university school teams from all over Mexico compete. In Mexico, \\"indoor\\" soccer fields are frequently built outdoors (though indoor courts are also used in some tournaments). In 2012 an eight- team indoor soccer league was launched, which consists of former professional association football players from Liga MX.http://www.record.com.mx/futbol- futbol-nacional-otros/presentan-la-liga-de-futbol-indoor-mexico South America Indoor soccer is known in Brazil as showbol, with several current regional leagues. Formal national leagues have also been formed in Bolivia, Colombia, Uruguay, Ecuador and Peru. However, the most common variation of indoor soccer played in Brazil is futsal. Europe Indoor soccer is also played in several European countries. In the United Kingdom, Masters Football is the most well-known competition. Tournaments among Masters teams (consisting of veteran former players from professional 11-a-side teams from each country) are regularly played. In Spain, some over-30 ex-professionals represent their clubs in the Liga Fertiberia which plays a five-a-side variant. The European indoor soccer federation, known as the European Minifootball Federation (EMF), organizes the European Minifootball Championship (miniEURO) every year, and in recent years countries have established national minifootball associations. EMF organize variations of six-a-side football and this could come in different shapes and sizes from a large custom-built facility with multiple pitches or even an 11-a-side pitch temporarily split into smaller pitches. This is not to be confused with the term used in Russia and some other former Soviet countries, where the term mini-football is used to describe futsal. Rules Diagram of a possible North American indoor soccer field Rules vary between governing bodies, but some of the nearly universal rule deviations from association football include: * The Field. Most indoor soccer arenas are rectangular or oblong in shape, with artificial turf floors. In many collegiate intramural leagues, the game may be played on basketball courts, in which case the floor is hardwood. Walls (often the hockey dasher boards and plexiglas used for that sport) bound the arena. Field sizes are generally smaller than soccer fields, and the goals are recessed into the walls. Goals are also smaller than in standard soccer and the penalty area is also smaller. The field is commonly 200' by 85' (approx 61m by 26m), the regulation size for a hockey rink in North America. * Duration. Most indoor soccer games are divided into four quarters of 15 minutes each, for a total of 60 minutes of play time. There are two 3-minute periods between the first and second, third and fourth quarters and one 15-minute half-time between the second and third quarters. If the game stays tied until the time runs out, there will be extra 15-minute, golden goal overtime periods. However, amateur leagues generally consist of two 25-minute halves with no overtime for tied games. * The team. Most indoor soccer games are played with six active players per team including goalkeeper and either defense or forward also known as attackers and strikers. Substitute players are permitted. At high levels of play, it is common for players to move fluidly between positions instead of staying statically in one position. * Play off of walls. The ball may be struck in such a way that it contacts one or more walls without penalty or stoppage. If the ball flies over the walls or contacts the ceiling, play is stopped and the team opposing the one that most recently touched the ball is awarded a free kick at the location where the ball left the arena or made contact with the ceiling. * Contact rules. Standard contact rules generally apply (i.e. ball contact must be made during a play on the ball, no charging with hands or elbows, no charging from behind, no holding the opponent etc.). Many leagues ban the use of the sliding tackle, though such techniques are less useful on artificial turf or wood than they are on a slick natural turf field. If one attempts to slide on an indoor field, painful burns and/or cuts can occur. * No offside. Most leagues play without an offside rule. Some leagues enforce a \\"three-line violation\\", prohibiting players from playing the ball in the air from behind the front line of their own penalty area across all three lines into the opponent's penalty area. Violations often result in a free kick for the opposing team at the front line of the offending team's penalty area. Beyond these common threads, the sport is structured according to the idiosyncrasies of individual leagues. Most of these rules are adopted from other arena sports like ice hockey. Below is a listing of some of the more common ones: * Substitution. Most leagues allow unlimited substitutions while the ball is out of play. Some allow live substitution while the game is in progress, provided that one player leaves the arena before another steps on. A minority of leagues require substitution in shifts. * Cards. In addition to the traditional yellow and red cards of association football, some leagues include a card of a third color (blue is a common color) or another form of warning before the issuance of a yellow card. Often, leagues with a third card include a penalty box rule, and issuance of this third card requires the penalized player to sit in the box for a prescribed period of time (usually two minutes as in ice hockey) during which his or her team plays shorthanded. In leagues using the traditional card system, it is common for the yellow card to carry with it a penalty box rule. * Zones. Because of short fields and walls surrounding the goal, a common tactic is to attempt to score at kickoff by shooting at the goal and charging at the goal with all five non-goalkeeper players who overwhelm the other team's defense and score at close range. As this depletes the tactics and drama of the game, many leagues have adopted an ice hockey-like zone rule, requiring that the ball not cross more than a certain forward distance toward the goal without being touched by a player. * The ball. For leagues that play on hardwood, the ball is generally covered with suede or a similar non-marking covering. The harder surface generally makes the ball \\"bouncier\\" and more difficult to control, which in turn tends to make scoring goals more complicated. * The crease. Some leagues enforce a special zone inside the goalkeeper's box called the crease. No player may shoot the ball from inside the crease unless that player entered the crease already having the ball. * Multi-point scoring. Some leagues value goals scored from a greater distance to be worth two or three points from behind an arc, similar to basketball's three-point field goal. Sometimes, leagues with a multi-point system also use a rule that a minor technical infraction gives the non-offending team a one- on-one opportunity to score on the opposing goalkeeper, worth one point. Many indoor coed leagues will give a female player two points for scoring a single goal. * Sixth attacker. Some leagues allow a team which is trailing by one or two goals late in the final period to replace the goalkeeper with a sixth position player to increase its offense in an attempt to tie the match, exactly as is done in ice hockey under those conditions.

A sliding tackle or slide tackle is a tackle in association football. It is completed with one leg extended to push the ball away from the opposing player. Sliding tackles can often be sources of controversy, particularly when players being tackled fall down over the tackler's foot (or the ball stopped by the tackler's foot), and penalties, free kicks and cards are assessed (or are conspicuous by their absence). Commonly associated fouls and misconduct A sliding tackle is not in itself foul play; however, there are a number of fouls that commonly occur during the execution of a sliding tackle. Examples of such fouls punishable by a direct free kick or penalty kick include: *When a player in a manner considered by the referee to be careless, reckless or using excessive force: **kicks or attempts to kick an opponent; **trips or attempts to trip an opponent; **jumps at an opponent; **charges an opponent; **tackles an opponent. Careless means that the player has shown a lack of attention of consideration when making a challenge or that he acted without precaution. Reckless means that the player has acted with complete disregard to the danger to, or consequences for, his opponent. Using excessive force means that the player has far exceeded the necessary use of force and is in danger of injuring an opponent.https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/footballdevelopment/refereeing/02/36/01/11/27%5f06%5f2014%5fnew --lawsofthegameweben%5fneutral.pdf Careless challenges are punished by only a direct free kick or penalty kick. However, reckless challenges are also punished with a caution (yellow card) for unsporting behaviour as well as a direct free kick or penalty kick, while challenges committed with excessive force are also punished with a send-off (red card) for serious foul play as well as a direct free kick or penalty kick. Playing in a dangerous manner is punishable by an indirect free kick. Playing in a dangerous manner is defined as any action, that while trying to play the ball, threatens injury to someone (including the player himself). It is committed with an opponent nearby and prevents the opponent from playing the ball for fear of injury. If any physical contact is made, the offence becomes an offence punishable with a direct free kick or penalty kick. Slide tackles that are made as two-footed lunges at an opponent are generally considered to endanger the safety of an opponent and are hence sanctioned as serious foul play, resulting in a sending-off. This is still the case even if the ball is won cleanly without touching an opponent. Strategy Arturo Vidal tackles Brazil's Kak√° at the 2010 FIFA World Cup The slide tackle is attractive to the defender because it allows him to cover a larger area of ground while attempting to dispossess an opponent. It is often a \\"last-ditch\\" attempt to dispossess an opponent due to frequent misses and the difficulty of recovering in the event that the slide tackle fails to take the ball away. After a slide tackle, the tackler is left sitting or lying on the ground with one leg extended. The tackler therefore also runs the risk of personal injury. Ideally, the other foot ends up folded underneath their rear end, where it can be used to push the tackler back up to their feet to continue play. If doing a sliding tackle to the right, the player's right leg must be straight when going down into the tackle and their left leg should be bent slightly behind the right one in order to achieve maximum potential in gaining the ball. If doing a sliding tackle to the left, the player's left leg must be straight and their right leg should not be bent behind the left one, as this can cause injury to the player.

Potential revisions In 2017, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Twitter that he intends to have Marshall P√©tain's plaque removed from the Canyon of Heroes. This happened after a national debate over the propriety of Confederate monuments spilled over into a reassessment of monuments in general. P√©tain was honored in 1931 for his service in World War I. After France's defeat by Germany, he advocated surrender rather than resistance; P√©tain headed the Nazi collaborationist government of Vichy France from 1940-1944\\\\. France itself has largely removed all commemoration for P√©tain; the last street named after him was renamed in 2010. References *Kenneth T. Jackson, ed.

The term \\"September Six\\" was coined by The Salt Lake Tribune and was used in the media and subsequent discussion.Salt Lake Tribune, June 16, 2014 The church's action was referred to by some as evidence of an anti-intellectual posture on the part of church leadership. One Nation Under Gods, Richard Abanes, pp.417-419  Six Individuals = Lynne Kanavel Whitesides  Lynne Kanavel Whitesides is a Mormon feminist and is noted for speaking on the Mother in Heaven. Whitesides was the first of the group to experience church discipline and was disfellowshipped September 14, 1993. Though technically still a member, Whitesides claims that she \\"burst\\" out of the church and her marriage in 1993, and she now considers herself a practitioner of Native American philosophies..  Avraham Gileadi  Avraham Gileadi is a Hebrew scholar and literary analyst, who is considered theologically conservative. Following his 1981 Ph.D. in Ancient Studies from Brigham Young University, he published a new interpretive translation of the Book of Isaiah in 1988 and a study of its eschatological prophecies in 1991. Mormon scholars, including Hugh Nibley, Truman G. Madsen and Ellis Rasmussen, praised his work, but his argument that the Isaiah prophecies pointed to a human \\"Davidic king\\" who would emerge in the Last Days, apart from Jesus Christ, was controversial, and his second book was pulled from the shelves by its publisher, church-owned Deseret Book. The reasons for his excommunication on September 15 are unclear. According to Margaret Toscano (whose husband was among the September Six and who would also later be excommunicated), Gileadi's \\"books interpreting Mormon scripture challenged the exclusive right of leaders to define doctrine,\\" but Gileadi himself disputes that characterization. The church afterwards reversed its disciplinary action against him and expunged it from the church's records, which is now officially regarded as having never happened. Gileadi is currently an active member of the church. He has continued to write books on Isaiah, including The Literary Message of Isaiah (2002) and Isaiah Decoded: Ascending the Ladder to Heaven (2002).  Paul Toscano  Paul Toscano is a Salt Lake City attorney who co-authored, with Margaret Merrill Toscano, a controversial book, Strangers in Paradox: Explorations in Mormon Theology (1990), and in 1992, he co-founded The Mormon Alliance. He later wrote the book The Sanctity of Dissent (1994) and its sequel, The Sacrament of Doubt (2007). He was excommunicated from the LDS Church on September 19, 1993. The reasons for his excommunication, as reportedly given by church leaders, were apostasy and false teaching. According to Toscano, the actual reason was insubordination in refusing to curb his sharp criticism of Church leaders' preference for legalism, ecclesiastical tyranny, white-washed Mormon history, and hierarchical authoritarianism, which privilege the image of the corporate church above its commitment to its members, to the teachings and the revelations of founder Joseph Smith, and to the gospel of Jesus Christ. In 2007, Toscano wrote that he lost his faith \\"like losing your eyesight after an accident.\\" He regrets that church leaders have disregarded his criticisms of what he considers the church's growing anti-intellectualism, homophobia, misogyny, and elitism. Toscano's wife, Margaret, faced her own disciplinary council for her doctrinal and feminist views and was excommunicated on November 30, 2000. Some view her excommunication as constituting a \\"seventh\\" member of the September Six, as she was summoned in 1993, but ecclesiastical focus shifted to her husband. Margaret's discipline was delayed until 2000.Tidying Up Loose Ends?: The November 2000 Excommunication of Margaret Toscano, 2001 Salt Lake Sunstone Symposium, Sunstone Magazine. Margaret later wrote \\"The Missing Rib: The Forgotten Place of Queens and Priestesses in the Establishment of Zion\\" as well as the tenth chapter of Transforming the Faiths of our Fathers: Women who Changed American Religion (2004), edited by Ann Braude.  Maxine Hanks  Maxine Hanks is a Mormon feminist theologian, who compiled and edited the anthology Women and Authority: Re-emerging Mormon Feminism (1992). She was excommunicated on September 19, along with fellow contributor D. Michael Quinn. In February 2012, Hanks was rebaptized as a member of the church.Excommunicated Mormon to tell how she came back to the faith  Lavina Fielding Anderson  Lavina Fielding Anderson is a Mormon feminist writer who edited the books Sisters in Spirit: Mormon Women in Historical and Cultural Perspective (1992) and Lucy's Book, an edition of the Lucy Mack Smith narrative. She is a former editor for the Ensign and served as editor for the Journal of Mormon History from 1991 to May 2009. She was excommunicated September 23 for apostasy, allegedly because of her article \\"The LDS Intellectual Community and Church Leadership: A Contemporary Chronology\\" in Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought. She also wrote chapter 9, \\"The Grammar of Inequity\\" in the book Women and Authority: Re-emerging Mormon Feminism (1992). Anderson continues to attend LDS Church services as a non-member. She writes on Mormon issues, including editing the multi-volume Case Reports of the Mormon Alliance, an ongoing collection of interviews with Mormons who believe they were unfairly disciplined by the church. After her husband's death in 2018, Anderson's bishop approached her about reinstatement, the first ecclesiastical leader in the 24 years since she was excommunicated to do so. The stake high council and regional council recommended to the First Presidency that she be reinstated, but on August 27, 2019, they received a denial without an explanation. Anderson continues to attend weekly church services and published in 2020 a collection of essays regarding inclusiveness and gender inequality in her book Mercy Without End: Toward a More Inclusive Church.  D. Michael Quinn  D. Michael Quinn is a Mormon historian. Among other studies, he documented LDS Church-sanctioned polygamy from 1890 until 1904, after the 1890 Manifesto that officially abandoned the practice.\\"LDS Church Authority and New Plural Marriages, 1890-1904,\\" Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought 18 (Spring 1985) 9-105 He wrote chapter 17, \\"Mormon Women Have Had the Priesthood Since 1843\\" in the book Women and Authority: Re-emerging Mormon Feminism (1992). He was excommunicated September 26. Quinn was summoned to a disciplinary council to answer charges of \\"conduct unbecoming a member of the Church and apostasy,\\" including \\"'very sensitive and highly confidential' matters that were not related to Michael's historical writings.\\" Anderson has suggested that the \\"allusion to Michael's sexual orientation, which Michael had not yet made public, was unmistakable.\\" Quinn has since published several critical studies of Mormon hierarchy, including his three-volume work of The Mormon Hierarchy: Origins of Power, The Mormon Hierarchy: Extensions of Power, and The Mormon Hierarchy: Wealth and Corporate Power. He also authored the 1996 book Same-Sex Dynamics Among Nineteenth-Century Americans: A Mormon Example, which argues that homosexuality was common among early Mormons and was not seen as a serious sin or transgression. He also authored the 1987 book, Early Mormonism and the Magic World View, which argues that early Mormon leaders were greatly influenced by folk magic and superstitious beliefs including stone looking, charms, and divining rods. Despite his excommunication and critical writings, Quinn, who is now openly gay, still considers himself to be a Latter-day Saint.Lavina Fielding Anderson. \\"DNA Mormon: D.

Church measures taken Except for Whitesides, all of the September Six were excommunicated. Whitesides was disfellowshipped, a lesser sanction that does not formally expel one from church membership. To date, three of the September Six have retained or regained church membership: Avraham GileadiFidel, Steve. \\"Scholar Rebaptized Into LDS Church.\\" Salt Lake City and Utah Breaking News.

While the LDS Church sometimes announces that a prominent member has been excommunicated, the default policy is to refuse to publicly discuss details about the reasons for any excommunication, even if details of the proceedings are made public by that person. Other than the summons sent to each of the six (specifying that their behavior was \\"contrary to the laws and order of the church\\"), the church is silent on why a member was disciplined. Such disciplinary proceedings are typically undertaken locally, initiated by leaders at the ward or stake level, although at least one of the September Six suggested his excommunication was orchestrated by higher-ranking church leaders. Procedures pertaining to the organization of these disciplinary councils are found in the church's scriptural Doctrine and Covenants section 102 as well as in its administrative handbook. During the time of the September Six, Handbook 1, which was only available to ecclesiastical leaders, was in use. In 2020, the church publicly published a revised handbook, General Handbook: Serving in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The 2020 Handbook changes some language and procedures regarding church discipline. The LDS Church later excommunicated Janice Merrill Allred in 1995 and Margaret Merrill Toscano in 2000, both of whom had collaborated with several of the September Six and were also involved in disciplinary actions during 1993.Allred, Janice, 1997. \\"My Struggle for a More Loving, Tolerant, and Egalitarian Church\\", Case Reports of the Mormon Alliance 2(4). http://mormon-alliance.org/casereports/volume2/part4/v2p4.htm See also * Criticism of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints * Mormonism and history * Strengthening Church Members Committee * Ordain Women * Sonia Johnson * Janice Merrill Allred * Mormon feminism * John Dehlin NotesReferences * Anderson, Lavina Fielding. \\"The LDS intellectual community and church leadership: A contemporary chronology.\\" Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, 26(1) [Spring 1993], 7-64. * Anderson, Lavina Fielding. \\"Freedom of Conscience: A Personal Statement.\\" Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, 26(4) [Winter 1993], 196-202. * Anderson, Lavina Fielding. \\"The Church and Its Scholars: Ten Years After.\\" Sunstone, 128 (July 2003), 13-19.

He was associated primarily with the dummy Lord Charles and later also with the puppets Tich and Quackers. Lord Charles was the first ventriloquist's dummy, to have his own personal microphone, which was first fitted by sound professional Douglas Oakley whilst working with Lord Charles at Thames TV, and became a regular feature thereafter. Biography Born in Greenwich, London, Alan was educated at Morden Terrace School, Lewisham.Who's Who on Television (1982), ITV Books, Michael Joseph Ltd, p.6, Alan was introduced to the world of entertainment at a young age, entering a talent contest at the age of five at his local Gaumont cinema. Career Aged 13 he became a call-boy at the Lewisham Hippodrome Theatre, where he started to do magic sets on stage between acts. He then started to entertain private functions, introducing ventriloquism into his act, along with playing the ukulele. Alan toured in cabaret all over the world and performed once with Laurel and Hardy in 1954. Laurel had provided inspiration for the look of Alan's most famous creation, Lord Charles, who first appeared at a charity show in Wormwood Scrubs Prison, London. Alan made his television debut with Lord Charles on the BBC programme The Good Old Days in the 1960s and the pair regularly re-appeared on the programme. In the 1960s he also appeared on a children's programme Tich and Quackers with Tich, a small boy, and his pet duck Quackers. He also created the puppet character Ali Cat for the HTV series Magic Circle (1977). He was also the presenter for two years of the BBC show Ice Show. In 1985 he was a special guest for Bob Hope's birthday show at London's Lyric Theatre. In 1986 he presented a show on Channel 4 on ventriloquism, called A Gottle of Geer. He also wrote for Tony Hancock, Dave Allen and for the shows Morecambe and Wise, The Two Ronnies and Bootsie and Snudge, usually under the name Ray Whyberd. Later life Alan continued to perform into his seventies, doing tours and also undertaking conference and corporate events. In 1998/1999 he entertained guests on the QE2. He also wrote for many shows, including a documentary entitled A Gottle of Geer for Channel 4, and the ITV show And There's More in 1985 which starred Jimmy Cricket. Alan wrote four novels: Death and Deception in 2007 and A Game of Murder in 2008 (both published by Robert Hale), A Fear of Vengeance (2010, published by F. A. Thorpe) and Retribution (2011, published posthumously by Robert Hale Ltd). He took a break from stage work due to ill health but he did not rule out a return, if his health had permitted. His last stage appearance was in November 2008 when he performed at a special charity concert in Bridlington organised by his friend Sir Greg Knight who is MP for the town. At the end of his performance he received a standing ovation. Death Alan died aged 79 on the morning of 24 May 2010. It is thought he stopped breathing overnight after complaining of feeling unwell at his home in Reigate, Surrey.

He was a Liberal member of the House of Representatives for over 25 years, serving between 1975 and 2001, and was a minister in the Fraser and Howard governments. Background and early career Moore was born in Rockhampton, Queensland. He was raised on a cattle station west of Bowen. His early education was through the Australian correspondence system used for isolated families. He finished his secondary education at The Armidale School, an Anglican boarding school for boys, before entering the University of Queensland and graduating with a Bachelor of Commerce with additional study in Accounting. Before he entered politics, Moore had a very successful career as a businessman and stock broker. He spent four years (1960‚Äì1963) with A.R. Walker & Co. before forming his own brokerage (John Moore & Company) in 1964. He was a member of the Brisbane Stock Exchange from 1961 until 1974. He grew his firm into the largest single trader business in Queensland, opening offices in regional centres there and in New South Wales. He also held directorship or board membership in a number of Australian companies, such as Brandt Limited and Phillips. He was a board member of the Australian subsidiary of some multinational investment firms including Merrill Lynch and Citigroup. Moore was appointed to the Council of The Australian National University in 1971, and served as a Councillor until 1976. Moore became a member of the Liberal Party in 1964, and by 1966 was serving in its state Executive Committee in Queensland. He was President of the Queensland Party twice; from 1973 to 1976 and again from 1984 to 1990. By party rules this also made him a member of the Federal Executive Committee (FEC) of the party. He served on the FEC in one role or another for almost thirty years. Political career Moore was elected to the House of Representatives for the Division of Ryan in Brisbane at the 1975 federal election. His first ministerial office was during the fourth Fraser government, when he was Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs from 1980 to 1982. He was forced to resign from this portfolio when it was shown that fellow minister Michael MacKellar had brought a television into Australia without paying customs duty and that Moore as the minister responsible for Customs had failed to adequately respond to a report of the incident. While the Labor governments of Hawke and Keating were in power 1983‚Äì1996, Moore served in the opposition's Shadow Cabinet for several key ministries including Finance, Industry and Commerce, and Communications. In 1985 Liberal leader Andrew Peacock chose John Moore to challenge deputy Liberal leader John Howard but Howard retained the position beating Moore in a vote by Liberal partyroom members. This led to Peacock resigning as leader and Howard elected in his place. Moore again contested the deputy leadership now vacated by Howard's elevation as leader but the position was ultimately won by Neil Brown. In March 1996 Moore was appointed to the Cabinet in the new Howard Coalition government, as Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism and Vice- President of the Executive Council. In this position Moore had a major role in shaping new government policies affecting the motor vehicle and pharmaceutical industries. In cooperation with industrial leaders, he created a long range policy package, \\"Investing for Growth.\\" In 1996, Moore came close to being forced to resign a ministry for the second time in his career, when it was discovered that his share holdings included significant investments that could potentially create a conflict of interest with his ministerial portfolio. These investments breached the Howard's ministerial code of conduct, but Moore was allowed to stay on. After the 1998 election, Moore was appointed as Minister for Defence. The most significant events during this period were the deployment of forces to East Timor as a part of the U.N. peace-keeping effort and the upgrade and operationalisation of the Collins Class Submarine Fleet. Famously, Moore had a falling out with the Secretary of the Department of Defence, Paul Barratt, resulting in the termination of Barratt's employment contract. Moore's most lasting legacy within the Australian Defence Force was the White Paper Defence 2000: Our Future Defence Force, released late in his ministry. Howard said: \\"The Defence White Paper is the most far-sighted reshaping of Australia's defence capability in a generation. It would not have been possible without John Moore's determination to improve management within Defence and also win new resources for the ADF\\". During the course of his second term in government, Howard reorganised Cabinet, and appointed Peter Reith as the Minister for Defence, with effect from 30 January 2001. Moore resigned his seat in Parliament on 5 February 2001. His resignation came at a bad time for the government, and the subsequent Ryan by-election saw Labor take the normally comfortably safe Liberal seat. In 2015, Moore and three other former MPs brought a case before the High Court of Australia, purporting that reductions to their retirement allowances and limitations on the number of \\"domestic return trips per year\\" under the Members of Parliament (Life Gold Pass) Act 2002 was unconstitutional under S51(xxxi) of the Constitution of Australia. They lost the case in 2016, with the court finding that Parliament was entitled to vary the terms of allowances. Honours Moore was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia in 2004 for service to the community through the Australian Parliament, to the development of strategic industry policy, and to both policy and management reform in the defence sector.

It is part of Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and one of the institutions that comprise the King's Health Partners, an academic health science centre. It is a large teaching hospital and is, with St Thomas' Hospital and King's College Hospital, the location of King's College London GKT School of Medical Education. The hospital's Tower Wing (originally known as Guy's Tower) was, when built, the tallest hospital building in the world, standing at with 34 floors. The tower was overtaken as the world's tallest healthcare-related building by The Belaire in New York City in 1988. As of June 2019, the Tower Wing, which remains one of the tallest buildings in London, is the world's fifth-tallest hospital building. History 1820 Engraving of entrance by James Elmes and William Woolnoth. The location of Guy's and St Thomas' hospitals, c. 1833 The hospital dates from 1721, when it was founded by philanthropist Thomas Guy, who had made a fortune as a publisher of unlicensed Bibles. It was originally established as a hospital to treat \\"incurables\\" discharged from St Thomas' Hospital. Guy had been a Governor and benefactor of St Thomas' and his fellow Governors supported his intention by granting the south-side of St Thomas' Street for a peppercorn rent for 999 years. Following his death in 1724, Thomas Guy was entombed at the hospital's chapel (also dating from the 18th century), in a tomb featuring a marble sculpture by John Bacon. The original buildings formed a courtyard facing St Thomas Street, comprising the hall on the east side and the Chapel, Matron's House and Surgeon's House on the west-side. A bequest of ¬£180,000 by William Hunt in 1829, one of the largest charitable bequests in England in historic terms, allowed for a further hundred beds to be accommodated. Hunt's name was given to the southern expansion of the hospital buildings which took place in 1850. Two inner quadrangles were divided by a cloister which was later restyled and dedicated to the hospital's members who fell in the First World War. The east side comprised the care wards and the 'counting house' with the governors 'Burfoot Court Room'. The north-side quadrangle is dominated by a statue of Lord Nuffield (1877‚Äì1963) who was the chairman of governors for many years and also a major benefactor. In 1974, the hospital added the 34-storey Guy's Tower and 29-storey Guy's House: this complex was designed by Watkins Gray. The Wolfson Centre for Age-Related Diseases, which is dedicated to improving outcomes of conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, stroke, Parkinson's disease and spinal cord injury, was opened by the Princess Royal in December 2004. In October 2005 children's departments moved to the Evelina London Children's Hospital in the grounds next to St Thomas's close to the Palace of Westminster. A new cancer centre, built by Laing O'Rourke at a cost of ¬£160 million, was completed in April 2016. Facilities Surgery is performed at Guy's in 1941 Medical services at the Guy's site are now concentrated in the buildings to the east of Great Maze Pond: these buildings, which are connected, are known as Tower Wing, Bermondsey Wing, Southwark Wing and Borough Wing. The Cancer Centre is in a separate building just to the south. To the west of the Great Maze Pond is Guy's Campus which forms part of King's College London. At high, Guy's Tower (now called the Tower Wing) regained its tallest hospital building in the world status in 2014.

Karl Scharschmidt came to Romania from Hungary in 1856 and settled in Bucharest. John H. Y.

By 1863 enough converts had been made to form a church, and Oncken sent August Liebig to serve them as pastor. This church, the oldest Baptist church in Romania, in still in existence and meets on Popa Rusu Street (Betania Baptist Church). Russian Baptist immigrants, mostly from the southern Ukraine, came to Dobrogea around 1862 and founded a church in Cataloi in 1869. Hungarian Baptists formed a church in Transylvania in 1875. Baptist witness did not enter Old Romania until the 20th century, and Orthodox opposition was strong. Nevertheless, a church was organized in Jegalia in 1909. An ethnic Romanian church was formed in Bucharest in 1912 by Constantin Adorian (1882-1954), a Romanian who had joined the German Baptist church in Bucharest. Adorian led in forming the Baptist Union of Romania in 1920. C. Douglas Weaver, In Search of the New Testament Church: The Baptist Story, Mercer University Press, USA, 2008, p. 234 In 1930, it had 45,000 members. Robert E. Johnson, A Global Introduction to Baptist Churches, Cambridge University Press, UK, 2010, p. 316 Before 1944, the legal status of evangelical groups such as the Baptists was not well defined. Due to World War II and the military dictatorship of General Antonescu, laws were passed in 1942 and 1943 dissolving all religious associations in Romania. As a consequence, Baptists could not meet, worship or evangelize. On August 31, 1944 these laws were abolished, and the Baptists (and others) could once again engage in religious activity legally. In 1948 Baptists were recognized as a legal cult (the generic term used by the Romanian government to describe religious bodies). In 2017, it had 1,614 churches and 84,915 members.Baptist World Alliance, Statistics, bwanet.org, USA, retrieved April 9, 2020 Educational institutions The Union has the Baptist Theological Institute in Bucharest and the Emanuel University in Oradea, Bihor.

In the 1940s, the Walker identified moving images (mostly movies, but also experimental films) as integral to contemporary life. Artists of that time were experimenting with film's formal properties, such as light, motion, and sound, while also separating film art from conventional narrative cinema. In 1973, the Film/Video Department was officially formed and the Edmond R. Ruben Film and Video Study Collection was established, along with an endowment to fund the development of the archive. Ruben, a leading figure in film exhibition in the Upper Midwest, and his wife Evelyn believed in collecting films as a way of preserving the art form. Today, with more than eight hundred fifty titles, the Ruben Collection brings together classic and contemporary cinema as well as documentaries, avant-garde films, and video works by artists. It holds works by visual artists that range from Salvador Dal√≠, Marcel Duchamp, and Fernand L√©ger to extensive contemporary work by William Klein, Derek Jarman, Bruce Conner, Marcel Broodthaers, Matthew Barney, Nam June Paik, Wolf Vostell, and experimental artists such as Paul Sharits and Stan Brakhage.Works by Wolf Vostell at the Walker Art Center Design The Walker Art Center maintains a professional, in-house design and editorial department to fulfill its various communication needs. The department is responsible for the design and editing of all printed materials, including the creation and planning of publications such as exhibition catalogues, bi- monthly magazines, and books, as well as exhibition and event graphics, signage programs, and promotional campaigns. Additionally, the department organizes design-related projects and programs, such as lectures, exhibitions, and special commissions. Over the course of its 60-plus year history, the department has organized many important exhibitions on architecture and design, and has served as a vital forum for contemporary design issues, bringing hundreds of world-renowned architects, designers, and critics to the Twin Cities through programs such as the Insights design lecture series, which celebrated its 30th year in 2016. During the 1940s, the Walker built two \\"idea houses\\" exhibiting the latest in building materials, furnishings and architectural design trends. From the late 1960s until the early '90s, the museum's design curator Mildred Friedman helped conceive and stage exhibitions on, among other topics, the Dutch avant-garde movement De Stijl, the design process at the Modernist furniture company Herman Miller, the history of graphic design, and traditional and contemporary Japanese arts, crafts and culture. For more than 30 years, the Walker has also offered the Mildred S. Friedman Design Fellowship, a yearlong program for young designers.William Yardley (September 9, 2014), Mildred Friedman, 85, Dies; Curator Elevated Design and Architecture New York Times. Digital media The Walker's New Media Initiatives group (renamed Digital Media in 2017) oversees mnartists.org, an online database of Minnesota artists and organizations that provides a digital gathering place for the local arts community. Through a partnership with the Minneapolis Institute of Art, the Walker manages ArtsConnectEd,artsconnected.org an online resource for arts educators that draws from both institutions' permanent collection resources. In 1998, the Walker acquired √§da'web, an early net art website curated by Benjamin Weil and designed by Vivian Selbo. The first official project of √§da'web went up in May 1995, although it had been informally active since February of the same year. In 2011, the Walker website was relaunched as a newsstyle website that features essays, interviews, and videos by both Walker staff and guest writers, as well as curated news links about global art and culture. The relaunch was met with positive reviews around the art world. Education and public programs Learning is emphasized as a core experience at the Walker through a mix of education programs, community building efforts, and interpretive projects. The department conducts community, family, interpretive, public, school, teen, and tour programs, as well as mnartists.org. Each division offers programs and activities in visual art, performing arts, film/video, new media, design, and architecture. To inform these undertakings, the staff work with Walker curators and partners from local organizations, artists, schools, and community groups. Advisory groups such as the Walker Art Center Teen Arts Council, Tour Guide Council, and the Parent Advisory Group are also implemented in the department for the Walker to further build relationships with its audience. Publishing The Walker's long history of publishing includes the production of exhibition catalogues, books, and periodicals as well as digital publishing. From 1946 to 1954, it published the Everyday Art Quarterly; in 1954, the publication changed its name to Design Quarterly and \\"shifted its emphasis away from consuming design to understanding design's impact on society and its processes and methods of practice and inquiry.\\" It was discontinued in 1993. The Walker's in-house design studio has created countless exhibition catalogues dedicated to the art of Marcel Broodthaers, Trisha Brown, Huang Yong Ping, Kiki Smith, Kara Walker, Andy Warhol, and Krzysztof Wodiczko, among many others, as well as books on design, architecture, social practice, and other topics in contemporary art. In 2011, the Walker redesigned its homepage as an \\"idea hub,\\" a news-magazine format that presents original interviews, videos, commissioned essays, scholarly writings, and newslinks. The publishing-forward homepage was hailed as a \\"game-changer, the website that every art museum will have to consider from this point forward\\" (Tyler Green, Modern Art Notes) and \\"a model for other institutions of all kinds\\" (Alexis Madrigal, The Atlantic). The site won Best of the Web awards at the 2012 Museums and the Web conference, including \\"Best Overall Site\\" and \\"Best Innovative/Experimental Site.\\" It also won a gold MUSE Award for \\"Online Presence, Media & Technology\\" from the American Alliance of Museums. In 2017, the homepage was redesigned, and the Walker's digital publishing was rebranded under the title Walker Reader, a magazine landing page that aggregates original content from the Walker's five verticals.

History Federal Art Project class at the Walker Art Center (1941) The Walker Art Center began with Minneapolis businessman Thomas Barlow Walker, who held one of the largest private art collections in the region. In 1879, he dedicated part of his home to exhibiting the art to the public for free. In 1916, Walker purchased the land now known as Lowry Hill to build a museum for his growing collection. His museum, the Walker Art Galleries, was opened on May 21, 1927. In 1939, the Minnesota Arts Council was granted control of the building on Lowry Hill, along with its art collection, in order to create a civic art center. With the assistance of the Works Progress Administration, building improvements were made and the Walker Art Center opened in January 1940. Daniel Defenbacher, who led the Federal Art Project's Community Art Center program, left the WPA to become the first director of the Walker Art Center. Around this time, the Walker officially began its focus on modern and contemporary works of art. The Walker's current building designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes was opened in 1971 and expanded in 1984. Minneapolis Parks and Recreation partnered with the Walker Art Center to establish the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden on the Walker's campus in 1988.Bina, Lauren. \\"Minneapolis Sculpture Garden: 1988 Opening Day\\", Walker Art Center, 16 July 2015.

In June 2017, the opening of the gallery's art garden was delayed due to protests over Sam Durant's sculpture Scaffold. Timeline Cargill Lounge * 1879 ‚Äì Lumber baron Thomas Barlow (T.B.)

Foods high in carbohydrates (e.g., sugar, bread, pasta) are limited, and replaced with foods containing a higher percentage of fat and protein (e.g., meat, poultry, fish, shellfish, eggs, cheese, nuts, and seeds), as well as low carbohydrate foods (e.g. spinach, kale, chard, collards, and other fibrous vegetables). There is a lack of standardization of how much carbohydrate low-carbohydrate diets must have, and this has complicated research. One definition, from the American Academy of Family Physicians, specifies low-carbohydrate diets as having less than 20% carbohydrate content. There is no good evidence that low-carbohydrate dieting confers any particular health benefits apart from weight loss, where low-carbohydrate diets achieve outcomes similar to other diets, as weight loss is mainly determined by calorie restriction and adherence. An extreme form of low-carbohydrate diet ‚Äì the ketogenic diet ‚Äì was first established as a medical diet for treating epilepsy. Through celebrity endorsement it has become a popular weight-loss fad diet, but there is no evidence of any distinctive benefit for this purpose, and it carries a risk of adverse effects. The British Dietetic Association named it one of the \\"top 5 worst celeb diets to avoid in 2018\\".  Definition and classification = Macronutrient ratios  The macronutrient ratios of low-carbohydrate diets are not standardized. the conflicting definitions of \\"low-carbohydrate\\" diets have complicated research into the subject. The American Academy of Family Physicians defines low-carbohydrate diets as diets that restrict carbohydrate intake to 20 to 60 grams (g) per day, typically less than 20% of caloric intake. A 2016 review of low-carbohydrate diets classified diets with 50g of carbohydrate per day (less than 10% of total calories) as \\"very low\\" and diets with 40% of calories from carbohydrates as \\"mild\\" low-carbohydrate diets. The UK National Health Service recommend that \\"carbohydrates should be the body's main source of energy in a healthy, balanced diet.\\"  Foodstuffs  Like other leafy vegetables, curly kale is a food that is low in carbohydrates. There is evidence that the quality, rather than the quantity, of carbohydrate in a diet is important for health, and that high-fiber slow-digesting carbohydrate-rich foods are healthful while highly refined and sugary foods are less so. People choosing diet for health conditions should have their diet tailored to their individual requirements. For people with metabolic conditions, a diet with approximately 40-50% carbohydrate is recommended. Most vegetables are low- or moderate-carbohydrate foods (in some low-carbohydrate diets, fiber is excluded because it is not a nutritive carbohydrate). Some vegetables, such as potatoes, carrots, maize (corn) and rice are high in starch. Most low-carbohydrate diet plans accommodate vegetables such as broccoli, spinach, kale, lettuce, cucumbers, cauliflower, peppers and most green-leafy vegetables.  Adoption and advocacy  The National Academy of Medicine recommends a daily average of 130 g of carbohydrates per day. The FAO and WHO similarly recommend that the majority of dietary energy come from carbohydrates.Food and Nutrition Board (2002/2005). Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. Page 769 . Low- carbohydrate diets are not an option recommended in the 2015‚Äì2020 edition of Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which instead recommends a low-fat diet. Carbohydrate has been wrongly accused of being a uniquely \\"fattening\\" macronutrient, misleading many dieters into compromising the nutritiousness of their diet by eliminating carbohydrate-rich food. Low-carbohydrate diet proponents emphasize research saying that low-carbohydrate diets can initially cause slightly greater weight loss than a balanced diet, but any such advantage does not persist. In the long-term successful weight maintenance is determined by calorie intake, and not by macronutrient ratios. The public has become confused by the way in which some diets, such as the Zone diet and the South Beach diet are promoted as \\"low-carbohydrate\\" when in fact they would more properly be termed \\"medium-carbohydrate\\" diets.  Carbohydrate-insulin hypothesis  Low-carbohydrate diet advocates including Gary Taubes and David Ludwig have proposed a \\"carbohydrate-insulin hypothesis\\" in which carbohydrates are said to be uniquely fattening because they raise insulin levels and cause fat to accumulate unduly. The hypothesis appears to run counter to known human biology whereby there is no good evidence of any such association between the actions of insulin, fat accumulation, and obesity. The hypothesis predicted that low-carbohydrate dieting would offer a \\"metabolic advantage\\" of increased energy expenditure equivalent to 400-600 kcal(kilocalorie)/day, in accord with the promise of the Atkin's diet: a \\"high calorie way to stay thin forever.\\" With funding from the Laura and John Arnold Foundation, in 2012 Taubes co-founded the Nutrition Science Initiative (NuSI), with the aim of raising over $200 million to undertake a \\"Manhattan Project For Nutrition\\" and validate the hypothesis. Intermediate results, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition did not provide convincing evidence of any advantage to a low-carbohydrate diet as compared to diets of other composition ‚Äì ultimately a very low-calorie, ketogenic diet (of 5% carbohydrate) \\"was not associated with significant loss of fat mass\\" compared to a non-specialized diet with the same calories; there was no useful \\"metabolic advantage.\\" In 2017 Kevin Hall, a NIH (National Institutes of Health) researcher hired to assist with the project, wrote that the carbohydrate-insulin hypothesis had been falsified by experiment. Hall wrote \\"the rise in obesity prevalence may be primarily due to increased consumption of refined carbohydrates, but the mechanisms are likely to be quite different from those proposed by the carbohydrate‚Äìinsulin model.\\"  Health aspects = Adherence  It has been repeatedly found that in the long-term, all diets with the same calorific value perform the same for weight loss, except for the one differentiating factor of how well people can faithfully follow the dietary programme. A study comparing groups taking low-fat, low- carbohydrate and Mediterranean diets found at six months the low-carbohydrate diet still had most people adhering to it, but thereafter the situation reversed: at two years the low-carbohydrate group had the highest incidence of lapses and dropouts. This may be due to the comparatively limited food choice of low-carbohydrate diets.  Body weight  In the short and medium term, people taking a low-carbohydrate diet can experience more weight loss than people taking a low-fat diet. Such people have very slightly more weight loss initially, equivalent to approximately 100kcal/day, but that the advantage diminishes over time and is ultimately insignificant. The Endocrine Society stated that \\"when calorie intake is held constant [...] body-fat accumulation does not appear to be affected by even very pronounced changes in the amount of fat vs. carbohydrate in the diet.\\" Much of the research comparing low-fat vs. low-carbohydrate dieting has been of poor quality and studies which reported large effects have garnered disproportionate attention in comparison to those which are methodologically sound. A 2018 review said \\"higher-quality meta-analyses reported little or no difference in weight loss between the two diets.\\" Low-quality meta-analyses have tended to report favourably on the effect of low-carbohydrate diets: a systematic review reported that 8 out of 10 meta-analyses assessed whether weight loss outcomes could have been affected by publication bias, and 7 of them concluded positively. A 2017 review concluded that a variety of diets, including low-carbohydrate diets, achieve similar weight loss outcomes, which are mainly determined by calorie restriction and adherence rather than the type of diet.  Cardiovascular health  Low-carbohydrate dieting tends to raise levels of LDL cholesterol, but it is unclear how this might effect cardiovascular health. Potential favorable changes in triglyceride and HDL cholesterol values should be weighed against potential unfavorable changes in LDL and total cholesterol values. Some randomized control trials have shown that low-carbohydrate diets, especially very low-carbohydrate diets, perform better than low-fat diets in improving cardiometabolic risk factors in the long term, suggesting that low- carbohydrate diets are a viable option alongside low-fat diets for people at risk of cardiovascular disease. There is only poor-quality evidence of the effect of different diets on reducing or preventing high blood pressure, but it suggests the low-carbohydrate diet is among the better-performing ones, while the DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) performs best.  Diabetes  There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of low- carbohydrate diets for people with type 1 diabetes. For certain individuals, it may be feasible to follow a low-carbohydrate regime combined with carefully managed insulin dosing. This can be hard to maintain and there are concerns about potential adverse health effects caused by the diet. In general, people with type 1 diabetes are advised to follow an individualized eating plan. The proportion of carbohydrate in a diet is not linked to the risk of type 2 diabetes, although there is some evidence that diets containing certain high- carbohydrate items ‚Äì such as sugar-sweetened drinks or white rice ‚Äì are associated with an increased risk. Some evidence indicates that consuming fewer carbohydrate foods may reduce biomarkers of type 2 diabetes. A in 2019 consensus report on nutrition therapy for adults with diabetes and prediabetes the American Diabetes Association (ADA) states \\"Reducing overall carbohydrate intake for individuals with diabetes has demonstrated the most evidence for improving glycemia (blood sugar) and may be applied in a variety of eating patterns that meet individual needs and preferences.\\", it also states that reducing overall carbohydrate intake with low- or very low- carbohydrate eating plans is a viable approach. While other sources states the there is no good evidence that low-carbohydrate diets are better than a conventional healthy diet, in which carbohydrates typically account for more than 40% of calories consumed. Low-carbohydrate dieting has no effect on the kidney function of people who have type 2 diabetes. Limiting carbohydrate consumption generally results in improved glucose control, although without long-term weight loss. Low-carbohydrate diets can be useful to help people with type 2 diabetes lose weight, but \\"no single approach has been proven to be consistently superior.\\" According to the ADA, people with diabetes should be \\"developing healthy eating patterns rather than focusing on individual macronutrients, micronutrients, or single foods.\\" They recommended that the carbohydrates in a diet should come from \\"vegetables, legumes, fruits, dairy (milk and yogurt), and whole grains\\", while highly refined foods and sugary drinks should be avoided. The ADA also wrote that \\"reducing overall carbohydrate intake for individuals with diabetes has demonstrated the most evidence for improving glycemia and may be applied in a variety of eating patterns that meet individual needs and preferences.\\" For individuals with type 2 diabetes who can't meet the glycemic targets or where reducing anti- glycemic medications is a priority, the ADA says that low or very-low carbohydrate diets are a viable approach.  Exercise and fatigue  A low- carbohydrate diet has been found to reduce endurance capacity for intense exercise efforts, and depleted muscle glycogen following such efforts is only slowly replenished if a low-carbohydrate diet is taken. Inadequate carbohydrate intake during athletic training causes metabolic acidosis, which may be responsible for the impaired performance which has been observed.  Ketogenic diet  The ketogenic diet is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet used to treat drug-resistant childhood epilepsy. In the 2010s, it became a fad diet for people wanting to lose weight. Users of the ketogenic diet may not achieve sustainable weight loss, as this requires strict carbohydrate abstinence, and maintaining the diet is difficult. Side effects may include constipation, high cholesterol, growth slowing, acidosis, and kidney stones.Kossoff EH, Wang HS. Dietary therapies for epilepsy. Biomed J. 2013 Jan-Feb;36(1):2-8. It has been hypothesized that some people have an atypical metabolism, and would therefore benefit metabolically from taking a ketogenic diet, but there had been no long-term research into this.  Safety  High and low-carbohydrate diets that are rich in animal-derived proteins and fats may be associated with increased mortality. On the contrary, with plant- derived proteins and fats, there may be a decrease of mortality. , research has paid insufficient attention to the potential adverse effects of carbohydrate restricted dieting, particularly for micronutrient sufficiency, bone health and cancer risk. One low-quality meta-analysis reported that adverse effects could include \\"constipation, headache, halitosis, muscle cramps and general weakness.\\" Ketosis induced by a low-carbohydrate diet has led to reported cases of ketoacidosis, a life-threatening condition. This has led to the suggestion that ketoacidosis should be considered a potential hazard of low-carbohydrate dieting. In a comprehensive systematic review of 2018, Churuangsuk and colleagues reported that other case reports give rise to concerns of other potential risks of low-carbohydrate dieting including hyperosmolar coma, Wernicke's encephalopathy, optic neuropathy from thiamine deficiency, acute coronary syndrome and anxiety disorder. Significantly restricting the proportion of carbohydrate in diet risks causing malnutrition, and can make it difficult to get enough dietary fiber to stay healthy. As of 2014 it appeared that with respect to the risk of death for people with cardiovascular disease, the kind of carbohydrates consumed are important; diets relatively higher in fiber and whole grains lead to reduced risk of death from cardiovascular disease compared to diets high in refined grains.  History  A low-carbohydrate diet restricts the amount of carbohydrate-rich foods ‚Äì such as bread ‚Äì in the diet.  First descriptions  In 1797, John Rollo reported on the results of treating two diabetic Army officers with a low-carbohydrate diet and medications. A very low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet was the standard treatment for diabetes throughout the nineteenth century. In 1863, William Banting, a formerly obese English undertaker and coffin maker, published \\"Letter on Corpulence Addressed to the Public,\\" in which he described a diet for weight control giving up bread, butter, milk, sugar, beer, and potatoes. His booklet was widely read, so much so that some people used the term \\"Banting\\" for the activity now called \\"dieting.\\" In the early 1900s Frederick Madison Allen developed a highly restrictive short term regime which was described by Walter R. Steiner at the 1916 annual convention of the Connecticut State Medical Society as The Starvation Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus.Another publication of similar regimen was This diet was often administered in a hospital in order to better ensure compliance and safety.  Modern low-carbohydrate diets  Other low-carbohydrate diets in the 1960s included the Air Force diet and the Drinking Man's Diet. In 1972, Robert Atkins published Dr. Atkins' Diet Revolution, which advocated the low- carbohydrate diet he had successfully used in treating people in the 1960s. The book was a publishing success, but was widely criticized by the mainstream medical community as being dangerous and misleading, thereby limiting its appeal at the time. The concept of the glycemic index was developed in 1981 by David Jenkins to account for variances in speed of digestion of different types of carbohydrates. This concept classifies foods according to the rapidity of their effect on blood sugar levelswith fast-digesting simple carbohydrates causing a sharper increase and slower-digesting complex carbohydrates, such as whole grains, a slower one. Jenkins' research laid the scientific groundwork for subsequent low-carbohydrate diets. In 1992, Atkins published an update from his 1972 book, Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution, and other doctors began to publish books based on the same principles. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, low-carbohydrate diets became some of the most popular diets in the US. By some accounts, up to 18% of the population was using one type of low-carbohydrate diet or another at the peak of their popularity. Food manufacturers and restaurant chains noted the trend, as it affected their businesses. Parts of the mainstream medical community have denounced low-carbohydrate diets as being dangerous to health, such as the AHA in 2001, and the American Kidney Fund in 2002.The American Kidney Fund: American Kidney Fund Warns About Impact of High-Protein Diets on Kidney Health: 25 April 2002  See also     References  Category:Diets ","title":"Low-carbohydrate diet"},{"id":"459567","text":"Big Mama may refer to: Arts and music *Big Mama (film), a 2000 Oscar- winning American film about grandparents raising their grandchildren *Big Mama (band), a band of four female pop/R&B; singers in South Korea *Big Mama, a character in the 1981 film The Fox and the Hound *Big Mama, a character in the anime and manga series Sorcerer Hunters *Big Mama, a nickname of EVA in Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots *Big Mama, a nickname of Josephine Joseph, matriarchal character in the Soul Food film and television series *\\"Big Mama (Unconditional Love)\\", a song by LL Cool J from his 2002 album 10 *Big Mama Thornton (1926‚Äì1984), American blues singer Other *Big Mama, a name for Mary, mother of Jesus in the Mama Tata religion *Big Mama, a nickname of JoAnne Carner, former LPGA golfer *Big mama, a colloquial name for Internet censors on web bulletin boards in the People's Republic of China See also *Big Momma's House, a 2000 series of American comedy films ","title":"Big Mama"},{"id":"459582","text":"Arms of St John: Argent, on a chief gules two mullets or Oliver St John, 1st Baron St John of Bletso, by Arnold Bronckorst, 1578 Baron St John of Bletso, in the County of Bedford, is a title in the Peerage of England. It was created in 1582 for Oliver St John. For a period, the title Baron St John was subsumed within the title Earl of Bolingbroke which was granted to the fourth Baron. The Earldom died out with the third Earl, but the Barony continued via another branch which had since become the baronet line. The eldest son of the 1st Earl was advanced to the barony by Writ of acceleration under King Charles I to become the 5th Baron. However he died in the civil war without becoming Earl, This resulted in the existence of an additional baron in the sequence but this was not taken into account by the family when the barony was continued. Hence there is a discrepancy between the complete numbered series used by Burke and Debrett, and the numbering series in use by the family, particularly in the 18th and 19th century. Hence the numbers on family graves of this time are one less than the numbers used in the principal peerage registers that form the basis for this article. History According to Horace Round (1901)Quoted in Cokayne, Complete Peerage, 2nd. ed., Vol. XI, p. 333 note (g), continuing on 334. the St John family of Bletso are descended from the St Johns of Fonmon Castle in Glamorgan, Wales. Again according to Round, this was possibly a cadet branch of St John of Basing, Hampshire, and Halnaker, Sussex, which family descended in the male line from the Norman Hugh de Port (d.1091) lord of the manor of Port-en-Bessin in Normandy who took part in the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, and was subsequently granted 53 manors in Hampshire.Cokayne, Complete Peerage, 2nd. ed., Vol. XI, pp. 316-18. However according to Brownhill (1931) the male ancestry of St John of Bletso cannot be traced further back than Alexander de St John (fl.1340) of Instow in Devon.John Brownbill, \\"St. John of Bletsoe\\", Genealogists' Magazine, vol. v, 1929-31, pp. 355-9, quoted in Cokayne, Complete Peerage, 2nd. ed., Vol. XI, p. 333 note (g), continuing on 334. Oliver St John, the 1st Baron was the great- great-grandson of Sir John St John (died c. 1482), eldest son of Sir John Oliver St John of Bletso (died 1437), the husband of Margaret, great-great- granddaughter of Roger de Beauchamp (died 1380), who was summoned to Parliament as Baron Beauchamp of Bletso from 1363 to 1379. Since then that title had not been assumed although Oliver St John was considered to be the line of heir. He was succeeded by his son, the second Baron. He was one of the peers who sat during the trial of Mary, Queen of Scots. He died without male heirs and the claim to the barony of Beauchamp of Bletsoe passed to his daughter Anne, the wife of William Howard, Lord Howard Effingham, eldest son and heir of Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham. He was succeeded in the barony of St John of Bletsoe by his younger brother, the third Baron. The latter's son, the fourth Baron, was created Earl of Bolingbroke in 1624. His eldest son and heir apparent, Oliver St John, was in 1641 summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father's junior title of Baron St John of Bletsoe. However, he predeceased his father (killed at the Battle of Edgehill in 1642) but due to the writ of acceleration issued he is known as the fifth Baron St John of Bletsoe. The Earl was succeeded by his grandson, the second Earl. He was the son of Sir Paulet St John, younger son of the first Earl. He died childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the third Earl, who represented Bedford in the House of Commons. He never married and on his death in 1711 the earldom became extinct. The barony was inherited by his second cousin once removed, Sir Paulet St Andrew St John, 5th Baronet, who became the eighth Baron. He was the great-great-grandson of the Hon. Sir Rowland St John, fourth son of the third Baron (see below for more information on the baronetcy). His cousin's son, the fourteenth Baron, sat as a Member of Parliament for Bedfordshire. His grandson, the seventeenth Baron, served as Lord Lieutenant of Bedfordshire from 1905 to 1912. the titles are held by the latter's great-grandson, the twenty-second Baron, who succeeded his father in 1978. He is one of the ninety elected hereditary peers that remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999, and sits as a cross-bencher. The St John Baronetcy, of Northwood in the County of Northampton, was created in the Baronetage of England in 1660 for Oliver St John. He was the son of the Hon. Sir Rowland St John, fourth son of the third Baron St John of Bletsoe. His son, the second Baronet, represented Northamptonshire in the House of Commons. The latter's grandson, the fifth Baronet, succeeded as eighth Baron St John of Bletsoe in 1711 (see above for later history of the titles). Oliver St John (died c. 1497), younger brother of the aforementioned Sir John St John (died c. 1482), was the ancestor of the Viscounts Grandison and the Viscounts Bolingbroke and St John.

Shubrick, after that country's firing on . She conveyed Commissioner Bowlin and served as flagship during the voyage to South America, but was not officially considered part of the expedition fleet, as she was not designed to act against Paraguay, not being able to ascend the river.Expenses of the Paraguay Expedition ‚Äì House of Representatives, 36th Congress, 1st Session, Mis.

From the Liljenquist Family Collection of Civil War Photographs, Prints and Photographs Division, Library of Congress Through July and August, she was out of commission at Portsmouth Navy Yard. Recommissioning on 30 August, she was ordered to join the Atlantic Blockading Squadron on 9 September. During the Civil War, Sabine was actively employed along the east coast searching for Confederate raiders. She participated in the relief and reinforcement of Fort Pickens, Florida, in April 1861, under command of Capt. Adams; the rescue of 500 marines and the crew of chartered troop transport Governor during a violent storm off South Carolina on 2 and 3 November 1861; the search for in March 1862, after the ship-of-the-line had been badly damaged by a storm while sailing to Port Royal, South Carolina; and the hunt for CSS Alabama in October 1862 and CSS Tacony in June 1863. Sabine returned to New York for blockade duty with the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron until ordered in August 1864 to Norfolk, Virginia as a training ship for Navy apprentices and landsmen. Training ship, 1865‚Äì1877 After the war, she was transferred to New London, Connecticut for the same purpose until 1868. In 1867, an apprentice on Sabine, Frank Du Moulin, was awarded the Medal of Honor for rescuing a crewmate who had fallen from the rigging into the water. In 1869 and 1870, the ship conducted midshipman training cruises to European and Mediterranean ports. In 1871 Sabine was repaired at Boston; and, from 1872 to 1876, she served as a receiving ship at Portsmouth, New Hampshire. In 1877, she was laid up until she was sold on 23 September 1883 at Portsmouth to J.L. Snow of Rockland, Maine.  Memorials  The last remaining armament from the Sabine, a 6.4 inch 100 Pounder Parrot Rifled Naval Cannon, currently resides on display outside the Grand Traverse County courthouse in Traverse City, Michigan. It was one of the two 100 pounder rifled cannons that were mounted on swiveling carriages on the Sabine. The cannon was donated to Grand Traverse County by Senator William Alden Smith in 1910.

The film is a dramatised historical account of the rise and fall of Urbain Grandier, a 17th- century Roman Catholic priest accused of witchcraft following the supposed possessions in Loudun, France; it also focuses on Sister Jeanne des Anges, a sexually repressed nun who inadvertently incites the accusations. A co- production between the United Kingdom and the United States, The Devils was partly adapted from the 1952 non-fiction book The Devils of Loudun by Aldous Huxley, and partly from the 1960 play The Devils by John Whiting, also based on Huxley's book. United Artists originally pitched the idea to Russell but abandoned the project after reading his finished screenplay, as they felt it was too controversial in nature. Warner Bros. subsequently agreed to produce and distribute the film. The majority of principal photography took place at Pinewood Studios in late 1970. The film faced harsh reaction from national film rating systems due to its disturbingly violent, sexual, and religious content, and originally received an X rating in both the United Kingdom and the United States. It was banned in several countries, and eventually heavily edited for release in others. The film has never received a release in its original, uncut form in various countries. Critics similarly dismissed the film for its explicit content, though it won the awards for Best Director at the Venice Film Festival, as well as from the U.S. National Board of Review. Film scholarship on The Devils has largely focused on its themes of sexual repression and abuse of power. It has also been recognized as one of the most controversial films of all time by numerous publications and film critics. The film remained banned in Finland until 2001. Plot In 17th-century France, Cardinal Richelieu is influencing Louis XIII in an attempt to gain further power. He convinces Louis that the fortifications of cities throughout France should be demolished to prevent Protestants from uprising. Louis agrees, but forbids Richelieu from carrying out demolitions in the town of Loudun, having made a promise to its Governor not to damage the town. Meanwhile, in Loudun, the Governor has died, leaving control of the city to Urbain Grandier, a dissolute and proud but popular and well-regarded priest. He is having an affair with a relative of Father Canon Jean Mignon, another priest in the town; Grandier is, however, unaware that the neurotic, hunchbacked Sister Jeanne des Anges (a victim of severe scoliosis who happens to be abbess of the local Ursuline convent), is sexually obsessed with him. Sister Jeanne asks for Grandier to become the convent's new confessor. Grandier secretly marries another woman, Madeleine De Brou, but news of this reaches Sister Jeanne, driving her to jealous insanity. When Madeleine returns a book by Ursuline foundress Angela Merici that Sister Jeanne had earlier lent her, the abbess viciously attacks her with accusations of being a \\"fornicator\\" and \\"sacrilegious bitch,\\" among other things. Baron Jean de Laubardemont arrives with orders to demolish the city, overriding Grandier's orders to stop. Grandier summons the town's soldiers and forces Laubardemont to back down pending the arrival of an order for the demolition from King Louis. Grandier departs Loudun to visit the King. In the meantime, Sister Jeanne is informed by Father Mignon that he is to be their new confessor. She informs him of Grandier's marriage and affairs, and also inadvertently accuses Grandier of witchcraft and of possessing her, information that Mignon relays to Laubardemont. In the process, the information is pared down to just the claim that Grandier has bewitched the convent and has dealt with the Devil. With Grandier away from Loudon, Laubardemont and Mignon decide to find evidence against him. Laubardemont summons the lunatic inquisitor Father Pierre Barre, a \\"professional witch-hunter,\\" whose interrogations actually involve depraved acts of \\"exorcism\\", including the forced administration of enemas to his victims. Sister Jeanne claims that Grandier has bewitched her, and the other nuns do the same. A public exorcism erupts in the town, in which the nuns remove their clothes and enter a state of \\"religious\\" frenzy. Duke Henri de Cond√© (actually King Louis in disguise) arrives, claiming to be carrying a holy relic which can exorcise the \\"devils\\" possessing the nuns. Father Barre then proceeds to use the relic in \\"exorcising\\" the nuns, who then appear as though they have been cured ‚Äì until Cond√©/Louis reveals the case allegedly containing the relic to be empty. Despite this, both the possessions and the exorcisms continue unabated, eventually descending into a massive orgy in the church in which the disrobed nuns remove the crucifix from above the high altar and sexually assault it. In the midst of the chaos, Grandier and Madeleine return and are immediately arrested. After being given a ridiculous show trial, Grandier is shaven and tortured ‚Äì although at his execution, he eventually manages to convince Mignon that he is innocent. The judges, clearly under orders from Laubardemont, sentence Grandier to death by burning at the stake. Laubardemont has also obtained permission to destroy the city's fortifications. Despite pressure on Grandier to confess to the trumped-up charges, he refuses, and is then taken to be burnt at the stake. His executioner promises to strangle him rather than let him suffer the agonising death by fire that he would otherwise experience, but the overzealous Barre starts the fire himself, and Mignon, now visibly panic-stricken about the possibility of Grandier's innocence, pulls the noose tight before it can be used to strangle the priest. As Grandier burns, Laubardemont gives the order for explosive charges to be set off and the city walls are blown up, causing the revelling townspeople to flee. After the execution, Barre leaves Loudun to continue his witch-hunting activities elsewhere in the Vienne region of Nouvelle-Aquitaine. Laubardemont informs Sister Jeanne that Mignon has been put away in an asylum for claiming that Grandier was innocent (the explanation given is that he is demented), and that \\"with no signed confession to prove otherwise, everyone has the same opinion\\". He gives her Grandier's charred femur and leaves. Sister Jeanne, now completely broken, masturbates with the bone. Madeleine, having been released, walks over the rubble of Loudun's walls and away from the ruined city. ' CastAnalysis Film scholar Thomas Atkins attests that, while The Devils contains overt themes regarding religion and political influence, the film is in fact more concerned with \\"sex and sexual aberrations.\\" He interprets the film as being centrally thematically interested in sexual repression and its cumulative effects on the human psyche. Commenting on the Sister Jeanne character, Atkins writes: \\"There are any number of examples of tormented visualization involving the Mother Superior... What more stunning visual metaphor for the psychological suffocation of the Mother Superior than to stuff her deformed body into a tiny lookout space from which she watches her fantasy lover? The mere confinement of mass in congested space creates an understanding of the annihilating pleasures of her sexual drive.\\" Atkins likens Sister Jeanne's erotic fantasy sequences to \\"eroticism from a deranged consciousness.\\" The color white is used significantly in the film, specifically in the design of the cityscape, which is overtly white and consists of stone structures. Atkins insists that through this use of blank white, Russell establishes a \\"leitmotif of whiteness which resists and dissolves natural relationships.\\" Production=Development Writer-director Ken Russell in 1971 After the success of Russell's Women in Love (1969) in the United States, its distributor, United Artists, suggested that Russell adapt Aldous Huxley's The Devils of Loudun (1952), a non-fiction book concerning the alleged 17th-century possessions in Loudun, France. Russell wrote the screenplay based on Huxley's novel, as well as John Whiting's 1961 play The Devils, which itself was based on Huxley's work. Russell said \\"when I first read the story, I was knocked out by it ‚Äî it was just so shocking‚Äîand I wanted others to be knocked out by it, too. I felt I had to make it.\\" Russell later said at the time he made the film: \\"I was a devout Catholic and very secure in my faith. I knew I wasn't making a pornographic film... although I am not a political creature, I always viewed The Devils as my one political film. To me it was about brainwashing, about the state taking over.\\" Though Russell admired Whiting's play, he mainly drew from Huxley's book as he found the play \\"too sentimental.\\" Some extraneous elements incorporated into the screenplay were not found in either source, including details about the plague, which were supplied by Russell's brother- in-law, a scholar of French history. Upon studying Grandier, Russell felt that he \\"represented the paradox of the Catholic church... Grandier is a priest but he is also a man, and that puts him into some absurd situations.\\" In Russell's original screenplay, the role of Sister Jeanne of the Angels, the disabled Mother Superior, was significantly larger, and continued after Grandier's execution. However, in order to shorten the lengthy screenplay, Russell was forced to cut down the role. United Artists announced the film in August 1969, with Robert Sole to produce under a three picture deal with the studio, and Russell to direct. Filming was set to start in May 1970. However, after United Artists executives read the screenplay, they \\"refused to touch it,\\" abandoning plans to fund the production. At the time, production designer Derek Jarman had already constructed some of the sets for the film. It was subsequently acquired by Warner Bros., who signed on in March 1970 to distribute the film. Casting Oliver Reed, who had worked with Russell previously on Women in Love, was cast as Urbain Grandier, the philandering doomed priest. Richard Johnson, who had portrayed Grandier in a stage production of The Devils, had originally been attached to the project in 1969, but eventually dropped out of the production. Reed agreed to do the film for a percentage of the profits. Gemma Jones was cast as Madeleine de Brou, Grandier's mistress. Sister Jeanne des Anges was originally to be played by Glenda Jackson, who had starred opposite Reed in Russell's Women in Love, as well as in Russell's The Music Lovers. However, Jackson turned down the role saying: \\"I don't want to play any more neurotic sex starved parts.\\" Russell later claimed that he felt Jackson had actually turned down the role because it had been truncated from his original screenplay. Jackson was replaced by Vanessa Redgrave. Max Adrian was cast as inquisitor Ibert (in his second-to- last film performance), while Dudley Sutton, who had become a cult figure for his performance in The Leather Boys (1964), agreed to appear in the film as Baron de Laubardemont. Sutton recalled that all of the \\"respectable actors turned it down. They thought it was blasphemous, which it is not.\\" In the role of Father Mignon, a priest who attempts to usurp Grandier's power, Russell cast Murray Melvin, despite the fact that he was decades younger than the character, who was intended to be in his eighties. Michael Gothard, an English character actor, was cast as self-professed witch hunter Father Barre. Russell cast Christopher Logue, an occasional actor who was mainly known as a poet and literary scholar, as the vengeful Cardinal Richelieu. As Phillipe, the young woman Grandier impregnates, Russell cast television actress Georgina Hale. Judith Paris, originally a dancer, was cast as Sister Agnes, Richelieu's niece who enters the convent under the guise of becoming a nun in order to gather information on Sister Jeanne. In the credits, her role is mislabeled as \\"Sister Judith.\\" Filming Filming began 17 August 1970 in London at Pinewood Studios. The film's sets of Loudun‚Äîwhich were depicted as a modernistic white-tiled city‚Äî were devised by Jarman, who spent a total of three months designing them. In conceiving the look of the city, Russell was influenced by the cityscape in Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927). The interiors of many of the buildings, specifically the convent, were crafted with plaster and made to appear as masonry; the plaster designs were then nailed to plywood framework. Director Russell hired a large cast of extras, whom he later referred to as \\"a bad bunch\\" who were demanding, and alleged that one of the female extras appearing as a civilian was sexually assaulted by another male extra. Jones recalled that Reed, who at the time had a reputation for being disruptive and confrontational, was extremely kind to her on set, and \\"behaved impeccably.\\" Sutton recalled of Redgrave that she was \\"always an adventurous type of person\\" on the set, in terms of exploring her character and interacting with the other performers. Russell echoed this sentiment, referring to Redgrave as \\"one of the least bothersome actresses I could ever wish for; she just threw herself into it.\\" Additional photography occurred at Bamburgh Castle in Northumberland, England. Jones recalled filming at the castle as challenging due to cold weather and having the flu during this period of the shoot, to which Russell was \\"frightfully unsympathetic.\\" Throughout the shoot, Russell and Reed clashed frequently, and by the time principal photography had finished, the two were hardly on speaking terms. Soundtrack The film score was composed for a small ensemble by Peter Maxwell Davies. Russell was reportedly intrigued by Davies' 1969 composition Eight Songs for a Mad King. Davies reportedly took the job because he was interested in the late medieval and Renaissance historical period depicted in the film. He went on to write a score for Russell's next film, The Boyfriend. The Australian promoter James Murdoch, who was also Davies' agent, was involved in organising the music for both these films. The score recorded by Davies' regular collaborators the Fires of London with extra players as the score calls for more than their basic line-up. Maxwell Davies' music is complemented by period music (including a couple of numbers from Terpsichore), performed by the Early Music Consort of London under the direction of David Munrow. Concert suite The Fires of London and the Early Music Consort of London gave a performance of a concert suite of the music at the Proms in 1974. There have been other performances of music from the film in the concert hall. Release=Box office The film was one of the most popular movies in 1972 at the British box office. The film grossed approximately $8‚Äì9 million in Europe, and an additional $2 million in the United States, making for a worldwide total gross of around $11 million. Critical response The Devils received significant critical backlash upon its release due to its \\"outrageous,\\" \\"overheated,\\" and \\"pornographic\\" nature. The film was publicly condemned by the Vatican, who, though acknowledging that it contained some artistic merit, asked that its screenings at the Venice Film Festival be cancelled. Judith Crist called the film a \\"grand fiesta for sadists and perverts\\", while Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a rare zero-star rating. Pauline Kael wrote of the film in The New Yorker that Russell \\"doesn't report hysteria, he markets it.\\" Vincent Canby, writing for The New York Times, noted that the film contains \\"silly, melodramatic effects,\\" and felt that the performances were hindered by the nature of the screenplay, writing: \\"Oliver Reed suggests some recognizable humanity as poor Father Grandier, but everyone else is ridiculous. Vanessa Redgrave, who can be, I think, a fine actress, plays Sister Jeanne with a plastic hump, a Hansel-and-Gretel giggle, and so much sibilance that when she says \\"Satan is ever ready to seduce us with sensual delights,\\" you might think that Groucho Marx had let the air out of her tires.\\" Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times lambasted the film, writing that its message is \\"not anti- clerical‚Äîthere's hardly enough clericalism to be anti anymore‚Äîit is anti- humanity. A rage against cruelty has become a celebration of it... you weep not for the evils and the ignorance of the past, but for the cleverness and sickness of the day.\\" Ann Guarino of the New York Daily News noted that the film \\"could not be more anti-Catholic in tone or more sensationalized in treatment,\\" but conceded that the performances in the film were competent. The Ottawa Citizens Gordon Stoneham similarly felt the film had been over- sensationalized, noting that Russell focuses so much on the \\"baroque effects, and concentrates so much on the Grand Guignol aspects of the affair, the narrative is never firmly in focus.\\" Bridget Byrne of the LA Weekly alternately praised the film as \\"brilliant, audacious, and grotesque,\\" likening it to a fairytale, but added that audiences \\"have to grasp its philosophy, work out the undercurrents of seriousness, close the structural gaps for [themselves], even as [they] are transported by a literal orgy of splendor.\\" Writing for the Hackensack, New Jersey Record, John Crittenden praised the film's visuals as \\"genius,\\" but criticized Reed's performance while asserting that Redgrave was underused. Stephen Farber of The New York Times noted the film as an ambitious work, conceding that the \\"ideas in Russell's film may seem overly schematic, but his terrifying, fantastical nightmare images have astonishing psychological power.\\" On internet review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, The Devils holds an approval rating of 67%, based on 30 reviews, and an average rating of 7.32/10. Its consensus reads, \\"Grimly stylish, Ken Russell's baroque opus is both provocative and persuasive in its contention that the greatest blasphemy is the leveraging of faith for power.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 49 out of 100, based on 11 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". =Accolades= { class=\\"wikitable unsortable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:55%;\\" - ! style=\\"width:30%;\\" Institution ! style=\\"width:20%;\\" Category ! style=\\"width:20%;\\" Recipient ! style=\\"width:12%;\\" Result ! style=\\"width:1%;\\"  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  National Board of Review  Best Director  rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ken Russell    - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Venice Film Festival  Best Director ‚Äì Foreign    } Censorship The explicit sexual and violent content, paired with its commentary on religious institutions, resulted in the film suffering significant censorship. Commenting on the film's controversial nature, Reed stated: \\"We never set out to make a pretty Christian film. Charlton Heston made enough of those... The film is about twisted people.\\" The British Board of Film Censors found the film's combination of religious themes and violent sexual imagery a serious challenge, particularly as the Board was being lobbied by socially conservative pressure groups such as the Festival of Light at the time of its distribution. In order to gain a release and earn a British 'X' certificate (suitable for those aged 18 and over), Russell made minor cuts to the more explicit nudity (mainly in the cathedral and convent sequences), details from the first exorcism (mainly that which indicated an anal insertion), some shots of the crushing of Grandier's legs, and a pantomime sequence during the climactic burning. Russell later said: The most significant cuts were made by Warner Bros. studios, prior to submission to the BBFC. Two notable scenes were removed in their entirety: One was a two-and-a- half-minute sequence featuring naked nuns sexually defiling a statue of Christ, which includes Father Mignon looking down on the scene and masturbating. Another scene near the end of the film showed Sister Jeanne masturbating with the charred femur of Grandier after he is burned at the stake. Because of its content, the former scene has been popularly referred to as the \\"Rape of Christ\\" sequence. The British theatrical cut, which runs 111 minutes, was given an 'X' certificate (no one under 18 years of age admitted) in the United Kingdom. In the United States, the film was truncated even further for theatrical release: The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) cut it to approximately 108 minutes, and also awarded it an 'X' rating. Russell expressed frustration with the censorship of the film, commenting that they ‚Äúkilled the key scene‚Äù [the Rape of Christ] and that \\"Warner Brothers cut out the best of The Devils.\\" Speaking on the American version of the film, Russell stated that the cuts made \\"adversely affected the story, to the point where in America the film is disjointed and incomprehensible.\\" The extended version of the film (running approximately 117 minutes) with the aforementioned footage restored, was screened for the first time in London on 25 November 2002, along with a making-of documentary titled Hell on Earth, produced for Channel 4. The extended version was procured by Mark Kermode, who uncovered the footage in the Warner Bros. vaults. The film remained banned in Finland for over 40 years, until the ban was ultimately lifted in November 2011. Home media The Devils has had a complicated release history in home media formats, with various cuts being made available in different formats. Warner Home Video released a clamshell VHS of the film in the United States in 1983, labeled as featuring a 105-minute cut of the film; however, this is a misprint, as this edition actually runs 103 minutes, due to time compression. Warner reissued a VHS edition in 1995, with a corrected label of a 103-minute running time. A VHS was issued in the United Kingdom by Warner in 2002 as part of their \\"Masters of the Movies\\" series, reportedly running 104 minutes. However, according to film historian Richard Crouse, the VHS version available in the United Kingdom is identical to the American VHS editions, despite the labeled runtimes. A bootlegged NTSC-format DVD was released by Angel Digital in 2005, with the excised footage reinstated, along with the Hell on Earth documentary included as a bonus feature. In 2008, it was suspected that Warner Home Video may have been planning a U.S. DVD release for the film, as cover artwork was leaked on the internet. However, Warner responded to the claim by deeming the leaked news an \\"error.\\" In June 2010, Warner released The Devils in a 108-minute version for purchase and rental through the iTunes Store, but the title was removed without explanation three days later. On 19 March 2012, the British Film Institute released a 2-disc DVD featuring the 111-minute UK theatrical version (sped up to 107 minutes to accommodate the technicalities of PAL colour). The BFI release also includes the Kermode documentary Hell on Earth, as well as a vintage documentary shot during the production entitled Directing Devils, among other features In March 2017, streaming service Shudder began carrying the 109-minute U.S. release version of The Devils. As of 2019, it is available for screening via Shudder. In September 2018, FilmStruck began streaming the same U.S. cut and it was subsequently added to the Criterion Channel in October 2019, almost a year after FilmStruck shut down. Legacy The Devils has been cited as one of the most controversial films of all time, named by such critics as Richard Crouse, among others. FilmSite included it in their list of the 100 most controversial films ever made, and in 2015, Time Out magazine ranked it 47 on their list of the \\"50 Most Controversial Movies in History.\\" Film historian Joel W. Finler described The Devils as Russell's \\"most brilliant cinematic achievement, but widely regarded as his most distasteful and offensive work.\\" In 2002, when 100 film makers and critics were asked to cite what they considered to be the ten most important films ever made, The Devils featured in the lists submitted by critic Mark Kermode and director Alex Cox. In 2014, Mexican filmmaker Guillermo del Toro publicly criticized Warner Bros. for censoring the film and limiting its availability in home video markets.

The ABA did not allow African-Americans to join until 1943. This discrimination by the ABA led to the formation, in 1937, of the National Lawyers Guild. Roberta Cooper Ramo was the first female President of the ABA from 1995‚Äì1996. In 2016 ABA introduced a new ethics rule prohibiting attorneys from using sexist, racist and condescending terms. The rule also prohibits attorneys from engaging in discrimination based on age in the conduct of bar association activities.https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/abanews/2016%20Annual%20Resolutions/109.pdf On May 1, 2019, the ABA launched a new membership model aimed at reversing declining membership and revenue. As mentioned in \\"Criticisms,\\" below, and despite ABA's own rule against age-discriminatory conduct, the \\"experience- based\\" component of the ABA dues structure is a proxy for age discrimination, imposing significantly higher dues on lawyers as their years in practice increase.https://www.americanbar.org/membership/dues_eligibility/ Leadership and governance The ABA adopts \\"policy\\" (organizational positions) on certain legislative and national issues, as voted on by its elected, 589-member House of Delegates. Its Board of Governors, with 44 members, has the authority to act for the ABA, consistent with previous action of the House of Delegates, when the House is not in session. The ABA president, elected to a one-year term, is chief executive officer of the association, while the appointed, longer-serving executive director works as chief operating officer. The conclusion of the ABA Annual Meeting, in August, is when a new president takes office, as well as when the main sessions of the House of Delegates take place. The Annual Meeting also gives the general membership the opportunity to participate in educational programs and hear speakers address many issues.Fitzpatrick, Thomas M., editor. American Bar Association Centennial‚ÄîA Century of Service, page 8 (American Bar Association, 1979) In 2010, Jack L. Rives, formerly TJAG (The Judge Advocate General of the Air Force), was appointed Executive Director and Chief Operating Officer.  Model ethical standards for lawyers  One function of the ABA is its creation and maintenance of a code of ethical standards for lawyers. The Model Code of Professional Responsibility (1969) and/or the newer Model Rules of Professional Conduct (1983) have been adopted in 49 states, the District of Columbia and the United States Virgin Islands. The exception is the State Bar of California; however, a few sections of the California Rules of Professional Conduct were drawn from the ABA models.  Accreditation of U.S. law schools since 1923  The United States Department of Education recognises the Council of the ABA Section on Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar as a professional accrediting agency for law schools in the U.S. American law schools that are accredited by the Council are termed \\"approved\\" by the ABA, which indicates the law school was found to be in compliance with ABA accreditation standards. ABA accreditation is important not only because it affects the recognition of the law schools involved, but it also affects a graduate's ability to practice law in a particular state. Specifically, in most U.S. jurisdictions, graduation from an ABA-accredited law school is prerequisite towards being allowed to sit for that state's bar exam, and even for existing lawyers to be admitted to the bar of another state upon motion. Even states which recognize unaccredited schools within their borders will generally not recognize such schools from other jurisdictions for purposes of bar admission.See, e.g., Supreme Court Rule 7 (Tennessee), Rules Regarding Admission to Practice Law (California). For law students attending ABA- accredited schools, memberships are available for free. Students attending non-ABA accredited law schools are permitted to join the ABA as associate members.  Accreditation process criticisms  The ABA accreditation process has been widely criticized for failing to ensure that law schools are disclosing accurate post-graduate statistics which may mislead students regarding the post-graduate job market, especially in light of ever-growing student loan debt. There are heated debates over requirements placed on law schools by the ABA. Many states and practitioners believe ABA requirements to be unnecessary, costly, outdated and lacking innovation. Some legal professionals and academics feel these requirements promote the rising cost of tuition. The collision of attorney layoffs in 2009, the glut of fresh non-top- tier law graduates without work, and the continued expansion of law schools raised questions on whether the ABA has been too lenient in its accreditation process. A non-profit organization, Law School Transparency, called upon the ABA to provide meaningful statistics regarding the employment prospects and salary information of graduates of ABA accredited institutions. In 2011 and 2012, the ABA updated its accreditation process to include penalties and possible loss of accreditation for schools that misrepresented their graduates' employment data, as well as, greatly expanded the information required from accredited laws schools regarding student bar-passage rates and post-graduate employment. Despite the ongoing controversy surrounding law school accreditation standards and inability of law school graduates to effectively service their educational debt, the ABA continued to approve new law schools. Since 2014, the ABA has required law schools to disclose more information about their applicants and graduates. Required information now includes such information as admissions data, tuition and fees, living costs, conditional scholarships, enrollment data, numbers of full‚Äêtime and part‚Äêtime faculty, class sizes for first‚Äêyear and upper‚Äêclass courses, employment outcomes and bar passage data. The 205 ABA-approved law schools reported that, 10 months after graduation, 28,029 graduates of the class of 2015, or 70 percent, were employed in long-term, full-time positions where bar passage is required or a J.D. is preferred. In May 2019, the ABA Council of the Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar changed the requirement for graduate bar passage rates. Previously, to remain accredited, schools had to have a 75% bar passage rate for students within 5 years of graduation, with various ways to meet this standard and no law schools having ever been found in violation of the rule. The new rule requires the 75% bar passage rate be achieved within 2 years with no exceptions. The change was passed by the Section despite failing a vote in the ABA House of Delegates twice. Proponents of the change say the increased standard will ensure students are better prepared for passing the bar and for legal practice in general with less students acquiring large student debt without reasonable job opportunities. Opponents claim this will adversely affect diversity in law schools, which will be forced to increase their admissions standards and required LSAT scores, which in turn will disproportionately affect minority applicants. Under the new plan, 14 schools will be at risk of losing their accreditation if their bar-passage rates do not improve within two years. At the time of the rule change, three law schools were currently in the process of closing, and another school was under probation. In June 2019, the ABA voted to revoke the accreditation of Thomas Jefferson School of Law in San Diego, California. Antitrust consent decree and contempt fine In 1995 the United States Department of Justice accused the ABA of violating Section 1 of the Sherman Act in its law school accreditation proceedings. The case was resolved with a consent decree.United States v. American Bar Association, U.S. District Court (D.C.), text of decree. In 2006, the ABA acknowledged that it violated the consent decree and paid DOJ a $185,000 fine. Continuing legal education Rappaport Center roundtable The American Bar Association Center for Continuing Legal Education (ABA-CLE) serves as the central CLE resource for the ABA. It is overseen by the ABA Standing Committee on Continuing Legal Education and works closely with experts from the ABA Sections and the profession at large. In addition to its own distribution, the ABA-CLE is also delivered via private, non-profit CLE organizations, such as Practising Law Institute and for-profit organizations, such as West LegalEdCenter.  Publications  ;Association The Association publishes a monthly general magazine circulated to all members, the ABA Journal (since 1984, formerly American Bar Association Journal, 1915‚Äì1983), now also online. ;Sections, divisions and forums ABA members may also join practice setting or subject- specific \\"sections,\\" \\"divisions\\", or \\"forums,\\" and each entity publishes a variety of newsletters and magazines for its members (such as Law Practice Magazine published by the Law Practice Division and GPSolo Magazine published by the Solo, Small Firm and General Practice Division). Some of these magazines, such as the Business Law Section's \\"Business Law Today,\\" are available on-line to non-members. The first such journal was the Annual Bulletin of the Comparative Law Bureau, the first comparative law journal in the U.S. (1908‚Äì1914). The entities also hold their own meetings, such as the annual Solo Day.Annual Report of the American Bar Association 2007 Each entity typically has a publication program that includes (1) books, usually oriented toward practitioners; (2) scholarly journals, such as Administrative Law Review (published by the ABA Section of Administrative Law & Regulatory Practice and The American University Washington College of Law) and The International Lawyer (published by the ABA Section of International Law and SMU Dedman School of Law); (3) newsletters, such as The International Law News (published by the ABA Section of International Law); (4) e-publications, such as a monthly message from the section chair, or updates on substantive law developments; and (5) committee publications, such as a committee newsletter published by one of the substantive law committees.  Commissions  The ABA's Commission on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity was established in 2007. The ABA's Criminal Justice Section, specifically the Corrections Committee, focuses on the United States Criminal Justice System and its surrounding laws, policies, and structure. The Corrections Committee \\"is pushing to provide greater assistance ... for those reentering society\\" from prison by pushing law schools and state bar associations to provide opportunities for law students to represent prisoners reentering society. In 2017, the ABA's Commission on Women in the Profession released \\"A Current Glance at Women in the Law\\", providing research about the status of women in the American legal profession. The report showed a 6 percent increase in women attorneys over the last decade, with women currently making up 36 percent of the legal profession. Law schools award 47.3 percent of J.D.s to women, which has been consistent for the past 10 years. In private practice law firms, women make up less than 22 percent of partners, a 4.2 percent increase over the last 10 years. In the last decade, there has been a significant growth rate of women in the role of general counsel in Fortune 500 companies, but still women only represent 24.8 percent of Fortune 500 general counsels. Positions on social and legal issues=Discrimination against LGBT people In 2011, the ABA's House of Delegates passed an anti-bullying resolution that included sexual orientation and gender identity among characteristics that should be protected, along with race, religion, national origin, sex, and disability. At the 2013 annual meeting, the ABA's House of Delegates passed a resolution that made it harder for criminal defense lawyers to use the LGBT panic defense, which argues that a crime victim's sexual orientation should mitigate the defendant's guilt. At the 2014 annual meeting, the ABA passed Resolution 114B, which stated that \\"lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people have a human right to be free from discrimination, threats, and violence based on their LGBT status,\\" and called on the governments of countries where such discriminatory laws exist to repeal them. Mandatory sentencing requirements A hearing in 2009 heard testimony from the ABA which stated that \\"Sentencing by mandatory minimums is the antithesis of rational sentencing policy\\". In 2004 the association called for the repeal of mandatory minimum sentences, stating that \\"there is no need for mandatory minimum sentences in a guided sentencing system.\\" Presidential signing statements In July 2006, an ABA task force under then President Michael S. Greco released a report that concluded that George W. Bush's use of \\"signing statements\\" violates the Constitution.Green, Elizabeth Weiss. \\"Signs Of A Struggle.\\" U.S. News & World Report 141.5 (7 Aug. 2006): 30. Academic Search Premier. Web. 29 Dec. 2011. These are documents attached by the President when signing bills, in which the President states that he or she will enforce the new law only to the extent that he or she feels the law conforms to the proper interpretation of the Constitution. Same sex marriage At the 2010 annual meeting, the ABA passed Resolution 111 urging every state, territorial, and tribal government to eliminate legal barriers to civil marriage between two persons of the same sex who are otherwise eligible to marry. Rating of judicial nominees For decades, the ABA has participated in the federal judicial nomination process by vetting nominees and giving them a rating ranging from \\"not qualified\\" to \\"well qualified\\". According to a compendium of those ratings, the ABA's Committee on the Federal Judiciary began rating Supreme Court nominees in 1956, but: \\"At various points in its history, the committee altered its ratings categories, making comparisons across time difficult.\\"Epstein, Lee et al. The Supreme Court Compendium: Data, Decisions & Developments, page 390 (Fourth Edition, CQ Press, 2007) The committee consists of two members from the ninth judicial circuit, one member from each of the other federal judicial circuits and the chair of the committee. The ABA's Board of Governors, House of Delegates and officers are not involved with the work of the committee, and it is completely insulated from the rest of the ABA's activities, including its policies. Although the committee rates prospective nominees, it does not propose, recommend or endorse candidates for nomination to the federal judiciary, as that would compromise its independent evaluative function. The committee works in strictly-enforced confidentiality, typically evaluating around 60 nominees per year. Nominees are rated as \\"well qualified\\", \\"qualified\\" or \\"not qualified\\". If the president selects a prospective nominee, the committee chair notifies the White House, the Department of Justice, the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the nominee of the committee's rating. There are several procedural differences between the committee's investigations of Supreme Court nominees and those of lower courts, notably that investigations of Supreme Court nominees are conducted after the president has submitted a nomination. Also, there is added scrutiny with Supreme Court nominees, such as teams of law professors examining the legal writings of the prospective justice. The process has been alleged by some (including the Federalist Society) to have a liberal bias. For example, the ABA gave Ronald Reagan's judicial nominees Richard Posner and Frank H. Easterbrook low \\"qualified/not qualified\\" ratings; later, the ABA gave Bill Clinton judicial nominees with similar resumes \\"well qualified\\" ratings. Meanwhile, Judges Posner and Easterbrook have gone on to become the two most highly cited judges in the federal appellate judiciary. In 2001, the George W. Bush administration announced that it would cease submitting names to the ABA in advance of judicial nominations. The ABA continued to rate nominees, just not before the names were released publicly. During the Obama administration, the ABA was once again given advance notice of judicial nominees for rating. President Trump returned to George W. Bush‚Äôs policy of not giving the ABA advanced notice of judicial nominees. Seven of George W. Bush‚Äôs nominees received a ‚Äònot qualified‚Äô ranking, four of Clinton‚Äôs nominees, zero of Obama‚Äôs nominees, and, through December 2018, six of Trump‚Äôs nominees were rated ‚Äònot qualified‚Äô. For recent U.S. Supreme Court nominees, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., Justice Samuel Alito, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Justice Elena Kagan, Justice Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh all received the same \\"well qualified\\" rating. In 2001 a study \\"found that nominees confirmed to the federal appeals courts with prior judicial experience fared about the same before the bar association whether they were nominated by the first President George Bush or President Bill Clinton. But ... 'among those without prior judicial experience, the differences were stark: 65 percent of Clinton nominees received the A.B.A.‚Äôs highest rating compared to 17 percent of Bush nominees.'\\" In 2012, a study was released in Political Research Quarterly showing that from 1977 to 2008 there was a distinct bias in favor of judicial candidates nominated by a Democratic president, with all other factors being equal. Candidates nominated by a Democrat president were 15 percent more likely to receive a \\"well qualified\\" ranking than a similarly-qualified candidate nominated by a Republican president. Supporters of the rating system argue that nominees rated 'not qualified' will not perform as well as judges, however, a 2010 study found \\"a review of tens of thousands of dispositions does not provide generally persuasive evidence that judges rated by the ABA as Well Qualified perform better.\\"  Nominee ratings during the Trump administration  The ABA judicial nominee rating process has drawn additional attention during the Trump administration. Through June 2019, six of President Trump's nominees were rated 'not qualified'. Three of those were ranked unanimously not qualified, which had only occurred twice previously since the George H.W. Bush administration. This has added further fuel to conservative's arguments of bias in the nominee rating process. Republicans claim the members of the Committee on the Federal Judiciary allow their personal liberal political leanings to influence their ratings under the category of judicial temperament. Members of the committee were accused of asking inappropriate questions of a nominee regarding abortion and negatively referring to Republicans as \\"you people.\\" Senator Ted Cruz stated that the ABA is a liberal advocacy group and, as such, \\"should not be treated as a fair or impartial arbiter of merit.\\" Senator Ben Sasse also criticized the organization for taking liberal stances on issues then proclaiming to be neutral when evaluating judicial nominees. The ABA has maintained \\"evaluation of these candidates does not consider the nominees' politics, their ideology or their party affiliation and has found unqualified candidates put forth by both political parties.\\" Criticisms The ABA has been criticized for racism. In 1925, African-American lawyers formed the National Bar Association at a time when the ABA would not allow them to be members. Currently, the National Bar Association has over 60,000 members and 84 chapters. ABA's \\"experience based\\" dues structure is also discriminatory against older lawyers, because it generally imposes higher dues for members who have been in practice longer. Lawyers with less than five years of experience are charged only $75. Lawyers with 20 or more years of experience (except for government or non-profit lawyers, judges, solo and small firm practitioners) are charged $450 for no greater member benefits. The discriminatory rates are not tied to economic justifications, as the median starting pay for new lawyers working in law firms at the start of 2019 was $155,000 http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/median-pay-for-new-associates-jumps- nearly-15-nalp-survey-says ABA's own Model Rule 8.4(g) provides that it is professional misconduct for practicing lawyers, in the course of bar association activities, to engage in discrimination based on age Since the advent of twenty-first century, the ABA has increased the diversity of its membership and leadership. Dennis Archer, who served as ABA president from 2003 to 2004, was the first African-American to hold the position, while Paulette Brown, 2015‚Äì2016, was the association's first president who is a woman of color. Steve Zack, whose term was in 2010 and 2011, was the first Cuban American to hold the American Bar Association's presidency. In 2016, for the first time, the ABA had an all-female roster of officers, including two African-Americans and one Native American: Linda A. Klein (president), Hilarie Bass (president-elect), Deborah Enix-Ross (chair of the House of Delegates), Mary L. Smith (secretary), Michelle A. Behnke (treasurer) and Paulette Brown (immediate past president). In recent years, the ABA has also drawn some criticism, mainly from the conservative side of the political spectrum, for taking positions on controversial public policy topics such as abortion, gun control, and same-sex marriage. The ABA's official position in favor of abortion rights led to the formation of an alternative organization for lawyers in 1993, the National Lawyers for Life, now the National Lawyers Association. The Federalist Society previously sponsored a twice-a-year publication called \\"ABA Watch\\" that reports on the political activities of the ABA. Writing for Forbes, Mark A. Cohen criticized the ABA for failing to keep the practice of law in America up with the changing demands of modern society. Cohen also criticized the ABA for opposing regulatory reform that would help increase access to affordable legal services for those in need and for engaging in protectionism when some legal services could be performed by paralegals and other non-lawyer professionals at a lower cost. Eighty percent of Americans cannot afford legal services and the ABA has failed to embrace alternative legal delivery methods that could address this problem. The ABA also failed to address rules that prohibit some online legal referral websites when it updated the Model Rules regarding Communication Concerning a Lawyer‚Äôs Services.

It depicts workers in a vineyard, and is believed to be the only painting van Gogh sold during his lifetime. It has been listed among the artist's major works. History The Red Vineyard was exhibited for the first time at the annual exhibition of Les XX, 1890 in Brussels, and sold for 400 Francs (equal to about $2,000 today) to Anna Boch, an impressionist painter, member of Les XX and art collector from Belgium;Hulsker (1980), 356Pickvance (1984), 168‚Äì169;206 Anna was the sister of Eug√®ne Boch, another impressionist painter and a friend of Van Gogh, too, who had painted Boch's portrait (Le Peintre aux √âtoiles) in Arles, in autumn 1888. The painting was later purchased, in 1909, from a Paris art gallery by Ivan Morozov. Later, it was being housed in the exquisite collection of Sergei Shchukin, in Shchukin‚Äòs home at Trubetskoy House in Moscow. After the Russian revolution, the painting was subsequently nationalised by the Bolsheviks, while Shchukin was allowed to emigrate to France. The Red Vineyard was eventually passed to Moscow‚Äòs Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts, where it resides today. ReferencesSources *Hulsker, Jan. The Complete Van Gogh.

The company was taken over and diversified in the 1960s. History=Model development Morane- Saulnier's first product was the Model A, a development of a monoplane design produced by the Morane company (sometimes called Morane-Borel, from the brothers partnership with Gabriel Borel). Using a wing-warping mechanism for control, this was the type in which Jules V√©drines won the Paris-Madrid race on May 26, 1911. L√©on Morane 1910:Robert and L√©on Morane before takeoff in two-seat Bleriot XI. Both were nearly killed when the machine crashed shortly after. The brothers decided to start their own company afterward. Morane- Saulnier's first commercially successful design was the Morane-Saulnier G, a wire-braced shoulder-wing monoplane with wing warping. This led to the development of a series of aircraft and was very successful in racing and setting records. The Type G was a 2-seater, and was reduced slightly in size to produce the Morane-Saulnier H, a single-seater, and was given a faired fuselage to produce the Morane-Saulnier N single-seat fighter. The Morane- Saulnier H was modified so that its wings were mounted parasol fashion, above the fuselage to afford the observer a better view, creating the Morane- Saulnier L. The L was then fitted with a faired fuselage as on the N and ailerons to make the Morane-Saulnier LA, which was then completely redesigned (though looking very similar) to make the Morane-Saulnier P which would be the basis for a whole family of aircraft developed in the '20s. The Type N was developed into the larger and more powerful Morane-Saulnier I and the very similar Morane-Saulnier V, but these were not successful, being too powerful and having inadequate controls. The V was then redesigned to create the Morane-Saulnier AC which substituted ailerons for wing warping and had a strut-braced wing. The AC was not particularly successful, in part because of poor field of view a shoulder-mounted wing produced, so the Morane-Saulnier AI was developed, in which the wing was raised above the fuselage. The AI lost out in the competition to the SPAD XIII but was built in limited numbers in case there was a problem with the SPAD; as it turned out it was the AI that suffered structural problems. In parallel to the L the Morane-Saulnier BB was developed for the RFC, which was a Type P built as a biplane. Because the type 'BB' when pronounced in French sounds like Bebe (or baby), this became the type's nickname. Most of these types had no fixed fin, or horizontal stabilizer, with the result that they were not only very sensitive on the controls, but also could not even be flown hands off. One early pilot noted that if one left the aircraft to its own devices it would end up going upside down in the opposite direction. Despite this, many were used as trainers, including a great many that had their wings stripped so they couldn't fly, creating what was known as a Penguin. The Type L has the distinction of being the first fighter aircraft used during World War I when one was fitted with a machine gun firing through the propeller, which was fitted with metal plates to deflect any bullets that struck it. This was flown with success by Roland Garros, who would later be considered to be the first French Ace. A similar system was fitted to the Type N pending the arrival of other machine guns, which made the system workable. While flying his modified Type L, Garros crashed on the German side of the lines and the wreckage was examined by Fokker just prior to Fokker producing a similar system. After the war, Morane- Saulnier produced a number of designs for training and general aviation, but with the threat of war in the late thirties it once again turned to military aircraft. During the late 1920s and early 1930s, it produced a number of parasol wing fighters including the M.S.230 and M.S.315, but all were of limited performance and were relegated to training duties. Morane-Saulnier had much more success with its dramatically modernized M.S.406, which was the French Air Force's most numerous fighter at the start of the war. Unfortunately, the 406 was advanced only for its introduction in 1935 and suffered terribly against the more modern Messerschmitt Bf 109s it faced in 1940. During World War II, Morane-Saulnier was operated under German control and built a number of German types including the Fieseler Storch, known after the war as the Morane-Saulnier MS.500 Criquet. Morane-Saulnier also produced a number of trainer and civilian aircraft models, the best known of which was the successful \\"Rallye\\" series of four-seat STOL semi-aerobatic tourers (see picture above). Morane-Saulnier was purchased by Potez on January 7, 1962 and became SEEMS, the Societe d'Exploitation des Etablissements Morane-Saulnier.

Population: It was previously known as Ust-Sheksna (until 1504), Rybnaya Sloboda (until 1777), Rybinsk (until 1946), Shcherbakov (until 1957), and Andropov (until 1989). History=Early history City center and cathedral in the 19th century Rybinsk is one of the oldest Slavic settlements on the Volga River. The place was first recorded by chroniclers in 1071 as Ust-Sheksna, i.e. \\"the mouth of the Sheksna\\". During this period the settlement was a regional center for craft and metal based produce and for trade. In the mid-13th century, Ust-Sheksna was laid waste by invading Mongols. For the next few centuries, the settlement was referred to alternatively as Ust-Sheksna or Rybansk. From 1504, it was identified in documents as Rybnaya Sloboda (literally: \\"the fishing village\\"). The name is explained by the fact that the settlement supplied the Muscovite court with choice sturgeons and sterlets. In the 17th century, when the sloboda was capitalizing on the trade of the Muscovy Company with Western Europe, it was rich enough to build several stone churches, of which only one survives to the present. More old architecture may be found in the neighborhood, including the very last of Muscovite three-tented churches (in the Alexandrov Hermitage) and the Ushakov family shrine (on Epiphany Island). Golden age In the 18th century, the sloboda continued to thrive on the Volga trade. Catherine the Great granted Rybnaya Sloboda municipal rights and renamed it Rybinsk. It was a place where the cargo was reloaded from large Volga vessels to smaller boats capable of navigating in the shallow Mariinsk Canal system, which connects the Russian hinterland with the Baltic Sea. With the population of 7,000, the town daily accommodated up to 170,000 sailors and up to 2,000 river vessels. Consequently, the local river port became known as the \\"capital of barge- haulers\\". General view of Rybinsk in the 1820s The town's most conspicuous landmark, the Neoclassical Savior-Transfiguration Cathedral, was constructed on the Volga riverside from 1838 until 1851. It was built to a design that the Dean of the Imperial Academy of Arts, Avraam Melnikov, had prepared for Saint Isaac's Cathedral in St. Petersburg. After Melnikov lost the contest for the best project of St. Isaac's Cathedral to Auguste de Montferrand, he sold his grandiose design to the municipal authorities of Rybinsk. A 19th-century photo of a monastery near Rybinsk, now submerged under the waters of the Rybinsk Reservoir Grain bourse in Rybinsk. For a more recent picture, see this. As a trade capital of the Upper Volga, Rybinsk formerly attracted scores of foreigners, who built a Lutheran church and an imposing Roman Catholic cathedral, said to be the tallest on the Volga. There is also the Nobel Family Museum, documenting the operations of that prominent Swedish family during the Russian Empire. 20th-century American film moguls Nicholas Schenck and Joseph Schenck were born in the town, and there is a grand 18th-century mansion of the Mikhalkov family, whose living members include Sergey Mikhalkov, Nikita Mikhalkov, and Andron Konchalovsky. 20th century In the Soviet years, Rybinsk continued its impressive renaming record, for it changed its name four times: to Shcherbakov (after Aleksandr Shcherbakov) in 1946, back to Rybinsk in 1957, to Andropov (after Yuri Andropov) in 1984, and back to Rybinsk in 1989.

As the experts warn, the giant Rybinsk dam, which holds the Rybinsk Reservoir (formerly touted as the largest man-made body of water on Earth) places the town in the imminent danger of the dam breaking and the reservoir flooding the city. The city is served by the Staroselye Airport. Climate Rybinsk has a four-season humid continental climate with significant differences between winters and summers, although the cold winters are still significantly less severe than those found on similar parallels further east in Russia. June, July and August all average above in average high temperatures with the five months above ensuring Rybinsk falls into humid continental rather than the subarctic category found further north.

The title dates to 1447 but it was recreated in 1603. Confusion over the details of the 15th-century title has led to conflicting order for titleholders; authorities such as Burke's Peerage and Debrett's Peerage do not agree on whether or not the 1447 creation is still extant. History The Saye (also spelt Say) family is an ancient one. According to the Roman de Rou, a \\"le sire de Saye\\" took part in the Norman conquest in 1087, after which they gained prominence and land. The name Saye possibly refers to Sai, Normandy. In the 11th century, a William de Say married Agnes, daughter of Hugh de Grandmesnil, but his connection to the later titleholders is not confirmed. However, the history of the title has been traced to another William de Saye, who was granted lands by Empress Matilda between 1141‚Äì42 and later joined his brother-in-law Geoffrey de Mandeville, 1st Earl of Essex in The Anarchy against King Stephen of England. He was likely killed in the same raid on Burwell Castle that killed Essex. De Saye arms: Quarterly or and gules William's eldest son, William II de Saye, had two daughters, one of whom, Beatrice, married Geoffrey Fitz Peter, 1st Earl of Essex (of the second creation). Lands held by the de Maminots ‚Äî including the Manor of Deptford, known now as Sayes Court ‚Äî came to the family through Alice, daughter of Hugh II de Maminot, who married William II de Saye's second son, Geoffrey II de Saye. The Sayes also adopted the Maminot arms, quarterly or and gules. Geoffrey II de Saye filed legal suits against his cousin, the new Earl of Essex, for the lands belonging to the Mandeville family. His son Geoffrey III de Saye, who held the Lordship of West Greenwich inherited from his mother, was one of the 25 feudal barons who stood surety for the Magna Carta in 1215. His son William III de Saye traveled with and fought for Henry III and is recorded as a witness for the Treaty of York in 1237. William IV de Saye fought for Edward I in his conquest of Wales (1277‚Äì1283). His grandson Geoffrey III de Saye was created feudal baron Saye by writ in 1313. His son Geoffrey IV de Saye, the second baron, married Lady Maud de Beauchamp, daughter of 10th Earl of Warwick. Their son William, the third baron, was knighted in 1361 and married Beatrice, daughter of Sir Thomas de Brewose (Breouse/Brewes/Braose). William died by 7 August 1375, leaving the title to their young son John, who died a few years later. The title then passed to John's sister Elizabeth, 16. She married Sir John de Falvesle, 1st Lord Falvesley. After his death she married secondly Sir William Heron, who sat in Parliament as Lord Say by right of his wife. She died in 1399 without heirs, after which the barony became abeyant among her three aunts. Idonea was married to John de Clinton, 3rd Lord de Clinton; Joan married Sir William Fiennes (died 1359); and Elizabeth married Sir Thomas de Aldoun. Of the three, only Joan had male issue. Her second but eldest surviving son Sir William Fiennes (died 1403) was the father of Sir Roger Fiennes, MP for Sussex and Treasurer of the Household. With the spoils of the Hundred Years' War, Sir Roger built Herstmonceux Castle. His elder son Sir Richard Fiennes was called to Parliament as 7th Lord Dacre in right of his wife, Joan Dacre, 7th Baroness Dacre. The Barony of Saye and Sele is thought to have been created by letters patent in 1447 for Sir Roger's second son, James Fiennes, for his services in the Hundred Years' War. The patent creating the original barony was lost, so it was assumed that the barony was created by writ, meaning that it could descend to heirs-general, and not only heirs-male. Fiennes-Saye arms However, several authorities, including Burke's Peerage, agree that the assumption was erroneous, and that the original creation was by letters patent, and thus identify the initial holder as Lordship of Saye and Sele. His son, the second baron, was summoned to Parliament but killed at the Battle of Barnet in 1471. His son, the de jure third Baron, was known as Lord Saye and Sele but was never summoned to Parliament. The peerage is therefore considered to have become dormant (unclaimed) on the death of the second Baron. His great-great- great-grandson, Richard Fiennes, the de jure seventh baron, claimed the title in 1573. For years, he remained unsuccessful, but in 1603 James I granted him letters patent confirming his right to the title. The patent confirmed that the barony created in 1447 belonged to Richard Fiennes, but on the condition that, for the purposes of precedence or seniority, it would be considered as having been created in 1603, and also provided that no future Baron Saye and Sele would assert the precedence of 1447. The patent, furthermore, allowed the title to pass to heirs-general, based on the erroneous assumption that the barony was created by writ. William Fiennes, the eighth Baron, was created Viscount Saye and Sele, also in the Peerage of England, in 1624. On the death of his son, the second Viscount, the two titles separated. The barony fell into abeyance between the late Baron's daughters Hon. Elizabeth, wife of John Twisleton, and Hon. Frances, wife of Andrew Ellis. The Viscountcy could only be passed on to male heirs and was inherited by the Baron's nephew, the third Viscount. He was the son of Nathaniel Fiennes, second son of the first Viscount. When his son, the fourth Viscount, died, this line of the family also failed. He was succeeded by his cousin, the fifth Viscount. He was the son of John Fiennes, third son of the first Viscount. He was in his turn succeeded by another cousin, the sixth Viscount. On his death in 1781, there were no more male heirs left of the first Viscount, and the title became extinct. Broughton Castle in Oxfordshire, family seat of the Barons Saye and Sele By 1715, all of the coheirs to the Barony of Saye and Sele had died save one; Cecil Twisleton, de jure tenth Baroness Saye and Sele. She was the daughter of the aforementioned Hon. Elizabeth, daughter of the second Viscount Saye and Sele. However, the barony was only formally called out of abeyance in favour of her great-grandson, Thomas Twisleton, who became the thirteenth Baron Saye and Sele. He was a General in the Army. His son, the fourteenth Baron, assumed the additional surnames of Fiennes and Eardley in 1825. He was succeeded by his son, the fifteenth Baron, who in his turn was succeeded by his cousin, the sixteenth Baron. In 1849 he assumed the additional surnames of Wykeham-Fiennes (the first Viscount Saye and Sele was a descendant of the sister and heiress of William of Wykeham).William of Wykeham (c1320 ‚Äì 1404) who left his fortune to his great-nephew Thomas Wykeham. Thomas Wykeham's granddaughter married William Fiennes, 2nd Baron Saye and Sele. His grandson, the eighteenth Baron, served as Comptroller of the Household from 1912 to 1915 in the Liberal government of H.H. Asquith. As of 2007 the title is held by his grandson, the twenty-first Baron. In 1965 he relinquished the additional surnames of Twisleton and Wykeham. Eustace Edward Fiennes, second son of the seventeenth Baron, represented Banbury in Parliament and also served as Governor of the Leeward Islands.Seychelles National Archives: Lt. Col. The Hon. Sir Eustace Edward Twistleton Wykeham Fiennes, CMG, (1918-1921) In 1916 he was created a baronet, of Banbury in the County of Oxford. Since 1944, the title has been held by his grandson, Sir Ranulph Twisleton-Wykeham-Fiennes. Actors Ralph Fiennes and Joseph Fiennes are from a cadet branch of the family, being descended from Frederick the sixteenth Baron. Through the marriage of the second Viscount to a daughter of Edward Cecil, 1st Viscount Wimbledon, the family descends from William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, as well as the Plantagenet Kings of England.

In the English-speaking world, she was one of the most widely read writers on such matters in the first half of the 20th century. No other book of its type matched that of her best-known work, Mysticism, published in 1911.Armstrong, C.J.R., \\"Evelyn Underhill: An Introduction to Her Life and Writings\\", A.R. Mowbray & Co., 1975 Life Underhill was born in Wolverhampton. She was a poet and novelist as well as a pacifist and mystic. An only child, she described her early mystical insights as \\"abrupt experiences of the peaceful, undifferentiated plane of reality‚Äîlike the 'still desert' of the mystic‚Äîin which there was no multiplicity nor need of explanation\\".Williams, Charles, editor, The Letters of Evelyn Underhill, Longmans Green, pp. 122‚Äì23. The meaning of these experiences became a lifelong quest and a source of private angst, provoking her to research and write. Both her father and her husband were writers (on the law), London barristers, and yachtsmen. She and her husband, Hubert Stuart Moore, grew up together and were married on 3 July 1907. The couple had no children. She travelled regularly within Europe, primarily Switzerland, France and Italy, where she pursued her interests in art and Catholicism, visiting numerous churches and monasteries. Neither her husband (a Protestant) nor her parents shared her interest in spiritual matters. Underhill was called simply \\"Mrs Moore\\" by many of her friends, but was not without her detractors. She was a prolific author and published over 30 books either under her maiden name, Underhill, or under the pseudonym \\"John Cordelier\\", as was the case for the 1912 book The Spiral Way. Initially an agnostic, she gradually began to acquire an interest in Neoplatonism and from there was increasingly drawn to Catholicism against the objections of her husband, eventually becoming a prominent Anglo-Catholic. Her spiritual mentor from 1921 to 1924 was Baron Friedrich von H√ºgel, who was appreciative of her writing yet concerned with her focus on mysticism and who encouraged her to adopt a much more Christocentric view as opposed to the theistic and intellectual one she had previously held. She described him as \\"the most wonderful personality. ... so saintly, truthful, sane and tolerant\\" (Cropper, p. 44) and was influenced by him toward more charitable and down-to-earth activities. After his death in 1925, her writings became more focused on the Holy Spirit and she became prominent in the Anglican Church as a lay leader of spiritual retreats, a spiritual director for hundreds of individuals, guest speaker, radio lecturer and proponent of contemplative prayer. Underhill came of age in the Edwardian era, at the turn of the 20th century and, like most of her contemporaries, had a decided romantic bent. The enormous excitement in those days was mysteriously compounded of the psychic, the psychological, the occult, the mystical, the medieval, the advance of science, the apotheosis of art, the rediscovery of the feminine, the unashamedly sensuous, and the most ethereally \\"spiritual\\" (Armstrong, p. xiii‚Äìxiv). Anglicanism seemed to her out-of-key with this, her world. She sought the centre of life as she and many of her generation conceived it, not in the state religion, but in experience and the heart. This age of \\"the soul\\" was one of those periods when a sudden easing of social taboos brings on a great sense of personal emancipation and desire for an El Dorado despised by an older, more morose and insensitive generation. As an only child, she was devoted to her parents and, later, to her husband. She was fully engaged in the life of a barrister's daughter and wife, including the entertainment and charitable work that entailed, and pursued a daily regimen that included writing, research, worship, prayer and meditation. It was a fundamental axiom of hers that all of life was sacred, as that was what \\"incarnation\\" was about. She was a cousin of Francis Underhill, Bishop of Bath and Wells. Education Underhill was educated at home, except for three years at a private school in Folkestone, and subsequently read history and botany at King's College London. She was conferred with an honorary Doctorate of Divinity from Aberdeen University and made a fellow of King's College. She was the first woman to lecture to the clergy in the Church of England as well as the first woman officially to conduct spiritual retreats for the Church. She was also the first woman to establish ecumenical links between churches and one of the first woman theologians to lecture in English colleges and universities, which she did frequently. Underhill was an award-winning bookbinder, studying with the most renowned masters of the time. She was schooled in the classics, well read in Western spirituality, well informed (in addition to theology) in the philosophy, psychology, and physics of her day, and was a writer and reviewer for The Spectator. Early work Blue plaque, 50 Campden Hill Square, London Before undertaking many of her better known expository works on mysticism, she first published a small book of satirical poems on legal dilemmas, The Bar-Lamb's Ballad Book, which received a favorable welcome. Underhill then wrote three highly unconventional though profoundly spiritual novels. Like Charles Williams and later, Susan Howatch, Underhill uses her narratives to explore the sacramental intersection of the physical with the spiritual. She then uses that sacramental framework very effectively to illustrate the unfolding of a human drama. Her novels are entitled The Grey World (1904), The Lost Word (1907), and The Column of Dust (1909). In her first novel, The Grey World, described by one reviewer as an extremely interesting psychological study, the hero's mystical journey begins with death, and then moves through reincarnation, beyond the grey world, and into the choice of a simple life devoted to beauty, reflecting Underhill's own serious perspective as a young woman. > It seems so much easier in these days to live morally than to live > beautifully. Lots of us manage to exist for years without ever sinning > against society, but we sin against loveliness every hour of the > day.Underhill, E., The Grey World, London: William Heinemann, 1904 The Lost Word and The Column of Dust are also concerned with the problem of living in two worlds and reflect the writer's own spiritual challenges. In the 1909 novel, her heroine encounters a rift in the solid stuff of her universe: > She had seen, abruptly, the insecurity of those defences which protect our > illusions and ward off the horrors of truth. She had found a little hole in > the wall of appearances; and peeping through, had caught a glimpse of that > seething pot of spiritual forces whence, now and then, a bubble rises to the > surface of things.Underhill, E., The Column of Dust, London: Methuen & Co., > 1909 Underhill's novels suggest that perhaps for the mystic, two worlds may be better than one. For her, mystical experience seems inseparable from some kind of enhancement of consciousness or expansion of perceptual and aesthetic horizons‚Äîto see things as they are, in their meanness and insignificance when viewed in opposition to the divine reality, but in their luminosity and grandeur when seen bathed in divine radiance. But at this stage the mystic's mind is subject to fear and insecurity, its powers undeveloped. The first novel takes us only to this point. Further stages demand suffering, because mysticism is more than merely vision or cultivating a latent potentiality of the soul in cosy isolation. According to Underhill's view, the subsequent pain and tension, and final loss of the private painful ego-centered life for the sake of regaining one's true self, has little to do with the first beatific vision. Her two later novels are built on the ideal of total self-surrender even to the apparent sacrifice of the vision itself, as necessary for the fullest possible integration of human life. This was for her the equivalent of working out within, the metaphorical intent of the life story of Jesus. One is reunited with the original vision‚Äîno longer as mere spectator but as part of it. This dimension of self-loss and resurrection is worked out in The Lost Word, but there is some doubt as to its general inevitability. In The Column of Dust, the heroine's physical death reinforces dramatically the mystical death to which she has already surrendered. Two lives are better than one but only on the condition that a process of painful re-integration intervenes to re-establish unity between Self and Reality. All her characters derive their interest from the theological meaning and value which they represent, and it is her ingenious handling of so much difficult symbolic material that makes her work psychologically interesting as a forerunner of such 20th-century writers as Susan Howatch, whose successful novels also embody the psychological value of religious metaphor and the traditions of Christian mysticism. Her first novel received critical acclaim, but her last was generally derided. However, her novels give remarkable insight into what we may assume was her decision to avoid what St. Augustine described as the temptation of fuga in solitudinem (\\"the flight into solitude\\"), but instead acquiescing to a loving, positive acceptance of this world. Not looking back, by this time she was already working on her magnum opus. Writings on religion=Mysticism (1911) Underhill's greatest book, Mysticism: A Study of the Nature and Development of Man's Spiritual Consciousness, was published in 1911, and is distinguished by the very qualities which make it ill-suited as a straightforward textbook. The spirit of the book is romantic, engaged, and theoretical rather than historical or scientific. Underhill has little use for theoretical explanations and the traditional religious experience, formal classifications or analysis. She dismisses William James' pioneering study, The Varieties of Religious Experience (1902), and his \\"four marks of the mystic state\\" (ineffability, noetic quality, transience, and passivity). James had admitted that his own constitution shut him off almost entirely from the enjoyment of mystical states, thus his treatment was purely objective. Underhill substituted (1) mysticism is practical, not theoretical, (2) mysticism is an entirely spiritual activity, (3) the business and method of mysticism is love, and (4) mysticism entails a definite psychological experience. Her insistence on the psychological approach was that it was the glamorous science of the pre-war period, offering the potential key to the secrets of human advances in intelligence, creativity, and genius, and already psychological findings were being applied in theology (i.e., William Sanday's Christologies Ancient and Modern). She divided her subject into two parts: the first, an introduction, and the second, a detailed study of the nature and development of human consciousness. In the first section, in order to free the subject of mysticism from confusion and misapprehension, she approached it from the point of view of the psychologist, the symbolist and the theologian. To separate mysticism from its most dubious connection, she included a chapter on mysticism and magic. At the time, and still today, mysticism is associated with the occult, magic, secret rites, and fanaticism, while she knew the mystics throughout history to be the world's spiritual pioneers. She divided her map of \\"the way\\" into five stages: the first was the \\"Awakening of Self\\". She quotes Henry Suso (disciple of Meister Eckhart): > That which the Servitor saw had no form neither any manner of being; yet he > had of it a joy such as he might have known in the seeing of shapes and > substances of all joyful things. His heart was hungry, yet satisfied, his > soul was full of contentment and joy: his prayers and his hopes were > fulfilled. (Cropper p. 46) Underhill tells how Suso's description of how the abstract truth (related to each soul's true nature and purpose), once remembered, contains the power of fulfilment became the starting point of her own path. The second stage she presents as psychological \\"Purgation of Self\\", quoting the Theologia Germanica (14th century, anonymous) regarding the transcendence of ego (Underhill's \\"little self\\"): > We must cast all things from us and strip ourselves of them and refrain from > claiming anything for our own. The third stage she titles \\"Illumination\\" and quotes William Law: > Everything in ...nature, is descended out that which is eternal, and stands > as a. ..visible outbirth of it, so when we know how to separate out the > grossness, death, and darkness. ..from it, we find. ..it in its eternal > state. The fourth stage she describes as the \\"Dark Night of the Soul\\" (which her correspondence leads us to believe she struggled with throughout her life) wherein one is deprived of all that has been valuable to the lower self, and quoting Mechthild of Magdeburg: > ...since Thou hast taken from me all that I had of Thee, yet of Thy grace > leave me the gift which every dog has by nature: that of being true to Thee > in my distress, when I am deprived of all consolation. This I desire more > fervently than Thy heavenly Kingdom. And last she devotes a chapter to the unitive life, the sum of the mystic way: > When love has carried us above all things into the Divine Dark, there we are > transformed by the Eternal Word Who is the image of the Father; and as the > air is penetrated by the sun, thus we receive in peace the Incomprehensible > Light, enfolding us, and penetrating us. (Ruysbroech) Where Underhill struck new ground was in her insistence that this state of union produced a glorious and fruitful creativeness, so that the mystic who attains this final perfectness is the most active doer ‚Äì not the reclusive dreaming lover of God. > We are all the kindred of the mystics. ..Strange and far away from us though > they seem, they are not cut off from us by some impassable abyss. They > belong to us; the giants, the heroes of our race. As the achievement of > genius belongs not to itself only but also to the society that brought it > forth;...the supernal accomplishment of the mystics is ours also. ..our > guarantee of the end to which immanent love, the hidden steersman. ..is > moving. ..us on the path toward the Real. They come back to us from an > encounter with life's most august secret. ..filled with amazing tidings > which they can hardly tell. We, longing for some assurance. ..urge them to > pass on their revelation. ..the old demand of the dim-sighted and > incredulous. ..But they cannot. ..only fragments of the Symbolic Vision. > According to their strength and passion, these lovers of the Absolute. > ..have not shrunk from the suffering. ..Beauty and agony have called. ..have > awakened a heroic response. For them the winter is over. ..Life new, > unquenchable and lovely comes to meet them with the dawn. (Cropper, p. 47) The book ends with an extremely valuable appendix, a kind of who's who of mysticism, which shows its persistence and interconnection from century to century. Ruysbroeck (1914) A work by Evelyn Underhill, on the 14th- century Flemish mystic Jan van Ruusbroec (1293‚Äì1381), entitled Ruysbroeck was published in London in 1914.By G. Bell & Sons; since reprinted [no date, circa 2003] by Kessinger Publishing. She had discussed him from several different perspectives during the course of her 1911 book on Mysticism. I. Life. She starts with a biography, drawn mainly from two near-contemporary works on his life, each written by a fellow monastic: Pomerius,Canon Henricus Pomerius was prior of the monastery where Ruysbroeck resided, but two generations later; he spoke with several of those who had known Ruysbroeck well [pages 5‚Äì6] and may have based his history on the work of a contemporary of Ruysbroek. and Gerard Naghel.Gerard Naghel was a contemporary and a close friend of Ruysbroeck, as well as being the neighboring prior; he wrote a shorter work about his life [6]. His childhood was spent in the village of Ruysbroeck. [page 7] At eleven he ran away to Brussels, where he began to live with his uncle, John Hinckaert, a Canon at the Cathedral of St. Gudule, and a younger Canon, Francis van Coudenberg. [10] At twenty-four he was ordained a priest and became a prebend at St. Gudule. [12] At his first mass he envisioned his mother's spirit released from Purgatory and entering Heaven. [15] From age 26 to 50 Ruysbroeck was a cathedral chaplain at St. Gudule. [15] Although he \\"seemed a nobody to those who did not know him\\", he was developing a strong spiritual life, \\"a penetrating intellect, a fearless heart, deep knowledge of human nature, remarkable powers of expression\\". [17] At one point he wrote strong pamphlets and led a campaign against a heretical group, the Brethren of the Free Spirit led by Bloemardinne, who practiced a self-indulgent \\"mysticality\\". [18‚Äì20] Later, with the two now elderly Canons, he moved into the countryside at Groenendael (\\"Green Valley\\"). [21‚Äì22] Pomerius writes that he retired not to hide his light \\"but that he might tend it better\\" [22]. Five years later their community became a Priory under the Augustinian Canons. [23] Many of his works were written during this period, often drawing lessons from nature. [24] He had a favorite tree under which he would sit and write what the 'Spirit' gave to him. [25] He solemnly affirmed that his works were composed under the \\"domination of an inspiring power\\", writes Underhill. [26] Pomerius says that Ruysbroeck could enter a state of contemplation in which he appeared surrounded by radiant light. [26‚Äì27] Alongside his spiritual ascent, Naghel says, he cultivated the friendship of those around him, enriching their lives. [27‚Äì28] He worked in the garden fields of the priory, and sought to help out creatures of the forest. [29‚Äì30] He moved from the senses to the transcendent without frontiers or cleavage, Underhill writes, these being for him \\"but two moods within the mind of God\\". [30] He counseled many who came to him, including Gerard Groot of the Brothers of the Common Life. [31] His advice would plumb the \\"purity and direction\\" of the seeker's will, and the seeker's love. [32] There, at Groenendael, he finally made a \\"leap to a more abundant life\\". [34] In The Sparkling Stone Ruysbroeck wrote about coming to know the love \\"which giveth more than one can take, and asketh more than one can pay\\". [34] II. Works. Next, Underhill gives a bibliography of Ruysbroeck's eleven admittedly authentic works, providing details concerning each work's origin, nature, and contents, as well as their place in his writings. 1. The Spiritual Tabernacle; 2. The Twelve Points of True Faith; 3. The Book of the Four Temptations; 4. The Book of the Kingdom of God's Lovers; 5. The Adornment of the Spiritual Marriage;Also known as The Spiritual Espousals (e.g., Wiseman's translation in his John Ruusbroec (Paulist Press 1985); it is \\"the best known\\" of Ruysbroeck's works. [42]. 6. The Mirror of Eternal Salvation or Book of the Blessed Sacraments; 7. The Seven Cloisters; 8. The Seven Degrees of the Ladder of Love; 9. The Book of the Sparkling Stone; 10. The Book of the Supreme Truth; 11. The Twelve B√©guines. [36‚Äì51] III. Doctrine of God. Several types of mystics are described. The first (e.g., St. Teresa) deals with personal psychological experiences and emotional reactions, leaving the nature of God to existing theology. [page 52] The second (e.g., Plotinus) has passion sprung from the vision of a philosopher; the intellect often is more active than the heart, yet like a poet such a mystic strives to sketch his vision of the Ultimate. [53] The greatest mystics (e.g., St. Augustine) embrace at once \\"the infinite and the intimate\\" so that \\"God is both near and far, and the paradox of transcendent-immanent Reality is a self-evident if an inexpressible truth.\\" Such mystics \\"give us by turns a subjective and psychological, an objective and metaphysical, reading of spiritual experience.\\" Here is Ruysbroeck. [53‚Äì54] An apostolic mystic [55] represents humanity in its quest to discern the Divine Reality, she writes, being like \\"the artist extending our universe, the pioneer cutting our path, the hunter winning food for our souls.\\" [56] Yet, although his experience is personal, his language is often drawn from tradition. [57] His words about an ineffable Nature of God, \\"a dim silence, and a wild desert,\\" may be suggestive, musical, she writes, \\"which enchant rather than inform the soul\\". [58] Ruysbroeck goes venturing \\"to hover over that Abyss which is 'beyond Reason,' stammering and breaking into wild poetry in the desperate attempt to seize the unseizable truth.\\" [55] \\"[T]he One is 'neither This nor That'.\\" [61] \\"God as known by man\\" is the Absolute One who combines and resolves the contradictory natures of time and eternity, becoming and being; who is both transcendent and immanent, abstract and personal, work and rest, the unmoved mover and movement itself. God is above the storm, yet inspires the flux. [59‚Äì60] The \\"omnipotent and ever-active Creator\\" who is \\"perpetually breathing forth His energetic Life in new births of being and new floods of grace.\\" [60] Yet the soul may persist, go beyond this fruitful nature,\\"Fruition is one of the master-words of Ruysbroeck's thought,\\" she observes. [page 59] Later she more fully discusses it, at [89]. into the simple essence of God. There we humans would find that \\"absolute and abiding Reality, which seems to man Eternal Rest, the 'Deep Quiet of the Godhead,' the 'Abyss,' the 'Dim Silence'; and which we can taste indeed but never know. There, 'all lovers lose themselves'.\\" [60] The Trinity, according to Ruysbroeck, works in living distinctions, \\"the fruitful nature of the Persons.\\" [61] The Trinity in itself is a Unity, yet a manifestation of the active and creative Divine, a Union of Three Persons, which is the Godhead. [60‚Äì61]Here, she comments, Ruysbroeck parallels the Hindu mystics, the Christian Neoplatonists, and Meister Eckhart. [61] Beyond and within the Trinity, or the Godhead, then, is the \\"fathomless Abyss\\" [60] that is the \\"Simple Being of God\\" that is \\"an Eternal Rest of God and of all created things.\\" [61]She quotes from The Twelve B√©guines at cap. xiv. The Father is the unconditioned Origin, Strength and Power, of all things. [62] The Son is the Eternal Word and Wisdom that shines forth in the world of conditions. [62] The Holy Spirit is Love and Generosity emanating from the mutual contemplation of Father and Son. [62]\\"[F]or these two Persons are always hungry for love,\\" she adds, quoting The Spiritual Marriage, lib. ii at cap. xxxvii. The Three Persons \\"exist in an eternal distinction [emphasis added] for that world of conditions wherein the human soul is immersed\\". [63] By the acts of the Three Persons all created things are born; by the incarnation and crucifixion we human souls are adorned with love, and so to be drawn back to our Source. \\"This is the circling course of the Divine life-process.\\" [63] But beyond and above this eternal distinction lies \\"the superessential world, transcending all conditions, inaccessible to thought-- 'the measureless solitude of the Godhead, where God possesses Himself in joy.' This is the ultimate world of the mystic.\\" [63‚Äì64] There, she continues, quoting Ruysbroeck: > \\"[W]e can speak no more of Father, Son and Holy Spirit nor of any creature; > but only of one Being, which is the very substance of the Divine Persons. > There were we all one before our creation; for this is our superessence... . > There the Godhead is, in simple essence, without activity; Eternal Rest, > Unconditioned Dark, the Nameless Being, the Superessence of all created > things, and the simple and infinite Bliss of God and of all the Saints.\\" > [64]She gives her source as The Seven Degrees of Love at cap. xiv. \\"The simple light of this Being... includes and embraces the unity of the Divine Persons and the soul... .\\" It envelopes and irradiates the ground (movement) of human souls and the fruition of their adherence to God, finding union in the Divine life-process, the Rose. \\"And this is the union of God and the souls that love Him.\\" [64‚Äì65]She quotes from The Kingdom of God's Lovers at cap. xxix. IV. Doctrine of Humankind. For Ruysbroeck, \\"God is the 'Living Pattern of Creation' who has impressed His image on each soul, and in every adult spirit the character of that image must be brought from the hiddenness and realized.\\" [66]Evelyn Underhill here refers to Julian of Norwich and quotes her phrase on the human soul being \\"made Trinity, like to the unmade Blessed Trinity.\\" Then our author makes the comparison of Ruysbroeck's uncreated Pattern of humankind to an archetype, and to a Platonic Idea. [68]. The pattern is trinitarian; there are three properties of the human soul. First, resembling the Father, \\"the bare, still place to which consciousness retreats in introversion... .\\" [67] Second, following the Son, \\"the power of knowing Divine things by intuitive comprehension: man's fragmentary share in the character of the Logos, or Wisdom of God.\\" [67‚Äì68] \\"The third property we call the spark of the soul. It is the inward and natural tendency of the soul towards its Source; and here do we receive the Holy Spirit, the Charity of God.\\" [68].Here she quotes The Mirror of Eternal Salvation at cap. viii. Cf., [70]. So will God work within the human being; in later spiritual development we may form with God a Union, and eventually a Unity. [70‚Äì71]She quotes Ruysbroeck, The Book of Truth at cap. xi, \\"[T]his union is in God, through grace and our homeward-tending love. Yet even here does the creature feel a distinction and otherness between itself and God in its inward ground.\\" [71]. The mighty force of Love is the 'very self-hood of God' in this mysterious communion. [72, 73] \\"As we lay hold upon the Divine Life, devour and assimilate it, so in that very act the Divine Life devours us, and knits us up into the mystical Body,\\" she writes. \\"It is the nature of love,\\" says Ruysbroeck, \\"ever to give and to take, to love and be loved, and these two things meet in whomsoever loves. Thus the love of Christ is both avid and generous... as He devours us, so He would feed us. If He absorbs us utterly into Himself, in return He gives us His very self again.\\" [75‚Äì76]Quoting The Mirror of Eternal Salvation at cap. vii. She refers here to St. Francis of Assisi. \\"Hungry love,\\" \\"generous love,\\" \\"stormy love\\" touches the human soul with its Divine creative energy and, once we become conscious of it, evokes in us an answering storm of love. \\"The whole of our human growth within the spiritual order is conditioned by the quality of this response; by the will, the industry, the courage, with which [we accept our] part in the Divine give- and-take.\\" [74] As Ruysbroeck puts it: > That measureless Love which is God Himself, dwells in the pure deeps of our > spirit, like a burning brazier of coal. And it throws forth brilliant and > fiery sparks which stir and enkindle heart and senses, will and desire, and > all the powers of the soul, with a fire of love; a storm, a rage, a > measureless fury of love. These be the weapons with which we fight against > the terrible and immense Love of God, who would consume all loving spirits > and swallow them in Himself. Love arms us with its own gifts, and clarifies > our reason, and commands, counsels and advises us to oppose Him, to fight > against Him, and to maintain against Him our right to love, so long as we > may. [74‚Äì75]She again quotes from The Mirror of Eternal Salvation at cap. > xvii. The drama of this giving and receiving Love constitutes a single act, for God is as an \\"ocean which ebbs and flows\\" or as an \\"inbreathing and outbreathing\\". [75, 76] \\"Love is a unifying power, manifested in motion itself, 'an outgoing attraction, which drags us out of ourselves and calls us to be melted and naughted in the Unity'; and all his deepest thoughts of it are expressed in terms of movement.\\" [76]Ruysbroeck, The Sparkling Stone at cap. x: quoted. Next, the spiritual development of the soul is addressed. [76‚Äì88] Ruysbroeck adumbrates how one may progress from the Active life, to the Interior life, to the Superessential life; these correspond to the three natural orders of Becoming, Being, and God, or to the three r√¥les of the Servant, the Friend, and the \\"hidden child\\" of God. [77, 85] The Active life focuses on ethics, on conforming the self's daily life to the Will of God, and takes place in the world of the senses, \\"by means\\". [78] The Interior life embraces a vision of spiritual reality, where the self's contacts with the Divine take place \\"without means\\". [78] The Superessential life transcends the intellectual plane, whereby the self does not merely behold, but rather has fruition of the Godhead in life and in love, at work and at rest, in union and in bliss. [78, 86, 87]Re the Superessential life, citing The Twelve B√©guines at cap. xiii [86]; and, The Seven Degrees of Love at cap. xiv [87]. The analogy with the traditional threefold way of Purgation, Illumination, and Union, is not exact. The Interior life of Ruysbroeck contains aspects of the traditional Union also, while the Superessential life \\"takes the soul to heights of fruition which few amongst even the greatest unitive mystics have attained or described.\\" [78‚Äì79] At the end of her chapter IV, she discusses \\"certain key- words frequent in Ruysbroeck's works,\\" e.g., 'Fruition' [89], 'Simple' [89‚Äì90], 'Bareness' or 'Nudity' [90], and \\"the great pair of opposites, fundamental to his thought, called in the Flemish vernacular Wise and Onwise.\\" [91‚Äì93]These opposites are variously translated into English, Underhill sometimes favoring \\"in some wise\\" and \\"in no wise\\" or \\"conditioned' and \\"unconditioned\\" or \\"somehow\\" and \\"nohow\\". That is, the second opposite Onwise she gives it translated as no wise [93]. Cf., \\"Superessential\\" [85 & 86‚Äì87; 90‚Äì91]. The Wise can be understood by the \\"normal man [living] within the temporal order\\" by use of \\"his ordinary mental furniture\\". [91] Yet regarding the Onwise he has \\"escaped alike from the tyrannies and comforts of the world\\" and made the \\"ascent into the Nought\\". [92]Ruysbroeck, The Twelve B√™guines at cap. xii. She comments, \\"This is the direct, unmediated world of spiritual intuition; where the self touches a Reality that has not been passed through the filters of sense and thought.\\" [92] After a short quote from JalƒÅlu'ddƒ´n, she completes her chapter by presenting eighteen lines from Ruysbroeck's The Twelve B√™guines (cap. viii) which concern Contemplation: > :Contemplation is a knowing that is in no wise ... :Never can it sink down > into the Reason, :And above it can the Reason never climb. ... :It is not > God, :But it is the Light by which we see Him. :Those who walk in the Divine > Light of it :Discover in themselves the Unwalled. :That which is in no wise, > is above Reason, not without it ... :The contemplative life is without > amazement. :That which is in no wise sees, it knows not what; :For it is > above all, and is neither This nor That. [93] V, VI, VII, VIII. In her last four chapters, Underhill continues her discussion of Ruysbroeck, describing the Active Life [94‚Äì114], the Interior Life (Illumination and Destitution [115‚Äì135], Union and Contemplation [136‚Äì163]), and the Superessential Life [164‚Äì185].As mentioned, Underhill earlier addressed how Ruysbroeck distinguishes the Active, Interior, and Superessential at pages 76‚Äì88 in her book. \\"The Mysticism of Plotinus\\" (1919) An essay originally published in The Quarterly Review (1919),QR (1919) at 479‚Äì497. and later collected in The Essentials of Mysticism and other essays (London: J. M. Dent 1920) at pp. 116‚Äì140.Recently offprinted by Kessinger Publishing as The Mysticism of Plotinus (2005), 48 pages. Underhill here addresses Plotinus (204‚Äì270) of Alexandria and later of Rome. A Neoplatonist as well as a spiritual guide, Plotinus writes regarding both formal philosophy and hands-on, personal, inner experience. Underhill makes the distinction between the geographer who draws maps of the mind, and the seeker who actually travels in the realms of spirit. [page 118] She observes that usually mystics do not follow the mere maps of metaphysicians. [page 117] In the Enneads Plotinus presents the Divine as an unequal triune, in descending order: (a) the One, perfection, having nothing, seeking nothing, needing nothing, yet it overflows creatively, the source of being; [121] (b) the emitted Nous or Spirit, with intelligence, wisdom, poetic intuition, the \\"Father and Companion\\" of the soul; [121‚Äì122] and, (c) the emitted Soul or Life, the vital essence of the world, which aspires to communion with the Spirit above, while also directly engaged with the physical world beneath. [123] People \\"come forth from God\\" and will find happiness once re-united, first with the Nous, later with the One. [125] Such might be the merely logical outcome for the metaphysician, yet Plotinus the seeker also presents this return to the Divine as a series of moral purgations and a shedding of irrational delusions, leading eventually to entry into the intuitively beautiful. [126] This intellectual and moral path toward a life aesthetic will progressively disclose an invisible source, the Nous, the forms of Beauty. [127] Love is the prevailing inspiration, although the One is impersonal. [128] The mystic will pass through stages of purification, and of enlightenment, resulting in a shift in the center of our being \\"from sense to soul, from soul to spirit,\\" in preparation for an ultimate transformation of consciousness. [125, 127] Upon our arrival, we shall know ecstasy and \\"no longer sing out of tune, but form a divine chorus round the One.\\" [129] St. Augustine (354‚Äì430) criticizes such Neoplatonism as neglecting the needs of struggling and imperfect human beings. The One of Plotinus may act as a magnet for the human soul, but it cannot be said to show mercy, nor to help, or love, or redeem the individual on earth. [130] Other western mystics writing on the Neoplatonists mention this lack of \\"mutual attraction\\" between humanity and the unconscious, unknowable One. [130‚Äì131] In this regard Julian of Norwich (1342‚Äì1416) would write, \\"Our natural will is to have God, and the good-will of God is to have us.\\" [130] Plotinus leaves the problem of evil unresolved, but having no place in the blissful life; here, the social, ethical side of religion seems to be shorted. His philosophy does not include qualities comparable to the Gospel's divine \\"transfiguration of pain\\" through Jesus. [131] Plotinus \\"the self-sufficient sage\\" does not teach us charity, writes St. Augustine. [132] Nonetheless, Underhill notes, Plotinus and Neoplatonism were very influential among the mystics of Christianity (and Islam). St. Augustine the Church Father was himself deeply affected by Plotinus, and through him the western Church. [133‚Äì135, 137] So, too, was Dionysius (5th century, Syria), whose writings would also prove very influential. [133, 135] As well were others, e.g., Erigena [135], Dante [136], Ruysbroeck [136, 138], Eckhart [138], and Boehme [139]. Worship (1936) In her preface,Evelyn Underhill, Worship (New York: Harper and Brothers 1936; reprint Harper Torchbook 1957) pp. vii‚Äìx. the author disclaims being \\"a liturgical expert\\". Neither is it her purpose to offer criticism of the different approaches to worship as practiced by the various religious bodies. Rather she endeavors to show \\"the love that has gone to their adornment [and] the shelter they can offer to many different kinds of adoring souls.\\" She begins chapter one by declaring that \\"Worship, in all its grades and kinds, is the response of the creature to the Eternal: nor need we limit this definition to the human sphere. ...we may think of the whole of the Universe, seen and unseen, conscious and unconscious, as an act of worship.\\" The chapter headings give an indication of its contents. Part I: 1. The Nature of Worship, 2. Ritual and Symbol, 3. Sacrament and Sacrifice, 4. The Character of Christian Worship, 5. Principles of Corporate Worship, 6. Liturgical Elements in Worship, 7. The Holy Eucharist: Its Nature, 8. The Holy Eucharist: Its Significance, 9. The Principles of Personal Worship. Part II: 10. Jewish Worship, 11. The Beginnings of Christian Worship, 12. Catholic Worship: Western and Eastern, 13. Worship in the Reformed Churches, 14. Free Church Worship, 15. The Anglican Tradition. Conclusion. Influences Underhill's life was greatly affected by her husband's resistance to her joining the Catholic Church to which she was powerfully drawn. At first she believed it to be only a delay in her decision, but it proved to be lifelong. He was, however, a writer himself and was supportive of her writing both before and after their marriage in 1907, though he did not share her spiritual affinities. Her fiction was written in the six years between 1903‚Äì1909 and represents her four major interests of that general period: philosophy (neoplatonism), theism/mysticism, the Roman Catholic liturgy, and human love/compassion.name=\\"Armstrong, C.J.R.\\" In her earlier writings Underhill often wrote using the terms \\"mysticism\\" and \\"mystics\\" but later began to adopt the terms \\"spirituality\\" and \\"saints\\" because she felt they were less threatening. She was often criticized for believing that the mystical life should be accessible to the average person. Her fiction was also influenced by the literary creed expounded by her close friend Arthur Machen, mainly his Hieroglyphics of 1902, summarised by his biographer: > There are certain truths about the universe and its constitution ‚Äì as > distinct from the particular things in it that come before our observation ‚Äì > which cannot be grasped by human reason or expressed in precise words: but > they can be apprehended by some people at least, in a semi-mystical > experience, called ecstasy, and a work of art is great insofar as this > experience is caught and expressed in it. Because, however, the truths > concerned transcend a language attuned to the description of material > objects, the expression can only be through hieroglyphics, and it is of such > hieroglyphics that literature consists. In Underhill's case the quest for psychological realism is subordinate to larger metaphysical considerations which she shared with Arthur Machen. Incorporating the Holy Grail into their fiction (stimulated perhaps by their association with Arthur Waite and his affiliation with the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn), for Machen the Holy Grail was perhaps \\"the\\" hieroglyph, \\"the\\" crystallisation in one sacred emblem of all man's transcendental yearning, \\"the\\" gateway to vision and lasting appeasement of his discontents, while for her it was the center of atonement-linked meanings as she pointed out to Margaret Robinson in a letter responding to Robinson's criticism of Underhill's last novel: > Don't marvel at your own temerity in criticising. Why should you? Of course, > this thing wasn't written for you ‚Äì I never write for anyone at all, except > in letters of direction! But, I take leave to think the doctrine contained > in it is one you'll have to assimilate sooner or later and which won't do > you any harm. It's not \\"mine\\" you know. You will find it all in Eckhart. ... > They all know, as Richard of St Victor said, that the Fire of Love \\"burns.\\" > We have not fulfilled our destiny when we have sat down at a safe distance > from it, purring like overfed cats, 'suffering is the ancient law of love' ‚Äì > and its highest pleasure into the bargain, oddly enough. ... A sponge cake > and milk religion is neither true to this world nor to the next. As for the > Christ being too august a word for our little hardships ‚Äì I think it is > truer that it is \\"so\\" august as to give our little hardships a tincture of > Royalty once we try them up into it.

For most of us don't get a chance \\"but\\" the humble and ordinary: and > He came that we might all have life more abundantly, according to our > measure. There that's all!Armstrong, C. J.

Mowbray & Co., 1975 Two contemporary philosophical writers dominated Underhill's thinking at the time she wrote \\"Mysticism\\": Rudolf Eucken and Henri Bergson. While neither displayed an interest in mysticism, both seemed to their disciples to advance a spiritual explanation of the universe. Also, she describes the fashionable creed of the time as \\"vitalism\\" and the term adequately sums up the prevailing worship of life in all its exuberance, variety and limitless possibility which pervaded pre-war culture and society. For her, Eucken and Bergson confirmed the deepest intuitions of the mystics. (Armstrong, Evelyn Underhill) Among the mystics, Ruysbroeck was to her the most influential and satisfying of all the medieval mystics, and she found herself very much at one with him in the years when he was working as an unknown priest in Brussels, for she herself had also a hidden side. > His career which covers the greater part of the fourteenth century, that > golden age of Christian Mysticism, seems to exhibit within the circle of a > single personality, and carry up to a higher term than ever before, all the > best attainments of the Middle Ages in the realm of Eternal life. The > central doctrine of the Divine Fatherhood, and of the soul's power to become > the Son of God, it is this raised to the nth degree of intensity...and > demonstrated with the exactitude of the mathematician, and the passion of a > poet, which Ruysbroeck gives us...the ninth and tenth chapters of The > Sparkling Stone the high water mark of mystical literature. Nowhere else do > we find such a combination of soaring vision with the most delicate and > intimate psychological analysis. The old Mystic sitting under his tree, > seems here to be gazing at and reporting to us the final secrets of that > Eternal World... (Cropper, p. 57) One of her most significant influences and important collaborations was with the Nobel Laureate, Rabindranath Tagore, the Indian mystic, author, and world traveler. They published a major translation of the work of Kabir (100 Poems of Kabir, calling Songs of Kabir) together in 1915, to which she wrote the introduction. He introduced her to the spiritual genius of India which she expressed enthusiastically in a letter: > This is the first time I have had the privilege of being with one who is a > Master in the things I care so much about but know so little of as yet: & I > understand now something of what your writers mean when they insist on the > necessity and value of the personal teacher and the fact that he gives > something which the learner cannot get in any other way. It has been like > hearing the language of which I barely know the alphabet, spoken > perfectly.(Letters) They did not keep up their correspondence in later years. Both suffered debilitating illnesses in the last year of life and died in the summer of 1941, greatly distressed by the outbreak of World War II. Evelyn in 1921 was to all outward appearances, in an assured and enviable position. She had been asked by the University of Oxford to give the first of a new series of lectures on religion, and she was the first woman to have such an honour. She was an authority on her own subject of mysticism and respected for her research and scholarship. Her writing was in demand, and she had an interesting and notable set of friends, devoted readers, a happy marriage and affectionate and loyal parents. At the same time she felt that her foundations were insecure and that her zeal for Reality was resting on a basis that was too fragile. By 1939, she was a member of the Anglican Pacifist Fellowship, writing a number of important tracts expressing her anti-war sentiment. After returning to the Anglican Church, and perhaps overwhelmed by her knowledge of the achievements of the mystics and their perilous heights, her ten-year friendship with Catholic philosopher and writer Baron Friedrich von H√ºgel turned into one of spiritual direction. Charles Williams wrote in his introduction to her Letters: 'The equal swaying level of devotion and scepticism (related to the church) which is, for some souls, as much the Way as continuous simple faith is to others, was a distress to her...She wanted to be \\"sure.\\" Writing to Von H√ºgel of the darkness she struggled with: > What ought I to do?...being naturally self-indulgent and at present > unfortunately professionally very prosperous and petted, nothing will get > done unless I make a Rule. Neither intellectual work nor religion give me > any real discipline because I have a strong attachment to both. ..it is > useless advising anything people could notice or that would look pious. That > is beyond me. In my lucid moments I see only too clearly that the only > possible end of this road is complete, unconditional self-consecration, and > for this I have not the nerve, the character or the depth. There has been > some sort of mistake. My soul is too small for it and yet it is at bottom > the only thing that I really want. It feels sometimes as if, whilst still a > jumble of conflicting impulses and violent faults I were being pushed from > behind towards an edge I dare not jump over.\\"Cropper, Margaret, Life of > Evelyn Underhill, Harper & Brothers, 1958 In a later letter of 12 July the Baron's practical concerns for signs of strain in Evelyn's spiritual state are expressed. His comments give insight into her struggles: > I do not at all like this craving for absolute certainty that this or that > experience of yours, is what it seems to yourself. And I am assuredly not > going to declare that I am absolutely certain of the final and evidential > worth of any of those experiences. They are not articles of faith. .. You > are at times tempted to scepticism and so you long to have some, if only one > direct personal experience which shall be beyond the reach of all reasonable > doubt. But such an escape. ..would ...possibly be a most dangerous one, and > would only weaken you, or shrivel you, or puff you up. By all > means...believe them, if and when they humble and yet brace you, to be > probably from God. But do not build your faith upon them; do not make them > an end when they exist only to be a means...I am not sure that God does want > a marked preponderance of this or that work or virtue in our life ‚Äì that > would feed still further your natural temperament, already too vehement. > (Cropper biography) Although Underhill continued to struggle to the end, craving certainty that her beatific visions were purposeful, suffering as only a pacifist can from the devastating onslaught of World War II and the Church's powerlessness to affect events, she may well have played a powerful part in the survival of her country through the influence of her words and the impact of her teachings on thousands regarding the power of prayer. Surviving the London Blitz of 1940, her health disintegrated further and she died in the following year. She is buried with her husband in the churchyard extension at St John-at-Hampstead in London. More than any other person, she was responsible for introducing the forgotten authors of medieval and Catholic spirituality to a largely Protestant audience and the lives of eastern mystics to the English-speaking world. As a frequent guest on radio, her 1936 work The Spiritual Life was especially influential as transcribed from a series of broadcasts given as a sequel to those by Dom Bernard Clements on the subject of prayer. Fellow theologian Charles Williams wrote the introduction to her published Letters in 1943, which reveal much about this prodigious woman. Upon her death, The Times reported that on the subject of theology, she was \\"unmatched by any of the professional teachers of her day.\\" Veneration Since 2000, the Church of England commemorates Underhill liturgically on 15 June. She is also honoured with a feast day in the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) on 15 June. Publications=Poetry *The Bar-Lamb's Ballad Book (1902). Online *Immanence (1916).

Katahdin was outfitted as a gunboat with cannon and rifled gun for blockade duty and two howitzers for shore bombardment.  Built in Bath, Maine, in 1861  The \\"90-day gunboat\\" was launched by Larrabee & Allen of Bath, Maine, 12 October 1861, and commissioned at Boston Navy Yard 17 February 1862, Lieutenant George Henry Preble in command.  Civil War service = Assigned to the West Gulf blockade  Katahdin was assigned to the West Gulf Blockading Squadron to bolster its strength as Flag Officer David Farragut prepared for his epochal attack on New Orleans. After entering the Mississippi River early in April, Katahdin assisted Farragut in his unprecedented effort to work the squadron's deep-draft, salt-water ships across the bar into the river. On 16 April she moved up the river with the fleet to a position below Fort Jackson and Fort St. Philip guarding the approaches to New Orleans with over 100 guns. The next morning a Confederate steamer came down and fired at the fleet; but, when Katahdin's guns answered briskly the Southern ship retired out of range. The following day the mortar flotilla opened an intensive bombardment of the forts which continued intermittently for the next six days until it reached a mighty crescendo in the small hours of 24 April as the Union fleet got underway and headed up the river toward the forts.  Racing past Forts Jackson and St. Philip  Half an hour later, when the Confederate guns opened fire, Katahdin steamed steadily ahead, replying with all her guns. Only two rounds struck the gunboat during the dash, one damaging the foremast and the other the smokestack. After passing the forts and sailing beyond the range of their artillery, the Union ships anchored opposite Quarantine abreast a Confederate encampment which raised a white flag. During the morning she collected ordnance surrendered by Confederate troops ashore. The next day she proceeded up the river firing on and silencing Southern batteries on both banks. The afternoon, upon arriving New Orleans, Louisiana, with the fleet, she captured schooner John Gilpin with a cargo of cotton.  Lower Mississippi River operations  Katahdin operated in the vicinity of New Orleans until 16 May when she got underway up river to join the squadron, which had proceeded her to Vicksburg, Mississippi. While moving up stream, she gathered valuable information about conditions in the Mississippi valley; and, throughout Farragut's operations above Vicksburg, she continued to perform reconnaissance missions as she convoyed vessels which supplied the force at Vicksburg from New Orleans. In July, when Farragut withdrew from the Mississippi River to attend to his blockaders in the gulf, he left Katahdin in the river with Essex, Sumter, and Kineo to protect Army units in the area and to police the river. During much of this time Katahdin was stationed at Baton Rouge. On 5 August Confederates attacked the Union encampment at Baton Rouge in force. The gunboats supported the badly outnumbered Northern soldiers enabling them to repulse the attack. Then they fired over the town into the Confederate camp, forcing them to withdraw out of range. The next morning Kineo and Katahdin guarded the right flank of the Union Army while Essex and Cayuga got underway to engage ironclad ram CSS Arkansas. However, as the Union warships were closing on Arkansas, the ram's engines failed leaving her unable to flee or fight; she was set afire by her officers and abandoned before she blew up. For the next fortnight the threat of an attack kept the ships constantly on the alert to protect the troops which depended upon naval fire support. Finally, upon orders from General Butler, the Union Army evacuated Baton Rouge 21 August. Just before embarking the troops, the gunboats beat off an attack on the Union pickets with rapid and heavy fire. Katahdin brought up the rear as the ships steamed to New Orleans, where they arrived the following morning.  Supporting Union troops at Donaldsonville  After repairs at New Orleans, the gunboat stood up the river 5 September with Kineo and Scioto scouring the banks for information. With Itasca she covered the landing of Army troops 22 September at Donaldsonville, Louisiana. While the expedition was ashore, the gunboats protected them; and, shortly before the soldiers reembarked, naval gunfire beat back a Southern attack which threatened to cut off the landing party. This support prevented annihilation of the landing party by vastly superior forces and enabled it to retreat to Laurel Hill for passage to safety in New Orleans.  Capturing a large herd of cattle  In the months that followed, the gunboats constantly patrolled the river to protect Union communications, to gather information on Confederate activity, and to cut the flow across the Mississippi River of food and men to Confederate armies in the East. With 3 other gunboats Katahdin intercepted a drove of some 1,500 cattle from Texas and loaded them on transports for passage to New Orleans. The value of this beef to the South can be attested by the fact that, four miles below Donaldsonville, about 3,000 infantrymen supported by nine field pieces struck back at the ships in a desperate attempt to recapture the cattle. The gunboats opened promptly and in about 20 minute drove the Confederates from their position. The months that followed were a period of constant stress and peril for the gunboats. \\"We are constantly under fire ... as we pass up and down the river,\\" Lt. Roe, the commanding officer of Katahdin, reported. > Our fighting is a savage Indian warfare. The troops and guns are concealed, > and watch for us as we pass along and fire and flee.  Blockading the Texas coast  In January 1863 Katahdin was ordered to reinforce the blockade off Galveston, Texas after that port had been recaptured by the Confederacy on New Year's Day. While serving in the Gulf off the Texas coast, Katahdin and Owasco chased, captured, and burned blockade running schooner Hanover 10 May 1863. She captured schooner Excelsior 13 July off San Luis Pass, Texas. Thereafter Katahdin continued to serve in the blockade of the Texas coast, cutting off supplies sorely needed by the Confederates. On 30 April 1864 she chased the former revenue cutter Harriet Lane and steamer Alice as they escaped from Galveston; but, after a brisk and lengthy race, Katahdin was finally outdistanced. She was more successful 31 October when the gunboat overtook Albert Edward as the British schooner tried to slip out of the same port with a cargo of cotton.  Post-war decommissioning  After the Confederate collapse in April 1865, the veteran gunboat returned north and decommissioned 14 July 1865. Katahdin was sold at New York City 30 November and documented as Juno 20 October 1866. ReferencesExternal links * USS Katahdin images, Naval History and Heritage Command website.

Population: History A local tradition dates the town's origins to 937. It was first documented in 1148 as Ugliche Pole (Corner Field). The town's name is thought to allude to the nearby turn in the Volga River, and is derived from the Russian word ugol (a corner, a nook). From 1218 until 1328, Uglich was the seat of a small princedom. At that time, the local princes sold their rights to the great prince of Moscow. Uglich was a border town of the Grand Duchy of Moscow, and it was burned several times in conflicts by Lithuanians, Tatars, and the grand prince of Tver. Grand Duke Ivan III of Moscow gave the town in 1462 to his younger brother Andrey Bolshoy (Andrey the Great). During Andrey's reign, the town was expanded and the first stone buildings were constructed. Particularly notable were the cathedral (rebuilt in 1713), the Intercession Monastery (destroyed by the Bolsheviks in the early 20th century Revolution), and the red-brick palace of the prince (completed in 1481 and still standing). Reign of Ivan the Terrible During the reign of Ivan the Terrible, the town passed to his only brother, Yury. Local inhabitants helped the Tsar capture the city of Kazan by building a wooden fortress that was transported via the Volga all the way to Kazan. Throughout the 16th century, Uglich prospered both politically and economically, but thereafter its fortunes began to decline. Death of Tsarevich Dmitry After Ivan's death, his youngest son Dmitry Ivanovich was banished to Uglich in 1584. The most well-known event in the town's history took place on May 15, 1591 when the 10-year-old boy was found dead with his throat cut in the palace courtyard. Suspicion immediately fell on the tsar's chief advisor, Boris Godunov. Official investigators concluded, however, that Dimitriy's death was an accident. They cut a \\"tongue\\" from the cathedral bell that rang the news of Dimitriy's death and \\"exiled\\" it to Siberia. Exiled bells of Uglich in Tobolsk, 1885 The Monastery of St. Alexis (1620s) As Dimitry was the last scion of the ancient Rurik Dynasty, his death precipitated the dynastic and political crisis known as the Time of Troubles. People readily believed that Dmitry was alive and supported several False Dmitrys (see False Dmitry I, False Dmitry II, False Dmitry III), who each tried to grab the Muscovite throne. During the Time of Troubles, Poles besieged the Alexeievsky and Uleima monasteries and burned them down, killing all the populace who had sought refuge inside. The Romanov Tsars quickly arranged to canonize the martyred Tsesarevich and to designate Uglich as a place of pilgrimage. On the spot where Dimitry was thought to have been murdered, the city in 1690 built a small Church of St. Demetrios on the Blood. Its red walls and blue domes are visible as travelers go north on the Volga. The palace where the prince lived was turned into a museum. The image of Tsesarevich with a knife in his hand was adopted as the town's coat of arms. Later history In the first third of the 18th century, the kremlin cathedral and its remarkable bell tower were demolished and rebuilt. Other 18th-century landmarks include the Smolenskaya, Korsunskaya, Kazanskaya and Bogoyavlenskaya churches. The most important edifice of the 19th century is the cathedral of the Theophany Convent, consecrated in 1853. Church of the Theotokos of Kazan (1777) Infrastructure improvements included a railway station, connecting residents to transportation via other routes than the river. A watch manufacturing plant operated in the 20th-century town, making Chaika watches; this has since closed. A hydroelectric power station was built under Stalin's reign to generate power from the Volga. But development of the dam and Uglich Reservoir resulted in severe flooding of the town's outskirts. In November 2008 the Nexans cable mill opened. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Uglich serves as the administrative center of Uglichsky District, although it is independent of it.Law #12-z As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the \\"town of oblast significance of Uglich\\"‚Äîan administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the town of oblast significance of Uglich is incorporated within Uglichsky Municipal District as Uglich Urban Settlement.Law #65-z Architecture The Transfiguration Cathedral in the Uglich kremlin in 2003 Apart from the kremlin, the city center features other examples of historic Russian architecture. Particularly notable are the Alexeievsky and Resurrection monasteries. The Assumption three-tented church (1628) of the Alexeyevsky Monastery is considered a gem of Russian medieval architecture. The common people said this church was \\"Marvelous\\", and that qualifier became part of its official name. Located nearby is the more conventional Church of St. John the Baptist (1681). Closer to the bank of the Volga is the Resurrection Monastery with a huge cathedral, refectory, belfry, and summer church. All these buildings stand in a row and date to 1674-77. Opposite the monastery is the graceful Church of the Nativity of St. John the Baptist. It was built in 1689-90 by a local merchant to commemorate the spot where his son had drowned. More historic architecture may be seen in the vicinity of Uglich, including the 17th-century Uleima Monastery and a fine church in Divnogorye.

In the 14th century, the barons of the first creation were made earls. Those of the fifth creation, in the 17th century, became first viscounts and then earls. Since 1913, the title has been held by the Fitzherbert family. History of the title The first creation was by writ in 1299 for Edmond de Stafford. His successor, the second baron, was made Earl of Stafford in 1351, and the sixth earl was made Duke of Buckingham in 1444. The sixth earl was the son of Anne of Gloucester, Countess of Buckingham, daughter of Thomas of Woodstock, Earl of Buckingham (later Duke of Gloucester), youngest son of King Edward III of England. Stafford was an important supporter of the House of Lancaster in the Wars of the Roses, and was killed at the Battle of Northampton in July 1460. The 1st Duke of Buckingham was succeeded in his titles by his grandson Henry, who aided Richard III in his claiming the throne in 1483 (Edward IV of England's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville having been declared null and void and Edward's sons illegitimate by Act of Parliament Titulus Regius), but who then led a revolt against Richard. He was executed for treason in 1483 and his titles were declared forfeit. His son Edward was restored as 3rd Duke upon Henry VII's accession to the throne in 1485, but he was ultimately executed in 1521 due to his opposition to Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, Henry VIII's chief advisor. When he was executed for treason, his titles were declared forfeit. A second creation, again by writ, was for Richard Stafford, who was created Baron Stafford of Clifton. At the death of the fourth baron, that title fell into abeyance. The third creation was in 1411 for Sir Hugh Stafford, a son of Hugh Stafford, 2nd Earl of Stafford; he had married Elizabeth Bourchier, 4th Baroness Bourchier (c. 1399 ‚Äì 1433), only child and sole heiress of Bartholomew Bourchier, 3rd Baron Bourchier (d.1409). Hugh was summoned to Parliament in lieu of his wife, as Baron Stafford. At his death, this title became extinct since he left no heirs. The fourth creation was in 1547 for Henry Stafford. In 1558, his title was recognized as carrying precedence from 1299, so he is in fact the 10th Baron.C. S. L. Davies, ‚ÄòStafford, Henry, tenth Baron Stafford (1501‚Äì1563)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Oct 2006. The fifth creation of the title came in 1640 in favour of William Howard. He was the third and youngest son of Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel, grandson of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk (see the Duke of Norfolk). He married Mary Stafford, only sister of Henry Stafford, 5th Baron de Stafford (of the 1547 creation, which is considered to have become extinct upon the death of Mary's uncle, the sixth Baron, sometime around 1640). On 12 September 1640 William Howard was created Baron Stafford, with remainder, in default of heirs male of the body, to the heirs of his body by his wife Mary and with the precedence of the 1547 barony. The same day Mary was made Baroness Stafford in her own right. This title was for life only. Two months later, on 11 November, William Howard was created Viscount Stafford, with remainder to his issue male. Costessey Hall c.1850. Now demolished, seat of the Jerningham family, Barons Stafford Swynnerton Hall, Staffordshire, seat of the Fitzherbert family, Barons Stafford Lord Stafford later became implicated in the Titus Oates plot, where fabricated evidence was used to prove an alleged Catholic plot against Charles II. He was attainted in 1678, with his titles forfeited. In 1680, he was impeached by the House of Commons and executed. After the accession of the Catholic James II, Mary, Baroness Stafford, was created Countess of Stafford for life in 1688. On the same day, her eldest son by Lord Stafford, Henry Stafford-Howard, was created Earl of Stafford, with remainder to his brothers John and Francis. However, he was not allowed to succeed in the barony or viscountcy of Stafford as these titles were still under attainder. Henry was succeeded according to the special remainder by his nephew, the second Earl (the eldest son of John). He was succeeded by his son, the third Earl. When he died childless, the title passed to his uncle, the fourth Earl. He was also childless and on his death in 1762 the earldom became extinct (the viscountcy of Stafford also formally became extinct, although the title was then under attainder). The claim to the barony of Stafford passed to the late Earl's niece, Anastasia, the de jure sixth Baroness Stafford. She was the daughter of the second Earl of Stafford. However, Anastasia was childless and on her death in 1807 the claim passed to her first cousin once removed, Sir William Jerningham, 6th Baronet, of Cossey (see Jerningham Baronets for earlier history of this title). He was the son of Sir George Jerningham, 5th Baronet, and his wife Mary, Lady Jerningham, only daughter of Mary Plowden, sister of the fourth Earl of Stafford. Jerningham died in 1809, when the claim passed to his son Sir George William Jerningham, 7th Baronet. He petitioned the House of Lords for a reversal of the attainder and for a writ of summons Parliament. In 1824 the attainder of the first Baron was completely reversed, and on 6 July 1825 the House of Lords decided that Jerningham had been successful in his claim to the barony. He was summoned to Parliament the same year as the eighth Baron Stafford. In 1826 he assumed by Royal licence the additional surname and arms of Stafford. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the ninth Baron. He had earlier represented Pontefract in the House of Commons. When he died the titles passed to his nephew, the tenth Baron, and then to the latter's brother, the eleventh Baron. On the eleventh Baron's death in 1913 the barony and baronetcy separated. The baronetcy was passed on to Sir Henry William Stafford Jerningham, 11th Baronet (on whose death in 1935 the title became extinct; see Jerningham Baronets). The barony, which could be inherited through female lines, was passed on to the late Baron's nephew Francis Edward Fitzherbert, the twelfth Baron. He was the son of Emily Charlotte (sister of both the tenth and eleventh Baron) and her husband, Basil Thomas Fitzherbert. He assumed in 1913 by Royal licence the additional surname and arms of Stafford. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the thirteenth Baron. He was an admiral in the Royal Navy. On his death, the title passed to his nephew, the fourteenth Baron. , the barony is held by the latter's son, the fifteenth Baron, who succeeded his father in 1986. The seat of the Jerningham family, who held the title from 1825 to 1913, was Costessey Hall in Norfolk (demolished in 1925).

Some are traffic signs that indicate hazards on roads that may not be readily apparent to a driver. While warning traffic sign designs vary, they usually take the shape of an equilateral triangle with a white background and thick red border. In the People's Republic of China (except for Macau and Hong Kong), they appear with a black border and a yellow background. In Sweden, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Greece, Finland, Iceland, North Macedonia and Poland, they have a red border with an amber background. The polar bear warning sign in Svalbard recently changed from displaying a black bear on white background to a white bear on black background (both signs are triangular with a red border). Some countries (like France, Norway and Spain) that normally use a white background have adopted an orange or amber background for road work or construction signs. Warning signs in some countries have a diamond shape in place of the standard triangular shape. In the United States, Canada, Mexico, Thailand, Australia, Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, most of South America, and also Ireland (diverging from the standards of the rest of Europe) use warning signs are black on a yellow background and usually diamond-shaped, while temporary signs (which are typically construction signs) are black on an orange background. Some other countries also use these standards for some signage. The warning signs usually contain a symbol. In Europe they are based on the UNECE Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals. In the United States they are based on the MUTCD standard and often contain text only.  History  17th-century sign along Salvador Street in Alfama, Lisbon says \\"Year of 1686. His Majesty commands all coaches, seges and litters coming from Salvador's entrance to back up to the same part\\"British specimen, .Early Czech warning signs, . The blue signs were later supplanted with red-white-black signs.reflector-spheres. Some of the first roadside signs--ancient milestones--merely gave distance measures. Hazard warnings were rare though occasional specimens appeared, such as the specific warning about horse-drawn vehicles backing up which was carved in stone in Lisbon's Alfama neighborhood in 1686. The early signs did not have high-contrast lettering and their messages might have been easily overlooked. Signs were written in the local language (example); symbolic signs, though long used on certain tradesmen's signs (like the pawnbrokers' tri-ball symbol) were to be used for traffic only much later in history. Complex signage systems emerged with the appearance of motorcars. In 1908 the automobile association in West London erected some warning signs. In 1909, nine European governments agreed on the use of four pictorial symbols, indicating bump, curve, intersection, and railroad crossing. The intensive work on international road signs that took place between 1926 and 1949 eventually led to the development of the European road sign system. As the 20th century progressed, and traffic volume and vehicle speeds increased, so did the importance of road sign visibility. Earlier flat- painted signs gave way to signs with embossed letters, which in turn gave way to button copy signs-- round retroreflective \\"buttons\\" helped to achieve greater night visibility. Flat metal signs reappeared in the 1980s with the widespread use of surfaces covered with retroflective sheeting materials like Scotchlite. In Europe, 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals (which became effective in 1978) tried, among other things, to standardize important signs. After the fall of the Iron Curtain and greater ease of country-to- country driving in the EU, European countries moved toward lessening the regional differences in warning signs. In modern regulations, U.S. warning signs are classified as Series W signs, such as W1 Series (curves and turns), W2 Series (intersections), W22 Series (blasting), et cetera, ending with the W25 Series (concerning extended green traffic lights). Some U.S. warning signs are without category while others like the warning stripes at tunnel portals or plain red End of Roadway signs are classified as Object Markers (OM Series). In the U.S., Stop and speed limit signs fall under the R Series (Regulatory). Modern U.S. signs are widely standardized; unless they are antique holdovers from an earlier era, oddities like a yellow Stop sign or a red Slippery When Wet sign would typically appear only on private property-- perhaps at a hospital campus or in a shopping mall parking lot. Street sign theft by pranksters, souvenir hunters, and scrappers has become problematic: removal of warning signs costs municipalities money to replace lost signs, and can contribute to traffic collisions. Some authorities affix theft-deterrence stickers to the back sides of signs. Some jurisdictions have criminalized unauthorized possession of road signs or have outlawed their resale to scrap metal dealers. In some cases, thieves whose sign-removal lead to road fatalities have been charged with manslaughter. Artistically inclined vandals sometimes paint additional details onto warning signs: a beer bottle, a handgun, or a boom box added to the outstretched hand of the Pedestrian Crossing person, for example.  Modern traffic warning sign shapes and colors  Warning signs can indicate any potential hazard, obstacle or condition requiring special attention. Some of the most common warning signs are the following.  General caution  right BelgiumSweden General warning signs are used in instances in which the particular hazard, obstacle or condition is not covered by a standard sign. In Europe, they usually comprise an exclamation mark on the standard triangular sign (Unicode #9888: ‚ö†) with an auxiliary sign below in the local language identifying the hazard, obstacle or condition. In Sweden, the general warning sign has only a vertical line instead of exclamation mark; this model was used also in many other European countries until the 1990s. In the United States and other countries using diamond-shaped signs, the explanatory language is often written directly on the diamond- shaped sign, although it may contain only a general warning such as \\"Caution\\", and pictograms may also be used.  Obstacles  Warning signs can be placed in advance of, next to or on a specific obstacle. Obstacles such as railway level crossings may have several warning signs beforehand, while bridge ramparts typically have reflective signs placed directly on them on either side. These signs can be specific to the shape requirements of the obstacle, for example, bridge rampart signs are often tall and skinny so as not to intrude into the lane.  Animals crossing the roadway  Kangaroo crossing sign in Australia These signs warn of wild animals (moose, bear, elk, deer, reindeer, polar bears, camels, wallabies, kangaroos, alligators, etc.) or farm animals (cows, horses, ducks, sheep) that may stray onto the road. In the United States, a \\"share the road\\" plaque is sometimes placed below these warning signs when used in this manner.  Unusual vehicles in roadway  Taiwan: handcarts crossing. These signs are found where road users could encounter slow, large or non-typical vehicle such as tractors, forklifts, snowmobiles, Amish buggies etc. They are more common around quarries, airports, industrial zones and rural areas.  Road work or construction  New Zealand road work sign These signs are often temporary in nature and used to indicate road work (construction), poor roads, or temporary conditions ahead on the road including flagmen, survey crew, single-lane, detour, bridge out, utility crew ahead, blasting area, bump, dip, frost heaves, flooding (with signs labeled \\"High water\\"), soft shoulder, uneven pavement, freshly oiled road, loose gravel, smoke on road, trucks entering, etc. (Note that some \\"high water\\" signs are posted to alert drivers of a flood-prone area and do not actually mean that there is a flooded section of road ahead.) In France, Italy, Spain, Norway etc., warning (and speed limit) signs connected with road work have a yellow background in place of the usual white background on signs. In America and Ireland, signs connected with road work have an orange background.  Curves and corners  Brazil sharp turn sign These signs indicate that dangerous or unexpected bends in the road are ahead. Signs typically indicate whether the curves are to the right or to the left, the angle of the curve and whether it is one curve or a series of curves. = Chevrons and arrows = Philippines curve chevron Chevron-shaped symbols or arrows on rectangular signs may be placed at the actual location of the bend or curve to further mark the location of the curve and to assist in the negotiation of the curve. They may also be used to indicate \\"merge\\" with other traffic, as for an on-ramp of a limited-access highway. An unusual occurrence of the rectangular arrow sign appears on the eastbound approach to Dead Man's Curve in Cleveland, Ohio, the USA, a curve so sharp that in places an arrow's stem is printed on one sign and the arrow's point is printed on another larger sign further down the road; from the driver's perspective at a distance, the two signs visually blend together to form one large arrow image.  Tunnels  United States (California) These signs are used to indicate tunnels, where lights are usually required, and a general change in the light level. May also indicate low ceiling clearance. Truck drivers should also watch for prohibited cargo signs (e.g., hazmat, propane, explosives) upon approach to tunnels.  Bridges  Italy drawbridge ahead sign These signs are used where traffic may be constricted to a narrow bridge, or where the bridge may have a movable span closed to vehicles while boats pass (e.g., drawbridge or floating bridge). They may also be used for underpass to indicate low overhead clearance.  Traffic signals  Australian traffic signal These warning signs indicate that traffic lights are ahead, and are often used when it is difficult to see that a traffic light may already be showing red, to warn a driver to prepare to slow down. They may be supplemented with flashing light or lighted sign when light is red or turning red. Some countries also have signs warning of signals for ramp meters, fire stations, and airfields.  Warning signs for regulatory signs  Jamaica give way ahead sign As for traffic signals, above, some \\"stop\\" or \\"yield\\" signs may require additional warning or reminder, especially in dense areas or where the sign has been added recently.  Intersections  Uruguay crossroads sign These signs warn of road crossings at (crossroads, T-intersection, forks (Y-intersection), rotary/roundabout). They may also indicate \\"hidden driveway\\" intersecting the road ahead. (Compare with bridges, overpasses, viaducts).  Lane starts and ends  Japan lane decrease sign These signs indicate when a multilane highway is being narrowed, when a passing lane is ending, or where the road is widening or a passing lane starting. Another type of sign is used to indicate central \\"two-way\\" left turning lane in center of roadway. Warning signs may also warn of \\"Highway ends\\", where the road changes class or type.  Merge to stay with through traffic  Peru merging traffic sign In the United States and Canada, there is special signage for lanes that are about to exit, so that drivers who wish to remain on the main road have adequate time to merge. Such lanes are sometimes indicated by special striping (\\"alligator stripes\\") and the sign, \\"Through Traffic Merge Left\\" (or right). On freeways, the green directions sign for the exit ramp may have the additional notation, \\"Exit Only,\\" and should have black letters on a yellow background for emphasis.  Roads with one entry point  Canada: \\"no exit\\" sign Roadways that only have one entry/exit point - \\"dead end\\", \\"not a through street\\" or \\"no outlet\\".  End of roadway  U.S. (New York City): roadway ends. Signs indicating the end point of a roadway.  Pedestrian crossings  Netherlands pedestrian crossing sign These signs are used to warn drivers of people walking in the street. They may also be used to warn of children playing, playgrounds, bicycle area, deaf child, blind pedestrians, and thickly settled zones where pedestrians may enter the road. In California, United States near the Mexican border, there are warning signs showing a running family. This is to warn motorists to look out for illegal immigrants who try to escape authorities by running through freeway traffic. The symbol was created by California Department of Transportation employee John Hood in the late 1980s.  Schools  Thailand School crossing ahead These signs mark school zones (in which lower speed limits may be in place), student crossings, crossing guards or signals ahead. In the U.S. and Canada, pentagon-shaped signs are used in place of the usual diamond-shaped signs. The shape of the U.S. school zone resembles a one-room schoolhouse and is the only U.S. sign shaped this way. Some Canadian provinces use an identical sign. Ontario uses a white on blue version of this sign.  Bicycle  Russia bicycle crossing warning sign Bicycle crossing signs warn that bicycles will cross at their location.  Fire stations  Texas emergency vehicles sign. These signs warn of approach to where firefighters may be entering the road with fire engines or other emergency apparatus, where other drivers will have to stop and wait until they pass.  Oncoming traffic  Norway two-way traffic sign These signs may be used to warn people of oncoming traffic; shown when a motorway becomes a dual carriageway or a normal road without a central reservation or median.  Level crossing (railway crossing)  Ireland level crossing with gates sign These signs are used to warn of level crossings ahead. In most countries, a red triangle warning sign is used, with various pictograms for unguarded crossings, crossings with manual gates, and automatic level crossings. In most of Europe, an old-style gate is used for a crossing with gates, and a steam locomotive for a crossing without gates. Germany uses an electric train. Similar pictograms are also used in Ireland, albeit on an amber diamond sign. In the United States the warning of all types of railway crossings is made using a circular yellow sign. The actual crossing is also marked with crossed \\"railroad crossing\\" crossbuck signs (stop, look, listen) and possibly lights, bells, and barriers.  Falling rocks  Ukraine falling rocks sign These signs may be used to indicate the hazards of fallen or falling rocks on the road ahead. They are usually pictographs, but may also include wording, such as \\"fallen rock\\", \\"falling rock\\", or \\"rock slide\\". In Italy the words may be \\"\\" or \\"\\"; in France \\"\\"; in Mexico \\"s\\".  Other warnings (aircraft-related)  Delaware low flying aircraft For example, a warning sign with the image of an aircraft in the middle of it indicates an airport or airfield, where drivers should be prepared for low- flying aircraft.  Crosswinds or Side winds  Poland side winds sign Flying socks, as indicated by a windsock on red triangle or yellow diamond signs, indicate locations where a strong side wind may cause the trajectory of the moving vehicle to change drastically, perhaps even \\"flying\\" across lanes, causing an accident.  Road conditions  Nebraska, may be icy ahead \\"Slippery when wet\\", \\"grooved pavement\\" (warning to motorcyclists and bicyclists), \\"Open joints on bridge\\", \\"Icy Road\\", \\"Bridge freezes before roadway\\" and variants thereof, and \\"bump\\" or \\"dip\\" ahead (not related to construction). Truck drivers will need to pay attention to \\"Steep grade\\" warnings (or \\"Down grade, use lower gear\\"), sometimes posted with the percent grade (e.g., 5 percent). Steep hills may also feature \\"Runaway truck escape\\" or \\"Emergency stop\\" areas with corresponding signs. The UK has a sign warning of \\"Adverse camber\\" on a curve. Also \\"Loose gravel\\", \\"Soft shoulder\\", \\"Speed hump\\", and \\"Watch for Ice.\\"  Traffic warning signs with lights  Some warning signs have flashing lights to alert drivers of conditions ahead or remind drivers to slow down. In Britain, they are called warning light. Flashing lights can be dangerous for people with certain forms of epilepsy and/or sensory processing disorder.

It broadcasts from Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates and is owned by Abu Dhabi Media. Although it is a generic channel and not a 24-hour news network, Abu Dhabi TV is famous for its coverage of the 2003 Iraq War broadcast on Western news channels at the time. Abu Dhabi TV is managed by the United Arab Emirates' largest media group, Abu Dhabi Media. ADMC, the largest and most diversified media corporation in the Arab world, enjoys editorial and administrative independence while somewhat dependent on government and federal funding through its previous attachment to the Ministry of Information and Culture since 1999 and current attachment to Abu Dhabi Media in which the ministry was scrapped in February 2006. EMI operations currently include 3 satellite television channels, 7 radio channels and 3 press publications. Abu Dhabi TV presents news bulletins every three hours. It produces nearly 60% of the programs that it broadcasts, including political, current affairs, cultural, entertainment, drama, and documentary features. Abu Dhabi TV is broadcast throughout the Arab World, North America, Europe, South America, and Australia. The network is known throughout the Arab World for the popular show of Million's Poet.  History and rebranding  Abu Dhabi Television started black and white broadcasts on 4 August 1969 and adopted the PAL format for color broadcasting on 4 December 1974; the station was only carried terrestrially in the United Arab Emirates for its first 23 years on the air. The Abu Dhabi TV satellite channel began regular broadcasts on 15 November 1992 on Arabsat A1; broadcasts were later transferred to Arabsat A2. The network also began to be carried through the entire Arabian Peninsula at that time. The network was rebranded on 30 January 2000 as a service aimed at the Arabic-speaking diaspora. Under this format, the channel began carrying a wide range of news programmes, as well as entertainment programs catered to Arabic audiences; as a result, it began to become competitive against rival networks MBC and Dubai TV. One of the network's most popular programmes was the game show Waznak Dahab; the programme premiered on 16 September 2002 and was canceled in early 2003 due to an invasion of Iraq by the United States, which resulted in the beginning of the Iraq War. On 6 October 2008, Abu Dhabi TV (then-renamed Abu Dhabi Al Oula) was rebranded with a new logo, theme and new original programming content. This rebranding involved the launches of an online website involving catch-ups of television programs and a 1080i high definition broadcast channel; which then featured bespoke idents in contrast to the standard-definition cast. The new themes were produced by graphic designers Lambie Nairn and the soundtrack was made by David Lowe, who produced the famous BBC News music. The rebrand also involved the launch of 'Abu Dhabi Sports', a group of eight sister channels (broadcast in either Arabic or English) with the inclusion of 'EDGE Sports' and 'YAS Sports'; all of which are currently broadcast 24/7. In the same year, President Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan issued a decree ordering Abu Dhabi TV to be established as a public joint-stock company that is wholly owned by the government of Abu Dhabi. In 2009, Abu Dhabi Media relaunched and rebranded 'Emirates TV' as 'Abu Dhabi Al Emarat' after acquiring the network in 2007. Additionally, a UAE-based channel of National Geographic was additionally launched on 1 July of the same year. On 5 April 2010, sister channel Abu Dhabi Drama was launched; catering to free-to-air broadcasts of drama and soap opera television programs broadcast 24/7 without advertisement breaks. On 13 February 2012, Abu Dhabi TV shut down its analogue broadcasts on terrestrial television on 3 December 2013; therefore began broadcasting solely in high definition while existing standard definition casts were down-converted. On 22 March 2015, the network was once again rebranded back to the 'Abu Dhabi TV' name with a brand new logo and identity. On 19 February 2020, Abu Dhabi TV unveiled its new logo after 5 years in use.

He is associated with his puppet Archie Andrews. Radio days Born in Shepherd's Bush, London, Brough began his radio career in 1944 in ventriloquism but in 1950 he debuted Archie, a mischievous child who domineered his mentor.The Sunday Post: Ventriloquism. Andrew Martin, BBC Genome Blog, 20 July 2017. Retrieved 23 July 2017. Archie's chief characteristics were his Savile Row- tailored blazers and manic eyes. Archie followed in the tradition of the American ventriloquist Edgar Bergen and his dummy Charlie McCarthy. His radio series based around the character ‚Äì Educating Archie ‚Äì featured in support of the likes of Dick Emery, Freddie Sales, Benny Hill, Tony Hancock, Hattie Jacques, Bruce Forsyth, Harry Secombe, Max Bygraves, Beryl Reid and even a young Julie Andrews as the girlfriend of Archie; Eric Sykes was one of the series' main writers in the early 1950s. The show often averaged 15 million listeners, and a fan club had 250,000 members. TV work Because of the success of his radio show, Brough made his debut on television in 1956 in the BBC sitcom Here's Archie which co-starred Irene Handl and Ronald Chesney. The show was written by the latter and Ronald Wolfe, who would later team up on British sitcoms The Rag Trade and On the Buses. Two years later, Brough was on ITV in Educating Archie, utilising the same team as before, although Marty Feldman took some of the writing credit as well. The TV appearances exposed his limitations as a ventriloquist, as his lips were frequently seen to move. In later years a critic remarked, \\"Ventriloquism on the radio - I could have done that.\\" By 1961, Brough decided to retire Archie following the death of his father, also a ventriloquist, and he then took over the family's textile and menswear business. His TV appearances were sporadic from then on. He died on 3 June 1999 and was buried in Maldon cemetery in Essex. In November 2005, the original Archie Andrews doll was sold at auction in Taunton for ¬£34,000. Family Brough married twice: first in 1940 to Peggy Franklin (one son, one daughter; marriage dissolved), second to Elizabeth Chantler (died 1994; one son, one daughter). His son Chris Brough, became a record producer and was married to the singer, actress and TV presenter Ayshea Brough in the 1970s.

Former Rodan guitarist Jason Noble played music individually and referred to himself as Rachel's but then began collaborating with core members violist Christian Frederickson and pianist Rachel Grimes. The group's work was strongly influenced by classical music, particularly inspired by the minimalist music of the late 20th century, and its compositions reflect this. While the trio formed the core part of the band, the group's recordings and performances featured a varying ensemble of musicians, who played a range of string instruments (including viola and cello) in combination with piano, guitars, electric bass guitar, and a drum set that included a large orchestral bass drum. A key influence on the music of Rachel's was the music of the English composer Michael Nyman, whose music the group's work resembles in both instrumentation and compositional style. A profile of the band is included in the book Second-Hand Stories: 15 Portraits of Louisville by Michael L. Jones. Noble died of cancer on August 4, 2012, and Edward Grimes died on March 25, 2017.

Aberdeen also released recordings through Sunday Records and guitarist and co-founder's own label The Tremolo Arm Users Club. They disbanded shortly after Sarah Records folded. They reformed in 2001, signed to Tremolo, and released a full-length album, Homesick and Happy to be Here, two singles, and a maxi-CD (see discography below). In 2002, the band embarked on a US tour with Robert Wratten, playing solo acoustic performances as Trembling Blue Stars. In 2003, the band again played with Robert but as Trembling Blue Stars for a series of Los Angeles shows at Cafe Club Fais Do-Do. Possibly the band's biggest exposure came when one of their songs, 'Sink or Float' was featured on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The song was also included on the UK edition of the series's second soundtrack album, Radio Sunnydale. Aberdeen broke up again in 2005 as their members drifted to other projects, though they released a career retrospective CD, What Do I Wish for Now? (Singles + Extras 1994‚Äì2004), the following year on LTM. Lead singer Beth Arzy has also been a member of Trembling Blue Stars since 2000, and contributed to albums by The Occasional Keepers.

Possibly the arms of Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby(1435-1504), KG. Ordsall Hall, Salford Baron Strange is a title that has been created several times in the Peerage of England. Two creations, one in 1295 and another in 1326, had only one holder each, upon the death of whom they became extinct. Two of the creations are extant. All four baronies of Strange have been created by writ, which means that they can pass through both male and female lines. 1295 creation The first creation came in 1295 when Roger le Strange was summoned to the Model Parliament as Lord Strange. On his death in 1311 the title became extinct. 1299 creation The second creation came in 1299 when John le Strange was summoned to the House of Lords as Lord Strange. This creation is often referred to as Baron Strange de Knokyn or Baron Strange of Knokyn (alternatively Latinized as Knokin or Knockin). Joan le Strange, the ninth holder of the title, married George Stanley, 9th Baron Strange, son of Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby, who was summoned to Parliament as Lord Strange in her right. Their son Thomas succeeded as both second Earl of Derby and tenth Baron Strange. The titles remained united until the death of his great-grandson, the fifth Earl and 13th Baron, in 1594. The earldom was inherited by his younger brother, the sixth Earl, while the barony of Strange (as well as the baronies of Mohun of Dunster and Stanley, also held by the Earl) fell into abeyance between the late Earl's three daughters Lady Anne, Lady Frances and Lady Elizabeth (however, the sixth Earl of Derby erroneously assumed the barony of Strange - see below). The barony of Strange remained in abeyance for the next 327 years. However, the abeyance was terminated in 1921 in favour of Elizabeth Frances Philipps, Viscountess St Davids, who became the fourteenth Baroness. She was the second wife of John Philipps, 1st Viscount St Davids. The abeyance of the ancient baronies of Hungerford and de Moleyns was terminated at the same time in her favour. On her death in 1974 the titles were inherited by her son, the fifteenth Baron Strange, who had already succeeded his father as second Viscount St Davids. As of 2013 the titles are held by the second Viscount's grandson, the fourth Viscount and seventeenth Baron Strange. 1326 creation The third creation came in 1326 when Sir Eubulus le Strange was summoned to Parliament as Lord Strange. However, the title became extinct on his death in 1335. His nephew Roger le Strange, 4th Baron Strange of Knockyn, was his heir.Le Strange Records, 1916 1628 creation In 1594 William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby (1561-1642), following the death of his elder brother the 5th Earl of Derby, incorrectly assumed the title Baron Strange (created in 1299) (see above). In 1628 his son and heir apparent, James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby, was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration as Lord Strange. When it was discovered that his father's assumption of the barony was erroneous, it was deemed that there were two baronies of Strange, one created in 1299 then in abeyance, and another created \\"accidentally\\" in 1628. James Stanley later succeeded his father as 7th Earl of Derby. The titles remained united until the death of his grandson, the ninth Earl and third Baron, in 1702. The earldom was inherited by the late Earl's younger brother, the tenth Earl, while the barony fell into abeyance between the Earl's two daughters, Lady Henrietta and Lady Elizabeth. On Lady Elizabeth's death in 1714 the abeyance was terminated in favour of Henrietta, who became the fourth Baroness. She married, firstly, John Annesley, 4th Earl of Anglesey, and after his death, secondly, John Ashburnham, 1st Earl of Ashburnham. Lady Strange was succeeded by her daughter from her second marriage, Henrietta Bridget, the fifth Baroness. However, she died unmarried at an early age and was succeeded by her aforementioned great- uncle, the tenth Earl of Derby, who became the sixth Baron Strange. Lord Derby was childless and was succeeded in the barony by his first cousin once removed James Murray, 2nd Duke of Atholl, who became the seventh Baron Strange as well. He was the grandson of Lady Amelia Anne Sophia Stanley, daughter of James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby. On his death the dukedom and barony separated. He was succeeded in the dukedom by his nephew John Murray, 3rd Duke of Atholl, while the barony passed to his daughter Charlotte, the eighth Baroness. She married her first cousin, the third Duke of Atholl. They were both succeeded by their son, the fourth Duke and ninth Baron. In 1786 he was created Earl Strange and Baron Murray of Stanley in the Peerage of Great Britain. The dukedom and barony remained united until the death of his great- great-grandson, the ninth Duke and fourteenth Baron, in 1957 (see the Duke of Atholl for more detailed information on the holders during this period and for later history of the title). The barony of Strange fell into abeyance between the representatives of the three daughters of the fourth Duke of Atholl, Lady Charlotte, Lady Amelia Sophia and Lady Elizabeth. The abeyance was terminated by the Queen in 1965 in favour of John Drummond of Megginch, who became the fifteenth Baron. He was the great-grandson of Lady Charlotte and her second husband Admiral Sir Adam Drummond of Megginch. However, on his death in 1982 the peerage once again fell into abeyance, this time between his three daughters. It was called out of abeyance in 1986 in favour of the eldest daughter, Cherry, who became the sixteenth Baroness. She was the wife of Captain Humphrey ap Evans (1922‚Äì2009), who along with his wife assumed the name of Drummond of Megginch by decree of the Lord Lyon in 1965. Lady Strange was one of the ninety hereditary peers that were allowed to remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999. On her death in 2005 the title was inherited by her eldest son, the seventeenth and () present holder of the title. The family seat was Megginch Castle, near Erroll, Perthshire.

Shiiba is a small, mountainous village situated in the centre of the Southern island of Kyushu. It is in northwest of Miyazaki prefecture, on the border with Kumamoto Prefecture. The main area of Shiiba village (known as Kami- Shiiba) itself is quite small, however, several small hamlets surround the village to make up the area/region known as Shiiba. As of October 1, 2019, the village has an estimated population of 2,579 and a density of 4.8 persons per km2. The total area of Shiiba is 537.29 km2. Geography Shiiba is a very mountainous region covered with deep forest, cliffs and waterfalls. There are also a few dams located in the area, the main one being the Shiba Dam which can be found in close proximity to Shiiba Secondary School. Due to its many rivers, waterfalls, and forests, it is an area of outstanding natural beauty. Due to the remote, natural, cool environment of Shiiba, it is home to many kinds of wildlife. Although many of the native animals are rarely seen during the day, they can often be seen very early in the morning or at night, especially when driving. Shiiba is home to a large number of tanuki or raccoon dogs that live in the nearby forests and often come out at night to look for food. There are also a great number of wild boar in the area and they also come out at night and sometimes during the day to look for food. A large population of Sika deer also live in the Shiiba area. These animals are seldom seen, however, when they are spotted they will run off and disappear into the forest. This usually occurs during the early morning, dusk or at night time. In the late evening their cries can be heard all over Shiiba. Despite this, they have been known to jump in front of cars when startled and have caused a few accidents in the past. This is however, an uncommon occurrence. Both wild boar meat and deer meat are local delicacies that are often sold during the Heike festival (see below) and are sometimes served during special events and parties in the village. The region is also host to a large number of insect groups. Although their numbers dwindle in the colder times of the year and are rarely seen, many are present during the summer months. A large number of Mantis can be seen during this period all over the village usually lying in wait to capture smaller insects for food. The summer also brings in a large number of butterflies, including large, almost hand-sized ones, that can be seen all over the place usually flying near plants and flowers. These can be seen in abundance around the local schools as many Japanese schools grow and keep flowers on their premises. During the summer months a variety of beetles can be found including rhinoceros beetles and the Japanese rhinoceros beetle. These large insects usually live underground and in cool, damp areas, hence they are not always easily seen. Many children in Japan, catch or buy these to breed or study them. Much like butterflies, they can be encountered around schools. Cockroaches can occasionally be seen during the humid periods of the summer months, however, they are not as common as they are in other parts of Japan. Cicadas can seldom be seen but can always be heard in the summer. As Shiiba has a number of rivers, waterfalls and reservoirs, a number of frogs and toads can be seen around the town during the summer months. As with cicadas they can often be heard more than seen. However, during the rainy season they have been known to swarm across several roads en masse on their way to their breading grounds so care should be taken. Climate The winters can be very cold, especially in the Okawachi area, with heavy snowfall and subzero temperatures. Although it changes slightly every year, it annually snows from the period starting from mid to late December until February. During this time most locals have to change their car tires to ones equipped with stronger treading (snow tires). This reduces the chance of slipping on the roads and makes it easier to drive up the more hilly, steep and occasionally exposed roads in the region. In summer Shiiba has high humidity and regular rains as result of the typhoon season. But, due to its central location within Kyushu, Shiiba tends to be protected by the surrounding mountain ranges and is relatively unaffected for the most part. However like many mountainous regions of Japan landslides have been known to occur, and during the period care should be taken as rivers and dams will be swollen. For most of the year Shiiba is relatively a cool compared to other parts of Miyazaki and Kyushu. This is directly due to its location in Kyushu, the slightly higher altitude, and the surrounding mountains and forests which keep it sheltered. Education Education in Shiiba is regulated by the Shiiba Village Board of Education (ÊïôËÇ≤ÂßîÂì°‰ºö - kyouikuiinkai'). As a result of the declining population, a few of the local schools have been closed over the years. At present there are 6 primary schools and 1 main secondary school:  Primary schools  * Shiiba Primary School (Ê§éËëâÂ∞èÂ≠¶Ê†°) * Kozaki Primary School (Â∞èÂ¥éÂ∞èÂ≠¶Ê†°) * Fudono Primary School (‰∏çÂúüÈáéÂ∞èÂ≠¶Ê†°) * Omukai Primary School (Â∞æÂêëÂ∞èÂ≠¶Ê†°) * Okawauchi Primary School (Â§ßÊ≤≥ÂÜÖÂ∞èÂ≠¶Ê†°) * Matsuo Primary School (ÊùæÂ∞æÂ∞èÂ≠¶Ê†°).  Secondary schools  Shiiba Secondary SchoolThe only secondary school in Shiiba is Shiiba Secondary School (Ê§éËëâ‰∏≠Â≠¶Ê†°). Another secondary school, Matsuo Secondary School (ÊùæÂ∞æ‰∏≠Â≠¶Ê†°) closed in spring 2013. Students from Matsuo Elementary School initially went straight to Matsuo Junior High School upon graduation. However, due its closure in the spring of 2013, all students in the region graduate to Shiiba Junior High school (This is now the main and only secondary school in Shiiba). As there are no high schools in Shiiba, students are required to study at high schools in other parts of Miyazaki prefecture upon graduation. Despite its remote location Shiiba is not internationally isolated and has had a longterm reciprocal exchange program with a sister school in Singapore. All the final year secondary school students travel to Singapore each year during the summer holidays (August) as part of an international cultural exchange and homestay programme. This is then reciprocated in the winter (November‚ÄìDecember) when students from Singapore travel to Shiiba. Due to the small size and close-knit nature of the community this is a town event, with the exchange often timed to coincide with local traditional festivals or events, such as Kagura or harvest festivals. The programme is unique, with few comparable programs in Japan, in part to the extent of local support and its structure allowing all students from Shiiba a chance experience foreign culture and the chance to forge strong friendship with people of their own age in a different country. It is an event that most students look forward to one day participating in.  Culture =Heike Festival The village, despite being small, has a long and deep history. Every year, during early to mid November, the locals are joined by hundreds of people from other parts of the country to celebrate the Shiiba Heike Matsuri. This festival celebrates a legendary tragic love affair that took place between two members of rival samurai families in the area over 800 years ago. This celebration is of a secret love between the Heike clan's Princess, Tsurutomi, and Daihachiro Nasu, a member of the Genji Clan who had been given orders to destroy the Heike clan. It takes place over 3 days (Friday evening and the following Saturday and Sunday) and includes a number of special events and performances accompanied with food and souvenir stalls with the main attraction being the Heike Parade. Over 300 people participate in the parade with many local men and boys dressing up in Genji clan style Samurai armour walking in line with Daihachiro Nasu, and the local women and girls dressing up as Heike maidens surrounding and following the Princess Tsurutomi. The roles for Princess Tsurutomi and Daihchiro Nasu are selected in the months before the parade by the village office. Many of the local school students and teachers, village officials and residents participate in the parade making it the starring attraction. The Heike Parade has been preceded in recent years by the talented, Kyushu famous, orchestra from Miyazaki Gakuen. The town's cute, cartoon style mascot, Otsuru-chan („Åä„Å§„Çã„Å°„ÇÉ„Çì), is based on Princess Tsurutomi. Outdoor activities Aside from the many hillwalking and hiking trails that cover the mountains around Shiiba, climbing, especially ice climbing in winter, has become popular; with climbers around Kyushu travelling to Shiiba due to the consistent subzero temperates and many frozen waterfalls to be found around the region. Along with hiking, camping is also popular, with camping and log cabins in the area available during the warmer months, as well as several guesthouses offering nature retreats.  Transportation  As there are no train stations and only a very limited bus service from Hyuga, it is predominantly accessible by car; the village is several hours drive from both Miyazaki City (3~4hrs) and Kumamoto City (2~3hrs). If travelling from Fukuoka or Kagoshima it is accessed from the West via Gokase (30~50 minute drive) on the Miyazaki-Kumamoto border, or via the main road from the coastal town of Hyuga (90~110 minute drive) if travelling from the East. Though it is possible to travel through Okawachi via Hitoyoshi, the road is unclearly signed from hotspring town of Yunomae and care needs to be taken for rockfall and road closure during certain times of the year.

Biology  Lepas anatifera in Thailand Gooseneck barnacles reaching down from the top of a tidal cave in Oregon Some species of goose barnacles such as Lepas anatifera are pelagic and are most frequently found on tidewrack on oceanic coasts. Unlike most other types of barnacles, intertidal goose barnacles (e.g. Pollicipes pollicipes and Pollicipes polymerus) depend on water motion rather than the movement of their cirri for feeding, and are therefore found only on exposed or moderately exposed coasts.  Spontaneous generation  Gerard's Herbal (1597), displaying the belief that goose barnacles produced barnacle geese. In the days before it was realised that birds migrate, it was thought that barnacle geese, Branta leucopsis, developed from this crustacean, since they were never seen to nest in temperate Europe, hence the English names \\"goose barnacle\\", \\"barnacle goose\\" and the scientific name Lepas anserifera (, \\"goose\\"). The confusion was prompted by the similarities in colour and shape. Because they were often found on driftwood, it was assumed that the barnacles were attached to branches before they fell in the water. The archdeacon of Brecon, Gerald of Wales, made this claim in his Topographia Hiberniae. Since barnacle geese were thought to be \\"neither flesh, nor born of flesh\\", they were allowed to be eaten on days when eating meat was forbidden by Christianity, though it was not universally accepted. The Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II examined barnacles and noted no evidence of any bird-like embryo in them, and the secretary of Leo of Rozmital wrote a very skeptical account of his reaction to being served the goose at a fast-day dinner in 1456.Henisch, Bridget Ann, Fast and Feast: Food in Medieval Society.

In Portugal and Spain, the species Pollicipes pollicipes is a widely consumed and expensive delicacy known as percebes. Percebes are harvested commercially in the Iberian northern coast, mainly in Galicia and Asturias, but also in the Southwestern Portuguese coast (Alentejo) and are also imported from other countries within its range of distribution, particularly from Morocco. A larger but less palatable species (Pollicipes polymerus) was also imported to Spain from Canada until 1999, when the Canadian government ceased exports due to depletion of stocks. In Spain, percebes are lightly boiled in brine and served whole and hot under a napkin. To eat percebes, the diamond shaped foot is pinched between thumb and finger and the inner tube pulled out of the scaly case. The claw is removed and the remaining flesh is swallowed.

It is the only confirmed case of hybrid speciation in marine mammals, descending from the spinner dolphin and the striped dolphin.  Taxonomy  The Clymene dolphin was first formally described by John Edward Gray in 1846, although, unusually, he did not assign it its current name until four years later, in 1850. From then on, until a reassessment in 1981, the Clymene dolphin was regarded as a subspecies of the spinner dolphin (Stenella longirostris). In 1981, Perrin et al. asserted the Clymene's existence as separate species. Until this time, because Clymenes are relatively remote and were regarded as very similar to the more accessible spinners, they were never heavily studied. Anatomical and behavioral traits suggested that this species is a hybrid of the spinner dolphin and striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba), and DNA testing has shown that it is indeed a hybrid species. The common and scientific names are probably derived from the Greek oceanid Clymene, although it has also been argued that it may instead come from the Greek word for \\"notorious\\".  Description  The Clymene dolphin looks very similar to the spinner dolphin. At close quarters, it is possible to observe that the beak of the Clymene is slightly shorter than that of its relative. The dorsal fin is also less erect and triangular. The basic color of the Clymene dolphin is \\"cetacean neapolitan\\" - it occurs in three shaded layers ‚Äî the underside being white. Next, a strip of light grey runs from just above the beak, round either side of the eye back to the tail stock, where the band thickens. The top layer, from the forehead, along the back to the dorsal fin, and down to the top of the tail stock, is a dark grey. The beak, lips, and flippers are also dark grey in color. Clymene dolphins grow to about in length and in weight. Behavior and biology bow-riding the bow wave of USNS Supply Clymene dolphins spend most of their lives in waters over in depth, but occasionally move into shallower, coastal regions. They feed on squid and small schooling fish, hunting either at night, or in mesopelagic waters where there is only limited light. Predators include cookie-cutter sharks, as evidenced by bite marks seen on a number of animals. Clymenes are fairly active dolphins. They do spin longitudinally when jumping clear of the water, but not with as much regularity and complexity as the spinner dolphin. They will also approach boats and ride bow waves. Group sizes vary from just four up to around 150 individuals, although about forty is typical. Many of these groups appear to be single-sex, and also to be segregated by the approximate age of the individuals. Clymene dolphins are also highly vocal, making short whistles in a range of 6‚Äì19 kHz. No figures are available for the size of animals at birth. Gestation, lactation, and maturation periods are all unknown, but are unlikely to vary greatly from others in the genus Stenella. Their longevity is also unknown, although at least one sixteen-year-old individual has been reported from a stranding.  Population and distribution  The Clymene dolphin is endemic to the Atlantic Ocean. Its full range is still poorly understood, particularly at its southern end. The species certainly prefers temperate and tropical waters. The northern end of the range runs roughly from New Jersey east-southeast to southern Morocco. The southern tip runs from somewhere around Angola to Rio de Janeiro. They appear to prefer deep water. Numerous sightings have been recorded in the Gulf of Mexico. The species has not been sighted, however, in the Mediterranean Sea. The total population is unknown. The only population estimate available is for the north part of the Gulf of Mexico, where a count of 6,500 individuals was reported. However, it is suspected that there are three well-define populations in the Atlantic Ocean, located in the North Atlantic, South Atlantic, and the Gulf of Mexico. As of more recent research, it is presumed that individuals from the South Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico move between these two populations, while the North Atlantic population seems to be more isolated. The species may naturally be rare in comparison with others in the genus Stenella.  Human interaction  Some individuals have been killed from directed fisheries in the Caribbean and others may have been caught in nets off West Africa.  Conservation  The West African population of the Clymene dolphin is listed on Appendix II\\"Appendix II \\" of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). As amended by the Conference of the Parties in 1985, 1988, 1991, 1994, 1997, 1999, 2002, 2005 and 2008. Effective: 5 March 2009. of the convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), since it has an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organized by tailored agreements. The Clymene dolphin is covered by the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia.

George entered the Navy as a midshipman on December 10, 1835, serving on the frigate until 1838. Career He was in the Florida war in 1841, and was on the sloop for its circumnavigation of the world in 1843‚Äì1845, taking ashore the first American force to land in China. In the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, he participated in the capture of Alvarado, Veracruz, and Tuxpan. He became master on July 15, 1847, and lieutenant on February 5, 1848. While serving on the frigate , he went with Matthew C. Perry to Japan in 1853, during which Preble surveyed various harbors in the Far East. After a period as lighthouse inspector and at Charlestown Navy Yard, he served on , 1859‚Äì1861, then took command of the steam-gunboat , serving with David Farragut on the Mississippi River, was promoted to commander on July 16, 1862, and given command of the steam-sloop blockading Mobile Bay. When the Confederate cruiser eluded him, Preble was dismissed from the Navy, but was reinstated after the captain of Florida testified that superior speed alone had saved him. Additionally, each of the officers on Oneida testified that Preble had done no wrong. According to their accounts, Florida appeared at around 5:00 PM on September 4, 1862 bearing the ensign of a ship of the English Navy. Preble was in command of Oneida and . Because the other ships were in for repairs, the usual complement of six ships had been reduced to two. Winona had been dispatched to chase another blockade runner and was returning from that chase when Florida began her run. One of Oneidas iron boilers had been shut down for repairs leaving only one in operation. (One of the officers stated that the Navy's choice to use cheaper iron rather than steel was the actual cause of the problem.) When Florida began her run, Preble moved to placeOneida in front of Florida. At 6:00 PM, he ordered shots fired across her bow. Believing that the ship was English, two warning shots were fired over her bow and a third shot into her forefoot (The part of a ship at which the prow joins the keel) instead of the customary single warning shot. All three shots were fired within three minutes of her being in range of Oneidas guns. When Florida did not stop, Preble ordered the fourth shot be sent into the enemy ship. This shot missed, at which time Florida lowered her false ensign, and made directly for Fort Morgan. It was not until this point that Preble could be sure that the ship was a Confederate vessel. With one boiler out of commission, Oneida was unable to keep pace with Florida, which escaped into the bay. However, Oneida kept up fire on the ship for 29 minutes until it was safely under the protection of Fort Morgan. In addition to the speed issue, the reports state that there were some visibility issues that contributed to poor marksmanship of Oneidas gun crew. After being reinstated, Preble commanded the sailing sloop , only to have Florida escape him once again, off Madeira. Writing career Preble was also known as a writer on naval and historical topics, and as a collector of naval documents. His extensive personal library of books and documents related to the sea are located in The George Henry Preble Collection at the Navy Department Library. He was also active in various learned and genealogical societies of the time. In 1868, he published a genealogical history of the Preble family in North America, which included his biography and portrait, as well as that of his famous uncle, Edward The book also set forth a defense of his actions that led to his dismissal from the Navy, as well as the efforts of himself and others that led to his exoneration and reinstatement. In 1872, he published his History of the American Flag, which is still cited as a source. He also took care of the original \\"Star-Spangled Banner\\" which had flown over Fort McHenry, and had the flag sewn to a piece of sailcloth in order to preserve it. Later life and death After the war, Preble commanded the steamer , and rescued 600 passengers from the wrecked steamer Golden Rule. He was at the Boston Navy Yard from 1865 to 1868, where he was promoted to captain on March 16, 1867, then commanded the screw steamer until 1870. He became commodore on November 2, 1871, commanded the Philadelphia Navy Yard from 1873 to 1875, became rear admiral on September 30, 1876 and retired in 1878. He was a member of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. In 1873 Preble was elected a member of the American Antiquarian SocietyAmerican Antiquarian Society Members Directory Preble died while living near Boston, Massachusetts, on March 1, 1885. He is buried near his famous uncle in the Eastern Cemetery in Portland, Maine.

History The history of Ogata town is based on ancient Japanese history that includes the legendary hero Ogata no Saburo Koreyoshi. Saburo, feared by many as the \\"descendent of a giant serpent\\", also appears in the Tale of the Heike and is said to have contributed greatly to Minamoto no Yoshitsune's success in the battle of Dan-no-ura. Ogata town is home to three shrines built by Saburo, called \\"Ogata Sansha\\". Saburo himself is enshrined in one of these, called the \\"Ninomiya Hachiman Shrine\\", where his name is still transmitted to today's generation. Ogata no Saburo Koreyoshi's younger brother Ogata Shuma \\"Jiraiya\\" is believed to be the first \\"Ninjia\\" in Japanese folklore. The legend in the \\"Heike Tales\\" refers to Yoshitune's decision to lead his armies in Ky≈´sh≈´. According to Helen Craig McCullough, she references the unique disposition of Minamoto choosing his chief warrior. Ogata no Saburo Koreyoshi commanded the largest armies in Ky≈´sh≈´ and marched in the name of the future sh≈çgun that led to the establishment of the Kamakura period. While establishing the \\"Ogata\\" clan-Saburo also built one of the most famous castles in Ky≈´sh≈´ ‚Äì Oka Castle (ja) for the new sh≈çgun. Today Oka Castle remains in ruins after many wars. However, the legacy of Ogata no Saburo Koreyoshi and the establishment of the Ogata clan in Japan was historic.

In addition to football, he also announced major golf and tennis events. In total, he announced 16 Super Bowls on network television (more than any other announcer), 26 Masters Tournaments, and 21 US Opens. He also contributed to 10 Super Bowl broadcasts on CBS Radio as a pregame host or analyst. Summerall played football for the Arkansas Razorbacks and then in the National Football League (NFL) from 1952 through 1961. He was drafted by the Detroit Lions and played with Bobby Layne. The best playing time in his career was with the New York Giants as a kicker. After retiring as a player, he joined CBS as a color commentator the next year. He worked with Tom Brookshier and then John Madden on NFL telecasts for CBS and Fox. Although retired since 2002, he continued to announce games on occasion, especially those near his Texas home. He was named the National Sportscaster of the Year by the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association in 1977, and inducted into their Hall of Fame in 1994. That year, he also received the Pete Rozelle Radio-Television Award from the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the American Sportscasters Association Hall of Fame in 1999. The \\"Pat Summerall Award\\" has been presented since 2006 during Super Bowl weekend at the NFL's headquarters hotel \\"to a deserving recipient who through their career has demonstrated the character, integrity and leadership both on and off the job that the name Pat Summerall represents.\\" Football career=High school At Columbia High School, Lake City, Florida, Summerall played football, tennis, baseball, and basketball.Summerall and Levin, 2010 pg. 24‚Äì25 Although basketball was his favorite sport, he was recognized as an All-State selection in basketball and football.Summerall and Levin, 2010 pg. 25 He was inducted into the FHSAA Hall of Fame and was later named to the FHSAA's All-Century Team. College Summerall played college football from 1949 to 1951 at the University of Arkansas, where he played defensive end, tight end, and placekicker positions for the Arkansas Razorbacks. He graduated in 1953 majoring in Russian history, according to CBS News. Professional Summerall on a 1955 Bowman football card Summerall spent ten years as a professional football player in the National Football League, primarily as a placekicker. The Detroit Lions drafted Summerall as a fourth-round draft choice in the 1952 NFL Draft.Summerall and Levin, 2010 pg. 27 Summerall played the pre-season with the Lions before breaking his arm, which ended the year for him.Summerall and Levin, 2010 pg. 28‚Äì29 After that season, he was traded and went on to play for the Chicago Cardinals from 1953 to 1957 and the New York Giants from 1958 to 1961, during which he was a part of The Greatest Game Ever Played. His best professional year statistically was 1959, when Summerall scored 90 points on 30-for-30 (100%) extra-point kicking and 20-for-29 (69%) field goal kicking. Summerall's most memorable professional moment may well have been at the very end of the December 14, 1958 regular season finale between his Giants and the Cleveland Browns at Yankee Stadium. Going into the game, the Browns were in first place in the Eastern Conference, holding a one-game lead over the second-place Giants. In that era, there was no overtime during regular season games, standings ties were broken by a playoff, and there were no wild-card teams. This meant that only the Eastern Conference champion would qualify for the NFL Championship Game to be held two weeks later, and it meant that the Giants had to win just to force a tiebreaker playoff game. The Browns, on the other hand, needed only a tie to clinch the Eastern championship. As time was running out, the Giants and Browns were tied, 10‚Äì10, a situation that, as indicated, favored the Browns. The Giants got barely into Cleveland territory, then sent out Summerall to try for a tiebreaking 49-yard field goal. To add to the drama, there were swirling winds and snow. Summerall, a straight-ahead kicker, made the field goal with just two minutes to play, keeping the Giants alive for another week (they defeated Cleveland a week later, 10‚Äì0, in the Eastern Conference tiebreaker playoff before losing the sudden-death league championship final to Baltimore the week after that). The Giants' offensive coach, Vince Lombardi, was against sending Summerall inMaraniss, 1999 pg. 183 (Summerall missed a 31-yard attempt a few minutes earlier), then gleefully greeted Summerall as he came off the field, \\"You son of a bitch, you can‚Äôt kick it that far!\\"Summerall and Levin, 2010 pg. 107Maraniss, 1999 pg. 184 Sports Illustrated ran the story as one of its primary articles the next week, with a leading photograph showing the football heading between the uprights through the snow.\\"Summerall's 49 Yarder Puts Giants in Playoff\\", The Daytona Beach Morning Journal, December 15, 1958, p. 10. His last professional game was the December 31, 1961 NFL Championship Game held at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Lombardi's Green Bay Packers defeated Summerall's Giants, 37‚Äì0, holding New York to just six first downs. Summerall was not a factor in that game. The urban legend was his nickname became \\"Pat\\" because of the abbreviation for \\"point after touchdown\\" that a field-goal kicker was credited for in a game summary. But in a 1997 Dallas Morning News story, Summerall said after his parents divorced, he was taken in by an aunt and uncle who had a son named Mike. \\"My aunt and uncle just started calling me Pat to go with their Mike\\", Summerall would say, referencing frequently named characters in Irish jokes told during that time. Broadcasting career In the early 1960s, Summerall was the morning host on WCBS (AM) radio in New York City. He left the job when WINS went all-news in 1965. He also co-hosted the syndicated NFL Films series This Week in Pro Football in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Summerall was also associated with a production company in Dallas from about 1998 through 2005 which was called Pat Summerall Productions. He was featured in and hosted various production shows, such as Summerall Success Stories and Champions of Industry. These qualified production segments would air on the Fox News Channel and later, CNN Headline News. During the mid-1990s, Summerall hosted the \\"Summerall-Aikman\\" Cowboys report with quarterback Troy Aikman. Summerall served as the host of Sports Stars of Tomorrow and Future Phenoms, two nationally syndicated high school sports shows based out of Fort Worth, Texas. Following their dismissal of announcer Harry Caray in 1969, the St. Louis Cardinals baseball team considered hiring Summerall to be their new radio voice. CBS SportsNFL= After retiring from football, Summerall was hired by CBS Sports in 1962 to work as a color commentator on the network's NFL coverage. CBS initially paired Summerall with Chris Schenkel on Giants games; three years later he shifted to working with Jim Gibbons on Washington Redskins games. In 1968, after CBS abandoned the practice of assigning dedicated announcing crews to particular NFL teams, Summerall ascended to the network's lead national crew, pairing with Jack Buck and then Ray Scott. For the postgame coverage of the very first Super Bowl at the end of the 1967 season (which was simulcast by CBS and NBC), the trophy presentation ceremony was handled by CBS' Summerall (who worked as a reporter, while CBS' game coverage was called by Ray Scott, Jack Whitaker and Frank Gifford) and NBC's George Ratterman. Summerall and Ratterman were forced to share a single microphone. In 1969, Summerall took part in NBC's coverage of Super Bowl III. NBC used Summerall to provide an \\"NFL perspective\\" on the coverage. This was due in part to the fact that NBC was at the time, the network television provider of the American Football League (whereas CBS was the network television provider for the pre-merger National Football League). In return, for CBS Radio's coverage of Super Bowls I, II and IV, they used Tom Hedrick, normally the radio voice of the Kansas City Chiefs, to provide an \\"AFL perspective\\" for their coverage. Midway through the 1974 NFL season, CBS shifted Summerall from color to play-by-play. The network's #1 NFL crew now consisted of Summerall and analyst Tom Brookshier (with whom he had previously worked on This Week in Pro Football), and the colorful Summerall-Brookshier duo worked three Super Bowls (X, XII, and XIV) together. Summerall, Brookshier, NFL on CBS producer Bob Wussler, and Miami Dolphins owner Joe Robbie appeared as themselves during the 1977 film Black Sunday, which was filmed on location at the Orange Bowl in Miami during Super Bowl X. In 1981, Summerall was teamed with former Oakland Raiders coach John Madden, a pairing that would last for 22 seasons on two networks and become one of the most well-known partnerships in TV sportscasting history. Summerall and Madden were first teamed on a November 25, 1979 broadcast of a Minnesota Vikings‚ÄìTampa Bay Buccaneers game. While the two were paired on CBS, they called Super Bowls XVI, XVIII, XXI, XXIV, and XXVI together. It is often mistakenly assumed that Summerall and Madden handled the call on CBS-TV for the 1981 NFC Championship Game, when San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Dwight Clark made \\"The Catch\\" to lift the 49ers to a 28‚Äì27 victory over the Dallas Cowboys and a berth in Super Bowl XVI. Instead, CBS' #2 broadcast team of Vin Scully and Hank Stram handled the broadcast while Madden was given the weekend off to travel to Pontiac, Michigan for the game and to prepare for the broadcast. Since Stram was Jack Buck's color commentator on CBS Radio, Summerall substituted for Stram as Buck's partner; this was the first time Buck and Summerall had called a game together since 1974, when then-lead color commentator Summerall was moved off of Buck's team to become CBS television's lead play-by-play voice for the NFL. During the 1982 NFL strike, CBS' NCAA football contract required the network to show four Division III games. CBS initially intended to show those games on Saturday afternoons, with only the interested markets receiving the broadcasts. However, with no NFL games to show on Sunday October 3, 1982 due to the strike, CBS decided to show all of its NCAA Division III games on a single Sunday afternoon in front of a mass audience. CBS used its regular NFL crews (Pat Summerall and John Madden at Wittenberg‚ÄìBaldwin‚ÄìWallace, Tom Brookshier and Wayne Walker at West Georgia‚ÄìMillsaps, Tim Ryan and Johnny Morris at Wisconsin‚ÄìOshkosh ‚Äì Wisconsin‚ÄìStout, and Dick Stockton and Roger Staubach at San Diego‚ÄìOccidental) and showed The NFL Today instead of using their regular college football broadcasters. Summerall's stature as pro football's premier television broadcaster was a result of two things: first, his ability to play the \\"straight man\\" alongside John Madden's lively, verbose persona; second, his economical delivery that magnified the drama of a moment while allowing the pictures and his baritone-like voice to tell the story. His style was closely modeled on that of his predecessor as CBS' main NFL announcer, Ray Scott, also known for his minimalist style. One of Summerall's most memorable on-air calls was his account of Marcus Allen's electrifying touchdown run in Super Bowl XVIII. That the call is memorable despite its sparseness is testament to the weight of Summerall's voice when he was at the height of his powers as an NFL broadcaster. This was a hallmark of his broadcasting career. For example, he usually called a Joe Montana to Jerry Rice touchdown pass with simple calls like \\"Montana......Rice.... Touchdown!\\" His last game alongside Madden for CBS (before the NFC television contract moved over to Fox) was the 1993 NFC Championship Game (which saw the Dallas Cowboys defeat the San Francisco 49ers in Irving, Texas to go to Super Bowl XXVIII against the Buffalo Bills in Atlanta). =Other CBS Sports assignments= Summerall also covered other events such as ABA for CBS during this period. Through 1966, he hosted a morning drive-time music/talk program for WCBS-AM radio in New York. Summerall also broadcast PGA Tour golf tournaments on CBS, including the Masters Tournament, as well as the US Open of tennis, during his tenure at CBS with Tony Trabert, and he was the play-by- play announcer for the 1974 NBA Finals (working alongside Rick Barry and Rod Hundley), CBS' first season broadcasting the NBA on CBS. In 1975, Summerall hosted the Pan American Games in Mexico, and in 1976 he teamed with Tom Brookshier to call some heavyweight boxing matches for CBS. Summerall broadcast his first Masters in 1968, when he anchored the coverage at hole 18. In 1983, Summerall replaced Vin Scully (who had left CBS to work for NBC on their Major League Baseball and golf coverage) in the 18th hole tower role (a role that Scully was in since 1975). Summerall's broadcast partner during this period was Ken Venturi. From 1969‚Äì1973, Summerall broadcast CBS' National Invitation Tournament coverage with Don Criqui. In 1985, Summerall once again called college basketball, working NCAA men's tournament games for CBS with Larry Conley. In 1970, Summerall and then-Boston Bruins' TV announcer Don Earle did a short postgame segment from inside the team's dressing room at the end of CBS' coverage of the fourth (and what turned out to be the final) game of the 1970 Stanley Cup Finals. WSBK-38, the Bruins' TV flagship at the time, simulcast the CBS coverage and did a longer post-game locker-room segment after CBS' coverage ended. After Bobby Orr scored the championship-winning goal after just 40 seconds, so the story went, Summerall turned to Bobby's father, Doug Orr (who was reportedly, too nervous to go back to his seat from the Bruins' dressing room for the start of overtime) and yelled over the crowd in the stands above \\"Mr. Orr, your son has scored and Boston has won the Stanley Cup!\\" Doug Orr is said to have told Summerall \\"I know Boston scored, but we didn't see it! What makes you think my son scored?\\" Summerall supposedly replied \\"Because they wouldn't be yelling this loudly if (Phil) Esposito (another high-scoring Boston player of the era) had scored!\\" Summerall also called at least one Professional Bowlers Association event, which was the 1975 Brunswick World Open. On April 15, 1987, Summerall did color commentary alongside Steve Stone for a Chicago Cubs-Pittsburgh Pirates baseball game on WGN-TV. This was during time period in which the Cubs' normal television announcer, Harry Caray, was recovering from a stroke. Thus, for about the first two months of the 1987 season, WGN featured a series of celebrity guest announcers on game telecasts while Caray recuperated.http://chicago.epguides.com/Cubs/guestannouncers.asp He also broadcast the US Open Tennis Tournament for CBS with Tony Trabert for 25 years. Summerall's last on-air assignment for CBS Sports was the 1994 Masters Tournament. Summerall signed off the broadcast thus, surrounded by the other CBS commentators that were working the tournament: Fox Sports In 1994, the Fox network surprised NFL fans by outbidding CBS for the NFC broadcast package. One of the network's first moves was to hire Summerall and Madden as its lead announcing team. While at Fox the pair called Super Bowls XXXI, XXXIII, and XXXVI together. The long-time partnership ended after Super Bowl XXXVI in early 2002, as Summerall had announced he would be retiring from announcing and Madden's contract had expired. Summerall was lured out of retirement and re-signed with Fox for the 2002 season because Ray Bentley was let go. However, since Madden had left to take over the color commentator position on Monday Night Football from Dan Fouts and Dennis Miller for ABC and Fox had promoted Joe Buck to be its number one NFL play-by-play voice (Troy Aikman and, until 2004, Cris Collinsworth replaced Madden as Fox's lead NFL color commentators), Summerall was paired with Brian Baldinger on regional telecasts. Most of the games Summerall covered featured the Dallas Cowboys, due in part to his residency in the city. One of the games Summerall called was the Cowboys' game against the Seattle Seahawks at Texas Stadium, in which Emmitt Smith broke Walter Payton's career rushing yardage record. Summerall was joined by Daryl Johnston, who at the time was working as Fox's #2 color man with Dick Stockton and who was a longtime teammate of Smith's with the Cowboys, for this game. Summerall retired again following the 2002 season but in 2006, he served as a substitute for Kenny Albert alongside Baldinger for the Week 8 (October 29) game between the eventual NFC champion Chicago Bears and the San Francisco 49ers. Summerall returned for one game the following year to take Stockton's place alongside Baldinger and provide the play-by-play for the December 9, 2007 game between the Cincinnati Bengals and St. Louis Rams in Cincinnati. From 2007 until 2010, Summerall appeared as the play-by- play voice of the network's coverage of the Cotton Bowl Classic game. Summerall teamed with Brian Baldinger on the 2007‚Äì09 Cotton Bowl Classic telecasts, and worked with Daryl Johnston on the 2010 game between Ole Miss and Oklahoma State. In 2011, Summerall appeared on the pregame coverage of the Cotton Bowl. Post-Fox In the 2000s, Summerall provided voiceover sponsorship credits for the CBS Masters golf telecasts, and voice-overs for game coverage on NFL Network. He also provided game commentary for the Golden Tee Golf video game series and narrated the first episode of the WrestleMania Rewind series for the WWE Network (a role that would be assumed by Gary Thorne upon Summerall's death). =NFL on ESPN= Summerall called several preseason and early regular-season NFL games for the ESPN network in 2004, substituting for regular announcer Mike Patrick while the latter recovered from heart surgery. =Sports Stars of Tomorrow= As previously mentioned, Summerall hosted this syndicated program dedicated to high school and collegiate athletics from 2005 to 2012. Charles Davis assumed hosting duties in 2012. Awards and honors The National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association named Summerall National Sportscaster of the Year in 1977, and inducted him into its Hall of Fame in 1994. Summerall was the 1994 recipient of the Pete Rozelle Radio-Television Award, bestowed by the Pro Football Hall of Fame \\"for longtime exceptional contributions to radio and television in professional football\\". In 1999, he was inducted into the American Sportscasters Association Hall of Fame. Since 2006, the \\"Pat Summerall Award\\" has been presented at the annual Legends for Charity Luncheon given on Super Bowl weekend at the NFL's headquarters hotel in the host city. The award is given \\"to a deserving recipient who through their career has demonstrated the character, integrity and leadership both on and off the job that the name Pat Summerall represents.\\" Recipients have included James Brown (2006), Greg Gumbel (2007), Jim Nantz (2008), Chris Berman (2009), Cris Collinsworth (2010), the entire Fox NFL crew (2011), Al Michaels (2012), Archie Manning (2013), Michael Strahan (2014), Joe Buck (2015), John Madden (2016), Rich Eisen (2017) and Tony Dungy (2018).http://www.prnewswire.com/news- releases/rich-eisen-honored-with-the-2017-pat-summerall-award-during-super- bowl-li-week-at-legends-for-charity-dinner-300408028.html Health issues During the 1990 season, Summerall was hospitalized with a bleeding ulcer after vomiting on a plane during a flight after a Bears‚ÄìRedskins game, and was out for a considerable amount of time. While Verne Lundquist replaced Summerall on games with Madden, Jack Buck (who was at CBS during the time as the network's lead Major League Baseball announcer) was added as a regular NFL broadcaster to fill-in. In the spring of 2004, Summerall, a recovering alcoholic, underwent a liver transplant. Summerall at one point preached a sermon at Travis Avenue Baptist Church in Ft. Worth, Texas. He also was a featured speaker at the Men's Gideon Conference in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, in which he related his giving his life to Christ during his stay at the Betty Ford Clinic during his recovery from alcoholism. In 2006, Pat Summerall underwent cataract surgery, and had an intraocular lens implanted.\\"Pat Summerall and Crystalens\\" . In January 2008, Summerall had a hip replacement surgery. On June 19, 2008, he was hospitalized for internal bleeding caused by a new medicine he was taking.Broadcaster Summerall, 78, resting after surgery Death Summerall checked into St. Paul University Hospital in Dallas, Texas, for surgery on a broken hip. He died there on April 16, 2013, of cardiac arrest at age 82. After his death, Jerry Jones referred to Summerall as \\"royalty in the broadcast booth\\" while Madden called him \\"a great broadcaster and a great man\\" and added that \\"Pat Summerall is the voice of football and always will be.\\" Fellow broadcasters Jim Nantz and Verne Lundquist also made statements on Summerall's life. A few days later, CBS Sports presented a tribute to Summerall during their coverage of the RBC Heritage golf event. Nantz and Gary McCord presented highlights of his life and career ‚Äì both as a player and at CBS ‚Äì ending with his 1994 Masters sign-off. During a Fox NASCAR broadcast Chris Myers paid tribute to Summerall for Fox. Outside sports broadcasting For many years Summerall was a commercial spokesperson for True Value, often ending advertisements with his tag line \\"and tell 'em Pat Summerall sent you\\". Ironically, his long-time broadcast partner Madden was the spokesperson for Ace Hardware, True Value's main competitor in the independent hardware store market. Summerall served as the longtime radio spokesman for the Dux Beds company, a Swedish maker of mattresses, and its \\"Duxiana\\" stores. Summerall started doing work as a commentator for the Madden NFL video game franchise in the game John Madden Football '92. His voice was subsequently featured in all the games in the Madden franchise from 1994-2002.https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0838619/filmotype?ref_=nm_flmg_shw_1#self_game Summerall also provided commentary, alongside Madden, on Cartoon Network's annual Super Bowl parodies, The Big Game, from 1998 through 2001. Summerall was name-checked on The Simpsons in the episode \\"Springfield Up\\", where his caricature and name appear on the cover of a book held by Homer Simpson titled \\"Smut Yuks.\\" Summerall and his partner John Madden also appeared in (and lent their voices to) the Simpsons episode \\"Sunday, Cruddy Sunday\\", which premiered following the duo's broadcast of Super Bowl XXXIII on Fox in 1999, and on the same night Summerall appeared on the Family Guy premiere episode \\"Death Has a Shadow\\". The pair was also featured in the movie The Replacements, calling the games of the Washington Sentinels on their run to the playoffs. Summerall is referenced in the Season 4 Gilmore Girls episode, \\"The Lorelais' First Day at Yale.\\" Summerall appeared in the music video for Forever the Sickest Kids' 2010 single \\"She Likes (Bittersweet Love)\\".

Kino- ap.eng.hokudai.ac.jp (2013-11-28). Retrieved on 2013-12-09. A surface acoustic wave (SAW) is an acoustic wave traveling along the surface of a material exhibiting elasticity, with an amplitude that typically decays exponentially with depth into the material. Discovery SAWs were first explained in 1885 by Lord Rayleigh, who described the surface acoustic mode of propagation and predicted its properties in his classic paper. Named after their discoverer, Rayleigh waves have a longitudinal and a vertical shear component that can couple with any media in contact with the surface. This coupling strongly affects the amplitude and velocity of the wave, allowing SAW sensors to directly sense mass and mechanical properties. SAW devices SAW devices use SAW in electronic components to provide a number of different functions, including delay lines, filters, correlators and DC to DC converters. Application in electronic components This kind of wave is commonly used in devices called SAW devices in electronic circuits. SAW devices are used as filters, oscillators and transformers, devices that are based on the transduction of acoustic waves. The transduction from electric energy to mechanical energy (in the form of SAWs) is accomplished by the use of piezoelectric materials. Schematic picture of a typical SAW device design Electronic devices employing SAWs normally use one or more interdigital transducers (IDTs) to convert acoustic waves to electrical signals and vice versa by exploiting the piezoelectric effect of certain materials (quartz, lithium niobate, lithium tantalate, lanthanum gallium silicate, etc.). These devices are fabricated by photolithography, the process used in the manufacture of silicon integrated circuits. SAW filters are now used in mobile telephones, and provide significant advantages in performance, cost, and size over other filter technologies such as quartz crystals (based on bulk waves), LC filters, and waveguide filters. Much research has been done in the last 20 years in the area of surface acoustic wave sensors. Sensor applications include all areas of sensing (such as chemical, optical, thermal, pressure, acceleration, torque and biological). SAW sensors have seen relatively modest commercial success to date, but are commonly commercially available for some applications such as touchscreen displays. SAW device applications in radio and television SAW resonators are used in many of the same applications in which quartz crystals are used, because they can operate at higher frequency. They are often used in radio transmitters where tunability is not required. They are often used in applications such as garage door opener remote controls, short range radio frequency links for computer peripherals, and other devices where channelization is not required. Where a radio link might use several channels, quartz crystal oscillators are more commonly used to drive a phase locked loop. Since the resonant frequency of a SAW device is set by the mechanical properties of the crystal, it does not drift as much as a simple LC oscillator, where conditions such as capacitor performance and battery voltage will vary substantially with temperature and age. SAW filters are also often used in radio receivers, as they can have precisely determined and narrow passbands. This is helpful in applications where a single antenna must be shared between a transmitter and a receiver operating at closely spaced frequencies. SAW filters are also frequently used in television receivers, for extracting subcarriers from the signal; until the analog switchoff, the extraction of digital audio subcarriers from the intermediate frequency strip of a television receiver or video recorder was one of the main markets for SAW filters. Early pioneer Jeffery Collins incorporated surface acoustic wave devices in a Skynet receiver he developed in the 1970s. It synchronised signals faster than existing technology. They are also often used in digital receivers, and are well suited to superhet applications. This is because the intermediate frequency signal is always at a fixed frequency after the local oscillator has been mixed with the received signal, and so a filter with a fixed frequency and high Q provides excellent removal of unwanted or interference signals. In these applications, SAW filters are almost always used with a phase locked loop synthesized local oscillator, or a varicap driven oscillator. SAW in geophysics In seismology surface acoustic waves travelling along the Earth's surface play an important role, since they can be the most destructive type of seismic wave produced by earthquakes. SAW in microfluidics In recent years, attention has been drawn to using SAWs to drive microfluidic actuation and a variety of other processes. Owing to the mismatch of sound velocities in the SAW substrate and fluid, SAWs can be efficiently transferred into the fluid, creating significant inertial forces and fluid velocities. This mechanism can be exploited to drive fluid actions such as pumping, mixing, and jetting.[8] To drive these processes, there is a change of mode of the wave at the liquid-substrate interface. In the substrate, the SAW wave is a transverse wave and upon entering the droplet the wave becomes a longitudinal wave.[9] It is this longitudinal wave that creates the flow of fluid within the microfluidic droplet, allowing mixing to take place. This technique can be used as an alternative to microchannels and microvalves for manipulation of substrates, allowing for an open system. This mechanism has also been used in droplet-based microfluidics for droplet manipulation. Notably, using SAW as an actuation mechanism, droplets were pushed towards two or more outlets for sorting. Moreover, SAWs were used for droplet size modulation, splitting, trapping, tweezing, and nanofluidic pipetting. Droplet impact on flat and inclined surfaces has been manipulated and controlled using SAW . PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) is a material that can be used to create microchannels and microfluidic chips. It has many uses, including in experiments where living cells are to be tested or processed. If living organisms need to be kept alive, it is important to monitor and control their environment, such as heat and pH levels; however, if these elements are not regulated, the cells may die or it may result in unwanted reactions. PDMS has been found to absorb acoustic energy, causing the PDMS to heat up quickly (exceeding 2000 Kelvin/second). The use of SAW as a way to heat these PDMS devices, along with liquids inside microchannels, is now a technique that can be done in a controlled manner with the ability to manipulate the temperature to within 0.1 ¬∞C. SAW in flow measurement Surface acoustic waves can be used for flow measurement. SAW relies on the propagation of a wave front, which appears similar to seismic activities. The waves are generated at the excitation centre and spread out along the surface of a solid material. An electric pulse induces them to generate SAWs that propagate like the waves of an earthquake. Interdigital transducer acts as sender and as receiver. When one is in sender mode, the two most distant ones act as receivers. The SAWs travel along the surface of the measuring tube, but a portion will couple out to the liquid. The decoupling angle depends on the liquid respectively the propagation velocity of the wave which is specific to the liquid. On the other side of the measuring tube, portions of the wave will couple into the tube and continue their way along its surface to the next interdigital transducer. Another portion will be coupled out again and travels back to the other side of the measuring tube where the effect repeats itself and the transducer on this side detects the wave. That means excitation of any one transducer here will lead to a sequence of input signals on two other transducers in the distance. Two of the transducers send their signals in the direction of flow, two in the other direction.Product from B√ºrkert Fluid Control Systems http://www.processindustryforum.com/article/patented-flow-meter-saw- technology-accurate-flow-measurement-hygienic-applications See also * Linear elasticity * Love wave * Phonon * Picosecond ultrasonics * Ultrasound ReferencesExternal links * History of SAW Devices * SAW Sensor * Watching ripples on crystals Category:Surface waves Category:Microtechnology ","title":"Surface acoustic wave"},{"id":"459847","text":"An email box folder filled with spam messages. Email spam, also referred to as junk email, is unsolicited messages sent in bulk by email (spamming). The name comes from a Monty Python sketch in which Spam is ubiquitous, unavoidable, and repetitive. Email spam has steadily grown since the early 1990s, and by 2014 was estimated to account for around 90% of total email traffic. Since the expense of the spam is borne mostly by the recipient, it is effectively postage due advertising. This makes it an excellent example of a negative externality. The legal definition and status of spam varies from one jurisdiction to another, but nowhere have laws and lawsuits been particularly successful in stemming spam. Most email spam messages are commercial in nature. Whether commercial or not, many are not only annoying, but also dangerous because they may contain links that lead to phishing web sites or sites that are hosting malware - or include malware as file attachments. Spammers collect email addresses from chat rooms, websites, customer lists, newsgroups, and viruses that harvest users' address books. These collected email addresses are sometimes also sold to other spammers. Overview At the beginning of the Internet (the ARPANET), sending of commercial email was prohibited. Gary Thuerk sent the first email spam message in 1978 to 600 people. He was reprimanded and told not to do it again.Opening Pandora's In- Box. Now the ban on spam is enforced by the Terms of Service/Acceptable Use Policy (ToS/AUP) of internet service providers (ISPs) and peer pressure. Spam is sent by both reputable organizations and lesser companies. When spam is sent by reputable companies it is sometimes referred to as Mainsleaze. Mainsleaze makes up approximately 3% of the spam sent over the internet. The problem with mainsleaze is that it is generally mixed in with mail that the recipients asked for, and it is difficult to tell the difference using traditional mail filters. As a result, if a mail system filters out all the mail from a mainsleazer, they will get complaints from the people who signed up. It was estimated in 2009 that spam cost businesses around US$130 billion.Ferris Research: Cost of Spam As the scale of the spam problem has grown, ISPs and the public have turned to government for relief from spam, which has failed to materialize.Spam's Cost To Business Escalates Spamvertised sites Many spam emails contain URLs to a website or websites. According to a Cyberoam report in 2014, there are an average of 54 billion spam messages sent every day. \\"Pharmaceutical products (Viagra and the like) jumped up 45% from last quarter‚Äôs analysis, leading this quarter‚Äôs spam pack. Emails purporting to offer jobs with fast, easy cash come in at number two, accounting for approximately 15% of all spam email. And, rounding off at number three are spam emails about diet products (such as Garcinia gummi-gutta or Garcinia Cambogia), accounting for approximately 1%.\\" Spam is also a medium for fraudsters to scam users into entering personal information on fake Web sites using emails forged to look like they are from banks or other organizations, such as PayPal. This is known as phishing. Targeted phishing, where known information about the recipient is used to create forged emails, is known as spear-phishing. Spam techniques=Appending If a marketer has one database containing names, addresses, and telephone numbers of customers, they can pay to have their database matched against an external database containing email addresses. The company then has the means to send email to people who have not requested email, which may include people who have deliberately withheld their email address. Image spam Image spam, or image-based spam,Giorgio Fumera, Ignazio Pillai, Fabio Roli, Journal of Machine Learning Research (special issue on Machine Learning in Computer Security), vol. 7, pp. 2699-2720, 12/2006.Battista Biggio, Giorgio Fumera, Ignazio Pillai, Fabio Roli, Volume 32, Issue 10, 15 July 2011, Pages 1436-1446, ISSN 0167-8655. is an obfuscation method by which text of the message is stored as a GIF or JPEG image and displayed in the email. This prevents text-based spam filters from detecting and blocking spam messages. Image spam was reportedly used in the mid-2000s to advertise \\"pump and dump\\" stocks. Often, image spam contains nonsensical, computer-generated text which simply annoys the reader. However, new technology in some programs tries to read the images by attempting to find text in these images. These programs are not very accurate, and sometimes filter out innocent images of products, such as a box that has words on it. A newer technique, however, is to use an animated GIF image that does not contain clear text in its initial frame, or to contort the shapes of letters in the image (as in CAPTCHA) to avoid detection by optical character recognition tools. Blank spam Blank spam is spam lacking a payload advertisement. Often the message body is missing altogether, as well as the subject line. Still, it fits the definition of spam because of its nature as bulk and unsolicited email. Blank spam may be originated in different ways, either intentional or unintentionally: # Blank spam can have been sent in a directory harvest attack, a form of dictionary attack for gathering valid addresses from an email service provider. Since the goal in such an attack is to use the bounces to separate invalid addresses from the valid ones, spammers may dispense with most elements of the header and the entire message body, and still accomplish their goals. # Blank spam may also occur when a spammer forgets or otherwise fails to add the payload when he or she sets up the spam run. # Often blank spam headers appear truncated, suggesting that computer glitches, such as software bugs or other may have contributed to this problem‚Äîfrom poorly written spam software to malfunctioning relay servers, or any problems that may truncate header lines from the message body. # Some spam may appear to be blank when in fact it is not. An example of this is the VBS.Davinia.B email worm which propagates through messages that have no subject line and appears blank, when in fact it uses HTML code to download other files. Backscatter spam Backscatter is a side-effect of email spam, viruses, and worms. It happens when email servers are misconfigured to send a bogus bounce message to the envelope sender when rejecting or quarantining email (rather than simply rejecting the attempt to send the message). If the sender's address was forged, then the bounce may go to an innocent party. Since these messages were not solicited by the recipients, are substantially similar to each other, and are delivered in bulk quantities, they qualify as unsolicited bulk email or spam. As such, systems that generate email backscatter can end up being listed on various DNSBLs and be in violation of internet service providers' Terms of Service. Legal countermeasures If an individual or organisation can identify harm done to them by spam, and identify who sent it; then they may be able to sue for a legal remedy, e.g. on the basis of trespass to chattels. A number of large civil settlements have been won in this way,e.g. CompuServe Inc. v. Cyber Promotions, Inc., School of Visual Arts v. Kuprewicz although others have been mostly unsuccessful in collecting damages. Criminal prosecution of spammers under fraud or computer crime statutes is also common, particularly if they illegally accessed other computers to create botnets, or the emails were phishing or other forms of criminal fraud.e.g. Sanford Wallace Finally, in most countries specific legislation is in place to make certain forms of spamming a criminal offence, as outlined below: European Union Article 13 of the European Union Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications (2002/58/EC) provides that the EU member states shall take appropriate measures to ensure that unsolicited communications for the purposes of direct marketing are not allowed either without the consent of the subscribers concerned or in respect of subscribers who do not wish to receive these communications, the choice between these options to be determined by national legislation. In the United Kingdom, for example, unsolicited emails cannot be sent to an individual subscriber unless prior permission has been obtained or unless there is a pre-existing commercial relationship between the parties.Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 Canada The Fighting Internet and Wireless Spam Act to fight spam. Australia The Spam Act 2003, which covers some types of email and phone spam. Penalties are up to 10,000 penalty units, or 2,000 penalty units for a person other than a body corporate. United States In the United States, many states enacted anti-spam laws during the late 1990s and early 2000s. All of these were subsequently superseded by the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003,But see, e.g., Hypertouch v. ValueClick, Inc. et al., Cal.App.4th (Google Scholar: January 18, 2011) which was in many cases less restrictive; and any further potential state laws preempted. However, CAN-SPAM leaves intact laws not specific to e-mail. Courts have ruled that spam is, e.g., Trespass to Chattel. Bulk commercial email does not violate CAN-SPAM, provided that it meets certain criteria, e.g., a truthful subject line, no forged information in the headers. If it fails to comply with any of these requirements it is illegal. Those opposing spam greeted the new law with dismay and disappointment, almost immediately dubbing it the \\"You Can Spam\\" Act. In practice, it had a little positive impact. In 2004, less than one percent of spam complied with CAN- SPAM, although a 2005 review by the Federal Trade Commission claimed that the amount of sexually explicit spam had significantly decreased since 2003 and the total volume had begun to level off. Many other observers viewed it as having failed, although there have been several high-profile prosecutions.e.g. Oleg Nikolaenko Deception and fraud Spammers may engage in deliberate fraud to send out their messages. Spammers often use false names, addresses, phone numbers, and other contact information to set up \\"disposable\\" accounts at various Internet service providers. They also often use falsified or stolen credit card numbers to pay for these accounts. This allows them to move quickly from one account to the next as the host ISPs discover and shut down each one. Senders may go to great lengths to conceal the origin of their messages. Large companies may hire another firm to send their messages so that complaints or blocking of email falls on a third party. Others engage in spoofing of email addresses (much easier than IP address spoofing). The email protocol (SMTP) has no authentication by default, so the spammer can pretend to originate a message apparently from any email address. To prevent this, some ISPs and domains require the use of SMTP-AUTH, allowing positive identification of the specific account from which an email originates. Senders cannot completely spoof email delivery chains (the 'Received' header), since the receiving mailserver records the actual connection from the last mailserver's IP address. To counter this, some spammers forge additional delivery headers to make it appear as if the email had previously traversed many legitimate servers. Spoofing can have serious consequences for legitimate email users. Not only can their email inboxes get clogged up with \\"undeliverable\\" emails in addition to volumes of spam, but they can mistakenly be identified as a spammer. Not only may they receive irate email from spam victims, but (if spam victims report the email address owner to the ISP, for example) a na√Øve ISP may terminate their service for spamming. Theft of service Spammers frequently seek out and make use of vulnerable third-party systems such as open mail relays and open proxy servers. SMTP forwards mail from one server to another‚Äîmail servers that ISPs run commonly require some form of authentication to ensure that the user is a customer of that ISP. Increasingly, spammers use networks of malware-infected PCs (zombies) to send their spam. Zombie networks are also known as botnets (such zombifying malware is known as a bot, short for robot). In June 2006, an estimated 80 percent of email spam was sent by zombie PCs, an increase of 30 percent from the prior year. An estimated 55 billion email spam were sent each day in June 2006, an increase of 25 billion per day from June 2005. For the first quarter of 2010, an estimated 305,000 newly activated zombie PCs were brought online each day for malicious activity. This number is slightly lower than the 312,000 of the fourth quarter of 2009. Brazil produced the most zombies in the first quarter of 2010. Brazil was the source of 20 percent of all zombies, which is down from 14 percent from the fourth quarter of 2009. India had 10 percent, with Vietnam at 8 percent, and the Russian Federation at 7 percent. Side effects To combat the problems posed by botnets, open relays, and proxy servers, many email server administrators pre-emptively block dynamic IP ranges and impose stringent requirements on other servers wishing to deliver mail. Forward-confirmed reverse DNS must be correctly set for the outgoing mail server and large swaths of IP addresses are blocked, sometimes pre- emptively, to prevent spam. These measures can pose problems for those wanting to run a small email server off an inexpensive domestic connection. Blacklisting of IP ranges due to spam emanating from them also causes problems for legitimate email servers in the same IP range. Statistics and estimates The total volume of email spam has been consistently growing, but in 2011 the trend seemed to reverse. The amount of spam that users see in their mailboxes is only a portion of total spam sent, since spammers' lists often contain a large percentage of invalid addresses and many spam filters simply delete or reject \\"obvious spam\\". The first known spam email, advertising a DEC product presentation, was sent in 1978 by Gary Thuerk to 600 addresses, the total number of users on ARPANET was 2600 at the time though software limitations meant only slightly more than half of the intended recipients actually received it. As of August 2010, the number of spam messages sent per day was estimated to be around 200 billion. More than 97% of all emails sent over the Internet in 2008 were unwanted, according to a Microsoft security report. MAAWG estimates that 85% of incoming mail is \\"abusive email\\", as of the second half of 2007. The sample size for the MAAWG's study was over 100 million mailboxes. In 2018 with growing affiliation networks & email frauds worldwide about 90% of global email traffic is spam as per IPwarmup.com study, which also effects legitimate email senders to achieve inbox delivery. A 2010 survey of US and European email users showed that 46% of the respondents had opened spam messages, although only 11% had clicked on a link. Highest amount of spam received According to Steve Ballmer in 2004, Microsoft founder Bill Gates receives four million emails per year, most of them spam. This was originally incorrectly reported as \\"per day\\". the date provided is for the original article; the date of revision for the republication is 8 June 2005; verification that content of the republication is the same as the original article is pending. At the same time Jef Poskanzer, owner of the domain name acme.com, was receiving over one million spam emails per day. Cost of spam A 2004 survey estimated that lost productivity costs Internet users in the United States $21.58 billion annually, while another reported the cost at $17 billion, up from $11 billion in 2003. In 2004, the worldwide productivity cost of spam has been estimated to be $50 billion in 2005.Spam Costs Billions Origin of spam Because of the international nature of spam, the spammer, the hijacked spam-sending computer, the spamvertised server, and the user target of the spam are all often located in different countries. As much as 80% of spam received by Internet users in North America and Europe can be traced to fewer than 200 spammers.Register of Known Spam Operations (ROKSO). In terms of volume of spam: According to Sophos, the major sources of spam in the fourth quarter of 2008 (October to December) were: *The United States (the origin of 19.8% of spam messages, up from 18.9% in Q3) *China (9.9%, up from 5.4%) *Russia (6.4%, down from 8.3%) *Brazil (6.3%, up from 4.5%) *Turkey (4.4%, down from 8.2%) When grouped by continents, spam comes mostly from: *Asia (37.8%, down from 39.8%) *North America (23.6%, up from 21.8%) *Europe (23.4%, down from 23.9%) *South America (12.9%, down from 13.2%) In terms of number of IP addresses: the Spamhaus Project ranks the top three as the United States, China, and Russia, followed by Japan, Canada, and South Korea. In terms of networks: , the three networks hosting the most spammers are Verizon, AT&T;, and VSNL International. Verizon inherited many of these spam sources from its acquisition of MCI, specifically through the UUNet subsidiary of MCI, which Verizon subsequently renamed Verizon Business. Anti-spam techniques The U.S. Department of Energy Computer Incident Advisory Capability (CIAC) has provided specific countermeasures against email spamming. Some popular methods for filtering and refusing spam include email filtering based on the content of the email, DNS-based blackhole lists (DNSBL), greylisting, spamtraps, enforcing technical requirements of email (SMTP), checksumming systems to detect bulk email, and by putting some sort of cost on the sender via a proof- of-work system or a micropayment. Each method has strengths and weaknesses and each is controversial because of its weaknesses. For example, one company's offer to \\"[remove] some spamtrap and honeypot addresses\\" from email lists defeats the ability for those methods to identify spammers. Outbound spam protection combines many of the techniques to scan messages exiting out of a service provider's network, identify spam, and taking action such as blocking the message or shutting off the source of the message. Email authentication to prevent \\"From:\\" address spoofing became popular in the 2010s. Methods of spammers=Gathering of addresses In order to send spam, spammers need to obtain the email addresses of the intended recipients. To this end, both spammers themselves and list merchants gather huge lists of potential email addresses. Since spam is, by definition, unsolicited, this address harvesting is done without the consent (and sometimes against the expressed will) of the address owners. A single spam run may target tens of millions of possible addresses ‚Äì many of which are invalid, malformed, or undeliverable. Obfuscating message content Many spam-filtering techniques work by searching for patterns in the headers or bodies of messages. For instance, a user may decide that all email they receive with the word \\"Viagra\\" in the subject line is spam, and instruct their mail program to automatically delete all such messages. To defeat such filters, the spammer may intentionally misspell commonly filtered words or insert other characters, often in a style similar to leetspeak, as in the following examples: , , , , . This also allows for many different ways to express a given word, making identifying them all more difficult for filter software. The principle of this method is to leave the word readable to humans (who can easily recognize the intended word for such misspellings), but not likely to be recognized by a computer program. This is only somewhat effective, because modern filter patterns have been designed to recognize blacklisted terms in the various iterations of misspelling. Other filters target the actual obfuscation methods, such as the non-standard use of punctuation or numerals into unusual places. Similarly, HTML-based email gives the spammer more tools to obfuscate text. Inserting HTML comments between letters can foil some filters. Another common ploy involves presenting the text as an image, which is either sent along or loaded from a remote server. Defeating Bayesian filters  As Bayesian filtering has become popular as a spam-filtering technique, spammers have started using methods to weaken it. To a rough approximation, Bayesian filters rely on word probabilities. If a message contains many words that are used only in spam, and few that are never used in spam, it is likely to be spam. To weaken Bayesian filters, some spammers, alongside the sales pitch, now include lines of irrelevant, random words, in a technique known as Bayesian poisoning. Spam-support services A number of other online activities and business practices are considered by anti-spam activists to be connected to spamming. These are sometimes termed spam-support services: business services, other than the actual sending of spam itself, which permit the spammer to continue operating. Spam-support services can include processing orders for goods advertised in spam, hosting Web sites or DNS records referenced in spam messages, or a number of specific services as follows: Some Internet hosting firms advertise bulk-friendly or bulletproof hosting. This means that, unlike most ISPs, they will not terminate a customer for spamming. These hosting firms operate as clients of larger ISPs, and many have eventually been taken offline by these larger ISPs as a result of complaints regarding spam activity. Thus, while a firm may advertise bulletproof hosting, it is ultimately unable to deliver without the connivance of its upstream ISP. However, some spammers have managed to get what is called a pink contract (see below) ‚Äì a contract with the ISP that allows them to spam without being disconnected. A few companies produce spamware, or software designed for spammers. Spamware varies widely, but may include the ability to import thousands of addresses, to generate random addresses, to insert fraudulent headers into messages, to use dozens or hundreds of mail servers simultaneously, and to make use of open relays. The sale of spamware is illegal in eight U.S. states. original location was at ; the referenced page is an auto-redirect target from the original location the link here is to an abstract of a white paper; registration with the authoring organization is required to obtain the full white paper. So-called millions CDs are commonly advertised in spam. These are CD-ROMs purportedly containing lists of email addresses, for use in sending spam to these addresses. Such lists are also sold directly online, frequently with the false claim that the owners of the listed addresses have requested (or \\"opted in\\") to be included. Such lists often contain invalid addresses. In recent years, these have fallen almost entirely out of use due to the low quality email addresses available on them, and because some email lists exceed 20GB in size. The amount you can fit on a CD is no longer substantial. A number of DNS blacklists (DNSBLs), including the MAPS RBL, Spamhaus SBL, SORBS and SPEWS, target the providers of spam- support services as well as spammers. DNSBLs blacklist IPs or ranges of IPs to persuade ISPs to terminate services with known customers who are spammers or resell to spammers. Related vocabulary ;Unsolicited bulk email (UBE) :A synonym for email spam. ;Unsolicited commercial email (UCE) :Spam promoting a commercial service or product. This is the most common type of spam, but it excludes spams that are hoaxes (e.g. virus warnings), political advocacy, religious messages, and chain letters sent by a person to many other people. The term UCE may be most common in the USA. ;Pink contract :A pink contract is a service contract offered by an ISP which offers bulk email service to spamming clients, in violation of that ISP's publicly posted acceptable use policy. ;Spamvertising :Spamvertising is advertising through the medium of spam. ;Opt-in, confirmed opt-in, double opt-in, opt-out :Opt-in, confirmed opt-in, double opt-in, opt-out refers to whether the people on a mailing list are given the option to be put in, or taken out, of the list. Confirmation (and \\"double\\", in marketing speak) refers to an email address transmitted e.g. through a web form being confirmed to actually request joining a mailing list, instead of being added to the list without verification. ;Final, Ultimate Solution for the Spam Problem (FUSSP) :An ironic reference to na√Øve developers who believe they have invented the perfect spam filter, which will stop all spam from reaching users' inboxes while deleting no legitimate email accidentally.

Definitions and usage Another geographic delineation for the region is the portion of Africa south of the Cunene and Zambezi Rivers ‚Äì that is: South Africa, Lesotho, Eswatini, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe and the part of Mozambique which lies south of the Zambezi River. This definition is most often used in South Africa for natural sciences and particularly in guide books such as Roberts' Birds of Southern Africa, the Southern African Bird Atlas Project and Mammals of the Southern African Subregion. It is not used in political, economic or human geography contexts because this definition cuts Mozambique in two.  UN scheme of geographic regions and SACU  In the United Nations scheme of geographic regions, five states constitute Southern Africa: * * (Swaziland)  The Southern African Customs Union (SACU), created in 1969, also comprises the five states in the UN subregion of Southern Africa. SADC membership The Southern African Development Community (SADC) was established in 1980 to facilitate co- operation in the region. It includes:  * * (Swaziland)    * * General usages The region is sometimes reckoned to include other territories: * ‚Äì part of Central Africa in the UN scheme. * , , , , , , , , , ‚Äì part of Eastern Africa in the UN scheme. The Democratic Republic of the Congo and Tanzania, though more commonly reckoned in Central and Eastern Africa, respectively, are occasionally included in Southern Africa as they are SADC members. Geography A composite satellite image of Southern Africa The terrain of Southern Africa is varied, ranging from forestCowling, R. M. (editor); (et al.) (2004) Vegetation of Southern Africa. Cambridge University Press. p. 278. and grasslands to deserts. The region has both low-lying coastal areas, and mountains. In terms of natural resources, the region has the world's largest resources of platinum and the platinum group elements, chromium, vanadium, and cobalt, as well as uranium, gold, copper, titanium, iron, manganese, silver, beryllium, and diamonds. History=Prehistory East and southern Africa are among the earliest regions where modern humans (Homo sapiens) and their predecessors are believed to have lived. In September 2019, scientists reported the computerized determination, based on 260 CT scans, of a virtual skull shape of the last common human ancestor to modern humans/H. sapiens, representative of the earliest modern humans, and suggested that modern humans arose between 350,000 and 260,000 years ago through a merging of populations in East and South Africa.

While colonialism has left its mark on the development over the course of history, today poverty, corruption, and HIV/AIDS are some of the biggest factors impeding economic growth. The pursuit of economic and political stability is an important part of the region's goals, as demonstrated by the SADC. In terms of economic strength, South Africa is by far the dominant power of the region. South Africa's GDP alone (estimated at circa US$350 billion) is many times greater than the GDP's of all other countries in the region. Generally, mining, agriculture and tourism sectors dominate the economies of Southern African countries, apart from South Africa which has a mature and flourishing financial sector, retail sector, and construction sector. Most global banks have their regional offices for Southern Africa based in Johannesburg, South Africa. Over the years, some the other Southern African nations have invested in economic diversification, and invested public funds into rail, road and air transportation as part of a concerted effort through SADC to boost regional trade and improve communication and transportation. The countries in this region also belong to the Southern Africa Power Pool, which facilitates the development of a competitive electricity market within the SADC region and ensures sustainable energy developments through sound economic, environmental and social practices. The main objective of the power pool is to develop a world class, robust and safe interconnected electrical system across the Southern African Region. According to a report by Southern Africa Power Pool, the three largest producers of electricity in Southern Africa as at 2017, include Eskom in South Africa with an estimated 46,963MW, Zesco in Zambia with 2,877MW and SNL of Angola with 2,442MW. Environment Southern Africa has a wide diversity of ecoregions including grassland, bushveld, karoo, savannah and riparian zones. Even though considerable disturbance has occurred in some regions from habitat loss due to human overpopulation or export-focused development, there remain significant numbers of various wildlife species, including white rhino, lion, African leopard, impala, kudu, blue wildebeest, vervet monkey and elephant. It has complex Plateaus that create massive mountain structures along the South African border. There are numerous environmental issues in Southern Africa, including air pollution and desertification. Culture=ArtArchitectureClothingCuisineMusicReligionFilm industry=Demographics and languages Southern Africa is home to many people. It was initially populated by indigenous or native Africans San, Khoikhoi and Pygmies in widely dispersed concentrations. Due to the Bantu expansion which edged the previous native African peoples to the more remote areas of the region, the majority of African ethnic groups in this region, including the Xhosa, Zulu, Tsonga, Swazi, Northern Ndebele, Southern Ndebele, Tswana, Sotho, Northern Sotho, Shona people, Mbundu, Ovimbundu, Shona, Chaga and Sukuma, speak Bantu languages. The process of colonization and settling resulted in a significant population of native European (Afrikaner, British, Portuguese Africans, etc.) and Asian descent (Cape Malays, Indian South Africans, etc.) in many southern African countries. Science and technologyAgriculture and food security Some key factors affecting the food security within the regions including political instability, poor governance, droughts, population growth, urbanisation, poverty, low economic growth, inadequate agricultural policies, trade terms and regimes, resource degradation and the recent increase in HIV/AIDS. These factors vary from country to country. For example, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has favourable climatic and physical conditions, but performs far below its capacity in food provision due to political instability and poor governance. In contrast, semi-arid countries such as Botswana and Namibia, produce insufficient food, but successfully achieve food security through food imports due to economic growth, political stability and good governance. The Republic of South Africa is a major food producer and exporter in the region. Data on agricultural production trends and food insecurity especially in term of food availability for Southern Africa is readily available through the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) and Southern African Development Community (SADC) - Food, Agriculture and Nature Resource Directorate (FARN). However, this data might not fully capture the reality of a region with large urban populations and where food insecurity goes beyond per-capita availability to issues of access and dietary adequacy. Urban food security has been noted as an emerging area of concern in the region, with recent data showing high levels of food insecurity amongst low-income households. In a study of eleven cities in nine countries: Blantyre, Cape Town, Gaborone, Harare, Johannesburg, Lusaka, Maputo, Manzini, Maseru, Msunduzi (Durban Metro) and Windhoek, only 17% of households were categorized as ‚Äòfood-secure‚Äô while more than half (57%) of all households surveyed were found to be ‚Äòseverely food-insecure‚Äô. Some factors affecting urban food insecurity include climate change with potential impact on agricultural productivity, the expansion of supermarkets in the region, which is changing the way people obtain food in the city, rural-to-urban migration, unemployment, and poverty. The issue of food insecurity in general and urban food insecurity in particular in the region is also characterized by an increased consumption of caloric junk food and processed foods leading to potential increase in the co-existence of undernutrition and dietary-related chronic diseases such as obesity and hypertension. In South Africa for example, while over 50% experience hunger, 61% are overweight or morbidly obese. There is only limited data on the other Southern African countries. As of early 2019, parts of the region are suffering from a period of drought.

He was born in Rotterdam and moved to the United States in 1926, becoming an American citizen in 1962. In 1943, he married painter Elaine Fried. In the years after World War II, de Kooning painted in a style that came to be referred to as abstract expressionism or \\"action painting\\", and was part of a group of artists that came to be known as the New York School. Other painters in this group included Jackson Pollock, Elaine de Kooning, Lee Krasner, Franz Kline, Arshile Gorky, Mark Rothko, Hans Hofmann, Nell Blaine, Adolph Gottlieb, Anne Ryan, Robert Motherwell, Philip Guston, Clyfford Still, and Richard Pousette-Dart. De Kooning's retrospective held at MoMa in 2011‚Äì2012 made him one of the best-known artists of the 20th century. Biography Willem de Kooning (1968)Willem de Kooning was born in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, on April 24, 1904. His parents, Leendert de Kooning and Cornelia Nobel, were divorced in 1907, and de Kooning lived first with his father and then with his mother. He left school in 1916 and became an apprentice in a firm of commercial artists. Until 1924 he attended evening classes in Rotterdam at the (Academy of Fine Arts and Applied Sciences), now the Willem de Kooning Academie. In 1926 de Kooning travelled to the United States as a stowaway on the Shelley, a British freighter bound for Argentina, and on August 15 landed at Newport News, Virginia. He stayed at the Dutch Seamen's Home in Hoboken, New Jersey, and found work as a house painter. In 1927 he moved to Manhattan, where he had a studio on West Forty-fourth Street. He supported himself with jobs in carpentry, house painting and commercial art. De Kooning began painting in his free time, and in 1928 he joined the art colony at Woodstock, New York. He also began to meet some of the modernist artists active in Manhattan. Among them were the American Stuart Davis, the Armenian Arshile Gorky and the Russian John Graham, whom de Kooning collectively called the \\"Three Musketeers\\". Gorky, whom de Kooning first met at the home of Misha Reznikoff, became a close friend and, for at least ten years, an important influence. Balcomb Greene said that \\"de Kooning virtually worshipped Gorky\\"; according to Aristodimos Kaldis, \\"Gorky was de Kooning's master\\". De Kooning's drawing Self-portrait with Imaginary Brother, from about 1938, may show him with Gorky; the pose of the figures is that of a photograph of Gorky with Peter Busa in about 1936. De Kooning joined the Artists Union in 1934, and in 1935 was employed in the Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Administration, for which he designed a number of murals including some for the Williamsburg Federal Housing Project in Brooklyn. None of them were executed, but a sketch for one was included in New Horizons in American Art at the Museum of Modern Art, his first group show. Starting in 1937, when De Kooning had to leave the Federal Art Project because he did not have American citizenship, he began to work full-time as an artist, earning income from commissions and by giving lessons. That year de Kooning was assigned to a portion of the mural Medicine for the Hall of Pharmacy at the 1939 World's Fair in New York, which drew the attention of critics, the images themselves so completely new and distinct from the era of American realism. De Kooning met his wife, Elaine Fried, at the American Artists School in New York. She was 14 years his junior. Thus was to begin a lifelong partnership affected by alcoholism, lack of money, love affairs, quarrels and separations. They were married on December 9, 1943. De Kooning worked on his first series of portrait paintings: standing or sedentary men like Two Men Standing, Man, and Seated Figure (Classic Male), even combining with self-portraits as with Portrait with Imaginary Brother (1938‚Äì39). At this time, de Kooning's work borrowed strongly from Gorky's surrealist imagery and was influenced by Picasso. This changed only when de Kooning met the younger painter Franz Kline, who was also working with the figurative style of American realism and had been drawn to monochrome. Kline, who died young, was one of de Kooning's closest artist friends. Kline's influence is evident in de Kooning's calligraphic black images of this period. In the late 1950s, de Kooning's work shifted away from the figurative work of the women (though he would return to that subject matter on occasion) and began to display an interest in more abstract, less representational imagery. He became a US citizen on 13 March 1962, and in the following year moved from Broadway to a small house in East Hampton, a house which Elaine's brother Peter Fried had sold to him two years before. He built a studio near by, and lived in the house to the end of his life. It was revealed that, toward the end of his life, de Kooning had begun to lose his memory in the late 1980s and had been suffering from Alzheimer's disease for some time. This revelation has initiated considerable debate among scholars and critics about how responsible de Kooning was for the creation of his late work.Swinnen, Aafje, and Mark Schweda. 2015. Popularizing Dementia: Public Expressions and Representations of Forgetfulness. Bielefeld: Transcript. p. 150. . Succumbing to the progression of his disease, de Kooning painted his final works in 1991. He died in 1997 at the age of 92 and was cremated. Marriage to Elaine de Kooning Elaine had admired Willem's artwork before meeting him; in 1938 her teacher introduced her to de Kooning at a Manhattan cafeteria when she was 20 and he 34. After meeting, he began to instruct her in drawing and painting. They painted in Willem's loft at 143 West 21st Street, and he was known for his harsh criticism of her work, \\"sternly requiring that she draw and redraw a figure or still life and insisting on fine, accurate, clear linear definition supported by precisely modulated shading.\\" He even destroyed many of her drawings, but this \\"impelled Elaine to strive for both precision and grace in her work\\". When they married in 1943, she moved into his loft and they continued sharing studio spaces. Elaine and Willem de Kooning had what was later called an open marriage; they both were casual about sex and about each other's affairs. Elaine had affairs with men who helped further Willem's career, such as Harold Rosenberg, who was a renowned art critic, Thomas B. Hess, who was a writer about art and managing editor for Artnews, and Charles Egan, owner of the Charles Egan Gallery. Willem had a daughter, Lisa de Kooning, in 1956, as a result of his affair with Joan Ward. Elaine and Willem both struggled with alcoholism, which eventually led to their separation in 1957. While separated, Elaine remained in New York, struggling with poverty, and Willem moved to Long Island and dealt with depression. Despite bouts with alcoholism, they both continued painting. Although separated for nearly twenty years, they never divorced, and ultimately reunited in 1976. Work=Early work De Kooning's paintings of the 1930s and early 1940s are abstract still-lifes characterised by geometric or biomorphic shapes and strong colours. They show the influence of his friends Davis, Gorky and Graham, but also of Arp, Joan Mir√≥, Mondrian and Pablo Picasso. In the same years de Kooning also painted a series of solitary male figures, either standing or seated, against undefined backgrounds; many of these are unfinished. Black and white abstracts By 1946, de Kooning had begun a series of black and white paintings, which he would continue into 1949. During this period he had his first one-man show at the Charles Egan Gallery in 1948 consisting largely of black and white works, although a few pieces have passages of bright color. De Kooning's black paintings are important to the history of abstract expressionism owing to their densely impacted forms, their mixed media, and their technique. Woman III, 1953, private collection The Woman series De Kooning as sculptor: left De Kooning's well-known Woman series, begun in 1950 and culminating in Woman VI, owes much to Picasso, not least in the aggressive, penetrative breaking apart of the figure, and the spaces around it. Picasso's late works show signs that he, in turn, saw images of works by Pollock and de Kooning. De Kooning led the 1950s art world into a new movement known as American abstract expressionism. \\"From 1940 to the present, Woman has manifested herself in de Kooning's paintings and drawings as at once the focus of desire, frustration, inner conflict, pleasure, ‚Ä¶ and as posing problems of conception and handling as demanding as those of an engineer.\\"Willem de Kooning. Text by Harold Rosenberg. 29 The female figure is an important symbol for de Kooning's art career and his own life. The Woman painting is considered as a significant work of art for the museum through its historical context about the post-World War II history and American feminist movement. Additionally, the medium (oil, enamel, and charcoal on canvas) of this painting makes it different from others of de Kooning's time.  Notable works  The painter is noted for his paintings: Woman III (1953), Woman VI (1953), Interchange (1955), and Police Gazette (1955). Some notable sculptures are Clamdigger (1972/1976) and Seated Woman on a Bench (1972/1976). Market reception Some of de Kooning's paintings have been sold in the 21st century for record prices. In November 2006, the American business magnate David Geffen sold his oil painting Woman III to hedge fund manager Steven A. Cohen for $137.5 million, just below the record at the time of $140 million, which involved the same people in the same month for Jackson Pollock's No. 5, 1948.Carol Vogel, Landmark De Kooning Crowns Collection, The New York Times, November 18, 2006 A month earlier Cohen had already paid Geffen $63.5 million for Police Gazette by de Kooning.Carol Vogel, Works by Johns and de Kooning Sell for $143.5 Million, The New York Times, October 12, 2006 In September 2015, Geffen sold de Kooning's oil painting Interchange to hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin for ca. $300 million, the highest price paid for a painting at the time.\\"Billionaire drops $500M for 2 masterpieces,\\" Feb. 19, 2016, Bloomberg News, as republished by Fox News, at . It held the record until November 15, 2017, when the da Vinci Salvator Mundi sold for $450 million at Christie's in New York. In November 2016, Untitled XXV sold for $66.3 million at Christie's in New York. This was a record price for a De Kooning piece sold at public auction. According to Patricia Failing: :By the end of the 1950s, in the opinion of many, the most influential painter at work for the world was the abstract expressionist master William de Kooning. Although it was 1948 before he was given his first one man show, de Kooning had previously acquired a formidable underground reputation which served to boost him to prominence, along with Jackson Pollock, as a leading exponent of \\"action painting.\\" John A. Garraty, ed., encyclopedia of American biography 1974 pp 269-270. Solo exhibitions The artist was featured in a number of solo exhibitions from 1948 to 1966, many in New York but also nationally and internationally. Specifically, he had fourteen separate exhibitions and even had two exhibitions per annum in the years 1953, 1964, and 1965. He was featured at the Egan Gallery, the Sidney Janis Gallery, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Arts Club of Chicago, the Martha Jackson Gallery, the Workshop Center, the Paul Kantor Gallery, the Hames Goodman Gallery, the Allan Stone Gallery, and the Smith College Museum of Art. Most of the exhibitions lasted for 3 weeks to one month. Most recent exhibition, De Kooning: Five Decades, took place in Mnuchin Gallery, New York City from 19 April till 15 June 2019.

It is a dark gray, water-insoluble solid. The compound has attracted attention because it becomes superconducting at 39 K (‚àí234 ¬∞C). In terms of its composition, MgB2 differs strikingly from most low-temperature superconductors, which feature mainly transition metals. Its superconducting mechanism is primarily described by BCS theory. Superconductivity Magnesium diboride's superconducting properties were discovered in 2001. Its critical temperature (Tc) of is the highest amongst conventional superconductors. Among conventional (phonon-mediated) superconductors, it is unusual. Its electronic structure is such that there exist two types of electrons at the Fermi level with widely differing behaviours, one of them (sigma-bonding) being much more strongly superconducting than the other (pi-bonding). This is at odds with usual theories of phonon-mediated superconductivity which assume that all electrons behave in the same manner. Theoretical understanding of the properties of MgB2 has nearly been achieved by modelling two energy gaps. In 2001 it was regarded as behaving more like a metallic than a cuprate superconductor. Semi-Meissner state Using BCS theory and the known energy gaps of the pi and sigma bands of electrons (2.2 and 7.1 meV, respectively), the pi and sigma bands of electrons have been found to have two different coherence lengths (51 nm and 13 nm, respectively). The corresponding London penetration depths are 33.6 nm and 47.8 nm. This implies that the Ginzburg-Landau parameters are 0.66¬±0.02 and 3.68, respectively. The first is less than 1/ and the second is greater, therefore the first seems to indicate marginal type I superconductivity and the second type II superconductivity. It has been predicted that when two different bands of electrons yield two quasiparticles, one of which has a coherence length that would indicate type I superconductivity and one of which would indicate type II, then in certain cases, vortices attract at long distances and repel at short distances. In particular, the potential energy between vortices is minimized at a critical distance. As a consequence there is a conjectured new phase called the semi- Meissner state, in which vortices are separated by the critical distance. When the applied flux is too small for the entire superconductor to be filled with a lattice of vortices separated by the critical distance, then there are large regions of type I superconductivity, a Meissner state, separating these domains. Experimental confirmation for this conjecture has arrived recently in MgB2 experiments at 4.2 Kelvin. The authors found that there are indeed regimes with a much greater density of vortices. Whereas the typical variation in the spacing between Abrikosov vortices in a type II superconductor is of order 1%, they found a variation of order 50%, in line with the idea that vortices assemble into domains where they may be separated by the critical distance. The term type-1.5 superconductivity was coined for this state. Synthesis Magnesium diboride was synthesized and its structure confirmed in 1953. The simplest synthesis involves high temperature reaction between boron and magnesium powders. Formation begins at 650 ¬∞C; however, since magnesium metal melts at 652 ¬∞C, the reaction may involve diffusion of magnesium vapor across boron grain boundaries. At conventional reaction temperatures, sintering is minimal, although grain recrystallization is sufficient for Josephson quantum tunnelling between grains. Superconducting magnesium diboride wire can be produced through the powder-in-tube (PIT) ex situ and in situ processes.B.A.Glowacki, M.Majoros, M.Vickers, J.E.Evetts, Y.Shi and I.McDougall, Superconductivity of powder-in-tube MgB2 wires, Superconductor Science and Technology, 14 (4) 193 (April 2001)  DOI: 10.1088/0953-2048/14/4/304 In the in situ variant, a mixture of boron and magnesium is reduced in diameter by conventional wire drawing. The wire is then heated to the reaction temperature to form MgB2. In the ex situ variant, the tube is filled with MgB2 powder, reduced in diameter, and sintered at 800 to 1000 ¬∞C. In both cases, later hot isostatic pressing at approximately 950 ¬∞C further improves the properties. An alternative technique, disclosed in 2003, employs reactive liquid infiltration of magnesium inside a granular preform of boron powders and was called Mg-RLI technique. The method allowed the manufacture of both high density (more than 90% of the theoretical density for MgB2) bulk materials and special hollow fibers. This method is equivalent to similar melt growth based methods such as the Infiltration and Growth Processing method used to fabricate bulk YBCO superconductors where the non- superconducting Y2BaCuO5 is used as granular preform inside which YBCO based liquid phases are infiltrated to make superconductive YBCO bulk. This method has been copied and adapted for MgB2 and rebranded as Reactive Mg Liquid Infiltration. The process of Reactive Mg Liquid Infiltration in a boron preform to obtain MgB2 has been a subject of patent applications by the italian company Edison S.p.A.. Hybrid physical‚Äìchemical vapor deposition (HPCVD) has been the most effective technique for depositing magnesium diboride (MgB2) thin films. The surfaces of MgB2 films deposited by other technologies are usually rough and non-stoichiometric. In contrast, the HPCVD system can grow high-quality in situ pure MgB2 films with smooth surfaces, which are required to make reproducible uniform Josephson junctions, the fundamental element of superconducting circuits. Electromagnetic properties Properties depend greatly on composition and fabrication process. Many properties are anisotropic due to the layered structure. 'Dirty' samples, e.g., with oxides at the crystal boundaries, are different from 'clean' samples. *The highest superconducting transition temperature Tc is 39 K. *MgB2 is a type-II superconductor, i.e. increasing magnetic field gradually penetrates into it. *Maximum critical current (Jc) is: 105 A/m2 at 20 T, 106 A/m2 at 18 T, 107 A/m2 at 15 T, 108 A/m2 at 10 T, 109 A/m2 at 5 T. *As of 2008 : Upper critical field (Hc2): (parallel to ab planes) is ~14 T, (perpendicular to ab planes) ~3 T, in thin films up to 74 T, in fibers up to 55 T. Improvement by doping Various means of doping MgB2 with carbon (e.g. using 10% malic acid) can improve the upper critical field and the maximum current density (also with polyvinyl acetate). 5% doping with carbon can raise Hc2 from 16 to 36 T while lowering Tc only from 39 K to 34 K. The maximum critical current (Jc) is reduced, but doping with TiB2 can reduce the decrease. (Doping MgB2 with Ti is patented.Zhao, Yong et al. \\"MgB2‚Äîbased superconductor with high critical current density, and method for manufacturing the same\\" , Issue date: Oct 11, 2005) The maximum critical current (Jc) in magnetic field is enhanced greatly (approx double at 4.2 K) by doping with ZrB2. Even small amounts of doping lead both bands into the type II regime and so no semi-Meissner state may be expected. Thermal conductivity MgB2 is a multi-band superconductor, that is each Fermi surface has different superconducting energy gap. For MgB2, sigma bond of boron is strong, and it induces large s-wave superconducting gap, and pi bond is weak and induces small s-wave gap. The quasiparticle states of the vortices of large gap are highly confined to the vortex core. On the other hand, the quasiparticle states of small gap are loosely bound to the vortex core. Thus they can be delocalized and overlap easily between adjacent vortices. Such delocalization can strongly contribute to the thermal conductivity, which shows abrupt increase above Hc1. Possible applications=Superconductors Superconducting properties and low cost make magnesium diboride attractive for a variety of applications. For those applications, MgB2 powder is compressed with silver metal (or 316 stainless steel) into wire and sometimes tape via the Powder-in-tube process. File:MgB2powder2.jpg File:pit_process.gif File:MgB2tape.jpg In 2006 a 0.5 tesla open MRI superconducting magnet system was built using 18 km of MgB2 wires. This MRI used a closed-loop cryocooler, without requiring externally supplied cryogenic liquids for cooling. \\"...the next generation MRI instruments must be made of MgB2 coils instead of NbTi coils, operating in the 20‚Äì25 K range without liquid helium for cooling. ... Besides the magnet applications MgB2 conductors have potential uses in superconducting transformers, rotors and transmission cables at temperatures of around 25 K, at fields of 1 T.\\" A project at CERN to make MgB2 cables has resulted in superconducting test cables able to carry 20,000 amperes for extremely high current distribution applications, such as the contemplated high luminosity version of the large hadron collider. CERN high current project The IGNITOR tokamak design was based on MgB2 for its poloidal coils.Ignitor fact sheet Thin coatings can be used in superconducting radio frequency cavities to minimize energy loss and reduce the inefficiency of liquid helium cooled niobium cavities. Because of the low cost of its constituent elements, MgB2 has promise for use in superconducting low to medium field magnets, electric motors and generators, fault current limiters and current leads. Propellants, explosives, pyrotechnics Unlike elemental boron whose combustion is incomplete through the glassy oxide layered impeding oxygen diffusion, magnesium diboride burns completely when ignited in oxygen or in mixtures with oxidizers.Koch, E.-C.; Weiser, V. and Roth, E. (2011), Combustion behaviour of Binary Pyrolants based on Mg, MgH2, MgB2, Mg3N2, Mg2Si and Polytetrafluoroethylene, EUROPYRO 2011, Reims, France Thus magnesium boride has been proposed as fuel in ram jets.Ward, J.

In addition the use of MgB2 in blast-enhanced explosives Wood, L.L. et al. \\"Light metal explosives and propellants\\" , Issued: April 5, 2005 and propellants has been proposed for the same reasons. Most recently it could be shown that decoy flares containing magnesium diboride/Teflon/Viton display 30‚Äì60% increased spectral efficiency, EŒª (J g‚àí1sr‚àí1), compared to classical Magnesium/Teflon/Viton(MTV) payloads. An application of magnesium diboride to hybrid rocket propulsion has also been investigated, mixing the compound in paraffin wax fuel grains to improve mechanical properties and combustion characteristics.Bertoldi, AEM, Bouziane, M, Lee, D, Hendrick, P, Vandevelde, C, Lefebvre, M, and Veras, CAG. \\"Development and Test of Magnesium-based Additive for Hybrid Rockets Fuels.\\" 15th International Conference on Space Operations, 2018.

Serving from May 15, 1544 to January 18, 1546, he was charged by Charles V with the enforcement of the controversial New Laws, which dealt with the failure of the encomienda system to protect the indigenous people of America from the rapacity of the conquistadors and their descendants. Origins N√∫√±ez Vela was a native of √Åvila, born into an ancient and noble family. The N√∫√±ez Vela family, lords of Tabadillo, lived in this area from at least 1403. He was a descendant of Don Pedro Nu√±ez de la Fuente Almexir (Fuentearmegil) the loyal, who saved the life of the King of Castile, Alfonso VIII in 1163. He was a knight of the Order of Santiago and corregidor of M√°laga and Cuenca, Spain, and devoted to the service of the king. One of his brothers was lord of the bedchamber to the king, and another was archbishop of Burgos. Although honest, loyal and courageous, N√∫√±ez was also very hot headed. Appointment as viceroy In 1543 he was named viceroy, governor and captain general of Peru and president of the Audiencia, and also captain general of Chile, with a salary of 5,000 ducats. He sailed from Sanlucar on November 3, 1542 in command of a fleet, with much pomp, and arrived in Lima on May 17, 1544. He was accompanied by the members of the Audiencia and other illustrious personalities. His last instructions from the king were to \\"show himself to be a severe punisher of infractions.\\" N√∫√±ez's adherence to these instructions was to prove very costly. The New Laws The New Laws promulgated by Charles, under the influence of reformers such as Bartolom√© de las Casas, had been established to improve the lot of the indigenous peoples of the Americas within the Spanish dominions. They were intended to clarify, expand and enforce provisions of the Laws of Burgos of 1512. The latter had provided many safeguards for the indigenous population, but these had not been strictly enforced. The New Laws became effective November 20, 1542. In order to enforce the New Laws and suppress the insubordination of the conquistadors in New Spain and Peru, representatives of the Crown were provided with the powers and authority of the king. The new office was designated a viceroyalty at the head of which was a viceroy or virrey. Audiencias were also appointed to assist the viceroys in the administration of civil and criminal justice. The Audiencias were composed of four oidores (judges). Actions as viceroy N√∫√±ez arrived at Nombre de Dios on January 10, 1544, and passed from there to Panama City. Leaving the Audiencia in Panama, he sailed for Peru, arriving at Tumbes on March 14, 1544. He went from there to Trujillo, where he was solemnly received, and thence to La Barranca. In La Barranca he may have read on one of the walls, \\"Whoever comes to take my hacienda, his life will be taken\\". The New Laws were not well received by the conquistadors because they provided that what was effectively Indian slavery had to end, that everyone had to pay a fair share of taxes, and that all the encomienda rights had to go to the king. The conquistadors would have nothing of this. N√∫√±ez arrived in Lima, the capital of the colony, on May 17, 1544, where he was received in royal splendor and sworn into office. News of governmental measures he had already taken on the voyage had preceded him, and he was met with hostility and resistance from the officials and clergy. N√∫√±ez himself now had doubts about enforcing the New Laws in the current situation. He agreed to join the Spanish landowners in the colony in a petition to the emperor to suspend them, but claiming a lack of authority, he refused to suspend them on his own initiative. The resistance aggravated his distrust and increased the severity of his measures. He imprisoned Crist√≥bal Vaca de Castro, his predecessor as head of the colonial government, and then had him sent to Spain. On September 13, 1544, in a late night interview in the viceroy's palace, N√∫√±ez accused Juan Su√°rez de Carbajal of treason. The exchange became heated, and N√∫√±ez killed Su√°rez with a dagger. Deposition as viceroy The death of Su√°rez led the Audiencia to break with the viceroy. Believing they could rely on help from Gonzalo Pizarro, brother of Francisco Pizarro, they determined to remove N√∫√±ez from office and send him back to Spain. (Pizarro had already raised a small army in opposition to the viceroy.) On September 18, 1544 they deposed him and ordered his imprisonment. The viceroy was sent a prisoner to the island of San Lorenzo, to be handed over to oidor √Ålvarez. In √Ålvarez's custody, N√∫√±ez left San Lorenzo for Panama on September 24. Just out of port, √Ålvarez told the viceroy he was now free, and turned over command of the ship to him. The civil war N√∫√±ez ordered the ship to sail for Tumbes, where he disembarked in the middle of October. He gathered an army and led it south to battle the conquistadors. Pizarro made his solemn entry into Lima on October 28, at the head of 1,200 well-trained and well-armed soldiers, with artillery, under the royal banner of Castile. Both sides claimed to be defenders of the king. Pizarro was sworn in before the Audiencia as interim governor and captain general of Peru, until a replacement could be named by the king. N√∫√±ez and his small force left San Miguel (near Quito) just ahead of Pizarro's soldiers. The hope was to link up in the high country with Benalcazar, the loyal commander at Popayan. Indecisive skirmishes were fought along the line of march. N√∫√±ez, suspecting treachery among his officers, had three of them executed. N√∫√±ez arrived in Popayan, and Pizarro occupied Quito, formerly friendly territory for the viceroy. Pizarro lured N√∫√±ez out of Popayan to Quito by a stratagem. The two armies met January 18, 1546 at nearby A√±aquito. Seven hundred soldiers of the army of Pizarro fought N√∫√±ez and his smaller army of a few hundred at A√±aquito. N√∫√±ez fought bravely, in spite of his age, but he was killed in the battle and then decapitated. His head was marched about on a pike to demonstrate that the conquistadors had won and were now in charge. Fearing the loss of the American colonies the Crown watered down the New Laws and restored the encomiendas. King Charles recognized the fallen viceroy and his sons, ordering that N√∫√±ez be honored annually. Charles made two of his sons knights, one in the Order of Santiago and one in the Order of Alc√°ntara. The sons became ambassador to France, captain general of artillery, and archbishop of Burgos.

Topics covered include British, European, and US politics, social issues, art, literature, cinema, science, the media, history, philosophy, and psychology. Prospect features a mixture of lengthy analytic articles, first-person reportage, one-page columns, and shorter, quirky items. The magazine was launched in October 1995 by David Goodhart, then a senior correspondent for the Financial Times (FT), and chairman Derek Coombs. Goodhart came up with the idea of producing an essay- based monthly general-interest magazine‚Äîa form at that time unknown in Britain‚Äîwhile covering German reunification as Bonn correspondent for the FT. Some of the world‚Äôs leading intellectuals have featured in Prospect in the last few years, including Nobel prize-winning economists Joseph Stiglitz, Amartya Sen and Angus Deaton, world-renowned writers such as Lionel Shriver, Clive James, Toni Morrison and Margaret Atwood, as well as scientists like Martin Rees. Notable features of the magazine include head-to-head debates between two writers with opposing views on a subject; roundtable discussions, in which a series of experts with varying views on a given topic meet for a discussion, an edited transcript of which is published in the magazine; and interviews with major political and cultural figures (examples include Orhan Pamuk, Paul Wolfowitz, and Hilary Mantel). Prospect received worldwide attention in October 2005 when it published its list of the world's top 100 public intellectuals, which included Noam Chomsky, Umberto Eco, Richard Dawkins, Steven Pinker and Christopher Hitchens. The magazine asked readers to vote for their top intellectual from the longlist; Chomsky was the eventual winner. Subsequent lists have continued to attract attention. Dawkins claimed the top spot in 2013. Amartya Sen won in 2014 and Thomas Piketty was the winner in 2015. After a four-year hiatus, the award was revived in 2019‚Äîthe winner was the Kurdish mathematician Caucher Birkar. Prospect has also published the winning short story of the Royal Society of Literature's V. S. Pritchett Memorial Prize since 2009.  Policy positions  The magazine features contributions from authors spanning the political spectrum. It tends to avoid a \\"line\\" on specific policy issues, claiming to offer a \\"contrarian\\" view and to be an \\"open minded\\" magazine. It has published articles debunking the \\"popular wisdom\\", on topics ranging from Japan's alleged economic crisis to the Mahdi army in Iraq. However, it has been described as left-leaning by the BBC, and the Prospect contributor Roger Scruton. In August 2009 in a roundtable interview in Prospect, Adair Turner supported the idea of new global taxes on financial transactions, warning that a \\"swollen\\" financial sector paying excessive salaries has grown too big for society. Turner's suggestion that a \\"Tobin tax\\", named after the economist James Tobin, should be considered for financial transactions drew international attention. Since 2004 the magazine's founding editor, David Goodhart, has stirred controversy with a series of articles arguing that the increasing diversity of the United Kingdom may weaken the bonds of solidarity on which the welfare state depends. The debate fed into the broader discussions of \\"Britishness.  The Think Tank Awards  Prospect holds the annual Think Tank Awards, which celebrate and reward the work of think tanks on a national and global scale. The awards are supported by Shell. Categories include \\"Global Think Tank of the Year\\", \\"Publication of the Year\\", \\"North American Think Tank of the Year\\", \\"European Think Tank of the Year\\" (excluding Britain), 'UK Think Tank of the Year', and many sub-categories for the UK. According to the official website, \\"The awards are judged by a cross-party panel looking for evidence of influence on public policy and on the public discourse. The judges will also consider the quality of research and potential of younger and smaller organisations.\\" The awards have been running since 2001, and have been expanding exponentially to include more global awards for international Think Tanks. The winner of the most recent 2017 Think Tank awards (held at the Institute of Directors on 10 July) was the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, based in the UK, for its \\"very strong analytical appraisal of social conditions in Britain\\".

Life Posidippus was born in the city of Pella, capital of the kingdom of Macedon as the son of Admetos. He lived for some time in Samos before moving permanently to the court of Ptolemy I Soter and later Ptolemy II Philadelphus in Alexandria, Egypt. An inscription from Thermon in Aetolia records that he was honoured by the Aetolian League in about 264/3 BC.IG_9.12.1.17 - English translation. He was friends with the poets Asclepiades of Samos and Hedylus. Poetry Twenty-three of Posidippus' poems were included in the Greek Anthology, and several more were quoted in either part or whole by Athenaeus of Naucratis in his Deipnosophistae. Until 2001, based on these remains, it was assumed that Posidippus wrote only about drinking and love. In that year the Milan Papyrus P.Mil.Vogl. VIII 309 was recovered from the wrappings of an Egyptian mummy dating to about 180 BC. It contained 112 poems, two of which were previously known to have been written by Posidippus, which address subjects that include events of the court of the Ptolemaic dynasty, gemstones, and bird divination. Because of Posidippus' authorship of these two poems, scholars have concluded that the other poems of the Milan Papyrus were also written by him. The poems of the Milan Papyrus are grouped into sections, and the papyrus largely preserves the section headers for the surviving poems: # On Stones (Lithika [title restored from two partially preserved letters], poems 1-20) # On Omens (Oionoskopika, 21-35) # Dedications (Anathematika, 36-41) # Epitaphs (Epitumbia [conjecture: title not preserved], 42-61) # On Statues (Andriantopoiika, 62-70) # On Equestrian Victories (Hippika, 71-88) # On Shipwrecks (Nauagika, 89-94) # On Cures (Iamatika, 95-101) # Characters (Tropoi, 102-109) # [title lost] (110-112) Editions * Posidippus' Milan Papyrus poetry book: Greek text and English translation (PDF) by various hands (CHS) * Bastianini G. - Gallazzi C.

Bastard son of Captain Gonzalo Pizarro y Rodr√≠guez de Aguilar (senior) (1446‚Äì1522) who as colonel of infantry served in the Italian campaigns under Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba, and in Navarre, with some distinction, and Mar√≠a Alonso, from Trujillo. He was the half brother of Francisco and Hern√°ndo Pizarro and the full brother of Juan Pizarro.  Early years in Peru  Born in Trujillo, Spain, Gonzalo Pizarro accompanied his eldest brother, Francisco Pizarro, in his third expedition for the conquest of Peru in 1530.Prescott, W.H., 2011, The History of the Conquest of Peru, Digireads.com Publishing, Gonzalo was also the brother of Hernando Pizarro and Juan Pizarro.Hemming, J., 1970, The Conquest of the Incas, New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Inc., A lieutenant of his brother Francisco during the conquest, Gonzalo Pizarro was one of the most corrupt, brutal and ruthless conquistadors of the New World, being far less restrained towards the natives and the Inca than his older brothers. After Inca emperor Atahualpa was captured in the Battle of Cajamarca and later executed, the Pizarro brothers and their followers marched towards the Inca capital of Cuzco to complete the conquest, capturing the city on 15 November 1533 after a brief battle with the Inca forces under Quizquiz holding it after previously defeating the central government and massacring the nobility of Cuzco. Gonzalo, and his brother Juan, were made regidores of the city on 24 March 1534. Cusco was split into factions behind Francisco Pizarro and Diego de Almagro, but these two signed a new article of agreement on 12 June 1535. Almagro then left Cuzco, having been given the honor by Spanish King Charles I of exploring the southern part of Peru (modern-day Chile) Gonzalo Pizarro sailing in Per√∫. Year of work:1554 Gonzalo and Juan Pizarro both looked after the settlements in Cuzco, while their eldest brother Francisco explored the west coast of northern Peru and founded the city of Lima in 1535. Gonzalo, Juan and his younger brother Hern√°ndo ruled Cuzco as a dictatorship dominated by greed, corruption and brutality; torturing and executing those who refused to accept Spanish rule. Particularly egregious was the conduct of Juan and Gonzalo Pizarro towards the Inca Emperor, Manco Inca Yupanqui. Manco was angered by the conduct of the Spaniards towards Incan women, especially after Gonzalo raped his queen and sister-wife Cura Ocllo.Titu Cusi Yupanqui, 2005, An Inca Account of the Conquest of Peru, Boulder: University Press of Colorado, The Spaniards corrupt rule and disrespectful treatment towards Manco Inca Yupanqui led to large-scale rebellion. The Incas fought the Spaniards in a number of sieges and battles for control of the land and temporarily captured Cuzco on May 6, 1536. The Incas were later defeated by the heavily armed Spanish soldiers led by Gonzalo and Juan. Smallpox was also spread among the natives and many perished. When Almagro returned from Chile disappointed in not finding any gold, he captured and imprisoned Gonzalo and Hern√°ndo on 8 April 1537. Gonzalo managed to escape and re-join Francisco Pizarro, while Almagro was on his way to Lima to negotiate with Francisco on who would control Cuzco. These negotiations led to Hern√°ndo's release. Hernando and Gonzalo then led an army against Almagro, defeating him in the Battle of Las Salinas. Almagro was captured, condemned for treason, and executed in Cusco on July 8, 1538.  Expeditions with Francisco de Orellana  Francisco Pizarro appointed Gonzalo Governor of Quito in 1541, which had been taken in 1534 by Sebasti√°n de Benalc√°zar. Gonzalo went to Quito and soon heard rumors of a rich native kingdom to the east: some called it El Dorado and the land was called the Land of Cinnamon - \\"Pa√≠s de la Canela\\". Gonzalo arranged an expedition: among those he recruited was Francisco de Orellana, a veteran of the conquest of the Inca and a dependable supporter of the Pizarro brothers. In Quito, Gonzalo was able to recruit 220 Spaniards and 4,000 Native Americans. The second-in-command, Orellana, was sent to Guayaquil to recruit more troops and horses. Gonzalo Pizarro and his followers left Quito on February 1541, a month before Orellana, who was able to bring 23 men and several horses. By March both met at the valley of Zumaco and started their march towards crossing the Andes. After following the courses of the Coca and Napo rivers, the expedition started running out of provisions. About 140 of the 220 Spaniards and 3,000 out of 4,000 natives had died. On February 1542, they decided Orellana would continue sailing down the Napo river in search of food along with 50 men. After a brief time, Gonzalo thought the expedition was a whole failure and decided to take a route north back to Quito with 80 of the remaining men, unknowingly relinquishing the success to Orellana, who ended discovering and exploring the entire length of the Amazon River. Upon his return to Quito, Gonzalo learned that the Almagristas (as the followers of Almagro were called) had assassinated his brother Francisco Pizarro on June 26, 1541 in retaliation for Almagro's execution. By this time the Crown's representative, Crist√≥bal Vaca de Castro, had arrived in Peru amidst the confusion after Pizarro's death. Gonzalo Pizarro offered to help capture those responsible for his brother's death, but was refused. The Almagristas were finally defeated in the battle of Chupas on September 16, 1542, and their leader, Diego Almagro El Mozo, was executed.  Gonzalo turns against the Spanish King  Emperor Charles V then appointed Blasco N√∫√±ez Vela as Peru's first viceroy in 1544. N√∫√±ez introduced the New Laws, which were framed by Bartolom√© de las Casas to protect the indigenous peoples. Many of the conquistadors living in Peru were against these laws since they could no longer exploit the natives. This prompted Gonzalo Pizarro and Francisco de Carvajal to organize an army of followers with the intent of suppressing the New Laws. Many conquistadors turned against the Viceroy and joined Gonzalo's side, as his surname provided an effective rallying point. The rebel army defeated N√∫√±ez in 1546 at A√±aquito near Quito. Although some, such as Carvajal, advised Gonzalo to proclaim himself King of Peru and to disown any further claim by the King of Spain to the land, Gonzalo refused. Over the following months, however, the support for Gonzalo diminished when the King's new representative, Pedro de la Gasca, arrived with the intention of offering pardon and repealing the New Laws. Most of Gonzalo's army deserted him just before the crucial battle of Jaquijahuana near Cusco, that would determine the fate of the conquest. No longer supported with an army against the King's new representative, Gonzalo Pizarro surrendered and was beheadedLeon, P., 1998, The Discovery and Conquest of Peru, Chronicles of the New World Encounter, edited and translated by Cook and Cook, Durham: Duke University Press, by the royal forces on the field of battle, being the last of the Pizarro brothers to die a violent death (with Hernando dying of old age in Spain some three or six decades later).

Designed by architect C√©sar Pelli, it is the tallest building in the state of Ohio, the 34th-tallest in the United States, and the 165th-tallest in the world. The building reaches 57 stories or to the top of its spire, and it is visible from up to away. The tower contains about 1.5 million square feet (139,355 m¬≤) of office space. Key Tower's anchor tenant is KeyCorp, a major regional financial services firm. In 2014 the law firm of BakerHostetler announced that it would move its headquarters to the building, taking up several floors being vacated by KeyCorp. The international law firm Squire Patton Boggs is headquartered here and a major tenant. It is also headquarters to Dan T. Moore Companies, located on the 27th floor. Key Tower is connected to the Marriott at Key Center, built in conjunction with the tower, and the older Society for Savings Building. It is the tallest building between Philadelphia and Chicago. It is also the tallest building in the Midwest United States outside of Chicago. In October of 2008 Wells Real Estate Funds purchased Key Center, including Key Tower, Marriott at Key Center, Society for Savings Building, and the underground Memorial Plaza Garage. Key Tower was subsequently acquired by The Millennia Companies in 2017. The purchase price was $267.5 million. History It was originally built as the Society Center and was the headquarters for Cleveland-based Society Corporation. Society had recently acquired Cleveland Trust and canceled Cleveland Trust's plans for an even taller building on Public Square. Its opening ended the Terminal Tower's 60-year reign as the tallest building in Ohio. It was renamed Key Tower after Society merged with KeyCorp and took the KeyCorp name. Indeed, it was decided to make Cleveland the headquarters for the new KeyCorp because it was felt the then-Society Center was more commensurate with the merged bank's status as a major bank. Pelli originally intended its design for the Norwest Center in Minneapolis, but a late change to the site led to Pelli designing a new tower for it. Key Tower was developed by the Richard E. Jacobs Group. When Society Center was completed in 1991 by Turner Construction Company, it became the tallest building between Chicago and New York City. The Comcast Center in Philadelphia assumed this distinction in 2007. The Chamber of Commerce Building stood on the tower's site from 1898 to 1955. F-111, James Rosenquist's large pop art painting, hung in the tower's lobby until building owner Richard Jacobs sold it to the Museum of Modern Art in 1996. He replaced it in 1998 with Songs for Sale, a mural by artist David Salle.Litt, Steven. \\"Salle Mural Quietly Fills Key Tower Void\\", The Plain Dealer. March 22, 1998.

In his service as a talent scout, Hammond became one of the most influential figures in 20th-century popular music. He is the father of famous blues musician John P. Hammond. Hammond was instrumental in sparking or furthering numerous musical careers, including those of Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Benny Goodman, Harry James, Charlie Christian, Billie Holiday, Count Basie, Teddy Wilson, Big Joe Turner, Pete Seeger, Babatunde Olatunji, Aretha Franklin, George Benson, Freddie Green, Leonard Cohen, Arthur Russell, Jim Copp, Asha Puthli, Stevie Ray Vaughan and Mike Bloomfield. He is also largely responsible for the revival of delta blues artist Robert Johnson's music. Early years and family Hammond was born in New York, christened John Henry Hammond Jr., although both his father and grandfather shared the same name. He was the youngest child and only son of John Henry Hammond and Emily Vanderbilt Sloane. His mother was one of three daughters of William Douglas Sloane and Emily Thorn Vanderbilt, and a granddaughter of William Henry Vanderbilt. His father attended Yale University, graduating with a law degree from Columbia Law School. His grandfather was Civil War General John Henry Hammond, who married Sophia Vernon Wolfe. His father was a brother of Ogden H. Hammond, ambassador to Spain, and uncle to politician Millicent Fenwick. Despite the family fortune from his mother's side of the family, which included wealth from the W. & J. Sloane chain, his father worked to provide for his family and maintain the family fortune. He worked \\"as a banker, lawyer, and railroad executive\\".Dunstan Prial (2006) The Producer: John Hammond and the Soul of American Music, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, Hammond had four sisters: Emily, Adele, Rachel, and Alice. The youngest, Alice married first, Arthur Duckworth in 1927, which ended in divorce and second, musician Benny Goodman in 1942. Hammond showed interest in music from an early age. At four he began studying the piano, only to switch to the violin at age eight. He was steered toward classical music by his mother but was more interested in the music sung and played by the servants, many of whom were black. He was known to go down to his basement to listen to the upbeat music in the servants' quarters. He loved Sir Harry Lauder's \\"Roamin' in the Gloamin'\\". While he was in the basement, the rest of his family in the greater part of the five-story mansion would listen to \\"the great opera tenor Enrico Caruso, as well as to standard classics by Beethoven, Brahms, and Mozart\\". Hammond became interested in social reform at a young age. His mother also promoted social reform as a means to give back some of her fortune to the community. She often found solace in religion. Hammond shared her desire to help the community with his privilege. Hammond notes that the first jazz music that he heard was in London in 1923 on a trip with his family. He heard a band called The Georgians, a white Dixieland jazz group, and saw a Negro show called From Dixie to Broadway, that featured Sidney Bechet. This trip changed the way that he thought about music. Upon his return to the states, Hammond searched for records by Negro musicians but could not find them in the greater Manhattan area. He learned that Negro music was sold in different stores, so he began to search for this music in Harlem.John Hammond, \\"An Experience in Jazz History\\", in Dominique-Ren√© de Lerma, ed., Black Music in Our Culture: Curricular Ideas on the Subjects, Materials, and Problems (Kent State University Press, 1970), pp. 42‚Äì53. In 1925 Hammond graduated from the elementary institution St. Bernard's School at the age of 14. He persuaded his family to allow him to attend Hotchkiss School due to its liberal curriculum. Hammond's love for music flourished. However, he felt limited within the confines of a boarding school. Hammond succeeded in convincing the headmaster to allow him to go into the city every other weekend, a rare privilege, so that he could take lessons from Ronald Murat. However, the headmaster was not aware that outside his formal lessons, Hammond would go up to Harlem to hear jazz. During this time, he said that he heard Bessie Smith perform at The Harlem Alhambra, but her biographer disagrees about the dates. The summer after graduating from Hotchkiss in 1929, Hammond went to work for a newspaper in Maine, the Portland Evening News. Its editor Ernest Gruening was also a Hotchkiss alumnus, class of 1903, who was interested in social issues and social justice.\\"Alumni Accomplishments: Ernest Gruening '03\\" , The Hotchkiss School In the fall of 1929, Hammond entered Yale University as a member of the class of 1933. He studied the violin and, later, viola. He felt a disconnect with his fellow students at Yale and felt that he was already well acquainted with the professional world. He made frequent trips into New York city and wrote regularly for trade magazines. In the fall semester of 1930, Hammond had to withdraw due to a recurring case of jaundice. Hammond had no desire to a repeat a semester, which contributed to his dissatisfaction with the university lifestyle. Much to the disappointment of his father, a Yale alumnus, in 1931 he dropped out of school for a career in the music industry, first becoming the U.S. correspondent for Melody Maker. Career In 1931, Hammond funded the recording of pianist Garland Wilson, marking the beginning of a long string of artistic successes as record producer. He moved to Greenwich Village, where he claimed to have engaged in bohemian life and worked for an integrated music world. He set up one of the first regular live jazz programs, and wrote regularly about the racial divide. As he wrote in his memoirs,John Hammond On Record: An Autobiography, \\"I heard no color line in the music.... To bring recognition to the negro's supremacy in jazz was the most effective and constructive form of social protest I could think of.\\" This pre-occupation with social issues was to continue, and in 1941 he was one of the founders of the Council on African Affairs. In 1932, Hammond acquired a nonpaying job on the WEVD radio station as a disc jockey. He did not discriminate when choosing which musicians to air; the station allowed Hammond complete freedom on the station as long as he paid for his time slot. Through this position, Hammond gained a reputation as a well-educated jazz fan. Various musicians were guests on his show, including Fletcher Henderson, Benny Carter, and Art Tatum. When the station transferred from the Broadway Central Hotel to the Claridge Hotel, the new venue would not allow the black musicians to use the main elevator. For this reason, Hammond quit his work with WEVD. By 1932‚Äì33, through his involvement in the UK music paper Melody Maker, Hammond arranged for the faltering US Columbia label to provide recordings for the UK Columbia label, mostly using the specially created Columbia W-265000 matrix series. Hammond recorded Fletcher Henderson, Benny Carter, Joe Venuti, Benny Goodman, and other jazz performers during a time when the economy was bad enough during the Great Depression that many of them would not have otherwise had the opportunity to enter a studio and play real jazz (a handful of these in this special series were issued in the US). In 1934, Hammond is known to have introduced Benny Goodman and Fletcher Henderson. It is said that Hammond convinced the musicians to 'swing' the current jazz hits, so that they could play in a free manner like the original New Orleans Jazz.\\"Swing\\". The Subject Is Jazz. WNBC. New York, New York, 1958. Television. Hammond always strived for racial integration within the musical scene. For this purpose, he frequently visited musicians in Harlem in order to connect with musicians in their own area. While initially his race proved a problem in connecting with this community, he formed relationships with various musicians that allowed him to surpass this barrier. His friendship with Benny Carter gave him a status that allowed him to enter this musical community. He played a role in organizing Benny Goodman's band, and in persuading him to hire black musicians such as Charlie Christian, Teddy Wilson and Lionel Hampton. In 1933 he heard the seventeen-year-old Billie Holiday perform in Harlem and arranged for her recording debut, on a Benny Goodman session. Four years later, he heard the Count Basie orchestra broadcasting from Kansas City and brought it to New York, where it began to receive national attention. In 1938, Hammond organized the first From Spirituals to Swing concert at Carnegie Hall, presenting a broad program of blues, jazz and gospel artists, including Ida Cox, Big Joe Turner, Albert Ammons, Pete Johnson, Meade \\"Lux\\" Lewis, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, the Count Basie orchestra, Sidney Bechet, Sonny Terry, James P. Johnson, and Big Bill Broonzy (who took the place of the murdered Robert Johnson). He coordinated a second From Spirituals to Swing concert in 1939.Berger, Edward. \\"Hammond, John (Henry Jr.)\\". The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz. Web. After serving in the military during World War II, Hammond felt unmoved by the bebop jazz scene of the mid-1940s. Rejoining Columbia Records in the late 1950s, he signed Pete Seeger and Babatunde Olatunji to the label, and discovered Aretha Franklin, then an eighteen-year-old gospel singer. In 1961, he heard folk singer Bob Dylan playing harmonica on a session for Carolyn Hester; he signed him to Columbia and kept him on the label despite the protests of executives, who referred to Dylan as \\"Hammond's folly\\". He produced Dylan's early recordings, \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" and \\"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\\". Hammond oversaw the highly influential posthumous reissues of Robert Johnson's recorded work (produced by Frank Driggs), convincing Columbia Records to issue the album King of the Delta Blues Singers in 1961. Musicians Hammond signed to the label included Leonard Cohen and Bruce Springsteen. Hammond retired from Columbia in 1975 but continued to scout for talent. In 1983, he brought guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan to Columbia and was credited as executive producer on his debut album. Personal accounts Hammond recognized jazz music to have originated as an African-American musical genre. When Hammond entered the jazz community, integration had not yet begun. Black and white musicians rarely played together and often the prestigious locations permitted only white audiences. Hammond remembers that before the 1920s, black musicians could always find jobs, even if they were low paying. After the instatement of Local 802, a union of professional musicians within New York City, Hammond saw more white people receiving jobs than black people. However, this did not stop the African-American musicians. Through burlesque and record making, these musicians continued to be a presence. 1933 was a defining year for Hammond. He remembers this year being extraordinary due to his establishment of relationships with British record companies. Hammond was able to secure contracts for various musicians. He was an attractive producer to these companies because he did not desire a profit for himself. In 1933, he helped Benny Goodman receive a record deal with Columbia Records, which at the time was only known as English Columbia. During this time, Goodman was in need of a big break, as he was getting a reputation as being difficult to work with. Hammond proposed that Goodman produce a multiracial record; however, Goodman believed this route would hurt his musical reputation. In this year, Hammond broke out of the traditional role of a producer and became a talent scout, after hearing Billie Holiday. He remarks that he was astounded to discover that she was the daughter of Clarence Holiday from Fletcher Henderson's band. That same year, he was able to get her involved in the Benny Goodman Orchestra. Hammond attributes fate to his finding of Holiday. After hearing her sing for the first time, he wrote, \\"She weighs over 200 pounds, is incredibly beautiful, and sings as well as anybody I have ever heard.\\" Later in 1933, he heard Teddy Wilson, a jazz pianist, on the Chicago radio. While he did not discover him, he was able to provide significant opportunities for him, even some collaboration with Billie Holiday. Hammond's work with civil rights came from multiple angles. In 1933, he traveled South to attend a trial regarding the Scottsboro case, a case in which two white girls accused nine black boys of raping them. The testimonies of the two girls did not align with the story. While all nine boys were convicted, Hammond viewed this trial as a \\"catalyst for black activism\\". Record integration became an important component of jazz music. Starting in 1935, musicians began to record in mixed- race groups. While some of this integration had already taken place, Hammond remembers it as being hidden. However, in 1935, the Goodman Trio began recording. In 1936, the group appeared in a live concert at the Chicago Hot Jazz Society. Hammond fondly remembers this as an innovative moment in jazz history. FBI investigation J. Edgar Hoover, FBI director, investigated Hammond's link to the Communist Party. Due to the various benefits and fund- raisers that Hammond hosted for the popular front, his name was often listed in The Daily Worker, a communist newspaper. Furthermore, his name often appeared on the letterheads of left-wing organizations for which he was a donor or member. However, Hammond was not a communist. Personal life John had four sisters: Alice, Rachel, Adele, and Emily. Early in his career, Hammond focused more on his work than his love life. While he was seen publicly with various women, the relationships were never substantial. However, in 1940 at a Manhattan party, Hammond met Jemison \\"Jemy\\" McBride. On March 8, 1941, Hammond married Jemy in New Haven, Connecticut. The couple had a small, non-denominational wedding with only about ten guests. Although both sets of parents approved of the couple, neither set attended the wedding. In 1942, Hammond took his wife on a road trip to Los Angeles. Shortly after this trip, Jemy realized that she was pregnant. In November 1942, Jemy gave birth to their first son, John P. Hammond. On March 21, 1942, Hammond's sister, Alice married Benny Goodman. She had previously been married to Englishman George Duckworth, a member of the British House of Commons. Hammond did not look kindly upon her marriage to Goodman. After years of arguments and disagreements about musical issues for Goodman's band, Hammond and Goodman had a complete falling out, some of which has been attributed to their differing class and educational backgrounds (Goodman had been born into poverty and had quit high school in order to help support his family as a musician). However, out of a sense of shared grief following Alice's death in 1978, John and Benny reconciled their friendship. In November 1943, after the United States entered World War II, Hammond began military training. He underwent his basic training at Fort Belvoir. Hammond was much older than the majority of the other men, and he had a rough time adjusting to the military life. While he was still in basic training, Jemy gave birth to their second child, Douglas, early in 1944. Douglas came down with a serious illness. While Jemy sent Hammond a telegram to alert him of his newborn's condition, Hammond said that he never received it. Jemy speculated that Hammond was in a concert and disregarded the letter; however, that claim has been proven unlikely due to Hammond's strict schedule in basic training. Douglas died shortly after birth from his illness, and Jemy had to undergo the family tragedy without her husband. Hammond returned after basic training on a three-day pass, but he and his wife were distant. After basic training, Hammond reported to Camp Plauche, where he was placed to organize activities for the black soldiers. During this time period, African- American soldiers were given little to do within the military. The armed forces were still segregated and discriminatory. Hammond began his efforts by organizing concerts for the soldiers featuring African-American musicians. He noted that shortly after these concerts began, an integrated sports team formed. Toward the end of World War II, Hammond was transferred to Fort Benning, Georgia, known for its intense racism. Hammond was not the only jazz fan irritated with racism. During this time period, bebop music grew out of late night jam sessions of black musicians. Hammond was not much a part of the bebop movement, but he shared the sentiment against racism. In 1946, Hammond was discharged from the military. His family moved to Greenwich Village, where Jemy gave birth to their third son, Jason. Hammond threw himself back into his work, which greatly upset his wife. In 1948, Jemy asked Hammond for a divorce. While he was originally reluctant, Hammond agreed to the divorce. Jemy never remarried. A year later, in 1949, Hammond met Esme Sarnoff, originally Esme O'Brien, the former wife of NBC chairman Robert W. Sarnoff, and a daughter of Mary and Esmond O'Brien. Esme shared Hammond's musical passion and was planning to divorce her husband. That year, Hammond married Esme Sarnoff. By this marriage Hammond had one stepdaughter, (Esme) Rosita Sarnoff (born 1943). During this time, Hammond's father died on a golf course. Left a widow, Emily Hammond became infatuated with Frank Buchman. In 1985, Hammond had his first stroke. Although this impaired him physically, his wife's death left him in despair. Esme Hammond was diagnosed with breast cancer. While treatments worked for some time, she died May 19, 1986,\\"Esme Hammond, 66, A Prominent Socialite\\"; The New York Times (May 22, 1986); Retrieved October 16, 2011. of complications of AIDS. She had contracted it from a blood transfusion. Hammond was distraught and died on July 10, 1987, after a series of strokes. It is said that he died listening to the music of Billie Holiday. Legacy \\"John's Idea\\", originally titled \\"I May Be Wrong It's John's Idea\\", is a tribute to John Hammond written by Count Basie. Hammond received a Grammy Trustees Award for being credited with co-producing a Bessie Smith reissue in 1971, and in 1986 was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Hammond's son, John P. Hammond, became an American Blues musician. Hammond was one of the first men to racially integrate the American music industry. Before the Civil Rights Act passed, Tom Wilson, an African American, replaced Hammond as Bob Dylan's record producer. In December 2015 Guinness featured John Hammond in its UK advertising campaign.

He founded the temple and headquarters of Tendai at Enryaku-ji on Mount Hiei near Kyoto. He is also said to have been the first to bring tea to Japan. After his death, he was awarded the posthumous title of Dengy≈ç Daishi (‰ºùÊïôÂ§ßÂ∏´).  Life = Early life  Saich≈ç was born in the year 767 in the city of ≈åmi, in present Shiga Prefecture, with the given name of Hirono. According to family tradition, Saich≈ç's ancestors were descendants of emperors of Eastern Han China; however, no positive evidence exists for this claim. The region where Saich≈ç was born did have a large Chinese immigrant population, so Saich≈ç likely did have Chinese ancestry. During Saich≈ç's time, the Buddhist temples in Japan were officially organized into a national network known as the provincial temple system, and at the age of 13, Saich≈ç became a disciple of one Gy≈çhy≈ç (722‚Äì797, Ë°åË°®). He took tonsure as a novice monk at the age of 14 and was given the ordination name \\"Saich≈ç\\". Gy≈çhy≈ç in turn was a disciple of Dao-xuan (702‚Äì760, ÈÅìÁíø, D≈çsen in Japanese), a prominent monk from China of the Tiantai school who had brought the East Mountain Teaching of Chan Buddhism, Huayan teachings and the Bodhisattva Precepts of the Brahmajala Sutra to Japan in 736 and served as the \\"precept master\\" for ordination prior to the arrival of Jianzhen. By the age of 20, he undertook the full monastic precepts at the T≈çdai-ji, thus becoming a fully ordained monk in the official temple system. A few months later he abruptly retreated to Mount Hiei for an intensive study and practice of Buddhism, though the exact reason for his departure remains unknown. Shortly after his retreat, he composed his which included his personal vows to: # So long as I have not attained the stage where my six faculties are pure, I will not venture out into the world. # So long as I have not realized the absolute, I will not acquire any special skills or arts (e.g. medicine, divination, calligraphy, etc.) # So long as I have not kept all the precepts purely, I will not participate in any lay donor's Buddhist meetings. # So long as I have not attained wisdom (lit. hannya Ëà¨Ëã•), I will not participate in worldly affairs unless it be to benefit others. # May any merit from my practice in the past, present and future be given not to me, but to all sentient beings so that they may attain supreme enlightenment. In time, Saich≈ç attracted other monks both on Mount Hiei, and from the Buddhist community in Nara, and a monastic community developed on Mount Hiei, which eventually became Enryaku- ji. Saich≈ç was said to have carved an image of the Bhai·π£ajyaguru and enshrined it. Additionally, he lit a lamp of oil before the Buddha and prayed that the lamp would never be extinguished. This lamp is now known as the and has remained lit for 1200 years. The capital of Japan was moved from Nara to Nagaoka-ky≈ç in 784, and then to Kyoto in 795. Because Mount Hiei was coincidentally located to the northeast of Kyoto, a direction considered dangerous according to Chinese geomancy, Saich≈ç's presence on the mountain was thought to protect the new capital and brought him to the attention of the court. Saich≈ç and his community on Mount Hiei also started to correspond and exchange ceremonies with the established communities in Nara, in addition to the monks at the Court, further enhancing his prestige. One of Saich≈ç's earliest supporters in the Court was Wake no Hiroyo, who invited Saich≈ç to give lectures at Takaosan-ji along with fourteen other eminent monks. Saich≈ç was not the first to be invited, indicating that he was still relatively unknown in the Court, but rising in prominence.  Trip to China  Saich≈ç is known for having introduced tea to Japan The success of the Takaosanji lectures, plus Saich≈ç's association with Wake no Hiroyo soon caught the attention of Emperor Kanmu who consulted with Saich≈ç about propagating his Buddhist teachings further, and to help bridge the traditional rivalry between the East Asian YogƒÅcƒÅra and East Asian MƒÅdhyamaka schools. The emperor granted a petition by Saich≈ç to journey to China to further study Tiantai doctrine in China and bring back more texts. Saich≈ç was expected to only remain in China for a short time however. Saich≈ç could read Chinese but was unable to speak it at all, thus he was allowed to bring a trusted disciple along named , who apparently could speak Chinese. Gishin would later become one of the head monks of the Tendai order after Saich≈ç. Saich≈ç was part of the four-ship diplomatic mission to Tang China in 803. The ships were forced to turn back due to heavy winds, where they spent some time at Dazaifu, Fukuoka. During this time, Saich≈ç likely met another passenger, K≈´kai, a fellow Buddhist monk who was sent to China on a similar mission though he was expected to stay much longer. When the ships set sail again, two sank during a heavy storm, but Saich≈ç's ship arrived at the port of Ningbo, then known as Mingzhou (), in northern Zhejiang in 804. Shortly after arrival, permission was granted for Saich≈ç and his party to travel to Tiantai Mountain and he was introduced to the seventh Patriarch of Tiantai, Daosui (), who became his primary teacher during his time in China. Daosui was instrumental in teaching Saich≈ç about Tiantai methods of meditation, monastic discipline and orthodox teachings. Saich≈ç remained under this instruction for approximately 135 days. Saich≈ç spent the next several months copying various Buddhist works with the intention of bringing them back to Japan with him. While some works existed in Japan already, Saich≈ç felt that they suffered from copyist errors or other defects, and so he made fresh copies. Once the task was completed, Saich≈ç and his party returned to Ningbo, but the ship was harbored in Fuzhou at the time, and would not return for six weeks. During this time, Saich≈ç went to Yuezhou (Ë∂äÂ∑û, modern-day Shaoxing) and sought out texts and information on Vajrayana (Esoteric) Buddhism. The Tiantai school originally only utilized \\"mixed\\" () ceremonial practices, but over time esoteric Buddhism took on a greater role. By the time Saich≈ç had arrived in China, a number of Tiantai Buddhist centers provided esoteric training, and both Saich≈ç and Gishin received initiation at a temple in Yue Prefecture. However, it's unclear what transmission or transmissions(s) they received. Some evidence suggests that Saich≈ç did not receive the dual ( transmissions of the Diamond Realm and the Womb Realm. Instead, it is thought he may have only received the Diamond Realm transmission, but the evidence is not conclusive one way or the other. Finally, on the tenth day of the fifth month of 805, Saich≈ç and his party returned to Ningbo and after compiling further bibliographies, boarded the ship back for Japan and arrived in Tsushima on the fifth day of the sixth month. Although Saich≈ç had only stayed in China for a total of eight months, his return was eagerly awaited by the court in Kyoto.  Founding of Tendai  On his return from China, Saich≈ç worked hard to win recognition from the court and \\"in the first month of 806, Saich≈ç's Tendai Lotus school (Tendai- hokke-sh≈´ Â§©Âè∞Ê≥ïËèØÂÆó) won official recognition when the court of the ailing emperor Kanmu issued another edict, this one permitting two annual ordinands (nenbundosha) for Saich≈ç's new school on Mount Hiei. This edict states that, following Saich≈ç's request, the ordinands would be divided between two curricula: the shanag≈ç course, centering on the study of the Mahavairocana S≈´tra (this was the Mikky≈ç curriculum, shana being the abbreviation for Birushana, the Japanese transliteration of Vairocana), and the shikang≈ç course, based on the study of the Mo-ho chih-kuan, the seminal work of the T'ien-t'ai patriarch Chih-i Êô∫È°ó (538‚Äì597) (this was the Tendai curriculum, shikan being the Japanese reading of Chih-i's central practice of chih-kuan [cessation and contemplation]) (Kenkairon engi, DZ 1, pp. 294‚Äì296). Thus from its very inception the Tendai Lotus school was equally based on Mikky≈ç and T'ien-t'ai. It was as a subdivision of Saich≈ç's new school that Mikky≈ç first received the official acknowledgment of the imperial court and became a proper subject of study in Japanese Buddhism. Before Saich≈ç, all monastic ordinations took place at T≈çdai-ji temple under the ancient Vinaya code, but Saich≈ç intended to found his school as a strictly Mahayana institution and ordain monks using the Bodhisattva Precepts only. Despite intense opposition from the traditional Buddhist schools in Nara, his request was granted by Emperor Saga in 822, several days after his death. This was the fruit of years of effort and a formal debate.  Decline and Death  By 822, Saich≈ç petitioned the court to allow the monks at Mount Hiei to ordain under the Bodhisattva Precepts rather than the traditional ordination system of the prƒÅtimok·π£a, arguing that his community would be a purely Mahayana, not Hinayana one. This was met with strong protest by the Buddhist establishment who supported the kokubunji system, and lodged a protest. Saich≈ç composed the , which stressed the significance of the Bodhisattva Precepts, but his request was still rejected until 7 days after his death at the age of 56.  Relationship with K≈´kai  Saich≈ç traveled to China along with a number of other young monks, one of whom was named K≈´kai. Saich≈ç befriended him during his trip to China who traveled with him going and coming. This turned out to be pivotal to the future development of Buddhism. , and likewise returned with esoteric (tantric) Buddhist texts. Saich≈ç was entranced with the new material and wanted to learn more. On the trip back he found that Kukai had studied these teachings in depth and had an entire library of vajrayana materials. This friendship would influence the future of Tendai. It was Saich≈ç who performed the abhi·π£eka, or initiatory ritual, for the court.  Exoteric syncretic tradition versus esotericism  Thus esoteric Buddhism became an important aspect of the Tendai school, which was primarily focused on the Lotus Sutra. Paul Groner states, Tendai and Esoteric practices, he felt, provided a direct path (jikid≈ç) to enlightenment, whereas the teachings of the Nara schools required aeons to bring the practitioner to enlightenment. However, Moreover, Saich≈ç began to realize that his own idea of \\"enmitsu itchi\\" was not exactly shared by the esoteric Shingon school, and especially its founder K≈´kai (K≈çb≈ç Daishi). Ryuichi Abe writes, Saich≈ç's late life criticisms were ignored by his own leading disciples, and the Tendai would continue to teach Mikky≈ç and Shikang≈ç (≈õamatha-vipa≈õyanƒÅ). Saich≈ç's public condemnation of K≈´kai would later form the seeds for some of the criticisms leveled by the founder of the Nichiren Sect, Nichiren, who would cite that work in his own debates.Gosho  http://www.sgilibrary.org/view.php?page=565 Saich≈ç was also an author.

Earl Talbot is a title that has been created twice in the Peerage of Great Britain. This branch of the Talbot family descends from the Hon. Sir Gilbert Talbot (died 1518), third son of John Talbot, 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury. His great-great-great-grandson, the Right Reverend William Talbot, was Bishop of Oxford, of Salisbury and of Durham. His eldest son Charles Talbot was a prominent lawyer and politician. In 1733, he was raised to the Peerage of Great Britain as Lord Talbot, Baron of Hensol, in the County of Glamorgan, and then served as Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain from 1733 to 1737. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Baron. He served as Lord Steward of the Household from 1761 to 1782. In 1761, he was created Earl Talbot and in 1780, Baron Dynevor, of Dynevor in the County of Carmarthen, in the Peerage of Great Britain. The earldom was created with normal remainder to the heirs male of his body, while the barony was created with remainder to his daughter Cecil, wife of George Rice, and her issue male. Subsequent history On his death in 1782, the earldom became extinct, while he was succeeded in the barony of Dynevor according to the special remainder by his daughter Cecil (see the Baron Dynevor article for later history of this branch of the family). The barony of Talbot was passed on to his nephew John, the third Baron. He was the son of the Hon. John Talbot (d. 1756), younger son of the first Baron, and his wife the Hon. Catherine Chetwynde, daughter of John Chetwynde, 2nd Viscount Chetwynde. He represented Castle Rising in the House of Commons. In 1784, the earldom was revived when he was made Viscount of Ingestre, in the County of Stafford, and Earl Talbot, of Hensol in the County of Glamorgan. Both titles were in the Peerage of Great Britain. Lord Talbot assumed by Royal licence the surname and arms of Chetwynd in 1786. On his death, the titles passed to his son, the second Earl. He served under the Earl of Liverpool as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland from 1817 to 1821. He was succeeded by his second but eldest surviving son, the third Earl. In 1856, on the death of his distant relative Bertram Arthur Talbot, 17th Earl of Shrewsbury and 17th Earl of Waterford, he succeeded as eighteenth Earl of Shrewsbury and eighteenth Earl of Waterford. For more information on him and for further history of the peerages, see the Earl of Shrewsbury. Several members of junior branches of the family have also gained distinction: *The Hon.

In concept and basic configuration, it was related to the early Korolyov RP-318 rocket-powered aircraft which was developed in 1936 and first flew February 20, 1940, and the more recent Bereznyak-Isayev BI-1http://vvs.hobbyvista.com/Research/Bereznyak- Isayev/BI/index.php Soviet design. Only two prototypes were built, both of which were destroyed in crashes, leading to the cancellation of the project. Model of I-270 Flights In the early stages of World War II (1942), a complete prototype BI-1 (also known as The Devil's Broomstick), made its first several flights. The I-270 shared the BI-1's simple, tapered fuselage, bubble canopy, wing design, and dual-chambered bipropellant rocket motor. On the other hand, it was considerably larger than the BI-1 and featured short, reinforced wings (from the RP-218) and a raised T-tail which aircraft such as the Tupolev ANT-8 proved, offered better landing control than the BI-1's more traditional fighter layout. While there seems little doubt that the BI-1 influenced the design of the I-270, the latter appears far from a direct descendant of the former, and much closer to being a Soviet version of the Me 263, sharing very similar fuselage, canopy and landing gear layouts, while adding a conventional stabilizer surface atop the vertical tail, absent on the German design. Soviet tradition of rocketry, starting from the early work of Konstantin Tsiolkovsky and carried through by men like Sergei Korolev, made rocket fighters a reality. The RD-2M engine, designed by Leonid Dushkin was the dual-combustion chamber version of the engine used for the 1941 BI-1 rocket plane. That in turn had followed from a tradition dating back to Sergey Korolev's work on project \\"06\\" in the early 1930s and the RP-318 rocket plane designed in 1936. The first gliding trials commenced in December 1946, with the first prototype towed into the air behind a Tupolev Tu-2, ballast-loaded in place of an engine. The second prototype began powered tests early in 1947, but was damaged beyond repair making a hard landing. Shortly afterwards, the first prototype was also destroyed in a landing accident. By this stage, turbojet technology was at a far more advanced stage than it had been at the outset of the project, and surface-to-air missiles had replaced the need for point-defence interceptors. Under these circumstances, the Air Force decided to cancel the project.

Betel leaves at a market in Mandalay, Burma Paan (from , lit. leaf,Oxford Dictionary paan cognate with English fern) is a preparation combining betel leaf with areca nut widely consumed throughout Southeast Asia, South Asia (Indian subcontinent) and East Asia (mainly Taiwan). It is chewed for its stimulant effects. After chewing, it is either spat out or swallowed. Paan has many variations. Slaked lime (chuna) paste is commonly added to bind the leaves. Some preparations in the Indian subcontinent include katha paste or mukhwas to freshen the breath. Magahi paan is an expensive variety of betel which is grown in Aurangabad, Gaya and Nalanda districts of central Bihar. It is non-fibrous, sweeter, tastier and the softest of the lot. The origin and diffusion of betel chewing originates from and is closely tied to the Neolithic expansion of the Austronesian peoples. It was spread to the Indo- Pacific during prehistoric times, reaching Near Oceania at 3,400 to 3,000 BP; South India and Sri Lanka by 3,500 BP; Mainland Southeast Asia by 3,000 to 2,500 BP; Northern India by 1500 BP; and Madagascar by 600 BP. From India, it was also spread westwards to Persia and the Mediterranean. Paan (under a variety of names) is also consumed in many other Asian countries and elsewhere in the world by some Asian emigrants, with or without tobacco. With tobacco it can be an addictive and stimulating formulation with adverse health effects. The spit from chewing betel nuts, known as \\"buai pekpek\\" in Papua New Guinea, is often considered an eyesore. Because of this, many places have banned selling and chewing \\"buai\\".Price, Blair (2012). \\"Betel nut: underground economies\\" . PNGIndustryNews.net. History Areca catechu illustrated by Francisco Manuel Blanco in Flora de Filipinas (1880-1883). It is originally native to the Philippines Based on archaeological, linguistic, and botanical evidence, the spread of betel chewing is most strongly associated with the Austronesian peoples. Chewing betel requires the combination of areca nut (Areca catechu) and betel leaf (Piper betle). Both plants are native from the region between Island Southeast Asia to Australasia. A. catechu is believed to be originally native to the Philippines, where it has the greatest morphological diversity as well as the most number of closely related endemic species. The origin of the domestication of Piper betle, however, is unknown. It is also unknown when the two were combined, as areca nut alone can be chewed for its narcotic properties. In eastern Indonesia, leaves from the wild Piper caducibracteum are also harvested and used in place of betel leaves. Austronesians (5,500 to 800 BP), which roughly corresponds to the prehistoric distribution of betel chewing The oldest unequivocal evidence of betel chewing is from the Philippines. Specifically that of several individuals found in a burial pit in the Duyong Cave site of Palawan island dated to around 4,630¬±250 BP. The dentition of the skeletons is stained, typical of betel chewers. The grave also includes Anadara shells used as containers of lime, one of which still contained lime. Burial sites in Bohol dated to the first millennium CE also show the distinctive reddish stains characteristic of betel chewing. Based on linguistic evidence of how the reconstructed Proto- Austronesian term *buaq originally meaning \\"fruit\\" came to refer to \\"areca nut\\" in Proto-Malayo-Polynesian, it is believed that betel chewing originally developed somewhere within the Philippines shortly after the beginning of the Austronesian expansion (~5,000 BP). From the Philippines, it spread back to Taiwan, as well as onwards to the rest of Austronesia. There are very old claims of betel chewing dating to at least 13,000 BP at the Kuk Swamp site in New Guinea, based on probable Areca sp. recovered. However, it is now known that these might have been due to modern contamination of sample materials. Similar claims have also been made at other older sites with Areca sp. remains, but none can be conclusively identified as A. catechu and their association with betel peppers is tenuous or nonexistent. It reached Micronesia at around 3,500 to 3,000 BP with the Austronesian voyagers, based on both linguistic and archaeological evidence. It was also previously present in the Lapita culture, based on archaeological remains from Mussau dated to around 3,600 to 2,500 BP. But it did not reach Polynesia further east. It is believed that it stopped in the Solomon Islands due to the replacement of betel chewing with the tradition of kava drinking prepared from the related Piper methysticum. It was also diffused into East Africa via the Austronesian settlement of Madagascar and the Comoros by around the 7th century. The practice also diffused to the cultures the Austronesians had historical contact with. It reached the Dong Son culture via the Austronesian Sa Hu·ª≥nh culture of Vietnam at around 3,000 to 2,500 BP through trade contacts with Borneo. It is from this period that skeletons with characteristic red-stained teeth start to appear in Mainland Southeast Asia. It is assumed that it reached South China and Hainan at around the same time, though no archaeological evidence for this can be found as of yet. In Cambodia, the earliest evidence of betel nut chewing is from around 2,400 to 2,200 BP. It also spread to Thailand at 1,500 BP, based on archaeobotanical evidence. Paan dan from Punjab, India, 19th century, Walters Art Museum, Baltimore. In the Indian subcontinent, betel chewing was introduced through early contact of Austronesian traders from Sumatra, Java, and the Malay Peninsula with the Dravidian-speakers of Sri Lanka and southern India at around 3,500 BP. This also coincides with the introduction of Southeast Asian plants like Santalum album and Cocos nucifera, as well as the adoption of the Austronesian outrigger ship and crab-claw sail technologies by Dravidian-speakers. Unequivocal literary references to betel only start appearing after the Vedic period, in works like Dipava·πÉsa (c. 3rd century CE) and MahƒÅva·πÉsa (c. 5th century). Betel chewing only reached northern India and Kashmir after 500 CE through trade with Mon-Khmer-speaking peoples in the Bay of Bengal. From there it followed the Silk Road to Persia and into the Mediterranean. Chinese records, specifically Linyi Ji by Dongfang Shuo associate the growing of areca palms with the first settlers of the Austronesian Champa polities in southern Vietnam at around 2,100 to 1,900 BP. This association is echoed in Nanfang Cao Mu Zhuang by Ji Han (c. 304 CE) who also describes its importance in Champa culture, specifically in the way Cham hosts traditionally offer it to guests. Betel chewing entered China through trade with Champa, borrowing the Proto- Malayo-Chamic name *pina≈ã resulting in Chinese bin lang for \\"areca nut\\", with the meaning of \\"honored guest\\", reflecting Chamic traditions. The same for the alternate term bin men yao jian, literally meaning \\"guest [at the door] medicinal sweetmeat\\". Culture Arecanutconsum1.PNGBetel leaf and areca nut consumption in the world.

Spit from chewing Areca nut 02.JPGPaan made with areca nut and lime, with or without tobacco, causes profuse red coloured salivation, known in Tok Pisin as buai pekpek. This saliva is spat, yielding stains and biological waste pollution in public spaces. Many countries and municipalities have laws to prevent paan spit. Chewing the mixture of areca nut and betel leaf is a tradition, custom or ritual which dates back thousands of years from India to the Pacific. Ibn Battuta describes this practice as follows: \\"The betel is a tree which is cultivated in the same manner as the grape-vine; ... The betel has no fruit and is grown only for the sake of its leaves ... The manner of its use is that before eating it one takes areca nut; this is like a nutmeg but is broken up until it is reduced to small pellets, and one places these in his mouth and chews them. Then he takes the leaves of betel, puts a little chalk on them, and masticates them along with the betel.\\" Since the introduction of tobacco from the Western Hemisphere to the Eastern Hemisphere, it has been an optional addition to paan. Paan chewing constitutes an important and popular cultural activity in many Asian and Oceanic countries, including India, Myanmar, Cambodia, the Solomon Islands, Thailand, the Philippines, Laos, and Vietnam.Archaeological evidence from Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines. In urban areas, chewing paan is generally considered a nuisance because some chewers spit the paan out in public areas ‚Äì compare chewing gum ban in Singapore and smoking ban. The red stain generated by the combination of ingredients when chewed are known to make a colourful stain on the ground. This is becoming an unwanted eyesore in Indian cities such as Mumbai, although many see it as an integral part of Indian culture. This is also common in some of the Persian Gulf countries, such as the UAE and Qatar, where many Indians live. Recently, the Dubai government has banned the import and sale of paan and the like. According to traditional Ayurvedic medicine, chewing betel leaf is a remedy against bad breath (halitosis), but it can possibly lead to oral cancer.

In a 16th-century cookbook, Nimmatnama-i Nasiruddin-Shahi, describes Ghiyas-ud-din Khalji, the Sultan of Mandu (r. 1469‚Äì1500), watches as tender betel leaves of the finest quality are spread out and rosewater is sprinkled on them, while saffron is also added. An elaborate betel chew or paan would contain fragrant spices and rose preserves with chopped areca nuts. It is a tradition in South India and nearby regions to give two Betel leaves, areca nut (pieces or whole) and Coconut to the guests (both male and female) at any auspicious occasion. Even on a regular day, it is the tradition to give a married woman, who visits the house, two Betel leaves, areca nut and coconut or some fruits along with a string of threaded flowers. This is referred to as tambolam. Betel leaf used to make paan is produced in different parts of India. Some states that produce betel leaf for paan include West Bengal, Bihar, Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh. In West Bengal, two types of betel leaves are produced. These are \\"Bangla Pata (Country Leaf)\\" and Mitha Pata (Sweet Leaf)\\". In West Bengal, Bangla pata is produced mainly in district of Dinajpur, Malda, Jalpaiguri, and Nadia. Mitha pata is produced in places such as Midnapur and South 24 Parganas. The skilled paan maker is known as a paanwala in North India. In other parts, paanwalas are also known as panwaris or panwadis. At North India, there is a tradition to chew paan after Deepawali puja for blessings. In the Indian state of Maharashtra, the paan culture is widely criticised due to the cleanliness problems created by people who spit in public places. In Mumbai, there have been attempts to put pictures of Hindu gods in places where people commonly tend to spit, in the hope that this would discourage spitting, but success has been limited. One of the great Marathi artists P L Deshpande wrote a comic story on the subject of paanwala (paan vendor), and performed a televised reading session on Doordarshan during the 1980s in his unique style. Paan is losing its appeal to farmers because of falling demand. Consumers prefer chewing tobacco formulations such as gutka over paan. Higher costs, water scarcity and unpredictable weather have made betel gardens less lucrative. According to StraitsResearch, The India pan masala market is expected to reach US$10,365 million by 2026 at the CAGR of 10.4% during the forecast period 2019‚Äì2026. The India pan masala market is driven by significant switching of consumers from tobacco products to pan masala, aggressive advertising and convenient packaging, and Maharashtra State's revocation of the ban over pan masala products. =Assam= In Assam, India, betel nut is traditionally offered as a mark of respect and auspicious beginnings. Paan-tamul (betel leaves and raw areca nut) may be offered to guests after tea or meals, served in a brass plate with stands called bota. The areca nut also appears as a fertility symbol in religious and marriage ceremonies. When showing respect to elders or asking for forgiveness, people, especially newlyweds place a pair of paan-tamul on a xorai, place it in front of the elder and bow to show respect. Guests may be invited to a wedding reception by offering a few areca nuts with betel leaves. During Bihu, the husori players are offered areca nuts and betel leaves by each household while their blessings are solicited. Paan-tamul is also offered to guests after the end of every feast, usually the paan-tamul-soon, or slaked lime with cardamom pods in it to freshen the breath.

COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Zilveren sirihdoos met gouden dekselbekleding TMnr 1698-474.jpgBalinese cerana or betel nut container. Bersirih, nyirih or menginang is a Malay-Indonesian tradition of chewing materials such as nut, betel, gambier, tobacco, clove and limestone. Menginang tradition or chewing betel nut is widespread among Indonesian ethnic groups, especially among the Javanese, Balinese and Malay people; dating back to more than 3000 years. Records of travelers from China showed that betel and areca had been consumed since the 2nd century BCE. In the Malay archipelago, the menginang or betel nut chewing has become a revered activity in local tradition; being a ceremoniously conducted gesture to honour guests. A complete and elaborate set of sirih pinang equipment is called Tepak Sirih, pekinangan or cerana. The set is usually made of wooden lacquerware, brass or silverwares; and it consists of the combol (containers), bekas sirih (leaf container), kacip (press-knife to cut areca nut), gobek (small pestle and mortar), and ketur (spit container). The Sirih Pinang has become a symbol of Malay culture, with the Malay oral tradition having phrases such as \\"The betel opens the door to the home\\" or \\"the betel opens the door to the heart\\". Menginang is used at many formal occasions such as marriages, births, deaths, and healings. A number of Malay traditional dances‚Äîsuch as the South Sumatran Tanggai dance‚Äîare in fact describing the dancers bringing cerana or tepak sirih equipment, ceremoniously presenting an offering of betel nut to the revered guest. Philippines Paan has been part of the indigenous culture in the Philippines. It is commonly and simply referred to as ngang√† in Tagalog and mama or maman in Ilokano. Ngang√† literally means \\"to chew/gnaw\\". Nowadays, it is most popular among the inhabitants of the Cordilleras, among the Lumad and Muslim Filipinos of Mindanao, and among lowland barrio folks elsewhere in the Philippines. Myanmar Paan vendor at Bogyoke Market in Yangon, Myanmar Kwun-ya ( [k√≥Àên.j√†]) is the word for paan in Myanmar, formerly Burma, where the most common configuration for chewing is a betel vine leaf (Piper betel), areca nut (from Areca catechu), slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) and some aroma, although many betel chewers also use tobacco. Betel chewing has very long tradition in Burma, having been practised since before the beginning of recorded history. Until the 1960s, both men and women loved it and every household used to have a special lacquerware box for paan, called kun-it (), which would be offered to any visitor together with cheroots to smoke and green tea to drink. The leaves are kept inside the bottom of the box, which looks like a small hat box, but with a top tray for small tins, silver in well-to-do homes, of various other ingredients such as the betel nuts, slaked lime, cutch, anise seed and a nut cutter. The sweet form (acho) is popular with the young, but grownups tend to prefer it with cardamom, cloves and tobacco. Spittoons, therefore, are still ubiquitous, and signs saying \\"No paan-spitting\\" are commonplace, as it makes a messy red splodge on floors and walls; many people display betel-stained teeth from the habit. Paan stalls and kiosks used to be run mainly by people of Indian origin in towns and cities. Smokers who want to kick the habit would also use betel nut to wean themselves off tobacco. Taungoo in Lower Burma is where the best areca palms are grown indicated by the popular expression \\"like a betel lover taken to Taungoo\\". Other parts of the country contribute to the best paan according to another saying \\"Tada-U for the leaves, Ngamyagyi for the tobacco, Taungoo for the nuts, Sagaing for the slaked lime, Pyay for the cutch\\". Kun, hsay, lahpet (paan, tobacco and pickled tea) are deemed essential items to offer monks and elders particularly in the old days. Young maidens traditionally carry ornamental betel boxes on a stand called kundaung and gilded flowers (pandaung) in a shinbyu (novitiation) procession. Burmese history also mentions an ancient custom of a condemned enemy asking for \\"a paan and a drink of water\\" before being executed. An anecdotal government survey indicated that 40% of men and 20% of women in Myanmar chew betel. An aggregate study of cancer registries (2002 to 2007) at the Yangon and Mandalay General Hospitals, the largest hospitals in the country, found that oral cancer was the 6th most common cancer among males, and 10th among females. Of these oral carcinoma patients, 36% were regular betel quid chewers. University of Dental Medicine, Yangon records from 1985 to 1988 showed that 58.6% of oral carcinoma patients were regular betel chewers. Since the 1990s, betel chewing has been actively discouraged by successive governments, from the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) onward, on the grounds of health and tidiness. In April 1995, the Yangon City Development Committee banned betel in Yangon (Rangoon), in anticipation of Visit Myanmar Year 1996, a massive effort to promote the country as a tourist destination. Effective 29 July 2007, betel chewing, along with smoking, has been banned from the Shwedagon Pagoda, the country's most important religious site. In 2010, the Ministry of Education's Department of Basic Education and Burma's Anti-Narcotics Task Force collaborated to prohibit betel shops from operating within of any school. Pakistan The consumption of paan has long been a very popular cultural tradition throughout Pakistan, especially in Muhajir households, where numerous paans were consumed throughout the day.Meetha or saada, Karachi's love for paan is unmatched In general, though, paan is an occasional delicacy thoroughly enjoyed by many, and almost exclusively bought from street vendors instead of any preparations at home. Pakistan grows a large variety of betel leaf, specifically in the coastal areas of Sindh,Betel-leaf farming in coastal area although paan is imported in large quantities from India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and, recently, Thailand. The paan business is famously handled and run by muhajir traders, who migrated from western India to Pakistan after the independence in 1947 (also cite pg 60, of Pakistan, By Samuel Willard Crompton, Charles F. Gritzner). The culture of chewing paan has also spread in Punjab where a paan shop can be found in almost every street and market. In the famous Anarkali Bazar in Lahore a street called paan gali is dedicated for paan and its ingredients together with other Pakistani products. The rate of Oral cancer have grown substantially in Pakistan due to chewing of Paan.Public health: 'Paan, supari, gukta leading causes of oral cancer' Cambodia, Laos and Thailand Paan dan in shape of peacock. Made of brass, the box dates to 17th or 18th century. On display at the National Museum of Cambodia. The chewing of the product is part of the culture of Cambodia, Laos and Thailand. Cultivation of areca nut palm and betel leaves is common in rural areas of these countries, being a traditional cash crop, and the utensils used for preparation are often treasured. Now, many young people have given up the habit, especially in urban areas, but many, especially older people, still keep to the tradition. Vietnam In Vietnam, the areca nut and the betel leaf are such important symbols of love and marriage that in Vietnamese the phrase \\"matters of betel and areca\\" (chuy·ªán tr·∫ßu cau) is synonymous with marriage. Areca nut chewing starts the talk between the groom's parents and the bride's parents about the young couple's marriage. Therefore, the leaves and juices are used ceremonially in Vietnamese weddings. Bangladesh In Bangladesh, paan is chewed throughout the country by all classes and is an important element of Bangladeshi culture. It is the Bengali ‚Äòchewing gum‚Äô, and usually for chewing, a few slices of the betel nut are wrapped in a betel leaf, almost always with sliced areca nuts and often with calcium hydroxide (slaked lime), and may include cinnamon, clove, cardamom, catechu (khoyer), grated coconut and other spices for extra flavouring. As it is chewed, the peppery taste is savoured, along with the warm feeling and alertness it gives (similar to drinking a fresh cup of coffee). Paan-shupari (shupari being Bengali for areca nut) is a veritable Bangladeshi archetypal imagery, employed in wide-ranging contexts. Prior to British rule, it was chewed without tobacco and it is still rarely chewed with tobacco. Betel leaves are arranged aesthetically on a decorated plate called paandani and it is offered to the elderly people, particularly women, when they engage in leisure time gossip with their friends and relatives. During the zamindari age, paan preparation and the style of garnishing it on a plate (paandani) was indeed a recognised folk art. In Bangladesh paan is traditionally chewed not only as a habit but also as an item of rituals, etiquette and manners. On formal occasions offering paan symbolized the time for departure. In festivals and dinners, in pujas and punyas paan is an indispensable item. Hindus make use of paans as offerings in worship. Dhakai Khilipan, a ready pack of betel leaf processed in Dhaka is famous in the sub-continent. Old Dhakaites have a rich heritage of creating the best khili paan with many complex, colourful, aromatic and mouth-watering ingredients. Although 'paan' has been a staple Bengali custom for ages, a number of high-end stores with premium quality paan has become available in recent times. Paan Supari is perhaps the first such brand, which offers a wide range of khili paan. They also offer a khili paan for diabetic patients called the \\"paan afsana\\". The sweet paan of the Khasi tribe is famous for its special quality. Paan is also used in Hindu puja and wedding festivals and to visit relatives. It has become a ritual, tradition and culture of Bangladeshi society. Adult women gather with paandani along with friends and relatives in leisure time. Total cultivated area under the crop in Bangladesh is about 14,175 ha and the total annual production is about 72,500 tons. The average yield per acre is 2.27 tons. There are usually three crops during the twelve months and they are locally called by the name of the respective months in which they are harvested. Paan leaf is usually plucked in Kartik, Phalgun and Ashad. The Kartik paan is considered by consumers to be the best and Ashad paan the worst. When plucking, it is a rule to leave at least sixteen leaves on the vine. Different varieties of betel leaf are grown and the quality differs in shape, bleaching quality, softness, pungency and aroma of leaf. Tamakh paan, a betel leaf blended with tobacco and spices. Supari paan, another variety of white leaf, Mitha paan, a sweet variety, and Sanchi paan are common varieties of betel leaves. Almost every paan-producing district has its own special variety of betel leaf of which consumers are well acquainted. In the past, the best quality of elegant camphor-scented betel leaf named Kafuri paan was produced in the Sonargaon area of Narayangonj district. It was exported to Calcutta and Middle Eastern countries. The next best is the Sanchi paan grown in Chittagong hill tracts. This variety is not very popular among Bangali people. It is exported to Pakistan for the consumers of Karachi. The commoner varieties are called Desi, Bangla, Bhatial, Dhaldoga, Ghas paan. Bangla paan, is also known as Mitha paan, Jhal paan or paan of Rajshahi. At present, this variety is becoming extinct, due to emergence of more profitable and lucrative fast-growing varieties of paan crops. Normally, betel leaves are consumed with chun, seed cinnamon, cardamoms and other flavored elements. Nepal Paan is chewed mainly by Terai people, although migrants in Terai have also taken up chewing paan in recent times. Throughout Terai, paan is as common as anywhere in northern India. There is some local production, generally not commercial, but most leaves are imported from India. Although not as ubiquitous as in the Terai, most residents of Kathmandu occasionally enjoy paan. A sweet version of paan called meetha paan is popular amongst many who do not like the strong taste of plain (sada) paan. Some parents allow their children to consume meetha in special occasion because it is tobacco- free. Taiwan In Taiwan betel quid is sold from roadside kiosks, often by the so-called betelnut beauties (Hokkien \\"pin-nnÃÇg se-si\\", Mandarin \\"bƒ´nl√°ng xƒ´shƒ´\\", Ê™≥Ê¶îË•øÊñΩ)‚Äîscantily-clad girls selling a quid preparation of betel leaf, betel nuts, tobacco and lime. It is a controversial business, with critics questioning entrapment, exploitation, health, class and culture. Betel girl01.JPGBetelnut Beauty kiosk in Taiwan. Effects on health Health effects of chewing paan: gum damage, tooth decay and oral cancer Health effects: Paan induces profuse salivation that stains mouth area. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) accept the scientific evidence that chewing betel quids and areca nut is carcinogenic to humans. The main carcinogenic factor is believed to be areca nut. A recent study found that areca-nut paan with and without tobacco increased oral cancer risk by 9.9 and 8.4 times, respectively. In one study (c. 1985), scientists linked malignant tumours to the site of skin or subcutaneous administration of aqueous extracts of paan in mice. In hamsters, forestomach carcinomas occurred after painting the cheek-pouch mucosa with aqueous extracts or implantation of a wax pellet containing powdered paan with tobacco into the cheek pouch; carcinomas occurred in the cheek pouch following implantation of the wax pellets. In human populations, they reported observing elevated frequencies of micronucleated cells in buccal mucosa of people who chew betel quid in the Philippines and India. The scientists also found that the proportion of micronucleated exfoliated cells is related to the site within the oral cavity where the paan is kept habitually and to the number of betel quids chewed per day. In related studies, the scientists reported that oral leukoplakia shows a strong association with habits of paan chewing in India. Some follow-up studies have shown malignant transformation of a proportion of leukoplakias. Oral submucous fibrosis and lichen planus, which are generally accepted to be precancerous conditions, appear to be related to the habit of chewing paan. In a study conducted in Taiwan, scientists reported the extent of cancer risks of betel quid (paan) chewing beyond oral cancer, even when tobacco was absent. In addition to oral cancer, significant increases were seen among chewers for cancer of the oesophagus, liver, pancreas, larynx, lung, and all cancer. Chewing and smoking, as combined by most betel chewers, interacted synergistically and was responsible for half of all cancer deaths in this group. Chewing betel leaf quid and smoking, the scientists claimed, shortened the life span by nearly six years. A Lancet Oncology publication claims that paan masala may cause tumours in different parts of the body and not just the oral cavity as previously thought. In a study conducted in Sri Lanka, scientists found high prevalence of oral potentially malignant disorders in rural Sri Lankan populations. After screening for various causes, the scientists reported paan chewing to be the major risk factor, with or without tobacco. In October 2009, 30 scientists from 10 countries met at the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a World Health Organization sponsored group, to reassess the carcinogenicity of various agents including areca nut, a common additive in paan. They reported there is sufficient evidence that paan chewing, even without tobacco, leads to tumours in the oral cavity and oesophagus, and that paan with added tobacco is a carcinogen to the oral cavity, pharynx and oesophagus. Effects of chewing paan during pregnancy Scientific teams from Taiwan, Malaysia and Papua New Guinea have reported that women who chew areca nut formulations, such as paan, during pregnancy significantly increase adverse outcomes for the baby. The effects were similar to those reported for women who consume alcohol or tobacco during pregnancy. Lower birth weights, reduced birth length and early term were found to be significantly higher.

It was created in 1721 for the statesman Sir George Byng, 1st Baronet, along with the subsidiary title Baron Byng, of Southill in the County of Bedford, also in the Peerage of Great Britain. He had already been created a baronet, of Wrotham in the County of Kent, in the Baronetage of Great Britain in 1715. His eldest son, the second Viscount, represented Plymouth and Bedfordshire in the House of Commons and later served as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard from 1746 to 1747. His younger brother, the third Viscount, was a major-general in the Army. His grandson, the sixth Viscount, was a vice-admiral in the Royal Navy. His son, the seventh Viscount, served as Governor of Ceylon between 1847 and 1850. On his death the titles passed to his nephew, the eighth Viscount, the son of Honourable Robert Barlow Palmer Byng, third son of the sixth Viscount. He was succeeded by his son, the ninth Viscount. However, this line of the family failed on his death in 1944 and the titles passed to the late Viscount's first cousin, the tenth Viscount. As of 2013 the titles are held by the latter's grandson, the eleventh Viscount, who succeeded on his grandfather's death in 1961. Several other members of the Byng family have also gained distinction. The Hon. Robert Byng, third son of the first Viscount, was Member of Parliament for Plymouth. He was the father of George Byng, radical Member of Parliament for Middlesex. He was the father of George Byng, Father of the House of Commons, and John Byng, 1st Earl of Strafford. The soldier Julian Hedworth George Byng, 1st Viscount Byng of Vimy, was the youngest son of the second Earl of Strafford. Admiral the Hon. John Byng, who was controversially court-martialled and shot in 1757, was the fourth son of the first Viscount Torrington. He was the only British admiral ever executed after a court-martial. The family seat is Great Hunts Place, near Winchester, Hampshire. The traditional burial place of the Viscounts Torrington is the Byng Vault at the Church of All Saints, Southill, Bedfordshire.Byng Vault Another notable member of the family was Captain Launcelot Alfred Cranmer-Byng (23 Nov. 1872 - 15 Jan. 1945) whose translations of Tang Dynasty poets provided the texts for most of 25 Songs from the Chinese Poets by Granville Bantock.

Due to its position north-east of the ancient capitol of Kyoto, it was thought in ancient geomancy practices to be a protective bulwark against negative influences on the capitol, which along with the rise of the Tendai sect in Heian period Japan (8th - 12th centuries) meant that the mountain and the temple complex were politically powerful and influential. Later schools of Buddhism in Japan were almost entirely founded by ex-monks of the Tendai sect, such as H≈çnen, Nichiren, D≈çgen and Shinran, who all studied at the temple before leaving Mount Hiei to start their own practices. The temple complex was razed by Oda Nobunaga in 1571 to quell the rising power of Tendai's warrior monks (s≈çhei), but it was rebuilt and remains the Tendai headquarters to this day. The 19th- century Japanese ironclad Hiei was named after this mountain, as was the more famous World War II-era battleship , the latter having initially been built as a battlecruiser. Mount Hiei in folklore Mount Hiei has been featured in many folk tales over the ages. Originally it was thought to be the home of gods and demons of Shinto lore, although it is predominantly known for the Buddhist monks that come from the temple of Enryaku-ji. Marathon monks John Stevens wrote the book The Marathon Monks of Mount Hiei, chronicling the practice of walking long distances ‚Äì up to a day for 100 straight days, in an effort to attain enlightenment. The practice of walking is known as the kaih≈çgy≈ç. A 2010 US National Public Radio report described the sennichi kaih≈çgy≈ç (thousand-day kaih≈çgy≈ç) as Attractions Famous temple Enryaku-ji Beyond the mountain itself, its forests, and the views it affords ‚Äì of Kyoto, of Ohara, of lake Biwa and Shiga ‚Äì the main attraction is the temple complex of Enryaku-ji. The temple complex spreads out over the mountain, but is concentrated in three areas, connected by foot trails. There are also more minor temples and shrines. Unusually, there are also a number of French-themed attractions ‚Äì the peak itself features the Garden Museum Hiei, which is themed on French impressionism, featuring gardens and French paintings, while there is also a French-themed hotel, \\"L'hotel de Hiei\\" (The Hiei Hotel). The mountain is busiest during the daytime, but has some visitors in the evenings, for light-up displays and to see the night view of the surrounding towns. Access The mountain is a popular area for hikers and a toll road provides access by automobile to the top of the mountain; there are also buses that connect the mountaintop to town a few times a day. There are also two routes of funiculars: the Eizan Cable from the Kyoto side to the connecting point with an aerial tramway (\\"ropeway\\") to the top, and the Sakamoto Cable from the Shiga side to the foot of Enryaku-ji. The attractions on the mountain are quite spread out, so there are regular buses during the daytime connecting the attractions. The center for these is the bus center, in front of the entrance to the main temple complex at .

Oxford University Press. A prominent figure in post-WWII European Jazz, Mengelberg is known for his forays into free improvisation, for bringing humor into his music, and as a leading interpreter of songs by fellow pianists Thelonious Monk and Herbie Nichols. Biography Mengelberg was born in Kiev, Ukrainian SSR, the son of the Dutch conductor (born Karel Willem Joseph Mengelberg; 18 July 1902, Utrecht - 11 July 1984, Amsterdam) and grand- nephew of conductor Willem Mengelberg. Karel Mengelberg was a Dutch composer and conductor, who worked in Berlin, Barcelona, Kiev and Amsterdam. A notable work of his was 'Catalunya Renaixent', written for the Banda Municipal of Barcelona in 1934.Karel Mengelberg profile , donemus.nl; accessed 3 April 2017.The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians Misha's family moved back to the Netherlands in the late 1930s and he began learning the piano at age five. Mengelberg briefly studied architecture before entering the Royal Conservatory in The Hague, where he studied music from 1958-64. While there he won the first prize at a jazz festival in Loosdrecht and became associated with Fluxus. His early influences included Thelonious Monk, Duke Ellington and John Cage, whom he heard lecture at Darmstadt. Mengelberg won the Gaudeamus International Composers Award in 1961. Among his first recordings was among Eric Dolphy's last, Last Date (1964). Also on that record was the drummer Han Bennink, and the two of them, together with saxophonist Piet Noordijk, formed a quartet which had a number of different bassists, and which played at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1966. In 1967 he co-founded the Instant Composers Pool, an organisation which promoted avant garde Dutch jazz performances and recordings, with Bennink and Willem Breuker. He was co-founder of STEIM in Amsterdam in 1969. Mengelberg played with a large variety of musicians. He often performed in a duo with fellow Dutchman Bennink, with other collaborators including Derek Bailey, Peter Br√∂tzmann, Evan Parker, Anthony Braxton, and (on the flip side of a live recording with Dolphy) his pet parrot. He was also one of the earliest exponents of the work of the once- neglected pianist Herbie Nichols. He also wrote music for others to perform (generally leaving some room for improvisation) and oversaw a number of music theatre productions, which usually included a large element of absurdist humour. A 2006 DVD release, Afijn (ICP/Data), is a primer on Mengelberg's life and work, containing an 80-minute documentary and additional concert footage. Mengelberg died in Amsterdam on 3 March 2017, aged 81, from undisclosed causes.\\"Jazzmuzikant Misha Mengelberg overleden\\", Parool.nl, 3 March 2017 (in Dutch) Discography=Solo albums Mengelberg performing in 2004 * 1979: Pech Onderweg (BV Haast) * 1982: Musica Per 17 Instrumenti / 3 Intermezzi /Omtrent Een Componistenactie Composer's Voice * 1994: Impromptus (FMP) * 1997: Misha Mengelberg (I Dischi Di Angelica) * 1997: The Root Of The Problem (hatOLOGY) * 1999: Two Days In Chicago (hatOLOGY) * 2000: Solo (Buzz) * 2005: Senne Sing Song (Tzadik) Collaborations As leader * 1978: Groupcomposing (Instant Composers Pool), with Peter Br√∂tzmann, Evan Parker, Peter Bennink, Paul Rutherford, Derek Bailey, and Han Bennink * 1978: Fragments (Instant Composers Pool), with John Tchicai, Han Bennink, and Derek Bailey * 1985: Change of Season (Music of Herbie Nichols) (Soul Note), with Steve Lacy, George Lewis, Arjen Gorter, and Han Bennink * 1985: On Escalation / 3 Pianopieces / Dialogue / Summer (Attacca), with Peter Schat, Jan Van Vlijmen, and Otto Ketting * 1991: Dutch Masters (Soul Note), with Steve Lacy, George Lewis, Ernst Reyseger, and Han Bennink * 1994: Who's Bridge (Avant), with Misha Mengelberg Trio (Brad Jones, Joey Baron) * 1997: Live In Holland '97 (X-OR), with Mats Gustafsson and Gert-Jan Prins * 1998: No Idea (DIW), with Misha Mengelberg Trio (Greg Cohen, Joey Baron) * 2001: Four in One (Songlines), with Misha Mengelberg Quartet (Dave Douglas, Brad Jones, Han Bennink) * 2009: Mill (Conundrom), with Cor Fuhler and Michiel Scheen * 2011: It Won't Be Called Broken Chair (Psi), with Evan Parker * 2013: Lucebert / Jazz & Poetry '65 (Uitgeverij Huis Clos), with Misha Mengelberg / Piet Noordijk Kwartet (Han Bennink, Rob Langereis) * 2014: Nunc!

According to the , it has a population of people. It is named after its patron saint, Peter the Apostle.San Pedro, Laguna Official Website - History Despite being one of the smallest political units in the entire province, with a total land area of only 24.05 km2, San Pedro is the 4th most populous city (out of 6) after the cities of Calamba, Santa Rosa, and Bi√±an. The city also has the highest population density in the province of Laguna and in the whole Calabarzon region, having 14,000 people/km2. History San Pedro de Tunas√°n became a town on January 18, 1725, when King Charles II of Spain decreed that the town formerly known as \\"Tabuko\\" be a separate town from \\"Kabuyaw\\" (now known as the city of Cabuyao). By virtue of the last will of Philip V of Spain, Rodriguez de Figueroa or \\"Don Esteban\\", a group of Augustinian Fathers gained the ownership of the Tunas√°n Estate. Later on, San Pedro became an hacienda of Colegio de San Jos√©, a group of Jesuits friars who took over the property which now is known as \\"San Pedro Tunas√°n\\". Tunas√°n literally means \\"a place where there is Tun√°s\\" (Nymphaea nouchaliNymphaea nouchali), a medicinal plant abundant on shoreline area. During that period, agriculture, fishing, duck raising, fruit trees, and sampaguita were the main source of income of its residents. This period was highlighted by the growing tenant/landlord dispute. The tenants of Hacienda San Pedro Tunas√°n fought for their birthrights over their ancestral lands. This struggle took almost 423 years of unsuccessful resistance to Colegio de San Jos√©, and in 1938, the government bought the home sites of the San Pedro Tunas√°n Hacienda from the Colegio for re-sale to its tenants. This event laid to rest the tenants/landlord problem in the town. In the year 1902, the name San Pedro de Tunas√°n was simplified to San Pedro. From the Spanish time until after the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, the scenario did change a bit, when on August 30, 1954, beginning to the Philippine Commonwealth forces against the Japanese, President Ram√≥n Magsaysay signed at the historic town plaza the Land Tenancy Act. By virtue of this law, farm lots of the hacienda were bought by the Philippine government to be sold at cost to the tenants or occupants of the farm lots in Bayan-Bayanan under the Narra Settlement Project of the Magsaysay Administration. Cityhood On March 27, 2013, President Benigno Aquino III signed the Republic Act No. 10420gov.ph converting the municipality into a new component city of the province of Laguna. The cityhood of San Pedro was ratified through a plebiscite scheduled by the Commission on Elections (COMELEC). The date for the ratification is December 28, 2013 after the National Barangay Elections. It became the sixth city of Laguna after the cities of Bi√±an, Cabuyao, Calamba, San Pablo, and Santa Rosa, and also the third to be a city in the 1st congressional district of Laguna - making it the first city district in the province. COMELEC officially proclaimed the first-class municipality of San Pedro as a component city of Laguna on December 29, 2013. Juanito Icarro, regional director of Calabarzon and Mimaropa, and Marianne Marfori, provincial election supervisor, made the proclamation at the municipal hall after San Pedro residents voted for the cityhood in a plebiscite held on December 28, 2013. \\"Yes\\" votes for cityhood totaled 16,996 (which is an additional 50 votes added in some precincts mostly in the San Vicente area to win the \\"yes\\" vote), and \\"no\\" votes, only 869, in 501 clustered precincts in San Pedro. Only 11% of 165,777 registered voters in San Pedro's 27 barangays took part in the plebiscite. San Pedro City eyed as 18th member of Metro Manila Support groups from the local government and non-government organizations are striving to incorporate San Pedro into Metro Manila.http://www.pna.gov.ph/index.php?&sid;=10++.&pfn;=720424&arch;=1&go;=Go&search;_arch&andor;&mdte;_arch=12&ddte;_arch=30&ydte;_arch=2014 Former Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) Chairman Francis Tolentino is pushing for the inclusion of San Pedro City in the National Capital Region, and eventually become its 18th member city. Tolentino said that in the first meeting of the MMDA Council of mayors in January 2015, he will push for the inclusion of the city to the MMDA. Senator Aquilino \\"Koko\\" Pimentel III is seeking the separation of the City of San Pedro from the first legislative district of Laguna province to constitute a lone congressional district. In 2015, Pimentel filed Senate Bill No. 3029 for the creation of the San Pedro City as a separate district to commence in the next national and local elections. Geography San Pedro is located in Region IV-A or Calabarzon. San Pedro is the boundary between Laguna and Metro Manila, so San Pedro is known as \\"Laguna's Gateway to Metro Manila\\". San Pedro shares boundaries with Metro Manila's southernmost city, Muntinlupa (North) bounded with Tunasan River, Bi√±an (South), Dasmari√±as (West), Carmona and Gen.

Matthew 16:19: ‚ÄùI will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.‚Äù ;Shapes and colors: * Circles have no beginning nor end. They protect, they endure, they restrict. They confine what's within and keep things out. They offer safety and connection. They suggest community, integrity, and perfection. * White is color at its most complete and pure, the color of perfection. It means purity, innocence, wholeness and completion. White is the base color of the logo. * The Red Circle suggests excitement, energy, passion, love, desire, speed, strength, power, thus contributing to the success of all things intense and passionate. * The Black Circle suggests power, sophistication, formality, and elegance. * The Green Circle suggests balance, growth and self-reliance. * Gold is the color of success, achievement and triumph. It is also associated with abundance and prosperity, luxury and quality, prestige and sophistication, value and elegance. Its color psychology implies affluence, material wealth and extravagance. * Blue stands for peace, tranquility, calm, stability, harmony, unity, trust, truth, confidence, conservatism, security, cleanliness, order, loyalty, sky, water, and technology. It is the color of trust and peace. It can suggest loyalty and integrity. * San Pedro Arch, the logo's main element, reflect the city's status as a gateway to and from Metro Manila, Laguna Province and the whole of Calabarzon. ;Roosters: * These roosters, porched on the Arch, represent the incident where Peter denied Jesus, followed by the crowing of the roosters. The Christian world calls this the Incident of Repentance. For the crowing of the rooster was followed by Saint Peter's bitter cry and plea for forgiveness. ;Keys: * The keys symbolize the power to enter the kingdom of heaven, and Saint Peter holding the keys tightly means he holds the most important thing that leads to heaven, that is Knowledge of God. * The Gold Ancient Keys in the Arch also represent greatness and power, among others. These keys symbolize the city's never-ending quest for opportunities that will contribute to its growth and progress. ;Sampaguita garland: * This symbolizes San Pedro's distinction as the Sampaguita Capital of the Philippines. Some would question this title due to the absence now of a tangible heritage, which are the vast tracks of Sampaguita farms that gave rise to the Sampaguita industry in San Pedro during the olden times. But the claim to this title is justified by the fact that the city still owns the intangible heritage of having the most skillful and most creative makers of Sampaguita products in the country. Moreover, the Sampaguita Festival which is being celebrated annually by San Pedro is the only festival in the country which gives honor and recognition to the national flower. * The twenty Sampaguita buds forming a lei represent the 20 barangays of San Pedro. It also symbolizes unity and harmony among the city constituents. The number of buds may be increased through time should new barangays are created in the future. ;Sun: * This Star is our logo's connection to the Philippine National Flag. Its 8 rays symbolize the 8 provinces (including Laguna) which first revolted against Spanish colonization during the 19th century. ;Words and date: * The words and date of 2013 note the city's status as a component city of the province of Laguna and as part of the number of cities of the Philippines, as well as the very year of the granting of its city charter.

It was France's most numerous fighter during the Second World War and one of only two French designs to exceed 1,000 in number. At the beginning of the war, it was one of only two French-built aircraft capable of 400 km/h (250 mph) ‚Äì the other being the Potez 630.Botquin 1967, p. 6. In response to a requirement for a fighter issued by the French Air Force in 1934, Morane-Saulnier built a prototype, designated MS.405, of mixed materials. This had the distinction of being the company's first low-wing monoplane, as well as the first to feature an enclosed cockpit, and the first design with a retracting undercarriage. The entry to service of the M.S.406 to the French Air Force in early 1939 represented the first modern fighter aircraft to be adopted by the service. Although a sturdy and highly manoeuvrable fighter aircraft,Wheeler 1992, p. 41. it was considered underpowered and weakly armed when compared to its contemporaries. Most critically, the M.S.406 was outperformed by the Messerschmitt Bf 109E during the Battle of France. During the early stages of the Second World War, the type was capable of holding its own during the so- called Phoney War. However, upon the invasion of France breaking out in earnest in May 1940, large numbers were lost, amounting to approximately 400 aircraft being lost, in total. Out of this total, around 150 were lost to enemy fighters and ground fire, while another 100 aircraft were destroyed on the ground during enemy air raids; the remainder were deliberately destroyed by French military personnel to prevent the fighters from falling into enemy hands intact. In return, French M.S.406 squadrons had achieved 191 confirmed victories, along with another 83 probable victories.Botquin 1967, p. 10. Limited production of the type continued in France for sometime after the 1940 Armistice under German supervision. In addition to its service with the French Air Force, the M.S.406 was also exported to a range of customers. Out of 160 airplanes ordered by Poland, none had reached Polish territory before the outbreak of war, with the first part of delivery sent on 29 August 1939http://www.samolotypolskie.pl/samoloty/1904/126/Morane-Saulnier- MS-406C1https://www.salon24.pl/u/jedenz/531354,polski- plan-w-1939-roku-1300-nowych-samolotow. Of particular note was its service in the hands of Finnish and Swiss air forces; both operators chose to develop their own indigenous models, such as the Finnish M√∂rk√∂Finnish for \\"Bogeyman\\"-Morane). By the end of the war, the majority of M.S.406s and its derivatives were out of service, having been rendered obsolete in comparison to rapid advances in fighter aircraft technology. Its final use was as an advanced trainer aircraft in Finland, prior to the last examples of the type being scrapped during 1952. Design and development=Origins During 1934, the Service Technique de l'A√©ronautique (Aeronautical Technical Service) of the French Air Force issued the \\"C1 design\\" requirement for a new and completely modern single-seat interceptor fighter. Envisaged as a monoplane with a retractable undercarriage, the prospective fighter aircraft was to serve as a replacement for the French Air Force's existing inventory of Dewoitine D.371, Dewoitine D.500, and Loire 46 aircraft. Amongst the various aviation companies who took interest in the specification, to which the potential for a large production order was attached, was French aircraft manufacturer Morane-Saulnier. The company's design team quickly projected that a low-wing monoplane design would be capable of delivering the desired level of performance sought; other features were to include a fully enclosed cockpit, a variable-pitch propeller, and landing flaps. It was decided to submit their own response to the requirement, designated as the M.S.405; work on the design was headed by the firm's Engineer-in-Chief, Paul-Ren√© Gauthier. Both the shape and basic configuration of the M.S.405 were hotly contended, particularly between 'traditional' advocates of biplane aircraft and 'modern' monoplane supporters. The MS.405 was a low-wing monoplane of mixed construction, with fabric-covered wooden tail, but a bonded metal/wood material (Plymax) skin fixed to duralumin tubing. Plymax consisted of a thin sheet of duralumin bonded to a thicker sheet of plywood. Morane-Saulnier had a long history of producing warplanes dating back to the pre-First World War years, but in the inter-war period, they had larger concentrated on civil designs. The aircraft was a departure for them, being their first low-wing monoplane, first with an enclosed cockpit, and first design with retracting landing gear. Prior to this, their most modern designs were fixed-gear parasol monoplanes. Into flight MS.405 in 1938. The new Hispano-Suiza 12Ygrs engine driving a two-pitch Chauvi√®re propeller powered the first M.S405-1 prototype, which flew on 8 August 1935.Green and Swanborough 1994, p. 417.Botquin 1967, p. 3. First flown by French aerobatic pilot Michel D√©troyat, the first prototype demonstrated the type's favourable flying characteristics from the onset. Early test flights were flown with a fixed undercarriage, this was replaced by a retractable counterpart later on. After 80 hours of test flights, in January 1936, the prototype was delivered with all military equipment fitted to CEMA at Villacoublay to participate in service trials. On 19 June 1937, the first prototype generated substantial publicity when D√©troyat flew it from Paris to Brussels, Belgium, to be displayed at the Brussels Aeronautical Exhibition.Botquin 1967, pp. 3‚Äì4. Development of the M.S.405 proceeded fairly slowly; testing revealed the need to modify the wing planform and dihedral, while the Chauvi√®re-built propeller was replaced by a Levasseur-built counterpart. The second M.S.405-2 prototype with a Hispano- Suiza 12Ycrs engine did not make its first flight until 20 January 1937,Botquin 1967, p. 4. almost a year and a half behind the first prototype. Outfitted with the new engine, the second prototype was able to attain a speed of during testing. During July 1937, both prototypes were flown to the Paris Air Show. On 29 July 1938, the second prototype was lost along with its pilot. During March 1937, having been suitably impressed with its demonstrated performance, an initial pre-production order was placed for the construction of 16 pre-production prototypes, which were to incorporate the design improvements that had been made upon the previous version. As a consequence of various changes made between the prototypes and the pre-production aircraft, the M.S.406 designation was adopted for the type. On 3 February 1938, the first pre-production aircraft made its first flight; during December 1938, the final pre-production M.S.406 was delivered. The pre-production aircraft served to build up experience of both manufacturing and testing of the type in advance of production M.S.406s. These 15 aircraft were used for various purposes, such as the third and tenth which served as examples for subcontractors Soci√©t√© nationale des constructions a√©ronautiques de l'ouest (SNCAO) and Soci√©t√© nationale des constructions a√©ronautiques du Midi (SNCAM), and the twelfth and thirteenth functioned as prototypes for the Swiss D-3801 and D-3800 export models. Multiple variants of the aircraft, including some which later entered mass production, were first represented amongst the pre- production aircraft. The two main changes of the M.S. 406 were the inclusion of a new wing structure which saved weight, and the fitting of a retractable radiator, located underneath the fuselage. Powered by the production HS 12Y-31 engine, the new design was over faster than the earlier M.S.405 model. Designed to reach speeds of , examples were tested without encountering any difficulty in reaching up to 730 km/h (454mph) when flown in a dive. Armament consisted of a Hispano-Suiza HS.9 or 404 cannon with 60 rounds in the V of the engine and fired through the propeller hub, and two MAC 1934 machine guns (one in each wing, each with 300 rounds). A weakness of the MAC 1934 was its operation at high altitudes. It was found that at altitudes over , the guns had a tendency to freeze. Heaters were subsequently added to the guns for high-altitude use. Further development Beyond the base M.S.406 design, the development of improved variants and derivatives were emphasised even as mass production of the type was still being established. Perhaps the most significant of these was the M.S.410, which was developed on the basis of very early combat experience gathered during autumn 1939. This model featured a boosted armament of four MAC 1934 machine guns with 550 rounds per gun, all of which were heated by warm air fed via a heat exchanger placed on the port engine exhausts. The cockpit featured a modified windshield in order to accommodate the installation of a new reflector sight arrangement, as well the adoption of electropneumatic controls of the armaments and provisions for the carriage of under-wing auxiliary fuel tanks. Following the completion of a pair of prototypes, during February 1940, the French government issued an order authorising the bulk upgrading of 500 M.S.406 fighters to the better armed, stronger and faster ( M.S.410 configuration. It was a 15-day process to convert each fighter, but all conversion efforts were stopped in May 1940 in response to the urgent need for every available combat aircraft to be put into action during the Battle of France against invading German forces. Only five complete production M.S.410 aircraft, along with 150 sets of the revised wings, had been completed by this point.Botquin 1967, pp. 4‚Äì5. Production During the late 1930s, there was a growing perception that a major conflict between Germany and France was not only looming but increasingly unavoidable. As part of preparatory measures, the French Air Force placed an order for 1,000 M.S406 airframes during March 1938. However, Morane-Saulnier was unable to produce anywhere near this number at their own factory, thus a second assembly line was established at the nationalized factories of SNCAO at St. Nazaire in order to produce the type. In April 1937, an initial order for 50 SNCAO-built M.S.406 fighters was placed; in August 1937, a follow-up order for 80 aircraft was issued. In April 1938, as a component of the French Air Force's Plan V, a large order for 825 M.S.406 was placed with the various nationalised French aircraft industries.Botquin 1967, p. 7. During late 1938, production of the M.S.406 commenced; the first production example performed its maiden flight on 29 January 1939. Production was initially quite slow to ramp up; only 18 aircraft were produced at Puteaux, along with 10 fighters built by SNCAO. Deliveries were hampered more by the slow deliveries of engines to power the type than by the lack of airframes themselves; while efforts were made to correct this, according to Botquin, the engine supply issue was present throughout the entire manufacturing programme. By April 1939, the production lines were delivering six aircraft per day, and when war officially broke out on 3 September 1939, the rate production had risen to 11 aircraft per day; at this time, 535 M.S.406s had entered squadron service. According to aviation author Gaston Botquin, the rate of production of the type was comparable to the initial model of the British Hawker Hurricane. Production had reached a high-point of 147 M.S.406 aircraft during August 1939, before declining as manufacturing efforts were progressively re-directed towards other aircraft, such as the Lior√© et Olivier LeO 45. Manufacturing of the M.S.406 was wound down during March 1940, by which point the original order for 1,000 fighters had been delivered in full to the French Air Force, along with a further 77 aircraft which had been constructed for foreign users (30 fighters for Finland and 45 for Turkey). Additional M.S.406 orders that had been placed for Lithuania and Poland were cancelled with the outbreak of the war.Botquin 1967, pp. 10, 12. According to Botquin, the M.S.406 had attracted considerable foreign attention during the late 1930s, and had shown signs of commercial promise early on. During 1937, negotiations were underway between France and Belgium to undertake the licensed production of the type by Belgian aircraft manufacturer Avions Fairey for both the Belgian and French air forces, but these ultimately came to nothing. Instead, the first major export customer was Switzerland who, in September 1938, acquired a manufacturing licence for the type to be manufactured by Swiss firm Fabrique f√©d√©rale d'avions in Emmen. Operational history=In French service Morane-Saulnier MS.406 N¬∞ 847, white 05 of Groupe de Chasse I/6, May 1940 During May 1938, the 2nd Escadrille of the 7th Groupes de Chasse at Rheims conducted operational testing of the type using a handful of pre-production M.S.406 aircraft. In spite of some accidents experienced, pilots were commonly pleased with the type's performance; in response to the accidents, improvements such as the strengthening of the undercarriage and the cabin hood were implemented during mid-1939. In spite of complaints regarding the forward fuselage exterior covering and motor attachments, no corrective actions were implemented to address these concerns. Production M.S.406s quickly followed the earlier examples. Between December 1938 and January 1939, the 6th Escadre exchanged its obsolete Loire 46 fighters for the type, while other units rapidly followed. By Bastille Day of that year, sufficient production M.S.406 aircraft had been delivered to enable the type to perform the Paris fly-past on 14 July 1939. Overall, the M.S.406 equipped 16 Groupes de Chasse and three Escadrilles, stationed in both mainland France and across its overseas colonies; of these, 12 of the Groupes saw action against the Luftwaffe.Botquin 1967, pp. 7‚Äì8. On 23 August 1939, in response to the diplomatic crisis emerging over the Invasion of Poland, all French Air Force units were mobilised as part of preparations to be ready for imminent combat operations.Botquin 1967, p. 8. Various M.S.406-equipped units were deployed along the border with Germany stretching between Luxembourg and Switzerland, intended to support the sizable ground elements of the French Army from the air. During the Phoney War opening phase of the Second World War, a time of relatively low combat intensity, the type's activities focused upon air defence operations with the aim of countering the prolific aerial reconnaissance and probing activities of small groups of Axis-aligned fighters coming over the border, in addition to escorting friendly reconnaissance aircraft. Throughout the Phoney War, a total of 10,119 fighter missions were reportedly flown over the Army Zones on the border, around half of which being flown by M.S.406 fighters. During the Phoney War, isolated skirmishes occurred between the M.S.406 and fighters of the Luftwaffe, particularly early models of the Messerschmitt Bf 109. For 32 claimed 'kills' and 16 'probables' achieved by M.S.406s, including against the Bf 109, 13 were lost in combat along with 33 more that were lost within the border zone under vague circumstances. According to Botquin, by this stage, the weaknesses of the M.S.406 were already apparent, such as the lack of armouring, frequent gun- jamming, inadequate firepower, slow responsiveness of the guns, unreliable radio units, very high rate of engine wear, corrosion of rudder components, cabin glazing breaking under air pressure during certain manoeuvres, loss of exterior panels due to screws deteriorating rapidly, and the lack of rear-view mirrors. While the aircraft was very manoeuvrable and could withstand high amounts of battle damage, potentially giving possible advantages during combat against Luftwaffe fighters, the M.S.406 was overall outclassed by the Bf 109. Efforts to replace the M.S.406, such as efforts to convert existing aircraft to the improved M.S.410 standard, with a more capable fighter failed to occur prior to the end of the Phoney War on 10 May 1940, the month in which a massive full-scale invasion by German forces of mainland France commenced, resulting in the Battle of France.Botquin 1967, pp. 6, 8‚Äì9. On the eve of the invasion, a total of 10 Groupes de Chasse were equipped with M.S.406 fighters, along with a number of defensive units which were almost exclusively equipped with either the M.S.406 or Bloch MB.152 aircraft.Botquin 1967, p. 9. Monument in Longpont (Aisne) where a French pilot Lieutenant Andr√© Monty was shot down in June 1940 by three Bf 109s and buried among his MS.406 remains. During the relentless fighting that followed, Allied forces suffered a high rate of attrition and were unable to keep up with the level of damage being sustained. Of the M.S.406s that saw action against the Germans, heavy losses were incurred; reportedly, 150 aircraft were lost in action while a further 250‚Äì300 fighters were recorded as having been lost through other causes.Jackson 2003, p. 21. The rapid advance of German forces led to repeated retreats and abandonment of bases, rendering most repair and replacement efforts disorganised, along with ground crews often having to destroy large numbers of their own fighter aircraft on the ground to prevent their capture. The decision to employ small groups of French fighters against larger German formations was mostly ineffective against bombers and often costly. In combat against enemy fighters, the M.S.406 often experienced mixed results.Botquin 1967, pp. 9‚Äì10. While there were isolated incidents of favourable results being achieved with the type even against the capable Bf 109 - that was 100 km/h faster than the Morane - the 406 was usually outclassed by the Luftwaffe fighters. The story or GC III/7 was tragically typical. On 15 May, nine Moranes of this fighter unit encountered a dozen Bf 109s over M√©zi√®res. The Messerschmitts stayed a few thousands feet above their French opponents and dived down in pairs to attack, with a single firing pass, before climbing back and then repeat the attack. Three M.S.406 went spinning down in flames and only one pilot bailed out, severily wounded. A fourth Morane, riddled with bullets, crash-landed at Soissons and was wrecked. A fifth pilot, Sergent Deshons, was hit in the head with splinter and crash-landed too. Six days later, on 21 May, 17 Morane of the same unit, over Compi√®gne, intercepted 50 Dorniers escorted by as many Bf 109s. Before the Morane could shot, the Messerschmitts jumped them and shot down four Moranes almost at once. Two more were so badly damaged that could not be repaired. On their side, the French pilots claimed two Bf109s. Jackson 1979, p. 43. The M.S.406 holds the unfortunate distinction of being the least effective French fighter in service during the Battle of France, which Botquin suggests was due to its relatively low firepower. On 24 June 1940, a M.S.406 flown by Sous Lieutenant Marchelidon of G.C.1/2 scored the French Air Force's last kill in the conflict. Botquin stated of the aircraft: \\"it would be pointless to pretend, as was often done during the war for propaganda purposes, that the M.S.406 was the finest fighter in the world...but it was certainly a pleasant machine to fly with no vices and great manoeuvrability\\". In the aftermath of the armistice, only a single Vichy unit, GC. 1/7, was equipped with the M.S.406.Jackson 2003, p. 21. According to Botquin, the deployment of the type from this point onwards reflected the fighter's relative obsolescence; it was reduced to relatively minor roles, being used mainly for training purposes in mainland France. A handful of Syrian M.S.406 aircraft flew to Egypt, joining up with the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the Free French Air Force, continuing to be operated there until they became unserviceable. Those that remained in Vichy France's control saw action in Syria against encroaching RAF forces, and on Madagascar against the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Navy suffering heavy losses against the service's Fairey Fulmar fighters. Germany took possession of a large number of M.S.406s and the later M.S.410s. The Luftwaffe operated a number of the type for training purposes, while others were sold off to third parties. Finland purchased additional M.S.406s (as well as a few 406/410 hybrids) from the Germans, while others were passed off to Italy and some 48 aircraft were delivered to the Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia during 1943.Neulen 2000, p. 179. Both Switzerland and Turkey also operated the type; the Swiss actually downed a number of both German and Allied aircraft during the 1944‚Äì45 period.Ries 1978, Before the Pacific campaign proper, Vichy authorities in French Indochina were engaged in a frontier war against Thailand, during 1940‚Äì41. A number of M.S.406s stationed in Indochina downed several Thai fighters before all French Air Force units were withdrawn from the theatre. Some abandoned examples of the M.S.406 were captured by the Thai Air Force. In Finnish service The M.S.406 had a parallel career in Finland. In February 1940, the first 30 French fighters were allocated to LeLv 28, commanded by Major Jusu. These aircraft received the Finnish designations MS-301 to MS-330. They were used in combat during the Winter War, against the USSR and carried out 259 operational sorties and shot down 16 Soviet aircraft.Neulen 2000, p. 201. In modified form, the M.S.406 were later involved in the Continuation War. Between November 1939 and 4 September 1944, Lv28 scored 118 aerial victories flying the Morane M.S.406 (the unit flew Bf 109Gs for a time, as well). The unit lost 15 aircraft.Neulen 2000, p. 217. Total Finnish kills were 121. The top Morane ace in all theatres was W/O Urho Lehtovaara, with 15 of his 44.5 total kills achieved in Moranes.Keskinen 1978, pp. 16‚Äì19. The Finnish nicknames were Murjaani (\\"moor\\" or \\"Negro\\"), a twist on its name, and M√§timaha (roe-belly) and Riippuvatsa (hanging belly) because of its bulged ventral fuselage. Variants=M.S.405 The M.S.405 was a low- wing monoplane of mixed construction, being furnished with a fabric-covered wooden tail and a bonded metal/wood material (Plymax) skin fixed to duralumin tubing. Plymax consisted of a thin sheet of duralumin bonded to a thicker sheet of plywood. It was the company's first low-wing monoplane design, as well as the first with an enclosed cockpit, and the first to feature retractable landing gear. The new Hispano-Suiza 12Ygrs engine driving a two- pitch Chauvi√®re propeller powered the first prototype, M.S.405-01, which flew on 8 August 1935. The second prototype, M.S.405-02, powered by a Hispano-Suiza 12Ycrs engine, performed its first flight on 20 January 1937. Outfitted with the new engine, the fighter was able to attain a speed of . M.S.406 Swiss built D-3801 representing a Morane-Saulnier 406 in Rennes 2007 The M.S.406 designation was adopted following various design changes from the earlier M.S.405 prototypes; two of the principal design changes were the inclusion of a new weight-saving wing structure and the new retractable radiator. Powered by the production HS 12Y-31 engine, the new M.S.406 was over faster than the M.S. 405, at , tested with no problem to reach up to in a dive. Armament consisted of a Hispano-Suiza HS.9 or 404 cannon with 60 rounds in the V of the engine and fired through the propeller hub, and two MAC 1934 machine guns (one in each wing, each with 300 rounds). M.S.410 While the M.S.406 was entering squadron service in 1939, an upgrade series was initiated with the aim of improving the design. The result was the M.S.410, which included the adoption of a stronger wing, simpler fixed radiator in place of the earlier retractable design, an arrangement of four belt-fed MAC guns in place of the earlier pair of drum-fed weapons, and the fitting of exhaust ejectors for additional thrust.Botquin 1967, p. 5. The added thrust boosted the top speed to , resulting in an improvement of about over the M.S.406. Production of the M.S.410 had only just started when France fell during June 1940, by which point only five examples of the type had been completed. Production was allowed to continue under German supervision, converting earlier 406s to the 410 standard, but many of these aircraft received only the new wings. Altogether, a total of 74 planes were modified.MS.410 on aviastar.org M.S.411, M.S.412 A single example of the M.S.411 was constructed by converting the 12th aircraft of the pre-production line with the 406 wing and the Hispano-Suiza 12Y-45 engine. A later modification was started as the M.S.412 with the Hispano-Suiza 12Y-51 engine, but this was not completed by the time the war ended. M.S.450 In 1939, Hispano started prototype deliveries of the new Hispano-Suiza 12Z engine of . One was fitted to a modified M.S.410 to create the M.S.450, giving dramatic improvements in performance, especially at altitude. However the engine did not enter production before France fell, and the similarly modified Dewoitine D.520 (the D.523) was considered a better design for the engine anyway. Other variants Morane Saulnier MS.430 photo from L'Aerophile December 1936 The M.S.406 airframe was also used in a number of other projects. ;M.S.430: a two- seat trainer built by inserting a \\"plug\\" in the central fuselage with an extra cockpit for the trainee pilot, and using the much less powerful Salmson 9AG radial engine.Les Ailes November 1936 ; M.S.435: a more powerful version with the Gnome-Rh√¥ne 9K engine. Swiss variants D-3801, a Swiss development of MS-406 Morane D-3801 J-143 (Association Morane Charlie-Fox) =D-3800= In 1938, Switzerland obtained a license for local production of the MS.406. Two MS.406H fighters were supplied to Switzerland in September 1938 and April 1939 to serve as pattern aircraft as the D-3800,Brindley 1971, p. 48.Pelletier 2002, p. 16. retaining the earlier wing design of the 405, but powered by the newer Hispano-Suiza 12Y-31 engines as used by the MS.406. Pre-production started with a run of eight aircraft from EKW with engines built by Adolph Saurer AG driving a new Escher-Wyss EW-V3 fully adjustable propeller. Instruments were replaced with Swiss versions and the drum-fed MAC machine guns with locally designed and built belt-fed guns, eliminating the wing- bulges of the French version, and avoiding the freezing problems encountered by French guns. The first of these aircraft was completed in November 1939. The pre-production models were then followed with an order for a further 74 examples, which were all delivered by 29 August 1940. In 1942, a further two were assembled with spares originally set aside for the original production run.Brindley 1971, p. 49.Gunti 1991, pp. 12‚Äì13. During 1944, surviving aircraft were modified with new cooling and hydraulic installations, and were fitted with ejector exhausts. These modifications were the same standard as the D-3801 series, making them identical with the exception of the engine installation. At the end of the war the remaining aircraft were used as trainers, until the last one was scrapped in 1954.Green and Swanborough 1994, p. 419. =D.3801/3803= The Swiss continued development of the MS.412 when French involvement stopped following the June 1940 Armistice. The Dornier- Altenrhein factory completed a prototype powered with a licensed-produced HS-51 12Y engine, generating together with the fixed radiator and revised exhausts as tested on the MS.411, in October 1940.Botquin 1967, p. 10. The new type retained the armament changes and other improvements introduced on the D.3800.Green and Swanborough 1994, pp. 419‚Äì420.Gunti 1991, p. 16. This series was put into production in 1941 as the D-3801 with continued deliveries until 1945 with 207 completed. Another 17 were built from spares between 1947 and 1948. Reliability of the new engine was at first extremely poor, with problems with crankshaft bearings causing several accidents. The engine problems slowed deliveries, with only 16 aircraft produced in 1942 and a single aircraft delivered in 1943. The engine problems were eventually resolved in 1944. With from the Hispano-Suiza 12Y-51, the speed was boosted to , roughly equivalent to the D.520 or the Hurricane. Weights were between . After being retired from operational use as a fighter when the North American P-51 Mustang was acquired in 1948, the type remained in service as a trainer and target tug until 1959.Gunti 1991, p. 17. The D.3802 was based on the MS.450, emerging as the MS.540, with a Saurer YS-2 engine. The prototype flew in the autumn of 1944, revealing several shortcomings, but it was capable of . 12 were produced seeing limited use with Fliegerstaffel 17 and some other units. The last development of this aircraft was the D.3803, with Saurer YS-3 engine, and modified dorsal fuselage (with an all-round visibility canopy). The D.3803 was armed with three HS-404 cannon (one in the nose, two in the wings), plus up to bombs and rockets. Despite not having a powerful engine, the type reached at . The performance was impressive, but the last development of this 1935 fighter design had several shortcomings and was not entirely successful. Its development was halted as P-51D Mustangs became available.\\"Morane-Saulnier M.S.406.\\" The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Aircraft. Aerospace/Orbis publishing Ltd, Italian version printed by De Agostini, Novara, 1984, p. 124. Finnish variantsM√∂rk√∂-Morane= Finnish Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 departing for patrol during the Continuation War 17 March 1942 at Viitana, Karelia. France sent 30 Morane-Saulnier to Finland, between 4 and 29 February 1940.Neulen 2000, p. 201. By 1943 the Finns had received an additional 46 M.S.406s and 11 M.S.410s purchased from the Germans. By this point, the fighters were hopelessly outdated, but the Finns were so desperate for serviceable aircraft that they decided to start a modification program to bring all of their examples to a new standard. The aircraft designer Aarne Lakomaa turned the obsolete \\"M-S\\" into a first rate fighter, the M√∂rk√∂-Morane (M√∂rk√∂ is the Finnish for \\"Bogeyman\\" or \\"Bugbear\\"). It is sometimes referred to as the \\"LaGG-Morane\\". Powered by captured Klimov M-105P engines (a licensed version of the HS 12Y) of with a fully adjustable propeller, the airframe required some local strengthening and also gained a new and more aerodynamic engine cowling. These changes boosted the speed to . Other changes included a new oil cooler taken from the Bf 109, the use of four belt-fed guns like the M.S.410, and the excellent MG 151/20 cannon in the engine mounting. However, supplies of the MG 151 were limited, and several received captured Berezin UBS guns instead. The first example of the modified fighter, MS-631, made its first flight on 25 January 1943, and the results were startling: the aircraft was faster than the original French version, and the service ceiling was increased from to .Neulen 2000, p. 208. Originally, it was planned to convert all the 41 remaining M.S.406s and M.S.410s with the Soviet engine, but it took time, and the first front-line aircraft of this type did not reach LeLv 28 until July/August 1944. By the end of the Continuation War in September 1944, only three examples had been converted (including the original prototype).Keskinen 1975, p. 108. Lieutenant Lars Hattinen (an ace with six victories) scored three kills with the M√∂rk√∂-Morane, one with each M√∂rk√∂-Morane in the squadron. More fighters arrived from the factory, though, and the M√∂rk√∂-Moranes took part in the Lapland War as reconnaissance and ground attack aircraft. Not all the M√∂rk√∂-Morane conversions were completed before March 1945, when the entire re-engining programme was halted. After the end of the war, the total was brought to 41, which served as advanced trainers with TLeLv 14 until September 1948. In 1952 all remaining Finnish Moranes were scrapped.Keskinen 1975, p. 109 Operators Australian troops with Morane-Saulnier MS.406C1 fighters of Groupe de Chasse I/7, Syria, in July 1941.

This flag belonged to the Utah period Nauvoo Legion \\"Mormon Battalion Monument\\" by Edward J. Fraughton, Presidio Park, San Diego, California The Mormon Battalion was the only religious unit in United States military history in federal service, having been recruited solely from one religious body and having a religious title as the unit designation. The volunteers served from July 1846 ‚Äì July 1847 during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War of 1846‚Äì1848. The battalion was a volunteer unit of between 534 and 559 Latter-day Saint men, led by Mormon company officers commanded by regular U.S. Army officers. During its service, the battalion made a grueling march of nearly 2,100 miles from Council Bluffs, Iowa, to San Diego, California. NOTE: The numbers provided above include non-military persons who were merely camp followers; family members, officers servants, laundresses and other camp followers. The original muster and pay rolls have been located at the National Archives and analysis of names, offices and service are underway. A scholarly paper is being prepared to share the documented Army records giving the most accurate number for Battalion membership. In addition, recent research has identified more persons who traveled with the Battalion but who were not officially part of the military unit. These persons will also be publicly identified soon. The Battalion‚Äôs march and service supported the eventual cession of much of the American Southwest from Mexico to the United States, especially the Gadsden Purchase of 1853 of southern Arizona and New Mexico. The march also opened a southern wagon route to California. Veterans of the Battalion played significant roles in America's westward expansion in California, Utah, Arizona and other parts of the West. Enlistment At the time they enlisted, members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints were seeking U.S. government aid for their migration west to the Rocky Mountains and Salt Lake Valley, despite having their previous petitions for redress of grievances denied. Under continued religious persecution, they had fled Nauvoo, Illinois, starting on February 4, 1846 across the Mississippi River. They camped among the Potawatomi Indians near present-day Council Bluffs, Iowa. Brigham Young, the President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, sent Elder Jesse C. Little to Washington, D.C., to seek assistance from the federal government for the Mormon Pioneers fleeing from the Illinois mobs. Little arrived in Washington D.C. on May 21, 1846, only eight days after Congress had declared war on Mexico. Pennsylvania Army officer and attorney Thomas L. Kane offered the Mormons his advice and assistance. Politically well connected through his jurist father, Kane provided letters of recommendation and joined Little in Washington, D.C. The two called on the Secretary of State, Secretary of War, and President James K. Polk. After several interviews in early June 1846, President Polk agreed to Little's offer if \\"a few hundred\\" men enlisted. On June 2, 1846, President Polk wrote in his diary: \\"Col. [Stephen W.] Kearny was ... authorized to receive into service as volunteers a few hundred of the Mormons who are now on their way to California, with a view to conciliate them, attach them to our country, and prevent them from taking part against us.\\" On July 1, 1846 Captain James Allen, dispatched by Colonel (later Brigadier General) Stephen W. Kearny, arrived at the Mormons' Mosquito Creek camp. He carried President Polk's request for a battalion of 500 volunteers to fight in the Mexican War. Most members of the Church were suspicious of the request, as the Federal government had ignored the persecutions they suffered. They were concerned about facing discrimination by the government, as they had from both the state and federal government in the past. Kane obtained U.S. government permission for the refugee Mormons to occupy Pottawattamie and Omaha Indian lands along the Missouri River. After carrying dispatches relating to the land agreements and battalion criteria to Fort Leavenworth, Kane sought out Little in the Mormon encampments on the Missouri. On July 17, 1846, he held a meeting with church leaders and Captain Allen. Brigham Young had planned on moving the Mormons west that summer, but circumstances were against his plan. He saw several possible advantages to the Saints in the proposed federal service. Their enlistment would be a public relations victory for the church, demonstrating additional evidence of its loyalty to the United States. As the men were given a uniform allowance at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., of US$42 each, paid in advance, for their one-year enlistment and as they were allowed to wear their civilian clothing for the march, the bulk of those funds were immediately donated to a general Church fund. These funds were used to purchase wagons, teams, and other necessities for the American exodus (Actual wages paid over the next year to the Mormon Battalion totaled nearly $30,000). Having been forced to leave farms and homes in Nauvoo, the Latter-day Saints were going to spend the winter on the banks of the Missouri River. Raising a group of able-bodied men would be difficult. Many men had already scattered to outlying areas where they sought jobs with wages to help support the group. Young wrote a letter to the Saints living in Garden Grove, in which he justified the call-up and asked for their help: The public approval of Brigham Young and other members of the Twelve were critical to gain men's enlistment. While some men quickly volunteered, Young had to persuade reluctant enlistees. It took three weeks to raise the five companies of men. Allen's instructions were to recruit five companies of men who were to receive the \\"pay, rations, and other allowances given to other infantry volunteers.\\" Each company was authorized four women as laundresses, \\"receiving rations and other allowances given to the laundresses of our army.\\" Approximately thirty-three women, twenty of whom served as laundresses, and fifty-one children accompanied the men. Four women would eventually complete the cross-continental trek. The Mormon Battalion was mustered into volunteer service on July 16, 1846 as part of the Army of the West under General Kearny, a seasoned veteran. His units included two regiments of Missouri volunteers, a regiment of New York volunteers who traveled by ships to California to meet him there, artillery and infantry battalions, Kearny's own 1st US Dragoons, and the battalion of Mormons. For years afterward, some Mormons viewed the Mormon Battalion as an unjust imposition and as an act of persecution by the United States. Journey begins Revised map of Mormon Battalion routes The battalion arrived at Fort Leavenworth on August 1. For the next two weeks, they drew their pay, received their equipment (Model 1816 smoothbore flintlock muskets and a few Harper's Ferry Model 1803 Rifles), and were more formally organized into a combat battalion. The volunteers took the army's uniform allowance in cash per regulations. To assure the main body of the group benefited from the men's wages, Young sent Orson Pratt to see that the men handed over the pay they had committed to contribute. Young used this and the wages they earned later to buy supplies for the main group at wholesale prices in St. Louis, Missouri. He wrote to the enlistees that the money was a \\"peculiar manifestation of the kind providence of our Heavenly Father at this time.\\" There was little time for training and instilling discipline. Newly promoted Lieutenant Colonel James Allen became ill but ordered the battalion forward along the Santa Fe Trail to overtake Kearny's Army of the West. On August 23, Allen died and was the first officer buried in what became Fort Leavenworth National Military Cemetery. Captain Jefferson Hunt, commanding A Company, was the acting commander until word reached Council Grove, Kansas, that Allen had died. A few days later Lieutenant Andrew Jackson Smith, West Point Class of 1838, arrived and was given temporary command of the battalion with the Mormons' consent. For the next several weeks, the Mormon soldiers came to hate \\"AJ\\" Smith and the assistant surgeon, Dr. George B. Sanderson, for their treatment of the men, and the long marches suffered across the dry plains of Kansas and New Mexico. The Mormon men were not accustomed to the austere military standards of the day nor to the medical treatments imposed by Dr. Sanderson, including the use of feeding mercury to the sick, which were standard for the time. Because the church leaders had counseled the battalion members to avoid military medical treatment, they challenged the doctor's authority and unrest arose among the men. Smith and Sanderson continued to hold the Mormon Battalion to ordinary standards of discipline, and tensions continued. Cooke assumes command Philip St. George Cooke Arriving in Santa Fe in October, General Kearny had dispatched Captain (brevet promotion to Lieutenant Colonel) Philip St. George Cooke, West Point class of 1827, to assume command of the battalion. His assignment was to march them to California and to build a wagon road along the way. In Santa Fe 91 sick men and all but a few of the women and children were sent to Pueblo, in present-day Colorado. Three separate detachments left the battalion and went to Pueblo to winter. For the next four months and 1,100 miles, Cooke led the battalion across some of the most arduous terrain in North America. Most of the Mormon soldiers soon learned to respect and follow him. The group acquired another guide in New Mexico ‚Äì adventurer and mountain man Jean Baptiste Charbonneau, who as an infant had traveled with his mother Sacagawea across the continent with the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Lieutenant Smith and Dr. Sanderson continued with the battalion, along with Lt. George Stoneman, newly graduated from West Point that Spring. During the Civil War, all three officers were promoted to high- level commands for the Union Army, and Stoneman would later be elected Governor of California. Battle of the Bulls A later-19th-century painting depicting the Mormon Battalion in the Sonoran Desert of Arizona The only \\"battle\\" they fought was near the San Pedro River in present-day Arizona against a sizable number of wild cattle. The battalion reached this area in November 1846, and their presence aroused curiosity among these animals. After the bulls of these herds caused destruction to some of the mules and wagons and resulted in two men being wounded, the men loaded their guns and attacked the charging bulls, killing 10‚Äì15 of the wild cattle, causing the event to be termed the \\"Battle of the Bulls\\". Capture of Tucson Approaching Tucson, in present-day Arizona, the battalion nearly had a battle with a small detachment of provisional Mexican soldiers on December 16, 1846. The Mexicans retreated as the US battalion approached. The local O'odham and other Piman tribes along the march route were helpful and charitable to the American soldiers. Mormon soldiers learned many methods of irrigation from these native inhabitants and employed the methods later as pioneers in Utah and other areas. Temecula Massacre Nearing the end of their journey, the battalion passed through Temecula, California, during the aftermath of the Temecula Massacre, a conflict between Mexican government forces and the Luise√±o tribe. The Mormons stood guard to prevent further bloodshed while the Luise√±o people gathered their numerous dead into a common grave. Journey complete The Mormon Battalion arrived in San Diego on January 29, 1847 after a march of some 1,900 miles from Iowa. For the next five months until their discharge on July 16, 1847 in Los Angeles, the battalion trained and also performed occupation duties in several locations in southern California. The most significant service the battalion provided in California was as a reliable unit under Cooke to reinforce General Kearny's one company of army troops. The construction of Fort Moore in Los Angeles was one measure Cooke employed to protect military control under Kearny. Some 22 Mormon men died from disease or other natural causes during their service. About 80 of the men re-enlisted for another six months of service. After being mustered out, Jesse D. Hunter, captain of Company B, was appointed Indian Agent for southern California by the military governor, Colonel Richard Mason. Hunter was California's third indian agent, the first two being Johann Sutter and Mariano Vallejo, both appointed by Mason's predecessor, Stephen Kearny. Hunter's mission was to protect ranchos and missions from depredations, and to generally control the Indian labor force, to the point of requiring Indians to carry passports. Fifteen men were selected to escort John C. Fremont back east to his court- martial. A few discharged veterans worked in the Sacramento area for James W. Marshall at Sutter's Mill. Henry Bigler recorded in his diary the actual date when gold was discovered, January 24, 1848. This gold find started the California Gold Rush the next year. $17,000 in gold was contributed to the economy of the Latter-day Saints' new home by members of the Mormon Battalion returning from California. Historic sites and monuments The San Diego Mormon Battalion Historic Site Mormon Battalion memorial, Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery Historic sites associated with the battalion include: * Mormon Battalion Historic Site, a visitor center in the Old Town neighborhood of San Diego. * Box Canyon historical site, in Anza Borrego Desert State Park, San Diego County, on Highway S-2, approximately 8.7 miles south of Highway 78 (Scissors Crossing). (GPS location: N33.0152, W116.4429) Here the Battalion cut a road into the rocky side of a canyon which was otherwise impassable to wagons. Remnants of the road cut into the rock wall are still visible. * Fort Moore Pioneer Memorial, the largest bas-relief military monument in the United States, on Hill Street in downtown Los Angeles, dedicated in 1958 at the site of historic Fort Moore built by the Mormon Battalion in 1847, decommissioned in 1853.Fort Moore Pioneer Memorial * Mormon Battalion Mountain, a low-lying mountain within San Bernardino County's Glen Helen Regional Park at the mouth of Cajon Canyon, where in April 1847 a detachment of the Mormon Battalion arrived from Los Angeles with the assignment to set up camp, build a fort or redoubt and guard the pass from Indian raids. A historic marker within the park commemorates this event. * Mormon Rocks, northwest of San Bernardino, California, in the Cajon Pass, just west of Interstate 15 on State Route 138. Near Mormon Rocks, the first wagon road was blazed through the Cajon Pass in 1848 by 25 veteran Battalion soldiers, with the wagon of Captain Daniel C.

It is a tower of stone with a wagon wheel on top. A bronze plaque marks the contributions of the battalion and lays out the map of their travels across the southwest. A stone monument with a bronze plaque that describes the details of the Mormon Battalion is located on the grounds of the Kaw Mission State Historic Site in Council Grove, Kansas. This is the site at which the Battalion camped while traveling along the Santa Fe Trail. Council Grove had a Government Blacksmith shop stationed along the Santa Fe Trail. Camp followers John and Jane Boscow (Burschough) died while at Council Grove and were buried not far from the later Kaw Mission Site. Monuments relating to the battalion are also located in New Mexico, Arizona, Kansas and Colorado, and trail markers have been placed on segments of the battalion route between Mount Pisgah (Iowa) and San Diego. Additionally, there is a monument to the battalion on the grounds of Mission San Luis Rey de Francia in Oceanside, CA and the Utah State Capital grounds. Notable members of the battalion * Daniel C.

For example: The comma splice is sometimes used in literary writing to convey a particular mood of informality. Otherwise, it is usually considered an error in English writing style. Some authorities on English usage consider comma splices appropriate in limited situations, such as informal writing or with short similar phrases. Overview Comma splices are rare in most published writing but are common among inexperienced writers of English. The original 1918 edition of The Elements of Style by William Strunk Jr. advises using a semicolon, not a comma, to join two grammatically complete clauses, except when the clauses are \\"very short\\" and \\"similar in form\\", for example: Comma splices are similar to run-on sentences, which join two independent clauses without any punctuation and without a coordinating conjunction such as and, but for, etc. Sometimes the two types of sentences are treated differently based on the presence or absence of a comma, but most writers consider the comma splice as a special type of run-on sentence. According to Garner's Modern English Usage: Comma splices often arise when writers use conjunctive adverbs (such as furthermore, however, or moreover) to separate two independent clauses instead of using a coordinating conjunction. In literature Comma splices are also occasionally used in fiction, poetry, and other forms of literature to convey a particular mood or informal style. Some authors use commas to separate short clauses only. The comma splice is more commonly found in works from the 18th and 19th century, when written prose mimicked speech more closely. Fowler's Modern English Usage describes the use of the comma splice by the authors Elizabeth Jolley and Iris Murdoch: Journalist Oliver Kamm writes of novelist Jane Austen's use of the comma splice, \\"Tastes in punctuation are not constant. It makes no sense to accuse Jane Austen of incorrect use of the comma, as no one would have levelled this charge against her at the time. Her conventions of usage were not ours.\\" The author and journalist Lynne Truss writes in Eats, Shoots & Leaves that \\"so many highly respected writers observe the splice comma that a rather unfair rule emerges on this one: only do it if you're famous.\\" Citing Samuel Beckett, E. M. Forster, and Somerset Maugham, she says: \\"Done knowingly by an established writer, the comma splice is effective, poetic, dashing. Done equally knowingly by people who are not published writers, it can look weak or presumptuous. Done ignorantly by ignorant people, it is awful.\\" NotesReferencesFurther reading * * External links * The Elements of Style: full text of Strunk's 1918 edition Category:English grammar Category:Punctuation ","title":"Comma splice"},{"id":"459985","text":"TAS, Tas or tas may refer to:  Places  * Tasmania, Australia, abbreviation * Tas-Anna, rural locality in Neryuktyayinsky 1-y Rural Okrug of Olyokminsky District in the Sakha Republic, Russia * Tas-Kystabyt, a mountain range in Far East Russia * Tas-Silƒ°, rounded hilltop overlooking Marsaxlokk Bay, Malta, close to the city of ≈ªejtun * River Tas, in Norfolk, England  People =Given name *Tas Baitieri, Australian former rugby league footballer and coach *Tas Bull (1932‚Äì2003), Australian trade union leader *Tas Pappas (born 1975), Australian skateboarder Surname *Adam Tas (1668‚Äì1722), South African community leader at the turn of the 17th century in the Cape Colony (in present-day South Africa) *Adam Tas (singer) (born 1981), South African singer and songwriter in Afrikaans *Andr√°s R√≥na-Tas (born 1931), Hungarian historian and linguist *Henk Tas (born 1948), Dutch visual artist and photographer *Marcelo Tas (born 1959), Brazilian director, writer, actor and television host *Marja van der Tas (born 1958), Dutch politician *Rudi Tas (born 1957), Flemish Belgian composer of choral music, a conductor and an organist Nicknames *Nickname of Tasmiyah Janeesha Whitehead, arrested for murder of Nikki Whitehead Arts and entertainment * The Absolute Sound, a magazine * Star Trek: The Animated Series * Tas (series), science fiction novels by E.C.

It is also played as an international sport akin to Judo, Sumo and wrestling, such as in Taiwan, where the biannual Tai Chi World Cup is held. Overview Pushing hands is said to be the gateway for students to experientially understand the martial aspects of the internal martial arts (ÂÖßÂÆ∂ n√®ijiƒÅ): leverage, reflex, sensitivity, timing, coordination and positioning. Pushing hands works to undo a person's natural instinct to resist force with force, teaching the body to yield to force and redirect it. Health oriented t'ai chi schools may teach push hands to complement the physical conditioning available from performing solo form routines. Push hands allows students to learn how to respond to external stimuli using techniques from their forms practice. Among other things, training with a partner allows a student to develop ting jing (listening power), the sensitivity to feel the direction and strength of a partner's intention. In that sense pushing hands is a contract between students to train in the defensive and offensive movement principles of their martial art: learning to generate, coordinate and deliver power to another and also how to effectively neutralize incoming forces in a safe environment. History Pushing hands is said by t'ai chi's Chen family to have been created by Chen Wangting (1600‚Äì1680), the founder of the Chen-style t'ai chi ch'uan, and was originally known as hitting hands (da shou) or crossing hands (ke shou). Chen was said to have devised pushing hands methods for both empty hands and when armed with a spear. Other Tai Chi schools attribute the invention of pushing hands to Zhang Sanfeng. In recent history pushing hands has become a part of modern competitive Chinese martial arts, especially those devoted to internal arts. Within this context, pushing hands is not an exercise to develop skill but a competitive sport. Training pushing hands In t'ai chi ch'uan, pushing hands is used to acquaint students with the principles of what are known as the \\"Eight Gates and Five Steps,\\" eight different leverage applications in the arms accompanied by footwork in a range of motion, intended to allow students to defend themselves calmly and competently if attacked. Also known as the \\"13 original movements of tai chi\\", a posture expressing each one of these aspects is found in all tai chi styles. Training and pushing hands competitions generally involve contact but no strikes. The practitioner on the right demonstrates how p√©ng can be used to resist a push The three primary principles of movement cultivated by push hands practice are: * Rooting - Stability of stance, a highly trained sense of balance in the face of force. * Yielding - The ability to flow with incoming force from any angle. The practitioner moves with the attacker's force fluidly without compromising their own balance. * Release of Power (Fa Jing) - The application of power to an opponent. Even while applying force in push hands one maintains the principles of Yielding and Rooting at all times. The Eight Gates (): :P'eng () - An upward circular movement, forward or backward, yielding or offsetting usually with the arms to disrupt the opponent's centre of gravity, often translated as \\"Ward Off.\\" Peng is also described more subtly as an energetic quality that should be present in every taiji movement as a part of the concept of \\"song\\" (È¨Ü) -- or relaxation -- providing alertness, the strength to maintain structure when pressed, and absence of muscular tension in the body. :L√º () - A sideways, circular yielding movement, often translated as \\"Roll Back.\\" :Chi () - A pressing or squeezing offset in a direction away from the body, usually done with the back of the hand or outside edge of the forearm. Chi is often translated as \\"Press.\\" :An () - To offset with the hand, usually a slight lift up with the fingers then a push down with the palm, which can appear as a strike if done quickly. Often translated as \\"Push.\\" :Tsai () - To pluck or pick downwards with the hand, especially with the fingertips or palm. The word tsai is part of the compound that means to gather, collect or pluck a tea leaf from a branch (Êé°Ëå∂, c«éi ch√°). Often translated \\"Pluck\\" or \\"Grasp.\\" :Lieh () - Lieh means to separate, to twist or to offset with a spiral motion, often while making immobile another part of the body (such as a hand or leg) to split an opponent's body thereby destroying posture and balance. Lieh is often translated as \\"Split.\\" :Chou () - To strike or push with the elbow. Usually translated as \\"Elbow Strike\\" or \\"Elbow Stroke\\" or just plain \\"Elbow.\\" :K'ao () - To strike or push with the shoulder or upper back. The word k'ao implies leaning or inclining. Usually translated \\"Shoulder Strike,\\" \\"Shoulder Stroke\\" or \\"Shoulder.\\" The Five Steps (): :Chin Pu () - Forward step. :T'ui Pu () - Backward step. :Tsuo Ku () - Left step. :You P'an () - Right step. :Chung Ting () - The central position, balance, equilibrium. Not just the physical center, but a condition which is expected to be present at all times in the first four steps as well, associated with the concept of rooting (the stability said to be achieved by a correctly aligned, thoroughly relaxed body as a result of correct Tai Chi training). Chung ting can also be compared to the Taoist concept of moderation or the Buddhist \\"middle way\\" as discouraging extremes of behavior, or in this case, movement. An extreme of movement, usually characterized as leaning to one side or the other, destroys a practitioner's balance and enables defeat. The Eight Gates are said to be associated with the eight trigrams (Bagua ÂÖ´Âç¶ bƒÅ gu√†) of the I Ching, the Five Steps with the five elements of the Taoist Wu Hsing (‰∫îË°å w«î x√≠ng); metal, water, wood, fire, and earth. Collectively they are sometimes referred to as the \\"Thirteen Postures of T'ai Chi Chuan\\" and their combinations and permutations are cataloged more or less exhaustively in the different styles of solo forms which Tai Chi is mostly known for by the general public. Pushing hands is practiced so that students have an opportunity for \\"hands-on\\" experience of the theoretical implications of the solo forms. Traditional internal teachers say that just training solo forms isn't enough to learn a martial art; that without the pushing hands, reflex and sensitivity to another's movements and intent are lost. Each component is seen as equally necessary, yin and yang, for realizing the health, meditative, and self-defense applications. Czech students push hands Pushing hands trains these technical principles in ever increasing complexity of patterns. At first students work basic patterns, then patterns with moving steps coordinated in different directions, patterns at differing heights (high, middle, low and combinations) and then finally different styles of \\"freestyle\\" push hands, which lead into sparring that combines closing and distancing strategies with long, medium and short range techniques. These exchanges are characterized as \\"question and answer\\" sessions between training partners; the person pushing is asking a question, the person receiving the push answers with their response. The answers should be \\"soft,\\" without resistance or stiffness. The students hope to learn to not fight back when pushed nor retreat before anticipated force, but rather to allow the strength and direction of the push to determine their answer. The intent thereby is for the students to condition themselves and their reflexes to the point that they can meet an incoming force in softness, move with it until they determine its intent and then allow it to exhaust itself or redirect it into a harmless direction. The degree to which students maintain their balance while observing these requirements determines the appropriateness of their \\"answers.\\" The expression used in some Tai Chi schools to describe this is \\"Give up oneself to follow another.\\" The eventual goal for self-defense purposes is to achieve meeting the force, determining its direction and effectively redirecting it in as short a time as possible, with examples provided of seemingly instantaneous redirections at the highest levels of kung fu by traditional teachers. Pushing hands also teaches students safety habits in regard to their own vital areas, especially acupressure points, as well as introducing them to the principles of chin na and some aspects of the manipulative therapy or tui na also taught in traditional Tai Chi Chuan schools. At a certain point, pushing hands begins to take on aspects of qigong (chi kung), as the students learn to coordinate their movements in attack and defense with their breathing. Contest Push hand contest divided to two types. :Moving Step () - The players stand in a circle; the player who is pushed or pulled out of the circle, or falls down, loses a point. :Fixed step () - The players stand in a small box; the player who is pushed or pulled out of the box loses a point.

It was a two-person Omnimover dark ride in Tomorrowland in the Magic Kingdom, sponsored by Eastern Air Lines. The ride featured travel destinations throughout the Caribbean and elsewhere, all of which were serviced by Eastern. The ride had an eponymous theme song by Buddy Baker. History If You Had Wings was located across from what originally was Flight To The Moon but later became Mission to Mars. The ride was sponsored by Eastern Air Lines. Eastern's initial investment in the ride was reportedly $10 million. Not well known or much promoted, waiting lines for IYHW were nonexistent or short even when the park was crowded. Nevertheless, the ride was imbued with the particular gentle charm and flavor characteristic of Disney productions and Walt Disney World more specifically. It was nicely air-conditioned and also free, when admission tickets were required of rides in the park. If You Had Wings was a four-and-a-half-minute dark ride based on Disney's Omnimover system. The ride moved at a leisurely pace throughout. It was structurally similar to the Disneyland attraction Adventure Thru Inner Space, which might be considered its predecessor; both were designed by Claude Coats. The theme music was written by Buddy Baker with lyrics by X Atencio. Attraction experience The ride began with projections of animated silhouettes of seagulls and airplanes sweeping past on the walls, enhancing the feeling of motion and gently suggesting flight. Riders passed through a series of colorful theater-like sets with embedded small screens looping rear-projected short filmed scenes, while their cars swiveled on their bases to direct riders toward points of interest. In all, thirty-eight 16mm projectors were used in the attraction. The scenes showcased various Eastern destinations and appealed to potential tourists with straw-hat markets, fishermen, limbo dancers, steel drum bands, and more. Many scenes had their own special sound effects. The omnipresent theme music featured a chorus of singers tunefully chanting, > If you had wings, if you had wings, > If you had wings, had wings, had wings, had wings. The music did not succeed in masking the clicking of the hidden projectors, which was clearly audible throughout most of the ride. The following locations were represented: Mexico, Bermuda, Puerto Rico, the Bahamas (where a tropically attired traffic cop blew a whistle to direct a flock of flamingos in one direction, pedestrians and vehicles in the other), Jamaica (where the ride's only 35mm projector showed a pod of bathing-suit-clad young people clambering up the rocks at Dunn's River Falls), Trinidad, and New Orleans (where shadows of blowing jazzmen flickered on the wall), all of which Eastern Air Lines offered as destinations at the time. Having viewed this sequence of site sets, riders entered the \\"speed room\\", an ellipsoid onto the interior of which were projected snippets of first-person movies of an airplane taking off, a train, water skis, motorcycles, airboats, and a few other scenes. The clips were projected on the walls by a 70mm projector. The ovoid screen encompassed the viewers' peripheral vision. Furthermore, the vehicle reclined in the speed room, and a breeze was blown on riders. The wraparound images, in combination with the motion and reclining angle of the vehicle and a blast of air, arguably constituted an early attempt at virtual reality. The images were to some extent blurry and distorted, unlike Disney's sharper Circle-Vision 360 technology; it rather resembled the fuzzy Cinema 180 shows featured in many contemporary amusement parks. The speed room was followed by the \\"mirror room\\", where two more 70mm projectors produced images of snow-covered mountains appearing on large screens and were reflected in enormous floor-to- ceiling mirrors, and the music became a wordless symphonic swell of harmonies. Riders \\"descended\\" after exiting the mirror room, and the voice of Orson Welles assured riders, > You do have wings. > You can do all these things. > You can widen your world. > Eastern: the wings of man. At the time of the ride's inception, \\"The Wings of Man\\" was the slogan of Eastern Air Lines. In later years, this passage (spoken by someone other than Welles; perhaps Disney vocal veteran Peter Renaday) ended with a different slogan, \\"Eastern: we'll be your wings.\\" Riders disembarked to an area containing an Eastern Air Lines reservation desk. Agents stood ready to assist riders with travel arrangements. In 1987, Eastern withdrew its sponsorship and the attraction closed on June 1 of that year. Eastern itself would go out of business just four years later. Interaction with the WEDway PeopleMover Large diorama windows, two on the right and one on the left, allowed the Mexico, Jamaica, and Trinidad scenes to be visible to riders on the Tomorrowland Transit Authority (then WEDWay PeopleMover). The window on the left was covered up when If You Had Wings was replaced with Delta Dreamflight. Successors After the closing of the original attraction, new attractions were created to inhabit the same space. If You Could Fly Subsequent to the closing of IYHW, Disney removed all references to Eastern, changed the name of the ride to If You Could Fly, and re-opened it on June 6, 1987. The sets and films were intact, but the theme music had been replaced. For many fans of the ride the absence of the infectious original music had taken much of the fun out of the attraction, and the opening scene which originally had a film about Eastern had been replaced with footage of flying birds. On January 4, 1989, If You Could Fly was permanently closed. Delta Dreamflight Soon after, Delta Air Lines took over sponsorship and made plans to update and remodel the attraction. The replacement was Delta Dreamflight, which made use of the same ride system and floor layout, but all-new scenery and music. Disney's Take Flight Delta dropped its sponsorship in June 1996. WDW removed all references to Delta and renamed the attraction Disney's Take Flight. The ride lasted two years, closing in January 1998. Unlike the wholesale musical change from If You Had Wings to If You Could Fly, Take Flights music was the same as Dreamflights except for minor alterations to the lyrics. Buzz Lightyear's Space Ranger Spin Disney decided to use the ride space to promote its popular film, Pixar's Toy Story. The attraction, Buzz Lightyear's Space Ranger Spin, again makes use of the original ride system and floor plan, but now riders can control the rotation of their vehicle via joysticks, and are armed with \\"laser cannons\\" to shoot at targets stationed throughout the attraction. Many of the elements in this attraction are similar to If You Had Wings including the speed tunnel with the projections on the walls and the loading and unloading areas. Buzz Lightyear sign above the door is in the shape of a cloud and was painted over after the attraction was renamed. Influence Epcot's World of Motion and Horizons dark rides featured Omnimovers in settings similar to the speed room mentioned above. The El Rio del Tiempo boat ride at the Mexico pavilion at World Showcase, which has since been modified into the Gran Fiesta Tour Starring The Three Caballeros, includes films projected onto small screens embedded in elaborate sets. This, combined with persistent music, miniature films, and dancing animatronics, draws significantly from If You Had Wings The theme song \\"If You Had Wings\\" can be heard in Tomorrowland at Walt Disney World; it is given a more retro metronome, and has no lyrics. The ride was parodied in The Simpsons episode \\"Special Edna\\" in which monstrous robotic Eastern airliners were depicted enslaving the human race.

In 1922, the Union of Slavic Baptists in Poland was formed, and the Union of the Baptist Churches of the German Language was formed in 1928. The unions of German-speaking and Polish- speaking Baptists existed until World War II, when they were forced into a merger with other evangelical Christian bodies. After 1947, the Baptists emerged as a small separate body. The Baptist Union of Poland is a member of the European Baptist Federation and the Baptist World Alliance. As of 2014, there were 83 Baptists churches with about 5,204 members in Poland, overwhelmingly a Catholic country.Ukraine: A Baptist Church for Every 5,000 Inhabitants The Sabbath Day Christian Church is a Seventh Day Baptist body that exists independently of the Union.

Description The langeleik has only one melody string and up to 8 drone strings. Under the melody string there are seven frets per octave, forming a diatonic major scale. The drone strings are tuned to a triad. The langeleik is tuned to about an A, though on score the C major key is used, as if the instrument were tuned in C. This is for simplification of both writing and reading, by circumventing the use of accidentals. Since the instrument cannot play a chromatic scale nor be easily tuned to other pitches, it is very limited in its ability to play along with other instruments and/or more harmonically complex music. The combination of the lone melody string and the multiple drone strings gives the langeleik a distinctively rich sound. History There exists a variety of box zithers in Europe. The German scheitholt and the Swedish Hummel have been suggested as the predecessor of the langeleik. However, in 1980 a langeleik dated as early as 1524 was uncovered on a farm in Vibergsroa, Gj√∏vik, Norway. This instrument predates any documented occurrences of the scheitholt, the hummel or any other similar instrument. The older Langeleik types were tuned after Pythagorean fashion, based on pure fifths and octaves, with variable smaller intervals. Thus, the pitches could easily be moved between more sombre \\"low\\" intervals and the more bright major ones. The fixed Langeleik with a recognizable major scale is dated to after 1850. After this change in tonation, many players had to change their melodies, or find new ones, as the older repertoire no longer fitted into the new system. Types of langeleik Early langeleiks are basically rectangular in shape, and often have an open bottom. They usually have five or six strings. They often had unique traditional scales other than the modern major scale (using 3/4 tones, etc.). Especially the third and seventh tend to be different; the third is often neutral (between a major and minor third) and the seventh tends to be lower than the modern leading tone. Modern langeleiks are somewhat curved, being wider at the middle, as it is the experience of modern instrument makers that this makes the instrument sound louder. They are all tuned to a major scale. Playing The right hand holds a long plectrum, and with this plectrum it strikes the beat, the basic rhythm. The left hand utilizes only its index, middle and ring finger. When a desired melody note is to be executed on the basic beat, the left hand only need to hold down the melody string, and the right hand will strike it with the plectrum. When a note is wanted in between the basic rhythm, the index or middle finger needs to hammer-on or pull-off the melody string. Tradition Norway has several areas of culture, amplified due to its many mountains, valleys and fjords; some areas have their own versions of springdans. (See Polska) Valdres and Vardal are the only areas where the langeleik has a living (and thus more developed) tradition, with more melodies available, especially of the more recent, more complex kind, made for arguably better instruments. The picture above is of a Valdres langeleik. It is also home of the valdres springar dance. Telemark is another distinct area of Norway, home of the Telemark springar. The Telemark langeleik is distinct from the Valdres kind in that the sound-box is thin and straight-walled whereas the Valdres-langeleik curves to a broader lower part, and it does not have a board at the bottom and thus is more dependent on a good table for amplification. Also the head looks all different. The langeleik has had a renaissance, and while there are players in most part of Norway, there are not so many places -at least not well known- where the instrument is being played officially. This is perhaps mostly due to that it is a solo instrument. Gj√∏vik Spelemannslag (the folk musician guild of Gj√∏vik ) has a steady group of langeleik-players which meets every Wednesday. They also build langeleiks and a lot of other kinds of instruments. Music The types of tunes mostly played on the instrument are reinlender, vals, mazurka, gangar, springar and halling. See Gammeldans (old dance) and Bygdedans (village dance) for more information.

Sociologists sometimes turn this euphemism into a formal designation, applying the term \\"inner city\\" to such residential areas, rather than to geographically more central commercial districts. The word \\"downtown\\" is also used to describe the inner city or city centre ‚Äì primarily in North America ‚Äì by English-speakers to refer to a city's commercial, cultural and often the historical, political and geographic heart, and is often contiguous with its central business district. In British English, the term \\"city centre\\" is most often used, \\"centre-ville\\" in French, Stadtzentrum in German, or sh√¨zh≈çngxƒ´n (Â∏Ç‰∏≠ÂøÉ) in Chinese). The two terms are used interchangeably in Canada. A few US cities, such as Philadelphia, use the term \\"Center City\\". Etymology The term \\"inner city\\" first achieved consistent usage through the writings of white liberal Protestants in the US after World War II, contrasting with the growing affluent suburbs. According to urban historian Bench Ansfield, the term signified both a bounded geographic construct and a set of cultural pathologies inscribed onto urban black communities. Inner city thus originated as a term of containment. Its genesis was the product of an era when a largely suburban mainline Protestantism was negotiating its relationship to American cities. Liberal Protestants‚Äô missionary brand of urban renewal refocused attention away from the blight and structural obsolescence thought to be responsible for urban decay, and instead brought into focus the cultural pathologies they mapped onto black neighborhoods. The term inner city arose in this racial liberal context, providing a rhetorical and ideological tool for articulating the role of the church in the nationwide project of urban renewal. Thus, even as it arose in contexts aiming to entice mainline Protestantism back into the cities it had fled, the term accrued its meaning by generating symbolic and geographic distance between white liberal churches and the black communities they sought to help.Bench Ansfield, \\"Unsettling 'Inner City': Liberal Protestantism and the Postwar Origins of a Keyword in Urban Studies\\" Antipode (2018) Urban renewal Urban renewal (also called urban regeneration in the United Kingdom and urban redevelopment in the United States) is a program of land redevelopment often used to address urban decay in cities.

Genesee River Middle Section Near Mount Morris Showing Glacial Changes in Valleys The present river valley has been modified extensively from preglacial river valleys. A lobe of the last glacier (Wisconsonian) pushed southward almost to the Pennsylvania line, dramatically reshaping the drainage patterns of central and western New York. Middle Genesee The first image shows the evidence of the glacial rerouting for the middle section of the Genesee. The original river had two branches. The east branch runs southeast of Mount Morris. It was much larger than the west branch, flowing from near present-day Canisteo, New York to empty into the preglacial Ontario River (now lake) north of Rochester. The headwaters of the east branch were blocked and diverted southward into the present Susquehanna River system by huge glacial terminal moraines just south of Dansville. The entire old valley was buried in that area. This left only the small Canaseraga Creek, to flow in the remnant of the large ancient east branch valley from Dansville to Mount Morris. The current upper Genesee (above Mount Morris) was only the west branch in preglacial times, a tributary river to the original. This branch, which entered the old valley was also dammed in the Nunda area by moraines. A lake was formed with varve clay sediments visible along the valley sides in many spots, but the lake drained as the river found a way to cut a new valley northeastward from Portageville a little west of the original valley, then drop back into the old valley at Mount Morris. This section of new valley is a spectacular gorge with three scenic waterfalls, that is now the site of Letchworth State Park. Portions of other preglacial valleys can be seen both east and west of the Genesee, occupied now by lakes. The remnants of these valleys were buried by glacial drift. A drumlin field can be seen just north of Conesus and Hemlock Lakes. Middle Falls and the Devonian rock gorge of the Genesee River at Letchworth State Park Lower Genesee Image:Lowergenesee1.jpg Genesee River Lower Section Near Rochester Showing Glacial Changes in Valleys In the lower part of the river, before entering Lake Ontario, the river appears to have been diverted once again from its ancient valley by the glacier. The original valley is thought to be that of Irondequoit Creek and Bay. The second image shows the most likely (buried) westward path originally followed by the river. With this blocked, the river cut a new channel, and created three waterfalls where it crossed limestone escarpments.

It connects Los Angeles with Pasadena alongside the Arroyo Seco seasonal river. It is notable not only for being the first, mostly opened in 1940, but for representing the transitional phase between early parkways and modern freeways. It conformed to modern standards when it was built, but is now regarded as a narrow, outdated roadway.* A 1953 extension brought the south end to the Four Level Interchange in downtown Los Angeles and a connection with the rest of the freeway system. The road remains largely as it was on opening day, though the plants in its median have given way to a steel guard rail, and most recently to concrete barriers, and it now carries the designation State Route 110, not historic U.S. Route 66. Between 1954 and 2010, it was officially designated the Pasadena Freeway. In 2010, as part of plans to revitalize its scenic value and improve safety, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) restored the original name to the roadway. All the bridges built during parkway construction remain, as do four older bridges that crossed the Arroyo Seco before the 1930s. The Arroyo Seco Parkway is designated a State Scenic Highway, National Civil Engineering Landmark, and National Scenic Byway. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.  Route description  Northbound over the Los Angeles River The six-lane Arroyo Seco Parkway (part of State Route 110) begins at the Four Level Interchange, a symmetrical stack interchange on the north side of downtown Los Angeles that connects the Pasadena (SR 110 north), Harbor (SR 110 south), Hollywood (US 101 north), and Santa Ana (US 101 south) Freeways. The first interchange is with the north end of Figueroa Street at Alpine Street, and the freeway then meets the north end of Hill Street at a complicated junction that provides access to Dodger Stadium. Beyond Hill Street, SR 110 temporarily widens to four northbound and five southbound lanes as it enters the hilly Elysian Park, where the northbound lanes pass through the four Figueroa Street Tunnels and the higher southbound lanes pass through a cut and over low areas on bridges. One interchange, with Solano Avenue and Amador Street, is located between the first and second tunnels. Just beyond the last tunnel is a northbound left exit and corresponding southbound right entrance for Riverside Drive and the northbound Golden State Freeway (I-5). Immediately after those ramps, the Arroyo Seco Parkway crosses a pair of three-lane bridges over the Los Angeles River just northwest of its confluence with the Arroyo Seco, one rail line on each bank, and Avenue 19 and San Fernando Road on the north bank. A single onramp from San Fernando Road joins SR 110 northbound as it passes under I-5, and a northbound left exit and southbound right entrance connect to the north segment of Figueroa Street. Here the original 1940 freeway, mostly built along the west bank of the Arroyo Seco, begins as the southbound lanes curve from their 1943 alignment over the Los Angeles River into the original alignment next to the northbound lanes. The Avenue 26 Bridge As the original freeway begins, it passes under an extension to the 1925 Avenue 26 Bridge, one of four bridges over the Arroyo Seco that predate the parkway's construction. A southbound exit and northbound entrance at Avenue 26 complement the Figueroa Street ramps, and similar ramps connect Pasadena to both directions of I-5. SR 110 continues northeast alongside the Arroyo Seco, passing under the L Line light rail and Pasadena Avenue before junctioning Avenue 43 at the first of many folded diamond interchanges that feature extremely tight (right-in/right- out) curves on the exit and entrance ramps. The next interchange, at Avenue 52, is a normal diamond interchange, and soon after is Via Marisol, where the northbound side has standard diamond ramps, but on the southbound side Avenue 57 acts as a folded diamond connection. The 1926 Avenue 60 Bridge is the second original bridge, and is another folded diamond, with southbound traffic using Shults Street to connect. The 1895 Santa Fe Arroyo Seco Railroad Bridge (now L Line) lies just beyond, and after that is a half diamond interchange at Marmion Way/Avenue 64 with access towards Los Angeles only. After the freeway passes under the 1912 York Boulevard Bridge, the pre-parkway bridge, southbound connections between the freeway and cross street can be made via Salonica Street. As the Arroyo Seco curves north to pass west of downtown Pasadena, the Arroyo Seco Parkway instead curves east, crossing the stream into South Pasadena. A single northbound offramp on the Los Angeles side of the bridge curves left under the bridge to Bridewell Street, the parkway's west-side frontage road. Looking south from Marmion Way, showing the differently-colored passing lanes As they enter South Pasadena, northbound motorists can see a \\"City of South Pasadena\\" sign constructed, in the late 1930s, of stones from the creek bed embedded in a hillside.. This final segment of the Arroyo Seco Parkway heads east in a cut alongside Grevelia Street, with a full diamond at Orange Grove Avenue and a half diamond at Fair Oaks Avenue. In between those two streets it crosses under the L Line for the third and final time. Beyond Fair Oaks Avenue, SR 110 curves north around the east side of Raymond Hill and enters Pasadena, where the final ramp, a southbound exit, connects to State Street for access to Fair Oaks Avenue. The freeway, and state maintenance, ends at the intersection with Glenarm Street, but the six- and four-lane Arroyo Parkway, now maintained by the city of Pasadena, continues north as a surface road to Colorado Boulevard (historic U.S. Route 66) and beyond to Holly Street near the Memorial Park L Line station.  Route usage  According to CalTrans in 2016, the average annual daily traffic (AADT) on the Arroyo Seco Parkway was 78,000 car trips at Orange Grove Blvd, 100,000 car trips at Ave 64, and 123,000 car trips at Ave 43.  History = Planning  alt=Photograph The Arroyo Seco (Spanish: \\"dry gulch, or streambed\\") is an intermittent stream that carries rainfall from the San Gabriel Mountains southerly through western Pasadena into the Los Angeles River near downtown Los Angeles. During the dry season, it served as a faster wagon connection between the two cities than the all-weather road on the present Huntington Drive.. The first known survey for a permanent roadway through the Arroyo was made by T. D. Allen of Pasadena in 1895, and in 1897 two more proposals were made, one for a scenic parkway and the other for a commuter cycleway. The latter was partially constructed and opened by Horace Dobbins, who incorporated the California Cycleway Company and bought a six- mile (10 km) right-of-way from downtown Pasadena to Avenue 54 in Highland Park, Los Angeles. Construction began in 1899, and about of the elevated wooden bikeway were opened on January 1, 1900, starting near Pasadena's Hotel Green and ending near the Raymond Hotel. The majority of its route is now Edmondson Alley; a toll booth was located near the north end, in the present Central Park. Due to the end of the bicycle craze of the 1890s and the existing Pacific Electric Railway lines connecting Pasadena to Los Angeles, the cycleway did not and was not expected to turn a profit, and never extended beyond the Raymond Hotel into the Arroyo Seco. In the 1900s (decade), the structure was dismantled, and the wood sold for lumber, and the Pasadena Rapid Transit Company, a failed venture headed by Dobbins to construct a streetcar line, acquired the right-of-way.. The California Cycleway, 1900 Due to the rise of the automobile, most subsequent plans for the Arroyo Seco included a roadway, though they differed as to the purpose: some, influenced by the City Beautiful movement, concentrated on the park, while others, particularly those backed by the Automobile Club of Southern California (ACSC), had as their primary purpose a fast road connecting the two cities. The first plan that left the Arroyo Seco in South Pasadena to better serve downtown Pasadena was drawn up by Pasadena City Engineer Harvey W. Hincks in 1916 and supported by the Pasadena Chamber of Commerce and ACSC. Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. and Harland Bartholomew's 1924 Major Street Traffic Plan for Los Angeles, while concentrating on traffic relief, and noting that the Arroyo Seco Parkway would be a major highway, suggested that it be built as a parkway, giving motorists \\"a great deal of incidental recreation and pleasure\\". By the mid-1930s, plans for a primarily recreational parkway had been overshadowed by the need to carry large numbers of commuters.. Debates continued on the exact location of the parkway, in particular whether it would bypass downtown Pasadena. In the late 1920s, Los Angeles acquired properties between San Fernando Road and Pasadena Avenue, and City Engineer Lloyd Aldrich began grading between Avenues 60 and 66 in the early 1930s. By June 1932, residents of Highland Park and Garvanza, who had paid special assessments to finance improvement of the park, became suspicious of what appeared to be a road, then graded along the Arroyo Seco's west side between Via Marisol (then Hermon Avenue) and Princess Drive. Merchants on North Figueroa Street (then Pasadena Avenue) also objected, due to the loss of business they would suffer from a bypass. Work stopped while the interested parties could work out the details, although, in late 1932 and early 1933, Aldrich was authorized to grade a cheaper route along the east side between Avenue 35 and Hermon Avenue. To the north, Pasadena and South Pasadena endorsed in 1934 what was essentially Hincks's 1916 plan, but lacked the money to build it. A bill was introduced in 1935 to add the route to the state highway system, and after some debate a new Route 205 was created as a swap for the Palmdale-Wrightwood Route 186, \\"A new route or portion of route is hereby added to the State highway system from Route 165 [Figueroa Street] near Los Angeles River in Los Angeles to Route 161 [Colorado Boulevard] in Pasadena at Broadway Avenue.\\" \\"Route 205 is from Route 165 near Los Angeles River in Los Angeles to Route 161 in Pasadena at Broadway Avenue.\\" as the legislature had just greatly expanded the system in 1933, and the California Highway Commission opposed a further increase..  Construction  The Figueroa Street Tunnels To connect the proposed parkway with downtown Los Angeles, that city improved and extended North Figueroa Street as a four-lane road to the Los Angeles River, allowing drivers to bypass the congested North Broadway Bridge on the existing but underutilized Riverside Drive Bridge. A large part of the project lay within Elysian Park, and four Art Deco tunnels were built through the hills. The first three, between Solano Avenue and the river, opened in late 1931, and the fourth opened in mid-1936, completing the extension of Figueroa Street to Riverside Drive. As with the contemporary Ramona Boulevard east from downtown, grade separations were mostly built only where terrain dictated. For Figueroa Street, this meant that all crossings except College Street (built several years after the extension was completed), where a hill was cut through, were at grade. The Figueroa Street Viaduct, connecting the Riverside Drive intersection with North Figueroa Street (then Dayton Avenue) across the Los Angeles River, opened in mid-1937. Closer to downtown, an interchange was built at Temple Street in 1939.. The Figueroa Street Viaduct, 1938 (Riverside Drive is to the left, and its bridge is in the left background) Although many South Pasadena residents opposed the division of the city that the parkway would bring, the city's voters elected supporters in the 1936 elections. The state, which had the power to put the road where it wished even had South Pasadena continued to oppose it, approved the route on April 4, 1936. The route used the Arroyo Seco's west bank to near Hough Street, where it crossed to the east and cut through South Pasadena to the south end of Broadway (now Arroyo Parkway) in Pasadena. Another project, the Arroyo Seco Flood Control Channel, was built by the Works Progress Administration before and during construction of the parkway to avoid damages from future floods. A number of state engineers toured East Coast roads in early 1938, including Chicago's Lake Shore Drive, full and modified cloverleaf interchanges in Massachusetts and New Jersey, and Robert Moses's parkway system in New York City. The parkway was the first road built in California under a 1939 freeway law that allowed access to be completely limited to a number of specified points. Although, in some areas, it was possible to use a standard diamond interchange, other locations required folded diamonds, or, as the engineers called them, \\"compressed cloverleafs\\", where local streets often took the place of dedicated ramps, ending at the parkway with a sharp right turn required to enter or exit. The highway was designed with two lanes and one shoulder in each direction, with the wider inside (passing) lanes paved in black asphalt concrete and the outside lanes paved in white Portland cement concrete. The differently-colored lanes would encourage drivers to stay in their lanes. (By mid-1939, the state had decided to replace the shoulders with additional travel lanes for increased capacity; except on a short piece in South Pasadena, these were also paved with Portland cement. So that disabled vehicles could be safely removed from the roadway, about 50 \\"safety bays\\" were constructed in 1949 and 1950..) The engineers used a design speed of , superelevating curves where necessary to accomplish this. (The road is now posted at ..) Despite the freeway design, many parkway characteristics were incorporated, such as plantings of mostly native flora alongside the road.. Prior to parkway construction, nine roads and two rail lines crossed the Arroyo Seco and its valley on bridges, and a number of new bridges were built as part of the project. Only four of the existing bridges were kept, albeit with some changes:National Bridge Inventory database, 2006 the 1925 Avenue 26 Bridge, the 1926 Avenue 60 Bridge, the 1895 Santa Fe Arroyo Seco Railroad Bridge (now part of the L Line) near Avenue 64, and the 1912 York Boulevard Bridge. The Avenue 43 Bridge would have been kept had the Los Angeles Flood of 1938 not destroyed it. At Cypress Avenue, abutments and a foundation were built for a roadway, but were not used until the 1960s, when a pedestrian bridge was built as part of the Golden State Freeway (I-5) interchange project. In South Pasadena, seven streets and the Union Pacific and Santa Fe railroad lines on a double track combined bridge were carried over the parkway to keep the communities on each side connected.. The Marmion Way (foreground) and York Boulevard (background) bridges in 1940 Construction on the Arroyo Seco Parkway, designed under the leadership of District Chief Engineer Spencer V. Cortelyou and Design Engineer A. D. Griffin, began with a groundbreaking ceremony in South Pasadena on March 22, 1938 and generally progressed from Pasadena southwest. The first contract, stretching less than a mile (1.5 km) from Glenarm Street in Pasadena around Raymond Hill to Fair Oaks Avenue in South Pasadena, and including no bridges, was opened to traffic on December 10, 1938. A 3.7-mile (6.0 km) section opened on July 20, 1940, connecting Orange Grove Avenue in South Pasadena with Avenue 40 in Los Angeles. The remainder in Los Angeles, from Avenue 40 southwest to the Figueroa Street Viaduct at Avenue 22, was dedicated on December 30, 1940, with great fanfare, and opened to the public the following day in time for the Tournament of Roses Parade and Rose Bowl on New Year's Day. However, the highway through South Pasadena was not completed until January 30, 1941, and landscaping work continued through September. The final cost of $5.75 million, under $1 million per mile, was extremely low for a freeway project because the terrain was favorable for grade separations.. Through Elysian Park: Figueroa Street Tunnels at left, 1943 lanes at right The state began upgrading the four-lane North Figueroa Street extension (then part of Route 165) in October 1940 as a \\"Southerly Extension\\" of the parkway, even before the parkway was complete. The at-grade intersection with Riverside Drive was already a point of congestion, and the six lanes of parkway narrowing into four lanes of surface street would cause much greater problems. The two-way Figueroa Street Tunnels and Viaduct were repurposed for four lanes of northbound traffic, and a higher southbound roadway was built to the west. From the split with Hill Street south to near the existing College Street overpass, the four-lane surface road became a six-lane freeway. The extension was designed almost entirely on freeway, rather than parkway, principles, as it had to be built quickly to handle existing traffic. The new road split from the old at the Figueroa Street interchange, just south of Avenue 26, and crossed the Los Angeles River and the northbound access to Riverside Drive on a new three-lane bridge. Through Elysian Park, a five-lane open cut was excavated west of the existing northbound tunnel lanes, saving about $1 million. The extension, still feeding into surface streets just south of College Street, was opened to traffic on December 30, 1943, again allowing its use for the New Year's Day festivities.. The Four Level Interchange, looking northeast along the Pasadena Freeway; the interchange at Figueroa and Temple Streets is in the right foreground While the Arroyo Seco Parkway was being built and extended, the region's freeway system was taking shape. The short city-built Cahuenga Pass Freeway opened on June 15, 1940, over a month before the second piece of the Arroyo Seco Parkway was complete. In the next two decades, the Harbor, Hollywood (Cahuenga Pass), Long Beach (Los Angeles River), San Bernardino (Ramona), and Santa Ana Freeways were partially or fully completed to their eponymous destinations, and others were under construction. The centerpiece of the system was the Four Level Interchange just north of downtown Los Angeles, the first stack interchange in the world. Although it was completed in 1949, the structure was not fully used until September 22, 1953, when the short extension of the Arroyo Seco Parkway to the interchange opened. Though the common name used by the public had become \\"Arroyo Seco Freeway\\" over the years, it was officially a \\"Parkway\\" until November 16, 1954, when the California Highway Commission changed its name to the Pasadena Freeway.. Beginning in June 2010, the state began modifying interchange signs to remove the Pasadena Freeway name and reinstate the Arroyo Seco Parkway name. Signs that indicate route 110 as a \\"freeway\\" are being modified to \\"parkway\\" or its \\"Pkwy\\" abbreviation.  Post-construction  Golden State Freeway interchange, looking northeast Despite a quadrupling of traffic volumes, the original roadway north of the Los Angeles River largely remains as it was when it opened in 1940. Trucks and buses were banned in 1943, though the bus restriction has since been dropped; this has kept the freeway in good condition and relatively safe, despite its outdated design. This design, state-of-the-art when built, includes tight \\"right-in/right-out\\" access with a recommended exit speed of and stop signs on the entrance ramps; there are no acceleration or deceleration lanes. While the curves are banked for higher speeds, they were designed at half the modern standard. Except for the Golden State Freeway (I-5) interchange near the river, completed in 1962, the few structural changes to the freeway north of the river include the closure of the original southbound exit to Fair Oaks Avenue after its location on a curve proved dangerous and the replacement of shrubs in the median with a steel and now concrete guard rail. Los Angeles paid for reconstruction of the interchange at Hill Street, south of Elysian Park, in the early 1960s to serve the new Dodger Stadium.. When the Arroyo Seco Parkway opened, it was the first freeway in the Western United States. It became a new alignment of U.S. Route 66, and the old routing via Figueroa Street and Colorado Boulevard became U.S. Route 66 Alternate. The southern extension over the Los Angeles River to downtown Los Angeles also carried State Route 11 (which remained on the old route when US 66 was moved) and U.S. Routes 6 and 99 (which followed Avenue 26 and San Fernando Road to the northwest). The 1964 renumbering saw US 66 truncated to Pasadena, and SR 11 was moved from Figueroa Street (which became SR 159) to the Pasadena Freeway. Finally, the number was changed to SR 110 in 1981, when SR 11 between San Pedro and the Santa Monica Freeway (I-10) became I-110. \\"Route 110 is from San Pedro to Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena.\\" ArroyoFest, 2003 The Arroyo Seco Parkway remains the most direct route between downtown Los Angeles and Pasadena despite its flaws; the only reasonable freeway alternate (which trucks must use) is the Glendale Freeway (SR 2) to the west, which is itself not easily reached by trucks from downtown Los Angeles. The Gold Line light rail, opened in 2003 over the former Santa Fe Railway line, providing an alternate mode for commuters. The state legislature designated the original section, north of the Figueroa Street Viaduct, as a \\"California Historic Parkway\\" (part of the State Scenic Highway System reserved for freeways built before 1945) in 1993; the only other highway so designated is the Cabrillo Freeway (SR 163) in San Diego. The American Society of Civil Engineers named it a National Civil Engineering Landmark in 1999,. and it became a National Scenic Byway in 2002 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. Occidental College hosted the \\"ArroyoFest Freeway Walk and Bike Ride\\" on Sunday, June 15, 2003, closing the freeway to motor vehicles to \\"highlight several ongoing or proposed projects within the Arroyo that can improve the quality of life for everyone in the area\\".

The entire route connects San Pedro and the Port of Los Angeles with Downtown Los Angeles and Pasadena. The southern segment from San Pedro to Interstate 10 in downtown Los Angeles is signed as I-110, while the northern segment to Pasadena is signed as SR 110. The entire length of I-110, as well as SR 110 south of the Four Level Interchange with US 101, is the Harbor Freeway, and SR 110 north from US 101 to Pasadena is the historic Arroyo Seco Parkway, the first freeway in the western United States. I-110 is one of two 3-digit interstate designations to appear on opposite coasts; I-280 in California and New Jersey is the other. Route description The Harbor Freeway is often heavily congested at rush hour Entrance to the Harbor Freeway in Downtown Los Angeles The Harbor Freeway southbound entering \\"The Slot\\" after emerging from the \\"4-level\\" The Harbor Freeway, signed as Interstate 110, begins at Gaffey Street in San Pedro, where it then travels mostly due north to the Santa Monica Freeway (Interstate 10) at a point south of downtown Los Angeles, where it becomes signed as State Route 110. I-110 is primarily within the city limits of Los Angeles, running right along the South Los Angeles region and the Harbor Gateway, a two-mile (3 km) wide north-south corridor that was annexed by the city of Los Angeles specifically to connect San Pedro, Wilmington and the Port of Los Angeles with the rest the city. Harbor Transitway In addition, the Harbor Transitway, a grade-separated bus and high-occupancy vehicle corridor in the median of Interstate 110, runs between State Route 91 (Gardena Freeway) and the south side of Downtown Los Angeles. The Harbor Freeway, along with the Long Beach Freeway (Interstate 710), are the principal means for freight from the Port of Los Angeles to rail yards and warehouses further inland. Its interchange with the Santa Monica Freeway is notoriously busy and congested, and the portions bordering Bunker Hill in northwest Downtown Los Angeles are choked with traffic at peak travel times. Landmarks Notable landmarks and attractions near the Harbor Freeway include the California State University, Dominguez Hills; Watts Towers; Exposition Park (including the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the Banc of California Stadium and soon the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art); the University of Southern California; Staples Center; L.A. Live, Los Angeles Harbor College; the skyline of Downtown Los Angeles; and the Los Angeles Convention Center. SR 110 continues north on the Arroyo Seco Parkway to Pasadena. The Harbor Freeway is noted for its elaborate high-occupancy toll lane feature, with the HOT lanes elevated above the rest of traffic in many areas, constructed in 1994 by C.C. Myers, Inc. as HOV lanes and converted to HOT lanes in 2012. Of particular note is the Judge Harry Pregerson Interchange, which contains the most elaborate network of direct HOV/HOT connectors in Los Angeles County. It includes a 7-story ramp that connects the Century Freeway's HOV lanes to the Harbor Freeway's northbound HOT lanes and offers splendid views of the entire Los Angeles Basin and the San Gabriel Mountains. The interchange with State Route 91 (formally known as the Edmund J. Russ Interchange) is also fairly large. Route 110 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration.

In the 1924 Major Street Traffic Plan for Los Angeles, a widening of Figueroa Street to San Pedro as a good road to the Port of Los Angeles was proposed.Los Angeles Times, City Moves in Figueroa Plan, September 29, 1926, p. 13 Progress was slow,Los Angeles Times, Haste Asked on Figueroa, March 2, 1936, p. A8 and in 1933 the state legislature added the entire length to the state highway system as Route 165, an unsigned designation. This route not only extended from San Pedro north to Los Angeles, but continued through the city-built Figueroa Street Tunnels and along the northern extension of Figueroa Street to Eagle Rock, and then followed Linda Vista Avenue (via an overlap on Route 161 (SR 134) over the Colorado Street Bridge) to Route 9 (now I-210) at the Devil's Gate Reservoir.: \\"San Pedro to State Highway Route 9 near La Canada via Figueroa Street.\\": \\"Route 165 is from San Pedro to Route 9 near La Canada via Figueroa Street.\\": \\"Route 165 is from San Pedro to Route 9 near La Canada via Figueroa Street and Linda Vista Avenue.\\" The entire length of Route 165 became Sign Route 11 in 1934. U.S. Route 6 was also assigned to the portion between SR 1 and Avenue 26 in 1937,Richard F. Weingroff, U.S. 6: The Grand Army of the Republic Highway and at about the same time US 66 was moved from Eagle Rock Boulevard to Figueroa Street, overlapping SR 11 between Sunset Boulevard (US 101) and Colorado Street (SR 134).H.M. Gousha Company, Los Angeles and Vicinity, 1935H.M. Gousha Company, Los Angeles and Vicinity, 1939 The state completed the Arroyo Seco Parkway which had been added to the state highway system in 1935 as Route 205, in early 1941, providing a faster route between SR 11 at Avenue 26 and Pasadena.Historic American Engineering Record (J.

In 1981, the SR 11 designation was renumbered as Interstate 110 on the Harbor Freeway, and State Route 110 on the Pasadena Freeway. The Interstate 110 designation had been previously applied to what is now a spur of I-10 from 1958 to 1968. Richard Ankrom signage In 2001, Richard Ankrom, a local artist who got lost trying to get onto Interstate 5 North from northbound I-110 because there was no clear official signage labeling access to I-5 North, solved his frustration by covertly modifying one of the overhead signs on the freeway just before the Four Level Interchange (). Using official government sign specifications, Ankrom fabricated two sign pieces, one being an Interstate 5 marker shield and the other with the word \\"NORTH\\", and affixed them to the left side of the sign. He performed his modifications in broad daylight, disguised as a Caltrans worker. In that district, Caltrans has three sign crews, each thinking one of the other two crews did the installation. After nine months, at Ankrom's request, the Los Angeles Downtown News broke the story. Prior to Ankrom's work, the only signage directing motorists to the 5 North off-ramp came at a quarter-mile before the exit, thus forcing many to merge across multiple lanes in a very short distance. The signs were inspected by Caltrans to ensure they would not fall off onto the road below. Ankrom was never charged, despite statements from officials that his actions were illegal. Ankrom referred to his sign project as \\"Guerilla Public Service\\".RICHARD ANKROM‚Äôs Freeway Art: Caltrans Buys Into the Prank LA Weekly December 30, 2009. Accessed 6-28-13 Caltrans later added an additional \\"5 North\\" sign over the left northbound lane at the entrance to the Figueroa Street Tunnels, as well as new electric signage, which will note when an additional lane is available for those wishing to transition to northbound Interstate 5 (converting the current single lane transition to dual lanes). In 2009, Caltrans replaced all signage along this segment with newer, more reflective versions. These new signs include Ankrom's original improvements. Preservation Despite the increased traffic in Los Angeles, including trucks shipping products from the Port of Los Angeles in San Pedro, there are no plans to upgrade the rest of I-110 from I-10 to Pasadena to Interstate standards. Instead, Caltrans has pushed for a protected status alternative to preserve the Arroyo Seco Parkway as a historic landmark. The state legislature designated the original section, north of the Figueroa Street Viaduct, as a \\"California Historic Parkway\\" (part of the State Scenic Highway System reserved for freeways built before 1945) in 1993; the only other highway so designated is the Cabrillo Freeway (SR 163) in San Diego.

Born in Liverpool, England, she emigrated to New Zealand with her family in 1868. There she became an active member of various religious and social organisations, including the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). In 1887 she was appointed the WCTU's National Superintendent for Franchise and Legislation, a position she used to advance the cause of women's suffrage in New Zealand. Kate Sheppard promoted women's suffrage by organising petitions and public meetings, by writing letters to the press, and by developing contacts with politicians. She was the editor of The White Ribbon, the first woman-operated newspaper in New Zealand. Through her skilful writing and persuasive public speaking, she successfully advocated women's suffrage. Her pamphlets Ten Reasons Why the Women of New Zealand Should Vote and Should Women Vote? contributed to the cause. This work culminated in a petition with 30,000 signatures calling for women's suffrage that was presented to parliament, and the successful extension of the franchise to women in 1893. As a result, New Zealand became the first country to establish universal suffrage. Sheppard was the first president of the National Council of Women of New Zealand, founded in 1896, and helped reform the organisation in 1918. In later life, she travelled to Britain and assisted the suffrage movement there. With failing health, she returned to New Zealand, after which she continued to be involved in writing on women's rights, although she became less politically active. She died in 1934, leaving no descendants. Sheppard is considered to be an important figure in New Zealand's history. A memorial to her exists in Christchurch. She replaced Queen Elizabeth II on the front of the New Zealand ten-dollar note in 1991. Early life Notable Sheppard locations: 1) Kate Sheppard National Memorial 2) Madras St residence 3) Trinity Church 4) Tuam St Hall 5) Addington Cemetery Kate Sheppard was born Catherine Wilson Malcolm on 10 March 1848 in Liverpool, England, to Scottish parents Jemima Crawford Souter and Andrew Wilson Malcolm. Her father, born in Scotland in 1819, was described in various documents as either a lawyer, banker, brewer's clerk or legal clerk; he married Souter in the Inner Hebrides on 14 July 1842. Catherine was named after her paternal grandmother, also Catherine Wilson Malcolm, but preferred to spell her name \\"Katherine\\" or to abbreviate it to \\"Kate\\". She had an elder sister Marie, born in Scotland, and three younger siblings ‚Äì Frank, born in Birmingham, and Isabella and Robert, both born in London; evidently the family moved often during that period. Details of the children's education are unknown, though Kate's later writings demonstrate an extensive knowledge of science and law, indicating a strong education. She was known for her broad knowledge and intellectual ability. Her father loved music and ensured that the family had good musical training. Kate's father died in 1862, while in his early forties, but left his widow with sufficient means to provide for the family. After her father's death, Kate lived with her uncle, a minister of the Free Church of Scotland at Nairn; he, more than anyone else, instilled in her the values of Christian socialism. During this time, the rest of the family stayed with relatives in Dublin, where Kate later joined them. George Beath, the future husband of Kate's sister Marie, emigrated to Melbourne in 1863, and later moved to Christchurch. After Marie joined him there, they were married in 1867, and their first child was born the following year. Marie's accounts of Christchurch motivated Jemima to move her family to New Zealand, as she was seeking better prospects for her sons' employment and wanted to see her granddaughter. They sailed on the Matoaka from Gravesend on 12 November 1868, arriving in Lyttelton Harbour on 8 February 1869. Trinity Congregational Church, where Sheppard worshipped In Christchurch, most of the family, including Kate, joined the Trinity Congregational Church. The minister was William Habens, a graduate of the University of London who was also Classics Master at Christchurch High School. Kate became part of Christchurch's intellectual and social scenes, and spent time with Marie and George's growing family. Kate married Walter Allen Sheppard, a shop owner, at her mother's house on 21 July 1871. Walter had been elected to the Christchurch City Council in 1868, and may have impressed Kate with his knowledge of local matters. They lived on Madras Street, not far from her mother's home, and within walking distance of the city centre. The Trinity Congregational Church raised funds for a new building from 1872 to 1874, and Kate was most likely involved in this. She formed a friendship with Alfred Saunders, a politician and prominent temperance activist who may have influenced her ideas on women's suffrage. Sheppard and her husband arrived in England in 1877 and spent a year there, then returned to Christchurch. Their only child, Douglas, was born on 8 December 1880. Sheppard was an active member of various religious organisations. She taught Sunday school, and in 1884 was elected secretary of the newly formed Trinity Ladies' Association, a body established to visit parishioners who did not regularly attend church services. The association also helped with fundraising and did jobs for the church such as providing morning tea. Sheppard wrote reports on the work of the Association, tried to recruit new members, and worked to retain existing ones. The following year she joined the Riccarton Choral Society. Her solo in a May 1886 concert was praised in the Lyttelton Times. She also served on the management committee of the YWCA. Women's suffrage movement Sheppard and five other prominent New Zealand suffragettes are commemorated on the Kate Sheppard National Memorial, a bronze sculpture in Christchurch. Early engagement Kate Sheppard's activism and engagement with politics began after listening to or reading about a talk by Mary Leavitt from the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) of the United States. In 1885 Leavitt toured New Zealand speaking not only about the problems caused by alcohol consumption, but also the need for women to have a \\"voice in public affairs\\". She spent two weeks in Christchurch, starting with a public speech at the Theatre Royal on 10 May. Journalists were impressed by the strength of public speaking displayed by a woman, something not witnessed often at that time in New Zealand. Sheppard became involved in establishing a Christchurch branch of the WCTU prior to the formation of a national organisation. Her initial involvement was in promoting petitions to Parliament to prevent women being employed as barmaids, and to outlaw the sale of alcohol to children. This marked the beginning of her collaborations with Alfred Saunders, who advised her on her negotiations with politicians and who wrote to the Premier, Sir Robert Stout, seeking to further her campaign. The barmaid petitions (including some from other parts of the country) were rejected by the Petitions Committee of Parliament later in 1885. Sheppard decided that politicians would continue to ignore petitions from women as long as women could not vote. In 1879 universal male suffrage had been granted to all men over the age of 21 whether they owned property or not, but women were still excluded as electors. A limited number of voting rights were extended to female voters in the 1870s. Female ratepayers were able to vote in local body elections in 1873, and in 1877 women \\"householders\\" were given the right to vote in and stand for education boards. The New Zealand Women's Christian Temperance Union was formed at a conference in Wellington in February 1886. Sheppard did not attend that conference, but at the second national convention in Christchurch a year later, she arrived ready to present a paper on women's suffrage, although there was no opportunity for her to do so. She was first appointed Superintendent for Relative Statistics, owing to her interest in economics. In 1887when local Franchise departments were established within the WCTUshe was appointed National Superintendent for the Franchise and Legislation. Much of the support for moderation came from women, and the Temperance Union believed that women's suffrage could advance their aim to prohibit alcohol while promoting child and family welfare. Sheppard soon became prominent in the area of women's suffrage, but her interest in the cause went beyond practical considerations regarding temperance. Her views were made well known with her statement that \\"all that separates, whether of race, class, creed, or sex, is inhuman, and must be overcome\\". Sheppard proved to be a powerful speaker and a skilled organiser, quickly building support for her cause. Sir Julius Vogel, Member of Parliament for Christchurch North and former Premier, introduced a Female Suffrage Bill to Parliament in 1887. The WCTU sent a deputation to Sir Julius Vogel, a Member of Parliament and former Premier, asking him to introduce a suffrage bill to parliament. He did so in 1887, with the Female Suffrage Bill, and Sheppard campaigned for its support. In its third reading, the part dealing with women's suffrage was defeated by one vote, and the bill was withdrawn. During the general election campaign later that year Sheppard encouraged WCTU members to ask parliamentary candidates questions about suffrage, but few women did so. In 1888 Sheppard was President of the Christchurch branch of the WCTU, and presented a report to the national convention in Dunedin, where the convention decided that prohibition and women's suffrage would be the organisation's central aims. Sheppard made public speeches on suffrage in Dunedin, Oamaru, and Christchurch, developing a confident speaking style. To reinforce her message, she gave audiences leaflets produced in Britain and the United States. Sheppard then published her own single-sheet pamphlet titled Ten Reasons Why the Women of New Zealand Should Vote, which displayed her \\"dry wit and logical approach\\". A copy was sent to every member of the House of Representatives. Petitions The government introduced an Electoral Bill in 1888 that would continue to exclude women from suffrage, and Sheppard organised a petition requesting that the exclusion be removed. She wrote to, and later met with, Sir John Hall, a well-respected Canterbury member of the House of Representatives, inviting him to present the petition and support her cause. He did so, but no action resulted. Sheppard then produced a second pamphlet, Should Women Vote?, which presented statements on suffrage from notable people in New Zealand and overseas. The Electoral Bill was delayed until 1890, when on 5 August, Hall proposed a motion \\"That in the opinion of the House, the right of voting for members of the House of Representatives should be extended to women.\\" After vigorous debate, this was passed 37 votes to 11. On 21 August, Hall moved an amendment to the Electoral Bill to give women suffrage, but it was defeated by seven votes. Following the defeat, Hall suggested to Sheppard that a petition to parliament should be the next step. She drew up the wording for the petition, arranged for the forms to be printed, and campaigned hard for its support. During the 1890 election campaign, WCTU members attempted to ask all candidates about their position on women's suffrage. The petition contained 10,085 signatures (according to WCTU minutes), and Hall presented it to Parliament in 1891 as a new Electoral Bill went into committee. The petition was supported in Parliament by Hall, Alfred Saunders, and the Premier at the time, John Ballance. Hall moved an amendment to the Electoral Bill to give women suffrage; it passed with a majority of 25 votes. An opponent of suffrage, Walter Carncross, then moved an amendment which would also allow women to stand for parliament; this seemed a logical extension of Hall's amendment but was actually calculated to cause the Bill's failure in New Zealand's upper house, the New Zealand Legislative Council. The Bill indeed failed in the Upper House by two votes. Illustrated comic of the Auckland Franchise League lining up outside the Premier's office. Published in The Observer in 1893. In 1890, Sheppard was one of the founders of the Christian Ethical Society, a discussion group for both men and women, not limited to the members of a single church. In their first few meetings the topics included selfishness, conjugal relations, and dress reform. The Society gave Sheppard more confidence debating her ideas with people from diverse backgrounds. During 1891, Sheppard began editing a page in the Prohibitionist on behalf of the WCTU. The Prohibitionist was a fortnightly temperance paper with a circulation around New Zealand of over 20,000. Sheppard used the pseudonym \\"Penelope\\" in this paper. Sheppard promised that a second petition would be twice as large and worked through the summer to organise it; it received 20,274 women's signatures. Using paid canvassers, the Liberal MP Henry Fish organised two counter petitions, one signed by men and the other by women; they received 5,000 signatures between them. An Electoral Bill in 1892 included provision for women's suffrage and again it easily passed in the House of Representatives, but the Upper House requested that women's votes be postal rather than by ballot. As the two houses could not agree on this, the bill failed. The first page of the successful 1893 Women's Suffrage Petition A third petition for suffrage, still larger, was organised by Sheppard and presented in 1893. This time 31,872 women signedthe largest petition of any kind presented to Parliament at this point. 1893 Electoral Bill The Electoral Bill of 1893, which granted women full voting rights, successfully passed in the House of Representatives in August. Few MPs were willing to vote against it, fearing that women would vote against them in the general election later that year. Many therefore chose to be absent from the house during votes. Henry Fish attempted to delay the proposed statute by calling for a national referendum, but the Bill progressed to the Legislative Council. After several attempts to stymie passage failed, the legislation passed 20 votes to 18 on 8 September. The Bill now needed the Governor's signature, and although Governor David Boyle did not support women's suffrage and was slow to sign, he eventually did so on 19 September. Sheppard was widely acknowledged as the leader of the women's suffrage movement.  1893 general election and further women's advocacy  Sheppard had no time to rest, as the was only ten weeks away, and the newspapers were spreading rumours that an early election might be called to reduce the number of women enrolled. Along with the Temperance Union, she was highly active in encouraging women to register as voters. The main meeting venue in Christchurch was the Tuam Street Hall. One of her largest detractors was the liquor industry, which feared for its continued business. Despite the short notice, 88 percent of women had enrolled to vote by election date (28 November), and nearly 70 percent ended up casting a vote. Although women had gained the vote they were not eligible to stand in parliamentary elections until 1919, and it was not until 1933 that the first woman was elected to parliament. In around 1892 Sheppard had started bicycling around Christchurchone of the first women in the city to do so. She joined the Atalanta Ladies' Cycling Club, which existed from 1892 to 1897, and was a founding committee member. The club was the first women's cycling club in New Zealand or Australia and attracted controversy as some of its members advocated \\"rational dress\\"such as knickerbockers rather than skirts for female cyclists. In December 1893, Sheppard was elected President of the Christchurch branch of the WCTU. She chaired the first two meetings in 1894, before travelling to England with her husband and son. She was in great demand in England as a speaker to women's groups about the struggle for women's suffrage in New Zealand. In mid-1895, the WCTU launched a monthly journal, The White Ribbon, with Sheppard as the editor, contributing to it from overseas. While in England Sheppard experienced health problems, requiring an operation, possibly a hysterectomy. The family returned to New Zealand at the beginning of 1896. Later that year, Sheppard was reappointed editor of The White Ribbon. Canterbury Women's Institute and the National Council of Women National Council of Women, Christchurch, 1896 The Canterbury Women's Institute was formed in September 1892, with Sheppard playing a leading role and taking charge of the economics department. The institute was open to both men and women and worked to reduce inequalities between them. Sheppard believed that enfranchisement was the first step towards achieving other reforms, such as reforming unfair laws on marriage, parenthood, and property, and towards eliminating the uneven treatment of the sexes in morality. The National Council of Women of New Zealand was established in April 1896 by the Canterbury Women's Institute and ten other women's groups from throughout New Zealand, and Sheppard was elected president at its founding convention. The Council promoted the right of women to stand for Parliament, equal pay and equal opportunities for women, the removal of legal disabilities affecting women, and economic independence for married women. Sheppard's election as president, instead of fellow feminist Lady Anna Stout, had caused a rift. This, along with other disagreements such as whether the Council should support New Zealand's involvement in the Second Boer War, contributed to the organisation going into recess in 1906. Later life Kate Sheppard, Sheppard's grave at Addington Cemetery, Christchurch As editor of The White Ribbon and president of the National Council of Women, Sheppard promoted many ideas related to improving the situation and status of women. In particular, she was concerned about establishing legal and economic independence of women from men. She was not only occupied with advancing women's rights, but also promoted political reforms such as proportional representation, binding referendums, and a Cabinet elected directly by Parliament. By 1902, Sheppard's marriage appears to have been under strain, and possibly had been for several years. Her husband sold their house and moved to England with their son, who wished to study in London. Sheppard bought new furnishings and appeared to be planning for a new permanent residence in Christchurch, but sold them in 1903, stepped down from her positions at the National Council of Women, and moved to England without any fixed date to return. On the way she briefly stopped in Canada and the United States where she met the American suffragist Carrie Chapman Catt. In London, she was active in promoting women's suffrage, but her health deteriorated further, forcing her to stop this work. In November 1904, Sheppard returned to New Zealand with her husband, but he went back to England in March the following year. She moved into the house of her long-time friends William Sidney Lovell-Smith and his wife Jennie Lovell-Smith; their third daughter, Hilda Kate Lovell-Smith, had been given her middle name after Sheppard. She remained relatively inactive in political circles, and stopped giving speeches, but continued to write. She prepared a display on the history of women's suffrage for the 1906 Exhibition in Christchurch, and wrote the pamphlet Woman Suffrage in New Zealand for the International Women's Suffrage Alliance in 1907. The following year she travelled to England for her son's wedding, visiting the headquarters of the WCTU in Chicago on the way, and meeting with suffrage groups after arriving in Britain. In 1912 and 1913, she travelled with the Lovell-Smiths through India and Europe. While she did not recover her former energy, her health had stopped declining, and she continued to be effective in influencing the New Zealand women's movement. She was the first to sign a petition to the Prime Minister, Sir Joseph Ward, in 1916, asking him to urge the British government to enfranchise women, and she revitalised the National Council of Women along with a group of other prominent suffragettes in 1918. Sheppard was elected president of the National Council that year before stepping down in 1919. Sheppard's husband Walter died in England in 1915. Jennie Lovell-Smith died in 1924, and Sheppard and William Lovell-Smith married in 1925. Lovell-Smith died only four years later, and Sheppard herself died in Christchurch on 13 July 1934 at the age of 86. As her son Douglas had died of pernicious anaemia at the age of 29 in 1910, and her only grandchild, Margaret Isabel Sheppard, had died of tuberculosis at the age of 19 in 1930, Sheppard left no living direct descendants. She was buried at Addington Cemetery, Christchurch, in a grave with her mother and her brother Robert. Commemoration WCTU Sheppard is considered to be an important figure in New Zealand's history. Since 1992 her profile has featured on the New Zealand ten-dollar note. A 2005 television show New Zealand's Top 100 History Makers ranked Sheppard as the second most influential New Zealander of all time. Similarly, The New Zealand Herald selected Sheppard as one of their ten greatest New Zealanders in 2013. In 1972, Patricia Grimshaw's book Women's Suffrage in New Zealand identified Sheppard as the leading figure of the suffrage movement. This was the first acclaimed book to do so and its publication marked a growth in recognition of Kate Sheppard's life and activism. In 1993, the centenary of women's suffrage in New Zealand, a group of Christchurch women established two memorials to Sheppard: the Kate Sheppard National Memorial, on the banks of the Avon River, and the Kate Sheppard Memorial Trust Award, an annual award to women in research. That year a special paeony-style white camellia was created at Camellia Glen Nurseries in Kaupokonui, Taranaki; white camellias were a symbol of the suffragists. It was named after Kate Sheppard and planted extensively throughout New Zealand. The Fendalton house at 83 Clyde Road, where the Sheppards lived from 1888 to 1902 and now known as the Kate Sheppard House, is registered by Heritage New Zealand as a Category I heritage building, in view of the many events relevant to women's suffrage which happened there. It was here that Sheppard pasted together the three main petitions onto sheets of wallpaper. Kate Sheppard House came into government ownership in 2019. New Zealand playwright Mervyn Thompson wrote the play O! Temperance! about Sheppard and the temperance movement. It was first performed in 1972 at Christchurch's Court Theatre. In 2016 and 2017, the production That Bloody Woman, which re-imagined Kate Sheppard's life as a punk rock musical, toured New Zealand. Sheppard on a pedestrian signal outside the Parliament Buildings in Wellington Kate Sheppard Place, located within Wellington's parliament precinct, is named in her honour; it is a short one-way street running from Molesworth Street opposite Parliament House to the intersection of Mulgrave Street and Thorndon Quay. There is a Kate Sheppard Avenue in the Auckland suburb of Northcross. In 2014, eight intersections near Parliament in Wellington were fitted with green pedestrian lights depicting Kate Sheppard. Several New Zealand schools have houses named after Sheppard. In 2014, Whangarei Girls' High School renamed a house that was named after Richard Seddon, an opponent of women's suffrage, to Sheppard House at the request of a student. On 8 March 2018, coinciding with International Women's Day and in celebration of the 125th anniversary of the women's suffrage movement, New Zealand Football renamed its premier women's knockout association football tournament the Kate Sheppard Cup.

They are viruses that represent a large family of small, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses with a 30-nm icosahedral capsid. The viruses in this family can cause a range of diseases including the common cold, poliomyelitis, meningitis, hepatitis, and paralysis. Picornaviruses constitute the family Picornaviridae, order Picornavirales, and realm Riboviria. There are currently 110 species in this family, divided among 47 genera. Notable examples are genera Enterovirus (including Rhinovirus and Poliovirus), Aphthovirus, Cardiovirus, and Hepatovirus.  Etymology  The name \\"picornavirus\\" has a dual etymology. Firstly, the name derives from picorna- which is an acronym for \\"poliovirus, insensitivity to ether, coxsackievirus, orphan virus, rhinovirus, and ribonucleic acid\\". Secondly, the name derives from pico-, which designates a very small unit of measurement (equivalent to 10‚àí12), combined with rna to describe this group of very small RNA viruses.  History  The first animal virus discovered (1897) was the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). It is the prototypic member of the genus Aphthovirus in the Picornaviridae family. The plaque assay was developed using poliovirus; the discovery of viral replication in culture was also with poliovirus in 1949. This was the first time that infection virus had been produced from molecular building blocks in the cells. Polyprotein synthesis, internal ribosome entry sites, and uncapped mRNA were all discovered by studying poliovirus infected cells, and a poliovirus clone was the first infectious DNA clone made of an RNA virus in animals. Along with rhinovirus, poliovirus was the first animal virus to have its structure determined by x-ray crystallography. RNA dependent RNA polymerase was discovered in Mengovirus, a genus of picornaviruses.  Virology = Structure  FMDV structural proteins VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4 form the biological protomer and icosahedral capsid. Picornaviruses are non- enveloped, with an icosahedral capsid. The capsid is an arrangement of 60 protomers in a tightly packed icosahedral structure. Each protomer consists of 4 polypeptides known as VP (viral protein) 1, 2, 3 and 4. VP2 and VP4 polypeptides originate from one protomer known as VP0 that is cleaved to give the different capsid components. The icosahedral is said to have a triangulation number of 3, this means that in the icosahedral structure each of the 60 triangles that make up the capsid are split into 3 little triangles with a subunit on the corner. In many picornaviruses have a deep cleft formed by around each of the 12 vertices of icosahedrons.The outer surface of the capsid is composed of regions of VP1, VP2 and VP3. Around each of the vertices is a canyon lined with the C termini of VP1 and VP3. The interior surface of the capsid is composed of VP4 and the N termini of VP1. J.Esposito and Professor Freederick A. Murphy demonstrates cleft structure referred to as canyons, using X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy. Depending on the type and degree of dehydration the viral particle is around 30‚Äì32 nm in diameter. The viral genome is around 2500 nm in length so we can therefore conclude that it must be tightly packaged within the capsid along with substances such as sodium ions in order to cancel out the negative charges on the RNA caused by the phosphate groups. Genome Genome organization and proteins of enteroviruses and aphthoviruses Picornaviruses are classed under Baltimore's viral classification system as group IV viruses as they contain a single stranded, positive sense RNA genome. Their genome ranges between 6.7 and 10.1 (kilobases) in length. Like most positive sense RNA genomes, the genetic material alone is infectious; although substantially less virulent than if contained within the viral particle, the RNA can have increased infectivity when transfected into cells. The genome RNA is unusual because it has a protein on the 5' end that is used as a primer for transcription by RNA polymerase.This primer is called VPg genome range between 2‚Äì3 kb. VPg contain tyrosine residue at the 3‚Äô end. Tyrosine as a ‚ÄìOH source for covalently linked to 5‚Äô end of RNA. The genome is non-segmented and positive-sense (the same sense as mammalian mRNA, being read 5' to 3'). Unlike mammalian mRNA picornaviruses do not have a 5' cap but a virally encoded protein known as VPg. However, like mammalian mRNA, the genome does have a poly(A) tail at the 3' end. There is an un-translated region (UTR) at both ends of the picornavirus genome. The 5' UTR is usually longer, being around 500‚Äì1200 nucleotides (nt) in length, compared to that of the 3' UTR, which is around 30‚Äì650 nt. It is thought that the 5' UTR is important in translation and the 3' in negative strand synthesis; however the 5' end may also have a role to play in virulence of the virus. The rest of the genome encodes structural proteins at the 5' end and non-structural proteins at the 3' end in a single polyprotein. The polyprotein is organised as follows: L-1ABCD-2ABC-3ABCD with each letter representing a protein; however, there are variations to this layout. The 1A, 1B, 1C, and 1D proteins are the capsid proteins VP4, VP2, VP3, and VP1, respectively. Virus-coded proteases perform the cleavages, some of which are intramolecular. The polyprotein is first cut to yield P1, P2 and P3. P1 becomes myristylated at the N terminus before being cleaved to VP0, VP3 and VP1, the proteins that will form procapsids; VP0 will later be cleaved to produce VP2 and VP4. Other cleavage products include 3B (VPg), 2C (an ATPase) and 3D (the RNA polymerase).  Replication  RNA elements = Foot- and-mouth disease virus genome and RNA structural elements Genomic RNAs of picornaviruses possess multiple RNA elements and they are required for both negative and plus strand RNA synthesis. The cis acting replication(cre) element is required for replication. The stem-loop-structure that contains the cre is independent of position but changes with location between virus types when it has been identified. Also, the 3‚Äô end elements of viral RNA are significant and efficient for RNA replication of picornaviruses. The 3‚Äô end of picornavirus contains poly(A) tract which be required for infectivity. On the other hand, RNA synthesis is hypothesized to occur in this region.3‚Äô end NCR of poliovirus is not necessary for negative-strands synthesis. However, it is important element for positive‚Äîstrand synthesis. Additionally,5‚Äô end NCR that contain secondary structural elements is required for RNA replication and poliovirus translation initiation(IRES). Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES) are RNA structures that allow cap independent initiation of translation, and are able to initiate translation in the middle of a messenger RNA. = Life cycle = Picornavirus life cycle The viral particle binds to cell surface receptors. Cell surface receptors are characterized for each serotype of picornaviruses. For example, poliovirus receptor is glycoprotein CD155 which is special receptor for human and some other primate species. For this reason, poliovirus could not be made in many laboratories until transgenic mice having a CD155 receptor on their cell surface were developed in the 1990s. These animals can be infected and used for studies of replication and pathogenesis. Binding causes a conformational change in the viral capsid proteins, and myristic acid are released. These acids form a pore in the cell membrane through which RNA is injected . Once inside the cell, the RNA un-coats and the (+) strand RNA genome is replicated through a double-stranded RNA intermediate that is formed using viral RDRP (RNA-Dependent RNA polymerase). Translation by host cell ribosomes is not initiated by a 5' G cap as usual, but rather is initiated by an IRES (Internal Ribosome Entry Site). The viral life cycle is very rapid with the whole process of replication being completed on average within 8 hours. However, as little as 30 minutes after initial infection, cell protein synthesis declines to almost zero output ‚Äì essentially the macromolecular synthesis of cell proteins is shut off. Over the next 1‚Äì2 hours there is a loss of margination of chromatin and homogeneity in the nucleus, before the viral proteins start to be synthesized and a vacuole appears in the cytoplasm close to the nucleus that gradually starts to spread as the time after infection reaches around 3 hours. After this time the cell plasma membrane becomes permeable, at 4‚Äì6 hours the virus particles assemble, and can sometimes be seen in the cytoplasm. At around 8 hours the cell is effectively dead and lyses to release the viral particles. Experimental data from single step growth-curve-like experiments have allowed scientists to look at the replication of the picornaviruses in great detail. The whole of replication occurs within the host cell cytoplasm and infection can even happen in cells that do not contain a nucleus (known as enucleated cells) and those treated with actinomycin D (this antibiotic would inhibit viral replication if this occurred in the nucleus.) Translation takes place by -1 ribosomal frameshifting, viral initiation, and ribosomal skipping. The virus exits the host cell by lysis, and viroporins. Vertebrates serve as the natural host. Transmission routes are fecal-oral, contact, ingestion, and air borne particles. = Viral protein (VPg) = Picornaviruses have a viral protein (VPg) covalently linked to 5‚Äô end of their genomes instead of 7-methylguanosine cap like cellular mRNAs. Virus RNA polymerases use VPg as primer. VPg as primer uses both minus and plus strand RNA synthesis. Picornavirus replication is initiated by the uridylylation of viral protein genome-linked (VPg).It is uridylylated at the hydroxyl group of a tyrosine residue. A VPg primer mechanism is utilized by the picornavirus (entero- aphtho- and others), additional virus groups (poty-, como-, calici- and others) and picornavirus-like (coronavirus, notavirus, etc.) supergroup of RNA viruses. The mechanism has been best studied for the enteroviruses (which include many human pathogens, such as poliovirus and coxsackie viruses) as well as for the aphthovirus, an animal pathogen causing foot and mouth disease (FMDV). In this group, primer-dependent RNA synthesis utilizes a small 22‚Äì25 amino acid long viral protein linked to the genome (VPg) to initiate polymerase activity, where the primer is covalently bound to the 5‚Äô end of the RNA template. The uridylylation occurs at a tyrosine residue at the third position of the VPg. A cis-acting replication element (CRE), which is a RNA stem loop structure, serves as a template for the uridylylation of VPg, resulting in the synthesis of VPgpUpUOH. Mutations within the CRE-RNA structure prevent VPg uridylylation, and mutations within the VPg sequence can severely diminish RdRp catalytic activity. While the tyrosine hydroxyl of VPg can prime negative-strand RNA synthesis in a CRE- and VPgpUpUOH-independent manner, CRE-dependent VPgpUpUOH synthesis is absolutely required for positive- strand RNA synthesis. CRE-dependent VPg uridylylation lowers the Km¬¨ of UTP required for viral RNA replication and CRE-dependent VPgpUpUOH synthesis, and is required for efficient negative-strand RNA synthesis, especially when UTP concentrations are limiting. The VPgpUpUOH primer is transferred to the 3‚Äô end of the RNA template for elongation, which can continue by addition of nucleotide bases by RdRp. Partial crystal structures for VPgs of foot and mouth disease virus and coxsackie virus B3 suggest that there may be two sites on the viral polymerase for the small VPgs of the picornaviruses. NMR solution structures of poliovirus VPg and VPgpU show that uridylylation stabilizes the structure of the VPg, which is otherwise quite flexible in solution. The second site may be used for uridylylation,v after which the VPgpU can initiate RNA synthesis. The VPg primers of caliciviruses, whose structures are only beginning to be revealed, are much larger than those of the picornaviruses. Mechanisms for uridylylation and priming may be quite different in all of these groups. VPg uridylylation may include the use of precursor proteins, allowing for the determination of a possible mechanism for the location of the diuridylylated, VPg-containing precursor at the 3‚Äô end of plus- or minus- strand RNA for production of full-length RNA. Determinants of VPg uridylylation efficiency suggest formation and/or collapse or release of the uridylylated product as the rate-limiting step in vitro depending upon the VPg donor employed. Precursor proteins also have an effect on VPg-CRE specificity and stability. The upper RNA stem loop, to which VPg binds, has a significant impact on both retention, and recruitment, of VPg and Pol. The stem loop of CRE will partially unwind, allowing the precursor components to bind and recruit VPg and Pol4. The CRE loop has a defined consensus sequence to which the initiation components bind, however; there is no consensus sequence for the supporting stem, which suggests that only the structural stability of the CRE is important. Assembly and organization of the picornavirus VPg ribonucleoprotein complex. * Step 1: Two 3CD (VPg complex) molecules bind to CRE with the 3C domains (VPg domain) contacting the upper stem and the 3D domains (VPg domain) contacting the lower stem. * Step 2: The 3C dimer opens the RNA stem by forming a more stable interaction with single strands forming the stem. * Step 3: 3Dpol is recruited to and retained in this complex by a physical interaction between the back of the thumb subdomain of 3Dpol and a surface of one or both 3C subdomains of 3CD. VPg may also play an important role in specific recognition of viral genome by movement protein (MP). Movement proteins are non-structural proteins encoded by many, if not all, plant viruses to enable their movement from one infected cell to neighboring cells. MP and VPg interact to provide specificity for the transport of viral RNA from cell to cell. To fulfill energy requirements, MP also interacts with P10, which is a cellular ATPase. Diseases Picornaviruses cause a range of diseases. Enteroviruses of the picornavirus family infect the enteric tract, which is reflected in their name. On the other hand, rhinoviruses infect primarily the nose and the throat. Enteroviruses replicate at 37 ¬∞C, whereas rhinoviruses grow better at 33 ¬∞C, as this is the lower temperature of the nose. Enteroviruses are stable under acidic conditions and thus they are able to survive exposure to gastric acid.

It was pioneered and popularized by the band Kassav' in the early 1980s. Zouk was originally characterized by a fast tempo (120‚Äì145 bpm), a percussion-driven rhythm and a loud horn section. In the second half of the 1980s, some bands began to play a slower (90‚Äì100 bpm), more romantic style which was dubbed zouk-love. The original faster style became known as \\"zouk b√©ton\\", \\"zouk chir√©\\" or \\"zouk hard\\". Zouk is considered a synthesis of various French Antillean dance music styles of the 20th century: kadans, konpa and biguine.  Styles  The 1990s was the confirmation of the success of zouk in the Caribbean, leading to the development of many styles. The progressive disappearance of brass instruments and the slow-down of the tempo made zouk-loke the most popular zouk subgenre in the 1990s and ever since. However, variants of zouk exist, often by incorporating elements from other genres. These include the following: * Zouk-love (Patrick Saint-Eloi, Real limit, ...) * Zouk-R&B; (Jean-Michel Rotin, ...) * Zouk-Africain (Oliver Ngoma, Monique Seka, ...) * Zouk-Rock (Volt-Face, Gilles Floro, ...) * Zouk- Compas (Kwak, Harmonik, ...) * Zouk-Chir√© (Fr√©d√©ric Caracas, Luc Leandry, ...) * Zouk-Gwoka (Sartana, Dominique Coco, ...) * Zouk-Symphonique (Dissonance, ...) * Zouk-Ragga (Shango, ...)

It is a picornavirus, the prototypical member of the genus Aphthovirus. The disease, which causes vesicles (blisters) in the mouth and feet of bovids, suids, ovids, caprids and other cloven-hoofed animals is highly infectious and a major plague of animal farming.  Structure and genome  Genome organization and structure of foot-and-mouth disease virus The virus particle (25-30 nm) has an icosahedral capsid made of protein, without envelope, containing a positive-sense (mRNA sense) single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) genome.  Replication  When the virus comes in contact with the membrane of a host cell, it binds to a receptor site and triggers a folding-in of the membrane. Once the virus is inside the host cell, the capsid dissolves, and the RNA gets replicated, and translated into viral proteins by the cell's ribosomes using a cap-independent mechanism driven by the internal ribosome entry site element. The synthesis of viral proteins include 2A 'cleavage' during translation. They include proteases that inhibit the synthesis of normal cell proteins, and other proteins that interact with different components of the host cell. The infected cell ends up producing large quantities of viral RNA and capsid proteins, which are assembled to form new viruses. After assembly, the host cell lyses (bursts) and releases the new viruses. Recombination Recombination can occur within host cells during co-infections by different FMDV strains.Ferretti L, Di Nardo A, Singer B, Lasecka-Dykes L, Logan G, Wright CF, P√©rez-Mart√≠n E, King DP, Tuthill TJ, Ribeca P.

A wedding dress or bridal gown is the dress worn by the bride during a wedding ceremony. The color, style and ceremonial importance of the gown can depend on the religion and culture of the wedding participants. In Western cultures, the wedding dress is most commonly white, which fashion was made popular by Queen Victoria when she married in 1840. In eastern cultures, brides often choose red to symbolize auspiciousness. Western culture Wedding dress from 1891 The woman to the far right is wearing a typical wedding dress from 1929. Until the late 1960s, wedding dresses reflected the styles of the day. From that time onward, wedding dresses have often been based on Victorian styles. Weddings performed during and immediately following the Middle Ages were often more than just a union between two people. They could be a union between two families, two businesses or even two countries. Many weddings were more a matter of politics than love, particularly among the nobility and the higher social classes. Brides were therefore expected to dress in a manner that cast their families in the most favorable light and befitted their social status, for they were not representing only themselves during the ceremony. Brides from wealthy families often wore rich colors and exclusive fabrics. It was common to see them wearing bold colors and layers of furs, velvet and silk. Brides dressed in the height of current fashion, with the richest materials their families' money could buy. The poorest of brides wore their best church dress on their wedding day. The amount and the price of material a wedding dress contained was a reflection of the bride's social standing and indicated the extent of the family's wealth to wedding guests. Color of wedding dresses The first documented instance of a princess who wore a white wedding dress for a royal wedding ceremony is that of Philippa of England, who wore a tunic with a cloak in white silk bordered with squirrel and ermine in 1406, when she married Eric of Pomerania. Mary, Queen of Scots, wore a white wedding dress in 1559 when she married her first husband, Francis, the Dauphin of France, because it was her favorite color, although white was then the color of mourning for French Queens. This was not a widespread trend, however: prior to the Victorian era, a bride was married in any color, black being especially popular in Scandinavia. White became a popular option in 1840, after the marriage of Queen Victoria to Albert of Saxe-Coburg, when Victoria wore a white gown trimmed with Honiton lace. Illustrations of the wedding were widely published, and many brides opted for white in accordance with the Queen's choice. Even after that, for a period, wedding dresses were adapted to the styles of the day. In the early 1900s, clothing included a lot of decorations, such as lace or frills. This was also adopted in wedding dresses, where decorative frills and lace was common. For example, in the 1920s, they were typically short in the front with a longer train in the back and were worn with cloche-style wedding veils. This tendency to follow current fashions continued until the late 1960s, when it became popular to revert to long, full-skirted designs reminiscent of the Victorian era. Today, Western wedding dresses are usually white, though \\"wedding white\\" includes shades such as eggshell, ecru and ivory. Later, many people assumed that the color white was intended to symbolize virginity, though this was not the original intention: it was the color blue that was connected to purity, piety, faithfulness, and the Virgin Mary. White is not the universal colour of wedding dresses. In Mexico, for example, red is a popular colour. Current fashion A bride in a contemporary version of the traditional long white wedding dress with train, tiara and white veil. Today, about 75% of wedding dresses on the market are sleeveless and strapless, though some brides may prefer more modest styles with sleeves, higher necklines, and covered backs. Most of today's wedding dresses have either lace-up backs or zipper backs. Wedding dresses can also be long or short, depending on the type of wedding. =Silhouettes= Some of the most popular contemporary silhouettes include: A-line, ballgown, empire, mermaid, tea-length, and trumpet. ;A-line A-line Wedding Dresses :A dress or skirt silhouette that is narrower at the top, flaring gently wider toward the bottom thereby resembling the letter A. Works well on most figure types; good for disguising bottom-heavy figures. ;Ballgown :Characterized by a very full skirt that begins at the waist and continues to floor length. It has a full bodice and a cinched waistline that falls into a full skirt. ;Empire :A type of dress or top where the waist line is raised above the natural waistline, sometimes as high as right below the bust. ;Mermaid :The mermaid dress is close fitting through the bodice, down through the hips and to below the knees where the skirt flares out. ;Mini :A dress with a hemline that hits the center of the thigh. ;Tea-length :Can resemble a cocktail-style dress that shows off the lower legs and bridal shoes. ;Trumpet :A straight skirt with a hem flounce that flares away from the body at the hem. =Necklines= Popular contemporary necklines types include: asymmetric, bateau, halter, jewel, off- the-shoulder, portrait, scoop, sheer, square, strapless, sweetheart, and v-neck. The neckline refers to the shape of the material at the top of the dress as it falls on the neck and shoulders. ;Asymmetric :Asymmetrical by its very definition means there is no symmetry or no balance. So this neckline appears different on either side of the centre front. ;Bateau :Also known as the \\"Boatneck\\". This is a wide, high neckline that follows the curve of the collarbone and ends in points on the shoulder seams. ;Halter :Necklines have a high panel on the front, which is then tied around the neck for support and, optionally, may be tied behind the neck or include a clasp, exposing the back and shoulders. ;Jewel :A plain, slightly rounded neckline without a collar. Also known as the T-shirt neckline, the jewel neckline is round and sits at the base of the throat. ;Off-the-shoulder :This neckline sits below the shoulders, with sleeve-like straps that cover part of the upper arm. Shows off your collarbone and shoulders. ;Portrait :Characterised by a wide, soft scoop from shoulder to shoulder. ;Scoop :Also known as a \\"ballerina neckline\\", this U-shaped style is often cut low, and occasionally the scoop will continue on the back of the dress. ;Sheer :A neckline that is created by \\"sheer\\" or translucent fabric, such as lace or netting, rather than an opaque material or strap. ;Spaghetti strap :This neckline is nearly strapless, except for the presence of thin, delicate straps; a bit like strings of spaghetti. ;Square :The neckline is cut straight across the top in between the straps, creating a \\"square\\"-like shape to the top of the dress. ;Strapless :A neckline that can be any shape, but is discerned by its lack of straps (neither over the shoulder, nor around the neck). ;Sweetheart :A neckline with a plunge in the front in the shape of the top of a heart. ;V-neck :A neckline characterized by a plunge in the front shaped like the letter \\"V\\". =Gown length= ;Ankle :Characterized by a hemline that hits at the ankle. ;Floor :Characterized by a hemline that hits the floor. ;Mini :Characterized by a hemline that hits the center of the thigh. ;Tea :Characterized by a skirt length that falls between the knee and ankle. ;Train :Characterized by a skirt length or attached and/or detachable train that can be several feet long. Eastern culture Many wedding dresses in China, India (wedding sari), Pakistan (heavily embroidered shalwar qameez or lehngas) are red; the traditional colour representing good luck and auspiciousness. Vietnam wedding dresses (in the traditional form of √°o t·∫•c the ancient Ao dai) were blue, dark blue. Nowadays, many women choose other colours besides red. In modern mainland Chinese weddings, the bride may opt for Western dresses of any colour, and don a traditional costume for the wedding tea ceremony.Qing dynasty styled traditional Chinese wedding dress with phoenix crown (È≥≥ÂÜ†) headpiece still used in modern Taiwanese weddings. In modern Taiwanese weddings, the bride generally picks red (following Chinese tradition) or white (more Western) silk for the wedding gown material, but most will wear the red traditional garment for their formal wedding banquets. Traditionally, the father of the bride is responsible for the wedding banquet hosted on the bride's side and the alcohol (specifically called \\"xi-jiu,\\" confusingly the same as what the wedding banquet itself is called) consumed during both banquets. While the wedding itself is often based on the couple's choices, the wedding banquets are a symbolic gesture of \\"thanks\\" and appreciation, to those that have raised the bride and groom (such as grandparents and uncles) and those who will continue to be there to help the bride and groom in the future. Thus out of respect for the elders, wedding banquets are usually done formally and traditionally. Red wedding saris are the traditional garment choice for brides in Indian culture. Sari fabric is also traditionally silk. Over time, colour options and fabric choices for Indian brides have expanded. Today fabrics like crepe, Georgette, charmeuse, and satin are used, and colors have been expanded to include gold, pink, orange, maroon, brown, and yellow as well. Indian brides in Western countries often wear the sari at the wedding ceremony and change into traditional Indian wear afterwards (lehnga, choli, etc.). Japanese formal wedding dress still used today. A Japanese wedding usually involves a traditional pure white kimono for the formal ceremony, symbolizing purity and maidenhood. The bride may change into a red kimono for the events after the ceremony for good luck. The Javanese people of Indonesia wear a kebaya, a traditional kind of blouse, along with batik. In the Philippines, variations of the Baro't saya adapted to the white wedding tradition are considered to be wedding attire for women, along with the Barong Tagalog for men. Various tribes and Muslim Filipinos don other forms of traditional dress during their respective ceremonies.  Native American culture  Apache bride The indigenous peoples of the Americas have varying traditions related to weddings and thus wedding dresses. A Hopi bride traditionally had her garments woven by the groom and any men in the village who wished to participate. The garments consisted of a large belt, two all- white wedding robes, a white wedding robe with red stripes at top and bottom, white buckskin leggings and moccasins, a string for tying the hair, and a reed mat in which to wrap the outfit. This outfit also served as a shroud, since these garments would be necessary for the trip through the underworld. A Pueblo bride wore a cotton garment tied above the right shoulder, secured with a belt around the waist. In the traditions of the Delaware, a bride wore a knee-length skirt of deerskin and a band of wampum beads around her forehead. Except for fine beads or shell necklaces, the body was bare from the waist up. If it was a winter wedding, she wore deerskin leggings and moccasins and a robe of turkey feathers. Her face was painted with white, red and yellow clay. The tribes of Northern California (which include the Klamath, the Modoc and the Yurok) had a traditional bridal dress woven in symbolic colors: white for the east, blue for the south, yellow (orange) for the west; and black for the north. Turquoise and silver jewelry were worn by both the bride and the groom in addition to a silver concho belt. Jewelry was considered a shield against evils including hunger, poverty and bad luck.

In a split from the development of the Mitsubishi J8M and Mitsubishi Ki-200, the IJA instructed Rikugun to develop a new design based on the Me 163, independent of the IJN's J8M. A fundamental shortcoming of the Me 163, and all other aircraft based on it, was extremely limited endurance, typically only a few minutes. The Imperial Japanese Navy proposed to improve the endurance of the J8M1 by producing a version with only one cannon, thereby saving weight and space for more fuel (the J8M2). The Army, on the other hand, opted to keep both cannon, but enlarge the airframe to accommodate larger tanks, resulting in the Ki-202, which was to have been the definitive Army version of the fighter.

Zouk was ranked as number 10 on DJ Magazine's list of Top 100 clubs in the world in 2006, 2007 and 2010. In 2017, Zouk Singapore earned its highest ranking yet at number 3, the top entry for clubs across Asia. In September 2015, one of its founders, Lincoln Cheng, sold the rights of the Zouk brand to Genting Hong Kong, an affiliate of the Genting Singapore. The brand and its business was valued at S$40 million by financial audit firm Ernst & Young in 2013. On 1 September 2020, Genting Hong Kong sold Zouk for S$14 million to Tulipa, a firm owned by Lim Keong Hui, the former deputy CEO of Genting Hong Kong and the son of Genting Hong Kong CEO and chairman Lim Kok Thay.

As a result, only one round of ammunition is fired each time the trigger is pulled, as the pistol's fire control group disconnects the trigger mechanism from the firing pin/striker until the trigger has been released and reset. Additional terms sometimes used as synonyms for a semi-automatic pistol are self-loading pistol, autopistol, and autoloading pistol. The term automatic pistol is sometimes also used, though it typically refers to a fully automatic pistol. A semi-automatic pistol recycles part of the energy released by the propellant combustion to move its bolt, which is usually housed inside the slide. After a round of ammunition is fired, the spent cartridge casing is extracted and ejected as the slide/bolt moves rearwards under recoil, the hammer/striker is cocked by the slide/bolt movement, and a new round from the magazine is pushed into the chamber when the slide/bolt returns forward under spring tension. This sets up the following shot, which is fired as soon as the trigger is pulled again. Most pistols use a short recoil operation to perform this, but some pistols use simple blowback or gas operation mechanisms. Most types of semi-automatic pistols rely on a removable box magazine to provide ammunition, which is usually inserted into the grip. However, some pistols are based on receiver-style designs similar to existing semi-automatic rifles, and thus have the magazine inserted separately from the grip. Terminology The language surrounding \\"automatic\\", \\"semi-automatic\\", \\"self-loading\\", etc., often causes confusion due to differences in technical usage between different countries and differences in popular usage. For example, the term \\"automatic pistol\\" technically refers to a fully automatic machine pistol, which is capable of continuously firing multiple rounds with a single pull of the trigger, although in popular American usage it is also used as a synonym for any self-loading pistol, the vast majority of which are semi-automatic. In colloquial usage, because machine pistols are very rare on the market, an \\"automatic pistol\\", a \\"semi-automatic pistol\\" or a \\"self-loading pistol\\" usually all imply a semi-automatic handgun that is fed by a removable magazine, which discharges one round for each trigger pull. Operation Semi-automatic pistols use one firing chamber that remains fixed in a constant linear position relative to the gun barrel. In contrast, although double- action revolvers can also be fired semiautomatically, their rounds are not fired from a single chamber, but rather are fired from each of the chambers that are rotated into linear alignment with the barrel's position in turn just prior for each shot fired. Typically, the first round is manually loaded into the chamber by pulling back and releasing the slide mechanism. After the trigger is pulled and the round is fired, the recoil operation of the handgun automatically extracts and ejects the shell casing and reloads the chamber. This mode of operation generally allows for faster reloading and storing a larger number of cartridges than a revolver. Diagram showing a simple blowback action Some modern semi-automatic pistols are double-action only (DA or DAO); that is, once a round is chambered, each trigger pull cocks the hammer, striker, or firing pin, and additionally releases the same to fire a cartridge in one continuous motion. Each pull of the trigger on a DAO semi-automatic pistol requires the same amount of pressure. The Kel-Tec P-32 is an example of a DAO action. DAO semi-automatic pistols are most generally recommended only in the smaller, self-defense, concealable pistols, rather than in target or hunting pistols. A notable exception is Glock-brand pistols which optimize preset triggers (similar to DAO), but the striker is partially cocked back as the slide closes. This allows for significantly shorter trigger pulls than DAO. The trigger spring can be replaced with a lighter one and paired with a low-strength sear connector resulting in lightened trigger pulls to improve a shooter's accuracy (like models G34 and G35). Smith & Wesson CS45 double- action/single-action .45 ACP semi-automatic compact pistol Standard modern semi-automatic pistols are usually double-action (DA), also sometimes known as double-action/single-action (DA/SA). In this design, the hammer or striker may be either thumb-cocked or activated by pulling the trigger when firing the first shot. The hammer or striker is recocked automatically during each firing cycle. In double-action pistols, the first pull of the trigger requires roughly twice as much pressure as subsequent firings, since the first pull of the trigger also cocks the hammer (if not already cocked by hand). The Beretta 92F/FS, a full-sized, service, semi-automatic pistol is an example of this style of action. A common mode of carry for DA semi-automatic pistols is with the magazine full, a round chambered, and the gun holstered and uncocked with the external safety unengaged or off. The Taurus PT145 is an example of a DA/SA weapon, as it has no decocker and thus has its striker primed from the moment of chambering and only enters double-action mode if a round fails to fire upon the pin's impact; at other times, it operates as a single-action striker fired firearm. In contrast, a single-action (SA) semi-automatic pistol must be cocked by first operating the slide or bolt, or, if a round is already chambered, by cocking the hammer manually. The famed Colt M1911 is an example of this style of action. All SA semi-automatic pistols exhibit this feature, and automatically cock the hammer when the slide is first \\"racked\\" to chamber a round. A round can also be manually inserted in the chamber with the slide locked back. Then the safety can be applied. It is generally not a good idea to load a round manually as this can cause excessive wear on the extractor as semi-automatic firearms were designed to have cartridges loaded from the bottom via the magazine. Cocking modes The normal mode of carrying an SA semi-automatic pistol is condition 1, popularly known as cocked and locked. Condition 1 (a term popularized by Jeff Cooper) refers to having the magazine full, a round chambered, the hammer fully cocked, and the thumb safety engaged or on, at least for right-handed users. For many single-action, semi-automatic pistols, this procedure works well only for right-handed users, as the thumb safety is located on the left side of pistol and is easily accessible only for those who are holding the pistol in the right hand. Many modern SA semi- automatic pistols have had their safety mechanisms redesigned to provide a thumb safety on both sides of the pistol (ambidextrous), thereby better meeting the needs of left-handed, as well as right-handed users. Many SA semi- automatic pistols have a hammer position known as \\"half-cocked\\". Squeezing the trigger will not fire the gun when it is in the half-cocked position, and neither will dropping the gun in this state cause an accidental discharge. During WWII in the Pacific Theater, an unofficial and unapproved carry mode for the SA M1911 by left-handed US soldiers in combat was carrying the gun with the magazine full, a round chambered, the action in half-cocked position, and the thumb safety (accessible only to right-handed users) positioned in the off (or ready-to-fire) mode. The primary advantage of the half-cocked position versus the uncocked position in that particular scenario was added sound suppression (of the click of the weapon being cocked). A secondary advantage was the avoidance of accidental discharges if the gun were accidentally dropped. The half cock was revised by Colt in the 1970s and subsequently other manufacturers ‚Äì the hammer will fall from half cock if the trigger is pulled on most newer 1911 type guns. Technology A self-loading pistol reloads the chamber with a new round automatically each time the weapon is fired, without additional action being required by the user. For a semi-automatic pistol, this is typically accomplished by recoil operation. In a machine pistol, in contrast, this can be accomplished by blowback, or, less commonly, by gas operation, harnessing gases produced when the gun is fired. The Desert Eagle is a rare example of a semi-automatic pistol that siphons off some of the gases instead of relying on short recoil operation. A revolver, which uses multiple chambers and a single barrel, and a derringer, which uses multiple chambers and multiple barrels, also fire one round per trigger pull, but achieve this in different ways and as such are not classified as being semi- automatic. A semi-automatic pistol will fire only one shot per trigger pull, in contrast to a \\"fully automatic\\" or machine pistol, which continues to fire as long as the trigger is held or until all rounds have been fired. The Mauser M712 Schnellfeuer (German for \\"rapid fire\\"), a modified Mauser C96 pistol, is a notable example of a true machine pistol. While both types of weapons operate on the same principles, fully automatic weapons must be built more ruggedly to accommodate the heat and stress caused by rapid firing, and it can be difficult (and illegal in most countries) to convert a semi-automatic pistol into a fully automatic mode of fire. A selective-fire action pistol, though, can be converted back and forth by means of a switch, and often includes a burst mode, typically for a three-round burst with each trigger pull. Selective-fire weapons are generally used by specialized law enforcement and security personnel such as SWAT teams, hostage rescue teams, antiterrorist units, or government bodyguards for heads of state. In the United States, selective-fire weapons are not available to civilians unless they live in a state that allows civilian ownership of National Firearms Act or Title II weapons. Actions: blowback versus locked breech Self-loading automatic pistols can be divided into \\"blowback\\" and \\"locked breech\\" categories according to their principle of operation. The blowback operating principle is suitable for smaller, lower-powered calibers, such as .32 ACP and .380 ACP, as the resistance of the recoil spring and mass of the slide are sufficient to retard the opening of the breech until the projectile has left the barrel, and breech pressure has dropped to a safe level. For more powerful calibers such as the 9 mm Parabellum (9 mm) and .45 ACP, some form of locked breech is needed to retard breech opening, as an unlocked blowback pistol in these calibers requires a very heavy slide and stiff spring, making them bulky, heavy, and difficult to operate. A somewhat commercially successful blowback pistol design in the more powerful calibers was produced; the Spanish Astra 400 in 9 mm Largo and the similar Astra 600 in 9 mm Parabellum. U.S. manufacturer Hi-Point also produces a line of blowback-operated pistols in several calibers, including 9 mm and .45 ACP. Virtually all other service- caliber pistols are locked-breech designs.  History  After Hiram Maxim introduced his recoil-powered machine gun in 1883, several gunsmiths set out to apply the same principles to handguns, including Maxim. Maxim's designs for smaller firearms using his recoil-powered ideas never went into production. In the 1880s, other designers worked on self-loading designs. The Salvator Dormus was the first semi-automatic pistol followed closely by the Sch√∂nberger- Laumann 1892. The first model to gain any commercial success was Hugo Borchardt's C-93, which, together with the 7.65 mm Borchardt cartridge, had been designed in 1893 and made its public debut in 1894. Borchardt based the principle of the C-93's mechanism in large part upon Maxim's toggle-lock. The C-93 featured a locking mechanism modeled after the human knee, which is called Kniegelenk in German (knee joint). The C-93 proved mechanically reliable, but was too large and bulky to receive widespread acceptance. Equipped with a screw-on wooden stock, the C-93 served well as a small pistol carbine. In 1896, Paul Mauser introduced the first model of his Mauser \\"Broomhandle\\" semi-automatic pistol, the C96. This was the first mass-produced and commercially successful pistol to have a large-capacity, staggered-column magazine holding 10 or 20 rounds. Its original cartridge was called 7.63 mm Mauser, which was more powerful but otherwise identical to the 7.65 mm Borchardt. The Mauser was one of the first self-loading pistols used extensively in battle, notably the South African War of 1899‚Äì1902. These pistols were made in 7.63 mm Mauser, or 9√ó25 mm Mauser, along with some models eventually being made in 9 mm Parabellum and a small number in .45 ACP for China. 1898 saw the Schwarzlose Model 1898, a semi-automatic pistol invented by Prussian firearm designer Andreas Wilhelm Schwarzlose. It was chambered for the 7.65√ó25mm Mauser,[1] but could also shoot the weaker Borchardt ammunition. The Schwarzlose design was most advanced and far ahead of its time, but not widely adopted with less than 1000 pieces being manufactured. Small lots were sold to members of the Russian Social-Democratic Party who were plotting insurrection, but were confiscated at the Russian border and issued to the Imperial Russian Frontier Guards. In Belgium in 1896 American gun designer John Browning developed self-loading semi-automatic pistols. His models were first manufactured in Europe by the Belgian firm of Fabrique Nationale (FN) and later by Colt in the U.S. Browning's first successful design was the Browning M1900. Like Georg Luger's work conducted around the same time in Germany, it was designed alongside a in 7.65 mm cartridge, but the 7.65 mm Browning (aka .32 Auto) differs substantially from Luger's 7.65 mm Parabellum. Browning went on to design .25, .38, .380, and .45 ACP cartridges for his semi-automatic pistol designs. Browning must be given credit for developing the type of locked-breech action which is commonly used by the vast majority of modern large caliber semi-automatic pistols. One of Browning's most enduring designs was the Colt M1911, which was adopted by the U.S. military as its service pistol and is still in active use with some U.S. Special Forces and Marine Corps units, albeit in modernized forms (the M45A1 Pistol is a prime example). Browning also co-designed the FN Browning Hi-Power, announced in 1922, during the last years of his life, working on this design until his death in 1926. This was a 9 mm Luger semi-automatic pistol capable of holding 13 rounds in the magazine (plus one chambered). A staggered magazine had already been realized in the Savage Model 1907 with 10-rounds of .32 ACP.Small Arms Encyclopedia, Amber Books Ltd., 2011, p. 89 This predates the filing of Browning's patent for the large-capacity 9 mm pistol [6-28-1923, issued as U.S. patent #1,618,510, dated 22 Feb. 1927] by some 18 years as the Savage was patented in 1905,Pistols of the World, Hogg, V. & Weeks, J., 1982. Whether the staggered magazine featured in the Savage 1905 was a focal point of the patent is unclear. In a review of the Browning patent dated 22 Feb. 1927, it is equally unclear if the staggered magazine is a primary or a dependent claim of the patent as issued. However, the existence of a staggered magazine in 1905 is indisputable, as many of these Savage pistols were produced and survive to this day. Browning could well have come into contact with this concept during the military trials of 1911, as a version of the Savage design in .45 cal was also under consideration alongside the Browning/Colt design. The next notable design was the 7.65 mm Luger by Georg Luger, which although successful in its function, nonetheless failed to have adequate stopping power and failed to win widespread acceptance. In 1902, Luger's subsequent and similar P08 in 9 mm Parabellum overcame the problem of inadequate stopping power and featured a greatly improved Borchardt-type Kniegelenk (\\"knee-joint\\") locking mechanism. Unlike Browning's locked-breech design, the barrel in a Kniegelenk design does not tip up and down while the gun is fired, thereby theoretically improving shooting accuracy. Luger's P.08 was adopted by the German military and served as their standard sidearm in World War I. During World War II, Germany was the first nation to adopt a double-action pistol, the Walther P38, which could be carried loaded (with a cartridge chambered) and ready to fire without the risk of an accidental discharge if dropped. The P38 also used Luger's 9 mm Parabellum cartridge. During World War II, revolvers were still issued by various major powers, but their use was decreasing. Though the British firm Webley & Scott had developed several adequate self-loading pistols, one of which was adopted by the (normally unarmed) British police in 1911 and by the Royal Navy and Royal Marines before the First World War, revolvers were generally preferred by most British military. In the Soviet Union, the TT pistol replaced the Nagant M1895 revolver during the war. In the United States, the M1911A1 was adopted as the standard military sidearm. Both Colt and Smith & Wesson produced revolvers chambered for the same .45 ACP ammunition used in the M1911A1, because of the great demand for handguns and the need to adopt a common cartridge for use in both semi-automatic pistols and revolvers. After World War II, most nations eventually adopted 9 mm Parabellum caliber pistols employing some variant of Browning's locked-breech design for their standard-issue military pistols. The most popular early choice was the FN Browning Hi-Power mentioned above; another popular model was the locked-breech Walther P38 because of its many safety features. , the U.S. military sidearm is a variant of the Beretta 92F/FS.

After the Second World War, the almost universal trend has been for semi-automatic pistols to replace revolvers for military use, although the transition has been slower in police and civilian use. , revolvers are mainly used in jurisdictions which permit their use for civilian self-defense, hunting, plinking, and target practice. Semi-automatic pistols are by far the most popular for concealed carry by civilians, primary handguns for police and military use, backup guns for police use, and where the usual five or six shots of a revolver are deemed inadequate.

Johnston of the Chickasaw Nation. Although not American Indian, he was appointed by Johnston as the Chickasaw delegate to the Convention for the proposed State of Sequoyah, and was later elected as a delegate to the 1906 constitutional convention for the proposed state of Oklahoma. Murray was elected as the first Speaker of the Oklahoma House of Representatives after statehood, as U.S. Representative, and as the ninth Governor of Oklahoma (1931‚Äì1935). During his tenure as governor in years of the Great Depression, he established a record for the number of times he used the National Guard to perform duties in the state and for declaring martial law. Early life and education William Henry Davis Murray was born in the town of Toadsuck, Texas (renamed \\"Collinsville\\" in the 1880s), on November 21, 1869. He was born to Uriah Dow Thomas Murray, a farmer, and Bertha Elizabeth Jones. His mother died when he was two years old and, after his father remarried, the family moved to Montague, Texas. At the age of twelve, Murray left home.Henry, pp. 10‚Äì11. During most of Murray's adolescence, he worked on farms during the summer and attended public schools in the winter. Murray worked and studied hard, and was admitted to the College Hill Institute in Springtown, Texas. He graduated from College Hill with a teaching degree in 1889 and began teaching in a public school in Parker County, Texas. Murray became politically active and joined the Farmers' Alliance and the Democratic Party. He was a skilled orator and campaigned for James Stephen Hogg when the latter ran for Governor of Texas. Early career Murray then moved to Corsicana, Texas, where he founded a newspaper that survived for only two years. During this time he ran for the state senate, but failed both attempts. He moved to Fort Worth, Texas, where he worked as a writer for the Fort Worth Gazette. While at College Hill, Murray had taken an interest in law and \\"read the law\\" in Fort Worth. He passed the Texas bar exam in 1897, and first practiced law in Fort Worth, Texas. Indian Territory In 1898, Murray moved to Tishomingo, the capital of the Chickasaw Nation in the Indian Territory (now eastern Oklahoma), where he started a law practice. Murray's legal knowledge and colorful personality brought him to the attention of Douglas H. Johnston, the Governor of the Chickasaw Nation, who appointed him as legal advisor. In addition to practicing law in Tishomingo, Murray began to learn farming. He acquired his nickname \\"Alfalfa\\" around 1902 while working as a political operative for Palmer S. Moseley, gubernatorial candidate for the Oklahoma Territory. Murray frequently toured to give talks to local farmers about politics and farming. He often referred to a large tract of alfalfa which he cultivated. Arthur Sinclair, who heard one of his speeches, reported to the editor of the Tishomingo Capital-Democrat that he had just seen \\"Alfalfa Bill\\" deliver one of his finest speeches. The name stuck with Murray for the rest of his life. Marriage and family On July 19, 1899, Murray married Mary Alice Hearrell, niece of Chickasaw Governor Douglas H. Johnston. They had five children together. A son, Johnston Murray, born in 1902, was elected Governor of Oklahoma in 1951. States of Sequoyah and Oklahoma Murray's relationship with the Chickasaw governor Johnston benefited his political career. By 1903, American Indians of the Five Civilized Tribes were talking of seeking statehood for Indian Territory as an independent, Indian-controlled state, to be called the State of Sequoyah. In 1905, the tribes organized a convention to draw up a state constitution. Governor Johnston appointed Murray to represent the Chickasaw at the convention in Muskogee. Of the six delegates at the convention, four were Native Americans; Murray and Charles N. Haskell were the only non-tribal, European Americans. The delegates drafted a constitution, which in a referendum was overwhelmingly approved by the voters of the Five Tribes. Trying to avoid a state that might be dominated by Democrats (because of the Five Civilized Tribes' origin in the Southeast and histories of slave- holding and alliance with the Confederacy in the Civil War), President Theodore Roosevelt, a Republican, opposed separate statehood for Sequoyah. Roosevelt insisted that the Indian and Oklahoma territories had to be admitted as one state ‚Äì Oklahoma. In response to Congress's passage of the Enabling Act in 1906, the people of the two territories held a joint convention. Murray was elected as the delegate for District 104, which included Tishomingo. At the convention in Guthrie, Murray worked closely with Robert L. Williams and again with Charles N. Haskell. They became lifelong friends and allies. Murray's friend and Oklahoma founding father Charles N. Haskell. Due to his experience in Chickasaw politics, Murray was elected by the delegates as the President of the Convention. He kept Haskell close to him; one newspaper reported the latter was the \\"power behind the throne.\\" Together, the two men controlled the convention. The Oklahoma Constitution produced under their guidance was substantially based on the Sequoyah constitution. The proposed constitution included white-supremacist and segregationist clauses strongly supported by Murray. President Roosevelt objected to these clauses, and obtained their deletion before the constitution was submitted to Congress. The US Congress admitted Oklahoma to the Union as the 46th state on November 16, 1907. Oklahoma politics With the state constitution in place, elections were held in 1907 for offices of the new state government. Murray was elected as a state representative, and became the first Speaker of the Oklahoma House of Representatives.Henry, p. 11. His ally Charles Haskell was elected as governor. As speaker, Murray often opposed the progressive work of Kate Barnard, Commissioner of Charities and Corrections, and he pushed for Jim Crow laws similar to those in southern states to control blacks: \\"We should adopt a provision prohibiting the mixed marriages of negroes with other races in this State, and provide for separate schools and give the Legislature power to separate them in waiting rooms and on passenger coaches, and all other institutions in the State ... As a rule they are failures as lawyers, doctors and in other professions...I appreciate the old-time ex-slave, the old darky ‚Äì and they are the salt of their race ‚Äì who comes to me talking softly in that humble spirit which should characterize their actions and dealings with the white man.\\"Egan, Timothy. The Worst Hard Time: The Untold Story of Those Who Survived the Great American Dust Bowl. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co, 2006. He left the state legislature after one term and did not seek re-election in 1908. In 1910, Murray ran for governor but lost in the Democratic primary. In 1912, Murray was elected as U.S. Representative from one of Oklahoma's three at-large seats. (Oklahoma had gained three seats in the 1910 Congressional apportionment but had not drawn up a new district map.) In 1914, he was elected to a second term from the 4th Congressional district under the new map. In 1916, he was defeated for renomination. In 1918, Murray again ran for governor and lost in the Democratic primary. He retired from politics and returned to private law practice in Tishomingo. In 1924, Murray led a group of Oklahoma ranchers who formed a colony in southeastern Bolivia. He stayed in Bolivia until 1929, when he returned to Oklahoma to run for governor in 1930. Governor of Oklahoma Governor Murray faced the beginnings of both the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl. Murray won the Democratic nomination, then won the general election by almost 100,000 votes, the largest majority of any Oklahoma governor up to that time. His campaign slogan, at a time of the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl, railed against \\"The Three C's ‚Äì Corporations, Carpetbaggers, and Coons.\\" He was inaugurated as the ninth Governor of Oklahoma on January 12, 1931. Murray faced the harsh problems of the Great Depression. Under the previous Governor, William J. Holloway, the state government had accumulated a deficit of over $5,000,000 trying to encourage jobs and provide welfare. Mass unemployment, mortgage foreclosures, the deficit, and bank failures haunted Murray's administration. In 1931, the legislature appropriated $600,000 for emergency necessities. Through money collected from state employees, businessmen, and his own salary, Murray financed programs to feed Oklahoma's poor. No federal relief program had yet been instituted. Murray became a national leader for the victims of the Depression, and called for a national council for relief to be held at Memphis, Tennessee in June 1931. The government of Oklahoma faced failure, not only because of the massive deficit, but because many of Oklahoma's citizens could not pay their debts. To speed the collection of funds, at Murray's urging the Legislature created the Oklahoma Tax Commission. This three-member commission was responsible for the collection and administration of taxes, licenses and fees from all citizens. The new agency established safeguards against tax evasion and helped to stem the drain on the state's tax revenue. Due to the severity of the depression, Murray relied on the Oklahoma National Guard to enforce the state's laws through the use of martial law. Murray did this in spite of impeachment threats from the Oklahoma Senate. During his tenure as governor, Murray called out the Guard and charged them with duties ranging from policing ticket sales at University of Oklahoma football games to patrolling the oil fields. Murray used the Guard during the \\"Toll Bridge War\\" between Oklahoma and Texas. A joint project to build a free bridge across the Red River on U.S. Highway 75 between Durant, Oklahoma and Denison, Texas turned into a major dispute when the Governor of Texas blocked traffic from entering his state on the new bridge. The Red River Bridge Company of Texas owned the original toll bridge and had a dispute over its purchase deal. Murray sent the Guard to reopen the bridge in July 1931. Texas had to retreat when lawyers determined that Oklahoma had jurisdiction over both banks of the river. Murray used the Guard to reduce oil production in the hopes of raising prices. Because of the vast quantity of newly opened wells in Texas and Oklahoma, oil prices had sunk below the costs of production. Murray and three other governors met in Fort Worth, Texas to demand lower production. When the Oklahoma producers did not comply, on August 4, 1931, Murray called out the Guard, declared martial law, and ordered that some 3,000 oil wells be shut down. By the end of his administration in 1935, Murray had used the National Guard on 47 occasions and declared martial law more than 30 times. As Oklahoma governors were unable to succeed themselves in those days, Murray could not run for reelection and thus left office on January 15, 1935. In 1933, Murray's old friend Charles Haskell died. Murray would never be the same. Murray lost the Democratic nomination to Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1932. He later rejected FDR's New Deal. In 1932, Murray sought the Democratic nomination for President and ran in several primaries, but he did not win any, though he received nearly 20 percent of the vote in Oregon. Huey Pierce Long, Jr., the former governor of Louisiana and U.S. senator, recalled visiting Murray in his hotel room at the 1932 Democratic National Convention in Chicago: > \\"Alfalfa Bill\\" was very gracious ... While we talked at length, he dwelt > upon the virtue in the possible candidacies of everybody except Franklin > Roosevelt and himself, even suggesting me as a candidate. He understood the > favorite son game. I soon saw that I was fencing with a past master in > politics. Had I listened to him very long, he would have been at work to > make a favorite son candidate out of me. I was then moving Heaven and earth > to keep down other favorite son candidates. ... Favorite son moves were the > most dangerous things we had to fight. ...Huey Pierce Long, Jr., Every Man a > King: The Autobiography of Huey P. Long (New Orleans: National Book Club, > Inc., 1933), pp. 304‚Äì305. Murray initially supported President Franklin Roosevelt, but he later turned against the New Deal as did other conservative Oklahoma politicians of that time.Henry, p. 14. Later life and death In 1938, Murray ran for governor, and lost in the Democratic primary. Later that year, he tried to run for the United States Senate as an Independent, but his nominating petitions were filed late. In 1942, he ran for the Senate again and lost in the Democratic primary. His wife, Mary Alice, died in Oklahoma City on August 28, 1938. Her body lay in state in the Oklahoma Capitol building on the afternoon of August 29, 1938, the first woman to receive the honor. She was buried in Tishomingo the following day. After his retirement, Murray became widely known for his radical racist and conspiracy views. He wrote articles and books dealing with constitutional rights. In his books, Murray seemed to indicate his support for fascism. Murray supported Strom Thurmond's insurgent Dixiecrat bid for the presidency against Harry S. Truman and Thomas E. Dewey in 1948. Murray's legacy continued with his son, Johnston Murray. A Democrat, Johnston Murray was administered the oath of office as the state's fourteenth governor by his father on January 9, 1951. Murray did not live long past his son's governorship, having died on October 15, 1956 of a stroke and pneumonia. He is buried in Tishomingo. Murray was considered the last surviving member of the Haskell Dynasty. Legacy and honors * Murray State College of Agriculture and Applied Science, is named in William Murray's honor.

Breeding display at Buffalo Springs National Reserve T. rufirostris The northern red-billed hornbill has a black stripe on the back of its head, reddish ocular skin and dark eyes. Keulemans, 1892 T. kempi is the only species with both dark eyes and blackish ocular skin At a nest in Gambia Description This group of conspicuous birds have mainly whitish underparts and head, grey upperparts, long tails, and a long curved red bill which lacks a casque. The sexes are similar, but the female has a smaller bill. They are generally large, at long, but the entire group is considered one of the smaller hornbills. Behaviour=Breeding During incubation, the female lays three to six white eggs in a tree hole, which is blocked off with a plaster of mud, droppings and fruit pulp. There is only one narrow aperture, just big enough for the male to transfer food to the mother and the chicks. When the chicks and the female are too big for the nest, the mother breaks out and rebuilds the wall. Then both parents feed the chicks. Nesting The female red-billed hornbill protects her young against intruders by building a wall across the opening of her nest. She then seals herself in and brings up her chicks in a 'prison'. Feeding They are omnivorous, taking and eating insects, fruit and seeds. They feed mainly on the ground and will form flocks outside the breeding season.

A member of the Democratic Party, he served as governor from 1951 to 1955. Murray was the first Native American to be elected Governor in the United States. His father, William H. Murray, was the ninth governor of Oklahoma and the president of the constitutional convention leading up to statehood. Both are buried in Tishomingo, Oklahoma. Johnston Murray served as governor from 1951 to 1955. He attempted to reduce state spending but was blocked by state legislators. Since he was prohibited, constitutionally, from succeeding himself, his wife Willie ran for governor in 1954 but failed to win. A few months later there was a bitter divorce with Willie accusing Murray of public drunkenness and adultery. The divorce was final in 1956 and he later married Helen Shutt. Murray moved to Fort Worth, Texas, and worked for an oil well servicing company and later with a limousine service. Murray returned to Oklahoma City and formed a law partnership with Whit Pate in February 1960. He ran for Oklahoma State Treasurer in 1962, surprisingly finishing last in the four-man Democratic primary field with 77,881 votes (18.24%).http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=493209 He later worked as a consulting attorney for the Oklahoma Department of Welfare. Early life Murray was born July 21, 1902, in the mansion of the Chickasaw Nation's Governor at Emet, Johnston County, Indian Territory. His mother, Mary Alice Hearrell, was one-eighth Chickasaw, Chief Johnston, for whom the boy was named, had employed his father, William H. Murray, as his legal advisor. His early education was provided in the public schools of Tishomingo, Oklahoma.\\"Johnston Murray - Tishomingo Cemetery - Tishomingo, OK.\\" Waymarking. June 6, 2017. Accessed August 6, 2018. Johnston Murray married Marion Draughon of Sulphur, Oklahoma, in 1923 and had one child. Early career After graduation from the Murray State School of Agriculture (now Murray State College) in 1924, he went to Bolivia where he lived for four years trying to make a success of his father's colonization expedition there.Dowell, Erin, \\"Murray, Johnston (1902‚Äì1974) ,\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture (accessed May 27, 2010). When he returned to Oklahoma, he worked in oil and gas fields, rising to the role of plant manager.Myers, Jim L. \\"Johnston Murray Governor of Oklahoma 1951‚Äì1955.\\" Fischer, LeRoy H., ed., Oklahoma's Governors, 1929‚Äì1955: Depression to Prosperity (Oklahoma Historical Society, 1983), pp 174‚Äì195. Murray divorced Marion in 1929 and married Willie Roberta Emerson in 1933. Political career Murray received his law degree from Oklahoma City University School of Law in 1947. He was chairman of the Oklahoma Electoral College in 1940 and a member of the Electoral College again in 1948. Before his election as governor, Murray served as Democratic chair of the Oklahoma Eighth Congressional District and as chair of local political groups in Kay and Oklahoma counties. He also served as chair of the Oklahoma Election Board and secretary of the Oklahoma Land Commission. Governor of Oklahoma Johnston Murray was elected Governor of Oklahoma in November 1950 and sworn into office on January 21, 1951. The oath of office was administered by his 81-year old father, \\"Alfalfa Bill\\" Murray. The two men were very much unlike. His main campaign theme was to reduce spending by the state government and reduce taxes. His program included continuing to consolidate schools to improve education (begun under his predecessor, Governor Roy J. Turner), changing the ad valorem tax to return more of the property taxes to local school districts, and expanding highway and toll road systems. Johnston did have some successes that were noteworthy. He was elected Chairman of the Southern Governors Conference (the first Oklahoma governor to hold that position); he secured approval and funding of the Turner Turnpike and was instrumental in the purchasing of the Fairgrounds in Oklahoma City. He toured Central and South American countries on behalf of the United States Information Service in 1954, and served as chairman of the Interstate Oil Compact Commission. This governor had the distinction of vetoing forty bills in forty years, the highest number in forty years of Oklahoma politics.Gibson, p. 241  Johnston and Willie  The new first lady, Willie Murray, was noted as a concert pianist with charm and intelligence. Less well-known were her fire and ambition. Her first action after Johnston's inauguration was to open the governor's mansion to public visitors every Thursday. She welcomed up to 3,000 people, who lined up at the door every week. Johnson began to rebel against their differences as the term wore on. Willie complained that he drank too much. He replied that she was too bossy. According to one article, he exclaimed, \\"‚ÄúDamn it, I got elected, not her.‚Äù Cronley, Connie. \\"Much Love Lost.\\" This Land. February 8, 2015. Accessed August 6, 2018. The state constitution prevented the governor from succeeding himself when his term expired. Before the term was up, Willie announced that she would run for the office. The campaign was a farce. She became the first state-wide candidate ever to campaign for office by helicopter. One reporter wrote that the helicopter, \\"... was the only thing that got off the ground.\\" After the 1954 election, Johnston filed for divorce. Willie fought back, asking for separate maintenance and alleging adultery and public drunkenness. The brawl went public, of course. He asked for another chance, she named another woman, and published letters from him declaring his intention to divorce. He called it all lies. Finally, the drama played out and the divorce was granted on the grounds of incompatibility. Willie got a $75,000 settlement, the family's home in Oklahoma City, a Ford automobile, and a movie of her gubernatorial campaign. Willie also got the last word, when Johnston announced that he had changed his political affiliation and supported Republican Dwight Eisenhower for President in 1956. Willie reportedly announced, ‚ÄúHe never has been much of a Democrat.‚Äù Death Murray served as an attorney with the Oklahoma Department of Public Welfare until his death April 16, 1974.Oklahoma Department of Libraries biography He is buried in Tishomingo, Oklahoma, where his father, William Murray is also buried.

Wilson is also co-author of The Illuminatus! Trilogy (1975), and Schr√∂dinger's Cat is a sequel of sorts, re-using several of the same characters and carrying on many of the themes of the earlier work. The one- volume edition currently in print is significantly shorter than the original three-volume edition. This is not a difference in print size or removal of redundant \\"recaps\\"; it is missing a noticeable amount of material, including many entire chapters. The name Schr√∂dinger's Cat comes from a thought experiment in quantum mechanics. The first book, The Universe Next Door, takes place in different universes in accord with the many worlds interpretation of quantum physics; in the second, The Trick Top Hat, characters are unknowingly connected through non-locality, i.e., having once crossed paths they are joined in quantum entanglement; and the third book, The Homing Pigeons, places characters in an \\"observer-created universe\\" in which consciousness causes the collapse of the wavefunction. Taking place in Unistat, which is the novel's parallel to the United States, the novels have intertwining plots involving a wide array of characters, including: * Epicene Wildeblood, a.k.a. Mary Margaret Wildeblood, a transsexual woman who throws great parties * Frank Dashwood, president of Orgasm Research * Markoff Chaney, a prankster * Hugh Crane, a.k.a. Cagliostro the Great, a mystic and magician * Furbish Lousewart V, author and President of Unistat * Marvin Gardens, author and cocaine addict * Eve Hubbard, scientist and alternate President of Unistat Series summary In The Universe Next Door, the President of Unistat is Furbish Lousewart V; in that universe, a terrorist organization known as Purity of Essence (named after General Ripper's obsession in the film Dr. Strangelove) threatens to detonate nuclear devices in major cities all over Unistat. Also mirroring Dr. Strangelove, Unistat has an automated device that will send nuclear missiles to Russia in the event of such an attack. Russia has a similar device to bomb China, and so on. In The Trick Top Hat, President Hubbard, promotes a scientific approach to the improvement of life: she offers rewards to anyone who can design a robot to do their job or develop methods to prolong life. Eventually Unistat becomes a Utopia. She makes the whole law system into three different laws: victimless crimes, which have no punishment; crimes against property, which involve debt and payment; and serious crimes, such as murder, which result in being sent to Hell, a place like jail but not quite. It's encased in laser shielding and is like a primitive world all its own. It is, in fact, the State of Mississippi. The original Pocket Books edition of The Trick Top Hat contains many passages, some sexually explicit, that are not included in later editions, including the Dell softcover. Much of this material first appeared in Wilson's earlier novel, The Sex Magicians, published as pornography by Sheffield House in 1973. The third volume, The Homing Pigeons, features President Kennedy, although it has very little to do with the President. Near the end of the book it keeps switching universes, some of which contain President Kennedy, others which contain President Lousewort, and still others in which Hubbard is the president. Like The Trick Top Hat, The Homing Pigeons also has material in the Pocket Books edition that is not in later editions. Unlike The Trick Top Hat, however, the material that was cut out did not contain particularly sexually explicit content. The main plots throughout these books are many. One follows Markoff Chaney, a midget, and his pranks played on the world that continuously screws him over. Most of his pranks are played on Dr. Dashwood, of Orgasm Research. However, the most important plot line follows the path of one Hugh Crane which may or may not be this Universe's Hagbard Celine; a character that is an obvious representation of Wilson himself. Another follows an \\"Ithyphallic Eidolon\\", a penis removed from a transsexual woman named Epicene (post-surgery, Mary Margaret) Wildebloode. She puts it on display on her mantelpiece, where it gets stolen. It passes through the vicinity of almost every character in the series at least once. There are dozens of conspiracy theories, strange loops, satire and paranoia included within those pages. In addition, there are numerous references to other works and occasional outright appropriation of characters from them (including cameos by Captain Ahab and Lemuel Gulliver, among others). Many of the character names are either puns (Bertha van Ation refers to the film Birth of a Nation, Juan Tootrego) or references to historical personages (Blake Williams refers to the poet William Blake, Francis Dashwood's name refers to Sir Francis Dashwood). References To Other WorksTanstagi \\"Tanstagi\\", an acronym standing for \\"There Ain't No Such Thing As Government Interference\\", is the motto of the Invisible Hand Society, an originally fictional organization invented in the Schr√∂dinger's Cat Trilogy. The acronym was deliberately intended as a reference to Robert A. Heinlein's TANSTAAFL principle. The Tanstagi principle is meant to imply that the invisible hand of the free market applies to government as well. In other words, contrary to traditional ideas of laissez-faire capitalism, government interference in the free market is impossible, since governments are inextricably a part of the market as a whole. 'Government' is not a separate institution‚Äîit is a word used to describe the actions of a large number of individuals subject to the same (at least qualitatively) pressures as everyone else. Both of these ideas are part of what is known as 'economic Taoism.' While it was first introduced in a novel, people claiming to be members or know of chapters of the Invisible Hand Society have occasionally appeared in editorial pages and on the Internet. Language and invented slang The Schr√∂dinger's Cat Trilogy is a fictional story, with much interpersonal dialogue between characters. This dialogue frequently makes use of slang words invented by the author, as a substitute for words that were, in the 1970s, typically taboo to speak about in modern western culture. In case a censorship case was brought against the book, Wilson made use of the names of Supreme Court Justices as \\"stand ins\\" for certain words. Examples include \\"Potter Stewarting\\", an expression used as a substitute for a common word that refers to the act of copulation, and \\"Burgering\\", referring to the act of voiding one's bowels (referring to Chief Justice of the United States from 1969‚Äì1986, Warren E. Burger), etc. Reception Greg Costikyan reviewed Schr√∂dinger's Cat in Ares Magazine #2 and commented that \\"It deals with uncertainty, sub- nuclear physics; Oriental philosophy, violence, sex and nuclear war. If this description seems confusing to you, you will be more confused after reading the novel. Purchase it; you will either love it or despise it.\\" Greg Costikyan reviewed Schrodinger's Cat II: The Trick Top Hat in Ares Magazine #10 and commented that \\"Wilson is not a writer for the unware; the Schrodinger's Cat series is immensely enjoyable, but requires a reader who will think. Aficionados of space opera need not apply.\\" Greg Costikyan reviewed Schrodinger's Cat III: The Homing Pigeons in Ares Magazine #11 and commented that \\"Schrodinger's Cat III proves once again that Wilson is one of the best and most interesting writers of whom science fiction can boast.\\"  Publication details  * Previously published in three separate volumes by Pocket Books.

In such films, the creation of choreography typically exists only in film or video. At its best, dance films use filming and editing techniques to create twists in the plotline, multiple layers of reality, and emotional or psychological depth. Dance film is also known as the cinematic interpretation of existing dance works, originally created for live performance. When existing dance works are modified for the purposes of filming this can involve a wide variety of film techniques. Depending on the amount of choreographic and/or presentational adjustment an original work is subjected to, the filmed version may be considered as dance for camera. However, these definitions are not agreed upon by those working with dance and film or video.  Examples  Britain's DV8 Physical Theatre, founded by Lloyd Newson, is well known for its film versions of staged works. The reworking of Enter Achilles (1995) for film in 1996 is a seminal example of Dance for camera. Recently acclaimed works include The Cost of Living.http://www.dv8.co.uk/film/film.folder.html Australia's The Physical TV Company, directed by Richard James Allen and Karen Pearlman, is well known for creating original works that are a sophisticated meeting of the possibilities of cinema with those of dance. Dance films such as Rubberman Accepts The Nobel Prize (2001), No Surrender (2002), and Down Time Jaz (2003) are differing examples of the possibilities of this approach involving comedy, visual effects, drama, and animation. The Machinima work by Chris Brandt: 'Dance, Voldo, Dance' which uses computer game characters within the game Soulcalibur to act out a live, choreographed dance. Two players simultaneously performed the dance piece using game controllers. The work existed as a live performance on screen, and has since been edited and distributed on the internet as a video work.

Motion Control featured 'a glammed up Aggiss, fixed to the spot in nameless, enclosed space, and the camera diving and circling around here. The camera lunges at speed towards the centre of her body like a ravenous carnivorous plant, and Aggiss battles against it with all the wiles of a performer.'Lizzy Le Quesne, 'Liz Aggiss: The 3D Queen of Brighton', Ballet Tanz Jahrbuch, 2005, p55 Billy Cowie, who collaborated with Aggiss from 1982 to 2003, is a pioneer of 3D Dance films, shown as installations in galleries.

ODOT had been using alternative fuels since 1999, and owned 193 flex-fuel vehicles when this announcement was made. Taft also mandated that ethanol tanks be constructed at all new ODOT facilities.\\"Ohio Governor Mandates DOT to use B20 and E85 Biofuels\\", Green Car Congress, Retrieved September 21, 2009. Later in 2005, Taft urged the U.S. Congress to extend tax credits to those who install fuel cell electricity stations. As part of the Ohio Third Frontier program, $100 million in grants had already been issued for the research of fuel cells.\\"Taft urges fuel cell tax credit\\", Cincinnati Biz Journals, Retrieved September 21, 2009. In early 2006, Taft announced his \\"Energy Action Plan\\", which included doubling the use of E85 ethanol in state fleets from to 60,000, increasing the use of biodiesel in state fleets by annually, while mandating the purchase of flex-fuel only vehicles for the state fleet, and allocating $3.6 million from the Energy Loan Fund to make state buildings energy efficient. The plan also called for $25 million from the Energy Loan Fund to be set aside over five years for wind turbine producing companies, and to set aside a grant of 1.2 cents per kilowatt-hour of electricity produced by wind energy. Taft called for a pilot program to create jet fuel from coal, moving Ohio's geological information on fossil fuel sources to digital formats, and reaffirming the state's commitment to FutureGen, a clean coal initiative.\\"Taft Announces Energy Action Plan\\" , National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, Retrieved September 21, 2009.

During Taft's governorship, the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation (BWC) invested hundreds of millions of dollars in high risk or unconventional investment vehicles run by Republican Party supporters who had made large campaign contributions to senior Ohio Republican officials. One was a rare coin investment fund run by Tom Noe which attracted particular scrutiny since two coins worth more than $300,000 were reportedly lost. Further investigation revealed that other state-backed coin investments worth $10‚Äì$12 million were missing and that only $13 million of the original $50 million invested could be accounted for. Tom Noe was convicted of running a criminal enterprise, stealing $13 million, and of keeping a second set of books to cover it. Governor Taft and Noe took 45 golf trips together, which went unreported, resulting in Taft's criminal conviction (see below) for undisclosed gifts. Criminal conviction In 1996, the Republican-controlled Ohio General Assembly passed a law that struck the requirement that the Ohio state government invest solely in bonds. Various fund managers and other brokers then scrambled to offer their services. In 1999, Taft issued a gubernatorial executive order mandating four hours of ethics training for members of his cabinet, assistant cabinet directors, and senior staff every two years. In 2001, a ruling by the Ohio Ethics Commission made clear that any free rounds of golf paid for by lobbyists which were valued over $75 were to be disclosed.\\"Taft Said He Didn't Know Golf Gifts Needed Reporting \\", Cleveland Plain-Dealer, Retrieved 13 nov 2009. Taft stated he was not aware of the opinion until 2005 after news reports surfaced about the Coingate scandal.

Taft personally notified the commission of possible disclosure failures, and offered his cooperation in correcting the issues in voluntarily triggering an investigation. On August 17, 2005, Taft was charged with four criminal misdemeanors stemming from his failure to disclose golf outings paid for by lobbyists, as well as some undisclosed gifts. The Associated Press reported the total value of at least 52 undisclosed gifts as about US$5,800, they included:\\"Governor Pleads To Charges\\" Marion Online Newspaper, Aug. 8, 2005, accessed Feb. 20, 2007; \\"Taft calls for limits on gifts\\" by Jim Siegel, The Columbus Dispatch, February 10, 2006, accessed Feb. 20, 2007. #Two undisclosed gifts including golf with coin dealer Thomas Noe, a Republican fundraiser then under investigation, and later convicted, for his handling of a $50 million investment of state money in rare coins, and diverting $2 million to personal use. Taft claimed of Tom Noe that \\"He fooled people from one end of Ohio to the other.\\" (See Coingate scandal.) #Six undisclosed gifts including golf outings with political strategist Curt Steiner and Robert Massie, president of chemical information services giant CAS, worth $700.

This was the first time an Ohio governor has ever been charged with a crime while in office. At his arraignment in Franklin County Municipal Court in Columbus on August 18, Taft pleaded no contest and was fined $4,000 plus court costs. Judge Mark Froehlich also ordered Taft to apologize to the people of Ohio as well as state employees.Taft: 'I have failed' Governor fined $4,000 for ethics violations, ordered to issue apology\\" by Mark Niquette, Alan Johnson and Randy Ludlow, The Columbus Dispatch, August 19, 2005, accessed Feb. 20, 2007.

During the sentencing it was noted that Taft had a 30-year unblemished record as a public official. Further investigation of GOP operative Noe revealed that coins worth $10‚Äì$12 million were missing and that only $13 million of the original $50 million invested could be accounted for. Tom Noe was convicted of running a criminal enterprise, the theft of $13 million from the fund, and of keeping a second set of books to cover for it. The Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation (BWC) ultimately invested hundreds of millions of dollars in high risk or unconventional investment vehicles run by people closely connected to the Ohio Republican Party who had made large campaign contributions to many senior Republican party officials. Taft's conviction was grounds under the Ohio Constitution for impeachment and removal from office by the Ohio General Assembly; however, impeachment proceedings did not occur and Taft remained in office until the end of his second term. In addition to the criminal sanctions, Taft was issued a public reprimand by the Ohio Supreme Court on December 27, 2006 for accepting and failing to report gifts and golf outings worth more than $6,000.Decision of Ohio Supreme Court Ohio Supreme Court, December 27, 2006; accessed March 28, 2007.

Since his victory in 1998, Hodges has remained the only Democrat elected to the South Carolina Governor's office since the 1982 election. Early life and career James Hovis Hodges was born on November 9, 1956 to parents George N. and Betty H. Hodges. He grew up in Lancaster, South Carolina, near the North Carolina border. He attended Davidson College but later transferred to the University of South Carolina, where he completed a BSBA in 1979 and earned election to Phi Beta Kappa. During his undergraduate studies, Hodges worked summers at a cotton mill to pay for his schooling. In 1982, Hodges received a J.D. from the University of South Carolina School of Law. From 1983 to 1986, Hodges served as Lancaster County Attorney. South Carolina House of Representatives At age 30, Hodges first won an election in a December 1986 special election for the 45th district seat in the South Carolina House of Representatives vacated by the late Tom Mangum. While in the House, Hodges served as chair of the House Judiciary Committee from 1992 until 1994 and as House Democratic Leader from 1995 until 1997. The South Carolina Chamber of Commerce named Hodges \\"Legislator of the Year\\" in 1993, and the National Federation of Independent Business bestowed Hodges with its \\"Guardian of Small Business\\" award. While serving in the state legislature, Hodges also worked as general counsel for The Springs Company. Governor of South Carolina=Gubernatorial election, 1998 Hodges entered the 1998 gubernatorial election in South Carolina an underdog but took advantage of controversy and missteps by incumbent Republican governor David Beasley, namely Beasley's indecisiveness on allowing a Confederate flag to fly at the state capitol and call to eliminate video poker. Donations from video gambling interests helped Hodges narrow a near million-dollar fundraising gap with Beasley. In what was reported as an upset victory, Hodges won the gubernatorial race with a 53 to 45 percent margin and won 35 of 46 counties. Hodges became the first challenger to defeat a sitting governor since the South Carolina constitution first allowed consecutive terms in 1980. Term as governor (1999‚Äì2003) As South Carolina's 114th governor, Hodges signed a law that made Martin Luther King, Jr. Day an official state holiday; South Carolina was the last state in the U.S. to do so. That law also added a Confederate Memorial Day, a move that drew opposition from the NAACP. He played an instrumental role in moving the Confederate flag from the state Capitol's dome to its grounds. He also instituted the construction of the New Cooper River Bridge in Charleston, which is North America's longest cabled spanned bridge. Public education was a major focus in the Hodges administration, as Hodges oversaw the founding of the South Carolina Education Lottery and the First Steps preschool initiative. The governor also helped pass a $1.1 billion school construction initiative, and the lottery funded millions in college scholarships to South Carolina students. Hodges received criticism in his first year in office for his management of the Hurricane Floyd evacuation, particularly his decision not to make Interstate 26 one-way westbound. Hodges also received blame for financial problems with the state Department of Commerce and long lines at Division of Motor Vehicles offices. In 2003, the University of South Carolina self-reported to the NCAA several secondary recruiting violations on Hodges' part. Hodges had met with recruits, something he was prohibited from doing as an ex-oficio trustee of the university. Gubernatorial election, 2002 Like Hodges' 1998 bid, the race concentrated on issues such as education and the state budget. On November 5, 2002, former U.S. Representative Mark Sanford defeated Hodges in the general election for governor, 53 to 47 percent. During the campaign, Sanford \\"likened Hodges to a weasel and to former President Bill Clinton and Al Gore,\\" reported The State in October 2002. To date, Hodges remains the last Democrat to have served as governor of South Carolina. Post-political career Hodges in 2008 Since leaving office as governor, Hodges has served as a senior advisor at McGuire Woods Consulting, LLC, and as partner in the affiliated law firm of McGuireWoods, LLP, and is based in Columbia, South Carolina. He endorsed General Wesley Clark (D-Arkansas) in the 2004 Democratic presidential primaries. In 2007, Hodges publicly supported Stephen Colbert's attempt to run for president in the South Carolina primaries, and even offered himself up as a vice presidential choice should the comedian actually win the nomination. In February 2008 the former governor officially endorsed U.S. Senator Barack Obama (D-Illinois) in the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries. The Obama campaign, in turn, named Hodges as one of its national co-chairs. Hodges and his wife Rachel live in Columbia with their two sons. He is an Episcopalian.

It was the heaviest aircraft ever built when it first flew in 1944, and was the largest aircraft produced by any of the Axis powers during World War II.Luftfahrt History Heft 1: Blohm & Voss BV 238. Lautec Medien GmbH, 57078 Siegen. History Development of the BV 238 giant flying boat began in 1941, following the success of the smaller but still enormous BV 222 Wiking. An approximately quarter-scale model of the BV 238 was commissioned to test the new, long and slim hull design. Built by the Czechoslovakian Flugtechnische Fertigungsgemeinschaft Prag (FGP), the FGP 227 arrived too late to contribute any data to the program. Although extensive defensive armament was planned the first prototype, the BV 238 V1, had none. Bearing the Stammkennzeichen alphabetic radio code of RO + EZ, it began flight trials in April 1944. It was strafed and partially sunk while moored on Lake Schaal, some miles to the east of Hamburg. One wing remained above water and it was salvaged, but by this time the war had ended and the Allies refused to let it be restored so it was taken out to deeper water and sunk.Amtmann (1988), p.64. One other prototype was effectively completed but never flown and two more were under construction at the end of the war. Design The BV 238 was an extremely large flying boat of conventional aerodynamic design, but bearing the usual B&V; structural hallmarks of all-metal construction with a tubular steel wing main spar which also acted as the armoured main fuel tank. Of the era, only the earlier Tupolev ANT-20, the Martin XPB2M-1 and the later Hughes H-4 had a bigger wing span. However it would be the heaviest yet flown, at fully loaded. The hull had an unusually long and slim planing bottom, of essentially two-step design but with a row of smaller auxiliary steps behind the main one. A large nose door opened onto its cavernous interior, with the main crew cabin immediately above and behind it. The wing was of straight, constant-chord form with tapered outer sections. Auxiliary floats were integrated into underside panels of the outer sections and could be retracted to lie flush with the wing. A catwalk ran internally along the wing in front of the tubular steel main spar, providing access to the engines in flight.Green (1970) Power was provided by six 1,287 kW (1,750 hp) Daimler-Benz DB 603 liquid-cooled inverted V12 piston engines, arranged in nacelles along the leading edge of the centre section. BV 250 A landplane version, initially called the BV 238-Land, was proposed, capable of carrying out transport, long-range bombing and transatlantic reconnaissance duties. The lower hull was replaced by a plain fairing with retractable undercarriage comprising twelve main and two nose wheels. One bomb bay filled the space between the wheel bays, another lay behind the main undercarriage. The wing floats were similarly replaced with retractable outrigger stabilising wheels. The nose wheel could be folded up, making the aircraft \\"kneel\\" and allowing vehicles to drive directly on- and off-board via a loading ramp to the nose doorway. Alternatively, passenger seating could be fitted. A further, upper deck behind the crew cockpit accommodated further passengers, bringing the total capacity to 300 troops.Sharp, D.; Luftwaffe:Secret Bombers of the Third Reich, Mortons, 2016, pp.36-39.

The plant is related to the cabbage and was first cultivated as a vegetable in Britain around the turn of the 18th century. Blanched stems are eaten as a vegetable, and had become popular in the mid-19th century in Britain, in Victorian times. Description Growing to tall by wide, it is a mound-forming, spreading perennial. It has large fleshy glaucous collard-like leaves and abundant white flowers. The globular pods contain a single seed. Distribution This species appears to be a European endemic, with a distribution generally confined to two discontinuous coastal regions of Europe; the species is absent from North Africa and the Middle East. It occurs from the Black Sea coasts of Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey, and Ukraine including the Crimea, but is absent from most of the Mediterranean, recurring again from northern France and Ireland to the Baltic Sea. In the Iberian Peninsula, Greece and Italy it is replaced by the species Crambe hispanica, with which its distribution has been confused with until quite recently; the species is absent from Portugal, Greece, Italy and Spain, but is said to occur in Croatia. Although it was once believed to be found growing in Israel and Jordan, or alternatively Lebanon and Syria, these populations are now classified as C. hispanica.

Dundalgan Press Ltd, Dundalk It is usually found above high tide mark on beaches in which the sand includes pebbles or rock. A typical habitat for the species in Britain is vegetated shingle beaches, where it grows in association with yellow horned poppy and curled dock. It is the dominant plant species in plant communities found in fragmentary, endangered habitats on shingle beaches and bars on the southern Baltic coasts of Sweden, Finland and Estonia, east to Mecklenburg, where it grows together with Leymus arenarius, Euphorbia palustris, Honkenya peploides, Angelica archangelica ssp. litoralis, Atriplex spp., Beta vulgaris ssp. maritima, Elymus repens, Geranium robertianum ssp. rubricaule, Glaucium flavum, Isatis tinctoria, Ligusticum scoticum, Mertensia maritima, Silene uniflora, Tripleurospermum maritimum and Valeriana salina. Trapping wind-blown sand, clumps of sea kale may initiate the formation of dunes. Cultivation and culinary use There are records from the 18th century of local people along some coasts of England digging out and harvesting the emerging shoots as a vegetable from naturally occurring root crowns in the early springtime. This custom was first reported by Phillip Miller in his 1731 Gardener's Dictionary as practised among the indigenous peoples of Sussex, and it was seen once in the 18th century being sold as food, this at the Chichester market in 1753. John Martyn was the first to publish some practical notes on cultivating the plant in a late edition of Miller's work, but William Curtis was the first to publish a tract about his experiments of growing the plant as a vegetable crop in London in 1799, just before his death, with John Maher giving a reading before the Horticultural Society of London in 1805 which elaborated slightly on the work of Curtis. Both Curtis and Maher recommended growing the plant as a forced, blanched vegetable, growing the rootcrown in a ceramic cylinder which could be capped with a closed blanching pot. Over and about this pot fresh manure would be heaped a few feet deep, the heat produced when this dung rotted would be sufficient to force the plant to bolt as early as December, although later in the winter was recommended. For those without the financial means to purchase expensive blanching pots, Maher suggests covering the plants in a mat covered by a thick layer of gravel, and Curtis mentions simply hoeing a foot of soil over the crown, or piling sea sand, pebbles or coal ash over it, although both agree this will produce a much inferior crop. An area of roughly five square feet could hold a single rootcrown consisting of three plants, which after growing out from seed for three years could be forced at least twice a season to yield four to six shoots of up to twelve inches, although usually much less. Thomas Jefferson grew sea kale at Monticello between 1820 to 1825. It was served at the Royal Pavilion in Brighton, when Prince Regent George IV of the United Kingdom (1762‚Äì1830) used it as a seaside retreat. By the Victorian Era sea kale had become \\"in very general use\\" as a vegetable in Britain, according to the popular cookbook Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management, in which it is called a type of asparagus, although at nine pennies for a basket of sprouts, it was one of the most expensive vegetables to be had. Its cultivation is discussed in older books on vegetable growing. Wild stocks were severely reduced in Britain by forcing in situ and collecting for food until the practice was banned in the early 20th century. Sea kale fell out of favour, but in the early 21st century, British chefs made it fashionable again. It is commercially grown by a number of farmers in Britain. A tiny experimental plot of sea kale is cultivated on Texel, a North Sea island in the Netherlands. It is irrigated with adulterated seawater. Maher mentions that he personally considered blanched sea kale a delicacy. Curtis says that as a food, boiled twenty minutes and covered in melted butter, it resembled most asparagus, although with hints of cabbage. He reports most he served it to found it agreeable; although some found it no better than cabbage, others found it superior even to asparagus. Although Curtis had never tried to do so himself, he mentions someone once made a decent stew of it and also theorizes that perhaps it might be well suited to be pickled.

EMAS was a powerful and efficient general purpose multi-user system which coped with many of the computing needs of the University of Edinburgh and the University of Kent (the only other site outside Edinburgh to adopt the operating system). History Originally running on the ICL System 4/75 mainframe (based on the design of the IBM 360) it was later reimplemented on the ICL 2900 series of mainframes (as EMAS 2900 or EMAS-2) where it ran in service until the mid-1980s. Near the end of its life, the refactored version was back-ported (as EMAS-3) to the Amdahl 470 mainframe clone, and thence to the IBM System/370-XA architecture (the latter with help from the University of Kent, although they never actually ran EMAS-3). The National Advanced System (NAS) VL80 IBM mainframe clone followed later. The final EMAS system (the Edinburgh VL80) was decommissioned in July 1992. The University of Kent system went live in December 1979, and ran on the least powerful machine in the ICL 2900 range - an ICL 2960, with 2MB of memory, executing about 290k instructions per second. Despite this, it reliably supported around 30 users. This number increased in 1983 with the addition of an additional 2MB of memory and a second Order Code Processor (OCP) (what is normally known as a CPU) running with symmetric multiprocessing. This system was decommissioned in August 1986. Features EMAS was written entirely in the Edinburgh IMP programming language, with only a small number of critical functions using embedded assembler within IMP sources. It had several features that were advanced for the time, including dynamic linking, multi-level storage, an efficient scheduler, a separate user-space kernel ('director'), a user-level shell ('basic command interpreter'), a comprehensive archiving system and a memory- mapped file architecture. Such features led EMAS supporters to claim that their system was superior to Unix for the first 20 years of the latter's existence.

It is a member of the family Phoeniculidae, the wood hoopoes, and was formerly known as the red-billed wood hoopoe. Description This abundant species is a metallic dark green, with a purple back and very long diamond-shaped purple tail. Distinctive white markings on the wings and white chevrons on the tail edges make it easily identifiable, as does its long, thin, curved red bill. Sexes are similar, but immatures have a black bill. Food and foraging The green wood hoopoe is an insect-eating species. It feeds mainly on the ground, termite mounds, or on tree trunks, and forms flocks outside the breeding season. Its specialised claws enable it to cling easily to the underside of branches while closely inspecting the bark for insects. Calls This conspicuous bird advertises its presence with its loud kuk-uk-uk-uk-uk call and other vocalisations. Breeding The green wood hoopoe is a cooperative breeder and common resident in the forests, woodlands and suburban gardens of most of sub-Saharan Africa. It is found in groups of up to a dozen or so birds with only one breeding pair. The breeding female lays two to four blue eggs in a natural tree hole or old barbet nest and incubates them for about 18 days. On hatching, she and the nestlings are fed by the rest of the group, even after they have fledged and left the nest hole. The group is fearless in defence of the nestlings against intruders. This species is parasitised by the greater and lesser honeyguide.Roberts Bird Guide (2007) Status Widespread and common throughout its large range, the green wood hoopoe is assessed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

His alleged death has not been proven, nobody has found his body, hence he cannot be deemed to be dead. He was involved in criminal activities such as heavy drug trafficking. It must be pointed out he has since changed his name. Youth and education  Koroma was born to Limba parents in Tombodu, in the Kono District of eastern British Sierra Leone, and grew up in Freetown, the capital. He is from the same ethnic group as former presidents Siaka Stevens and Joseph Saidu Momoh. He joined the Sierra Leonean army in 1985 and was sent to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in England in 1988 to train as an officer. He returned to Sierra Leone the next year and was promoted to platoon commander, and soon thereafter to company commander. He continued to move up the ladder, and in 1994, he went to the Teshi Military College in Ghana for training in army command. Coups and civil war Koroma received military training in Nigeria and United Kingdom. He commanded government forces who were fighting against the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), a rebel army led by the warlord Foday Sankoh. In August 1996, he was arrested for alleged involvement in a coup plot against the southern civilian officials who were in control of the country. It was also alleged that there were plans to kill President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah. Koroma was freed from prison during a successful military coup on 25 May 1997, when 17 junior soldiers serving the Sierra Leone Army (SLA) broke into the central prison and made a do-or-die offer that brought him to power. He advocated making a peaceful settlement with Sankoh and allowing him to join the government, though this never happened. After the coup in 1997, Koroma was named head of state and chairman of the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC). He invited the leadership of the Revolutionary United Front to join the AFRC, which they promptly did. To maintain order, he suspended the constitution, banned demonstrations and abolished all political parties. The AFRC coup was accompanied by an explosion of violence against civilians throughout the nation. The key strategic change was that the RUF had immediate access throughout the country, something they had failed to achieve through six years of military action. Koroma cited corruption, erosion of state sovereignty, over-dependence on foreign nations, and leaders' failure to address tensions between the SLA and government-backed tribal militia movements (in particular the Kamajors) as the pretext for the coup. Koroma's story was consistent with that of the AFRC, which cited the failure of the Abidjan Peace Accord struck between the government of Sierra Leone and the RUF on 30 November 1996.  Involvement of ECOMOG  By 2 June 1997, the RUF/AFRC found itself at odds with Nigerian forces, which were deployed unilaterally under the Economic Community of West African States' Ceasefire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) and its mandate of August 1997. The Nigerians were stationed in and around Freetown's Western Area, trading mortar fire along the main highway into Freetown and around Freetown International Airport. Koroma immediately sought to ease the situation, seeking mediation, which resulted in the signing of a peace accord in late October 1997 in Conakry, Guinea. Almost immediately, violations of the peace accord were perpetrated by all sides in the complex conflict. By January 1998, ECOMOG forces were preparing to oust the RUF/AFRC from power. On 6 February 1998, ECOMOG forces invaded key locations in the Western Area, removing the RUF/AFRC entirely by 12 February. On 1 March, ECOMOG forces commenced operations in provincial Sierra Leone, removing the RUF/AFRC from every key town except Kailahun (in the far east of the country). By December 1998, RUF/AFRC forces had reversed this position, and they entered Freetown in January 1999. Failing to hold territory, the RUF/AFRC retreated into the Northern Province of Sierra Leone. Lom√© Peace Agreement The leadership of the RUF oversaw negotiations with the government of Sierra Leone that led to the signing of the Lom√© Peace Accord on 7 July 1999. Koroma was cut out of the negotiations, and the AFRC did not benefit from the substantive provisions of the agreement. Nevertheless, Koroma participated in the disarmament process, encouraging those SLA soldiers who had joined the AFRC to demobilize. By 2000, Koroma no longer held significant influence over the RUF leadership, as evidenced by the involvement of ex-AFRC members (from a splinter group called the West Side Boys) in defending towns in Port Loko District against a renewed RUF offensive in May 2000. In August 2000, Koroma officially disbanded the AFRC and sought to consolidate his position by forming a political party.  Special Court for Sierra Leone  In early 2002, the government of Sierra Leone and the United Nations signed a bilateral treaty establishing the Special Court for Sierra Leone, mandated to try those who \\"bear the greatest responsibility\\" for crimes against humanity, war crimes, and other serious violations of international humanitarian law. According to the indictment, the RUF/AFRC, under the orders of Koroma, had led armed attacks in Sierra Leone in which the primary targets included civilians, humanitarian aid workers, and UN peacekeeping forces. These attacks served the purpose of terrorizing the population as a form of punishment for not supporting rebel activities. They included such crimes as looting, murder, mutilations, sexual violence, and rape. Child soldiers were conscripted, and women and girls were kidnapped to be raped or turned into sex slaves. Men and boys were also abducted and forced to work or fight for the rebel groups. On 7 March 2003, the prosecutor of the Special Court issued his first indictments. For his role in the RUF/AFRC, Koroma was among them. He fled Freetown in December, reportedly to Liberia. On 1 June 2003, he was officially declared dead under mysterious circumstances, said to have been murdered. However, the prosecutor has yet to withdraw the indictment against Koroma. An October 2006 newspaper headline in Freetown read, \\"Johnny Paul has 1,000 armed soldiers\\". According to an unconfirmed report in September 2008, Koroma's remains were found buried in Foya, a village in Liberia's Lofa County.Tanu Jalloh, \\"Johnny Paul's Dead Body Found in Liberia\\", Concord Times, Freetown (allAfrica.com), September 11, 2008. However, Stephen Rapp, the Special Court's prosecutor, noted that DNA tests on the remains found in Lofa County did not match Koroma's DNA. As of 2010, many still believe Koroma was executed somewhere in Lofa at the hands of former President Charles Taylor of Liberia.http://allafrica.com/stories/201010260617.html Three witnesses‚Äîformer Vice President Moses Blah of Liberia; Joseph Zig Zag Marzah, a former member of Taylor‚Äôs National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) rebel group; and a protected witness‚Äîtestified that while they had not witnessed Koroma's execution, Taylor had told them about it. In October 2010, Taylor's defense team filed a motion to have these testimonies removed as evidence, alleging that the prosecution had bribed the three witnesses, but this motion was rejected the following month. Apparently Koroma in the end only died on 10 or 11 August 2017 in his home village Binkolo.After 10 years in hiding: AFRC Johnny Paul is dead. Standard Times Press.

The issue of the legal status of Texas led the group to claim to have reinstated a provisional government on December 13, 1995. Activists within the movement claim over 40,000 active supporters, and public opinion polls have shown significant support for the secession of Texas or other states. A September 2014 Reuters/Ipsos poll found over 34% of people in southwestern states favored their own state seceding from the United States. So far, however, supporters have not managed to turn these public sentiments into concrete moves toward an independent Texas. History The movement for independence was started by Richard Lance \\"Rick\\" McLaren (born c. 1953). McLaren claimed that, in 1861, Texans voted four-to-one to leave the Union. That most Union loyalists were prevented from voting by violence, threats, and terrorism, he ignored. McLaren still concluded that Texas still met the qualifications, under international law, of a captive nation of war since the end of the American Civil War in 1865, a claim not supported by scholars. The movement split into three factions in 1996, one led by McLaren, one by David Johnson and Jesse Enloe, and the third by Archie Lowe and Daniel Miller. In 1997, McLaren and his followers kidnapped Joe and Margaret Ann Rowe, held them hostage at the Davis Mountain Resort, and demanded the release of a movement member in exchange for the release of the Rowes. McLaren's wife, Evelyn, convinced him to surrender peacefully after a week-long standoff with police and Texas Rangers. McLaren and four other Republic of Texas members were sent to prison.McLaren is imprisoned at the William P. Clements unit at Amarillo, Texas. McLaren's projected prison release date is June 15, 2041, when he would be 87 years old. See generally Texas Dep't of Crim. Justice, inmate #00802782, Richard Lance McLaren, at . McLaren was also convicted of mail fraud and bank fraud in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas in Dallas. See generally footnote 1, McLaren v. United States Incorporated, 2 F.

Keyes III and Mike Matson managed to slip away. Matson was shot dead by Texas Rangers two days later, while Keyes surrendered to the authorities on September 19. In June 1998, Keyes was convicted of burglary with intent to commit aggravated assault and sentenced to 90 years in prison.\\"Republic of Texas member convicted, sentenced to 90 years\\" Associated Press, June 20, 1998 This effectively destroyed the McLaren faction, and the Johnson-Enloe faction was discredited after two of its members, Jack Abbot Grebe Jr. and Johnie Wise, were convicted in 1998 of threatening to assassinate several government officials, including President Bill Clinton. The McLaren case led to the establishment of the group \\"STAR\\", or Sheriffs of Texas Agreed Response, originated by Gary Painter, the sheriff of Midland County, and including officials from some sixty West Texas counties. In a case involving Richard McLaren and his wife Evelyn as plaintiffs, a United States District Court in the District of Columbia ruled, on April 30, 1998: \\"Despite plaintiffs' argument ..... [i]n 1845, Texas became the 28th state of the United States of America. The Republic of Texas no longer exists.\\"McLaren v. United States Incorporated, 2 F. Supp. 2d 48 (D.D.C. 1998), at . In 2003, what remained of the organized movement consolidated into one dominant group recognizing an \\"interim\\" government (which replaced the \\"provisional\\" government), headed by Daniel Miller. This interim government claimed authority from the original proclamations of 1995 and set up a headquarters in the town of Overton. The movement split again over legal arguments, resulting in the current state of affairs. Most of the original personalities of the movement have disappeared from public view. The organization's finances have come from donations and the sale of some items such as a Republic of Texas Passport.

Founded in 1986 by Joseph Segel in West Chester, Pennsylvania, United States, QVC broadcasts to more than 350 million households in seven countries, including channels in the UK, Germany, Japan, and Italy, along with a joint venture in China with China National Radio called CNR Mall. History=Early years under Joseph Segel (1986-1992)QVC's founding and television launch= QVC was founded on June 13, 1986, by Joseph Segel. One of the first brands to sign a two-year deal with QVC for its products was Sears. The corporation later set a new record for first full-year fiscal sales for a new public company of $112 million.http://www.qvc.com/AboutUsAboutQVC.content.html About QVC], About QVC The channel was launched on November 24, 1986 with program hosts Kathy Levine, John Eastman, Bob Bowersox, and Cindy Briggs-Moore. Each November 24, QVC celebrated their birthday annually through 2008. Initially broadcasting live from 7:30 p.m. until midnight ET each weekday and 24 hours a day each weekend, the channel extended its live programming to 24/7/364 in January 1987. Former QUBE host and producer, Ron Giles, was named an executive vice president and executive producer at QVC in late 1987. In October 1988, the board of directors elected Michael C. Boyd to the position of senior executive vice president and chief operating officer. In early 1990, Boyd would take the title of president, reportedly to relieve some of Segel's load. =QVC seeks to buy out its competition= In 1989, QVC acquired its top competitor, the Cable Value Network (CVN), founded by Irwin L. Jacobs. The $380 million deal contributed to a loss of $17 million during the next fiscal quarter, and then led to difficulties in the couple of years that followed. QVC first offered to buy out competitor J. C. Penney Television Shopping Channel on March 16, 1991, a bid rejected by its producers and the Los Angeles Superior Court. On May 21, 1991, QVC picked up a further 4 million cable subscribers when it took over the Burbank-produced JC Penney Shopping Channel, which owed $2 million to its producers. A QVC offer to buy rival Home Shopping Network in March 1992 was sidetracked by legal problems. On July 12, 1993, QVC offered to acquire Home Shopping in a stock swap valued at about $1.1 billion, but talks faltered when QVC pursued a bid for Paramount in fall 1993. Liberty Media Corp. held a controlling interest in the St. Petersberg, Florida-based Home Shopping Network along with their share of QVC. Barry Diller, Celebrity Executive (1993-1995)Plans for a fifth broadcast network= Introduced to televised shopping by designer Diane von F√ºrstenberg a decade before their marriage, Fox founder Barry Diller pursued slick \\"infotainment\\"-style programming as his next television venture. After resigning as chairman of Fox Inc. in early 1992, Diller's Arrow Investments purchased a $25 million stake in QVC, or just under 3 percent of the company, in December 1992 and Diller succeeded Segel as chairman and chief executive on January 18, 1993. Diller, known for building Fox as a fourth national television network in just five years, replaced QVC's second channel, The Fashion Channel, with his prototype for a fifth broadcast television network, Q2. Debuting in spring 1994, Q2 was aimed at younger, slightly less educated and slightly less affluent consumers and broadcast from New York City. The spin-off network was shelved in 1996, costing QVC $55 million. =Failed Paramount takeover bid= QVC, under Diller, first placed a hostile $9.6 billion bid for Paramount in September 1993, when talks for a friendly merger between Paramount and Viacom, worth $7.2 billion at the time, were already under way. QVC's more attractive bid was forced on Paramount in the February 4, 1994 decision of Paramount Communications, Inc. v. QVC Network, Inc. by the Delaware Supreme Court. Following Viacom's merger with Blockbuster that gave Viacom the financial lead, Diller proposed that QVC financial backer BellSouth could buy QVC shares after the merger to boost the value of QVC's stock to Paramount shareholders. Diller dropped the proposal when reminded of its legal challenges and on February 14, 1994, QVC lost its bid for Paramount to a $9.85 million bid from Viacom. Diller's reported five-word response to the end of what The Los Angeles Times called \\"the biggest takeover war of the 1990s\\" was: \\"They won. We lost. Next.\\" =Becoming a worldwide multimedia company= Diller changed the name of QVC Network to QVC, Inc. in 1994, while creating a holding company to allow the firm to diversify and build assets and divisions separately. Among the changes were the creation of two new divisions, Q Direct, to produce infomercials and 60- and 120-second direct response TV commercials, and QVC Interactive, an online-shopping service. QVC launched their internet shopping site, iQVC, on September 15, 1996. QVC's shopping channel based in Mexico, airing in non-primetime programming hours on Canal 4, launched November 1, 1993 in a partnership with local media company Televisa. The shopping channel, called CVC, which stood for ‚ÄúQuality, Value & Convenience‚Äù in Spanish, closed August 4, 1995 after a devaluation of the peso and drop in purchasing power during Mexico's recession. New frontiers with Douglas Briggs (1995-2005)Developing QVC's brand power= On September 29, 1994, QVC Vice President Douglas Briggs unveiled the QVC Local, a customized, $1.7 million state-of- the-art television studio in a bus, in Washington, D.C. In January 1995, QVC kicked off the \\"Quest for America's Best: 50 in 50 Tour,\\" a 50-week nationwide product search to promote local and regional products with live broadcasts from every State. The QVC Local traveled 88,796 miles of American road during the 50 in 50 Tour in 1995. Comcast and TCI spin-off company Liberty Media completed their acquisition of the company on February 2, 1995 and Diller resigned. Douglas S. Briggs was announced as QVC Inc. CEO on March 6, 1995, after overseeing the daily business of the company as president of QVC electronic retailing and executive vice president of QVC Inc. since February 1994. Briggs was tasked with boosting Diller's many start-up ventures, including QVC UK and Q2. On September 24, 1997 at 7pm ET, QVC signed off their live broadcast from their previous studio and celebrated the opening of their new broadcast center and corporate offices, Studio Park, a nearly 17-acre property with more than 58,000 square feet of filming studios in West Chester, Pennsylvania. QVC tested a retail concept in 2000 at The Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota with a limited-term lease on a 500 square-foot store. The next year, QVC signed a ten-year lease on a 2,500 square-foot store with broadcasting capabilities and opened QVC @ The Mall on August 8, 2001. The Mall of America store remained the only location for this format and the store closed at the conclusion of the ten-year lease on March 22, 2011. =Legal hurdles and Comcast's exit= In 1998, two former hosts filed a class-action lawsuit against QVC, claiming that they were discriminated against by the shopping channel based on their race. The lawsuit went on to state that QVC refused to allow non-white hosts any permanent daytime/primetime spots, which relegated them to the overnight hours, otherwise known as the \\"graveyard shift.\\" Because of this, the non-white hosts were paid considerably less than the white hosts. On July 3, 2003, Comcast sold its majority share to Liberty Media, which purchased the remaining 56.5% of QVC it didn‚Äôt already own for $7.9 billion. Comcast, for which QVC was a financial asset, not a strategic one, continued to carry QVC for its 21 million cable subscribers. On Wednesday, March 24, 2004, the FTC sued QVC over violating a June 2000 order barring the company from making misleading claims about dietary supplements. A March 2009 settlement with the FTC charged QVC with paying $6 million for consumer redress and a $1.5 million civil penalty and for QVC to discontinue the dietary supplements products. In 2006, the U.S. District Court in Philadelphia settled a dispute between QVC and HSN over the use of the phrase \\"Christmas in July,\\" QVC maintaining their use of it since 1987, and HSN claiming copyright on it in 2000. The Mike George Years (2006-present)New CEO, new brand identity= CEO Douglas Briggs announced his retirement in April 2005 and on November 1, 2005, Michael A. George, who previously served as chief marketing officer and general manager of the U.S. consumer business at Dell Inc, was named successor. George was named QVC CEO on April 15, 2006. On September 23, 2007, QVC U.S. rebranded itself, changing its logo on-air and online. The rebranding was accompanied by an advertising campaign with the tagline \\"iQdoU?\\" (\\"I shop QVC, do you?\\") that had preceded the rebrand with billboards in major U.S. cities. The iQdoU? campaign also included a \\"teaser\\" website. =Advancements in broadcasting technology and entering new markets= QVC was the first shopping network to offer a native high-definition simulcast channel in May 2009. Formery, the 4:3 cut for its standard definition feed in a 16:9 presentation was made to the right of the screen rather than on both sides of the 4:3 frame, allowing the network to place its graphics fully to the left and lower portions of the screen to maximize camera presentation space. Eventually, the standard definition feed was converted to a downscaled letterboxing of the 16:9 HD channel at the provider's headend level. On September 30, 2010, at 11 p.m., QVC began broadcasting in Italy, both on satellite and through digital terrestrial television. In 2012, QVC partnered with China National Radio to take over operations of its home shopping network and associated internet e-commerce site, CNR Mall. In 2014 the joint venture reached 89 million households. In 2013, QVC partnered with Ion Media Networks to bring its programming to broadcast television, through Ion Television. QVC began to be carried as the fifth digital subchannel on most Ion Television owned-and-operated stations beginning on August 5, 2013; due to technical limitations caused by the number of subchannels Ion requires its stations to carry, QVC is carried in a squeezed full-screen 4:3 format and is transmitted in standard definition. The channel is also broadcast on digital subchannels of low-powered television stations in selected areas. The broadcast service is branded as \\"QVC Over the Air\\", with an accompanying on-screen bug appearing on the lower right corner of the screen during the network's programming. After integrating their shopping experience with Facebook in 2008 and with Instagram in 2012, QVC launched toGather, a social shopping platform resembling Pinterest in July 2013. The site allowed members to set up a personalized newsfeed to view shopping recommendations from people and brands they chose to follow. QVC shut down the site in January 2015. On October 21, 2014, QVC returned to the NASDAQ, with trading names QVCA and QVCB. =Joining Zulily and HSN brands under Liberty Media/Qurate Retail Group= In August 2015, QVC acquired the online retailer Zulily for $2.4 billion. On July 6, 2017, QVC's parent company, Liberty Interactive, announced its intention to purchase the remaining 62% of stock it didn't already own of HSN, the rival home shopping channel. The all-stock deal is valued at $2.1 billion ($40.36 a share). In 2018, Liberty Interactive rebranded itself as Qurate Retail Group, trading under the new NASDAQ tickers QRTEA and QRTEB, with Mike George remaining as President and CEO. In 2018, Qurate named Leslie Ferraro as President of their QVC and HSN units. Ferraro concluded her 17-year run at The Walt Disney Company where she most recently served as co-chair of Disney Consumer Products and Interactive Media and president of Disney Consumer Products and reported to work at Qurate on September 16. On February 6, 2019, QVC again rebranded itself, the new logo with a square shape intended to resemble a computer or a phone screen emphasizing its digital and mobile platforms. The reimagined 'Q' in a sleek, mobile-friendly format, has a lever that is supposed to symbolize an open door, said Susan Ripke, QVC's vice president of brand strategy. On Monday, October 7, 2019, QVC ceased its 24/7 live broadcasting model in favor of airing nineteen hours of live and five hours of repeated programming daily. On November 22, 2019, QVC expanded to twenty hours of live programming daily. =Response to COVID-19 worldwide pandemic= As early as March 16, 2020, QVC saw changes to their operations due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, with on-air product representatives appearing via Skype from around the world, calling in to live broadcasts with program hosts and models practicing social distancing. QVC remained live on-air 20 hours a day, with QVC2 temporarily cutting back to one live hour per day. Employees not essential to the West Chester, Pennsylvania live broadcast shifted to remote work, while all fulfillment centers in Pennsylvania, Virginia, California, and North and South Carolina remained operational with the introduction of health and safety measures and enhanced sanitation practices. QVC2 On August 22, 2013, QVC launched a timeshift channel called QVC Plus (the first such channel operated by a home shopping network), made available initially on cable provider Bright House Networks and satellite provider DirecTV, which broadcasts the channel's programming on a three-hour tape delay.QVC Launches Second Linear Channel, Multichannel News, 23 August 2013. On April 1, 2017, QVC Plus was rebranded as QVC2 as a destination for more live programming, broadcasting live 12 hours a day, Monday through Friday from noon to midnight ET, and Saturdays and Sundays from 10am-10pm ET. After four months of reduced programming on QVC2 due to the global coronavirus pandemic, QVC2 ceased live programming on July 14, 2020, focusing thereafter only on repeated QVC programming. Beauty iQ On October 25, 2016, QVC announced the creation of Beauty iQ, a female-oriented television channel based entirely on beauty products. The network was launched on both DirecTV and Dish Network on October 31, 2016. Beauty iQ aired live programming Monday through Friday, 8pm- Midnight ET. Beauty iQ ceased live programming on March 13, 2019. Beginning April 23, 2019, QVC introduced Beauty iQ as their first digital-only channel, in order to better target its younger audience. QVC3 On April 1, 2019, Beauty iQ's broadcast channel was rebranded as QVC3, airing rebroadcasts of previously recorded QVC and QVC2 programming 24 hours a day. Operations All of QVC's operations (U.S., UK, Germany, Japan, Italy, and China) run 24 hours a day, although live programming hours vary between each region.

The applications typically use HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the client, PHP, ASP.NET (C#), Python, Go or Java in the server, and http for communications between client and server. A web content management system is often used to develop and maintain web applications.  Nature of employment  Web developers are found working in various types of organizations, including large corporations and governments, small and medium-sized companies, or alone as freelancers. Some web developers work for one organization as a permanent full-time employee, while others may work as independent consultants, or as contractors for an agency or at home personal use. Web developers typically handle both server-side and front-end logic. This usually involves implementing all the visual elements that users see and use in the web applications or use, as well as all the web services that are necessary to power the usage of their developing work. Salaries vary depending on the type of development work, location, and level of seniority.  Type of work performed  Modern web applications often contain three or more tiers, and depending on the size of the team a developer works on, he or she may specialize in one or more of these tiers - or may take a more interdisciplinary role. A web developer is usually classified as a Front-end web development or a Back-End Web Developer. For example, in a two-person team, one developer may focus on the technologies sent to the client such as HTML, JavaScript, CSS, ReactJs or AngularJS and on the server-side frameworks (such as Perl, Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, ASP, ASP.NET, Node.js) used to deliver content and scripts to the client. Meanwhile, the other developer might focus on the interaction between server-side frameworks, the webserver, and a database system. Further, depending on the size of their organization, the aforementioned developers might work closely with a content creator/copywriter, marketing adviser, user experience designer, web designer, web producer, project manager, software architect, or database administrator - or they may be responsible for such tasks as web design and project management themselves.  Educational and licensure requirements  There are no formal educational or licensure requirements to become a web developer. However, many colleges and trade schools offer coursework in web development. There are also many tutorials and articles, which teach web development, freely available on the web - for example Basic JavaScript Even though there are no formal educational requirements, dealing with web developing projects requires those who wish to be referred to as web developers to have advanced knowledge/skills in: * HTML/XHTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. * Server/client side architecture like all or some of the above mentioned. * Programming/Coding/Scripting in one of the many server-side languages or frameworks (e.g., Perl, Python, Ruby, PHP, Go, CFML - ColdFusion, Java, ASP, ASP.NET, Node.js) * Ability to utilize a database * Creating single page application with use of front-end tools such as EmberJS, ReactJS or AngularJS  See also  * Outline of web design and web development * Website design * Web development * Web engineering * Software developer References External links  * The US Department of Labor's description of Web Developers * / World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Category:Web development Category:Computer occupations ","title":"Web developer"},{"id":"460192","text":"Bookcase, c. 1830-40, probably from New York, maker unknown. Rosewood, mahogany, bird's eye maple veneer, marble, ormolu, and leather. In the collection of the Cincinnati Art Museum American Empire is a French-inspired Neoclassical style of American furniture and decoration that takes its name and originates from the Empire style introduced during the First French Empire period under Napoleon's rule. It gained its greatest popularity in the U.S. after 1820 and is considered the second, more robust phase of the Neoclassical style, which earlier had been expressed in the Adam style in Britain and Louis Seize, or Louis XVI, in France. As an early-19th-century design movement in the United States, it encompassed architecture, furniture and other decorative arts, as well as the visual arts. In American furniture, the Empire style was most notably exemplified by the work of New York cabinetmakers Duncan Phyfe and Paris-trained Charles-Honor√© Lannuier. Other major furniture centers renowned for regional interpretations of the American Empire style were Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. Many examples of American Empire cabinetmaking are characterized by antiquities-inspired carving, gilt-brass furniture mounts, and decorative inlays such as stamped-brass banding with egg-and-dart, diamond, or Greek-key patterns, or individual shapes such as stars or circles. The most elaborate furniture in this style was made around 1815-25, often incorporating columns with rope-twist carving, animal-paw feet, anthemion, stars, and acanthus-leaf ornamentation, sometimes in combination with gilding and vert antique (antique green, simulating aged bronze). The Red Room at the White House is a fine example of American Empire style. A simplified version of American Empire furniture, often referred to as the Grecian style, generally displayed plainer surfaces in curved forms, highly figured mahogany veneers, and sometimes gilt-stencilled decorations. Many examples of this style survive, exemplified by massive chests of drawers with scroll pillars and glass pulls, work tables with scroll feet and fiddleback chairs. Elements of the style enjoyed a brief revival in the 1890s with, particularly, chests of drawers and vanities or dressing tables, usually executed in oak and oak veneers. This Americanized interpretation of the Empire style continued in popularity in conservative regions outside the major metropolitan centers well past the mid-nineteenth century.

Other pseudonyms he used were Jakob Holst and Giorgio Focco. Life Kinau was the eldest child of fisherman Heinrich Wilhelm Kinau and his wife, Metta Holst, on the Elbe island of Finkenwerder (now part of Hamburg). In 1895 he was apprenticed to his uncle, the merchant August Kinau in Geestem√ºnde (today part of Bremerhaven), and from 1897 until 1898 he attended a commercial school in Bremerhaven. Later he was employed as an accountant in Meiningen, Bremen, Halle (Saale) and from 1907 at the shipping company Hamburg-Amerika-Linie in Hamburg. He married Rosa Elisabeth Reich in 1908, with whom he had three children. In 1904, Kinau started publishing poetry and stories in his native Low German dialect. In 1913, he published his most popular work, the novel Seefahrt ist Not!, in which he describes the life of the deep sea fishermen of his home island. In the First World War, Kinau was drafted into the German infantry in 1915. He fought in Serbia and Russia and later at Verdun. From 1916 he served in the German Navy, having requested the transfer. He served as a lookout on the light cruiser SMS Wiesbaden and died when the ship was sunk in the Battle of Jutland. His body was found on the Swedish shore on the island V√§der√∂bod midsummer's eve 1916 near Fj√§llbacka. He was later buried on the island of Stensholmen together with other German and British servicemen. He was recognised by carrying a poem, \\"Letzter Wunsch\\", which predicted his demise, in a hermetically sealed box in his pocket: Letzter Wunsch / Sterb ich auf der stolzen See, / g√∂nnt Gorch Fock ein Seemansgrab. / Bringt mich nicht zum Kirchhof hin, / senkt mich tief ins Meer hinab. / Segelmacher n√§h mich ein. / Steuermann, ein Bibelwort. / Junge, nimm deine M√ºtze mal ab... / Und dann sinnig √ºber Bord...

By the end of the war, the aircraft had only flown in the form of two unpowered prototypes. Design and development Initial design of the DFS 228 was undertaken before the outbreak of war as a research aircraft, the DFS 54, aimed at developing a high-altitude escape system for sailplanes. The project was suspended by the commencement of hostilities, but was revived in 1940 when the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM - \\"Reich Aviation Ministry\\") delivered the DFS with a requirement for a rocket-powered reconnaissance aircraft. The advantages of a sailplane for aerial reconnaissance included its silence, its low speed relative to the ground (allowing for higher-quality photography), and its potential ability to loiter above an area of interest. The project gave the DFS the opportunity to investigate two additional areas that it was interested in: the effects of wing sweep on sailplane design, and supersonic flight. The DFS 228 was designed by Felix Kracht and a first prototype was completed in March 1944; it was undergoing gliding tests by that August, carried aloft piggyback and strut-mounted atop a Dornier Do 217. The aircraft was of conventional sailplane arrangement with long, slender wings and designed to land on a retractable skid mounted on its belly. The nose of the aircraft could be separated in an emergency and formed a self-contained, pressurized escape capsule for the pilot. Because of problems with the cabin pressurization system, the second prototype accommodated the pilot in a prone position. Forty flights were made with the prototypes, and installation of a rocket was to have taken place in February 1945, but the project fell by the wayside as the war situation became more desperate. The second prototype was destroyed in an air raid in May 1945, and the first prototype was captured by U.S. troops in June. In 1946 it was sent to the United Kingdom for study where it was apparently scrapped in 1947, although its exact fate is unknown.

It is surrounded by Sinop to the east, Bartƒ±n, Karab√ºk to the west, √áankƒ±rƒ± to the south, √áorum to the southeast and the Black Sea to the north.  Statistics  The province has an area of 13,108 km2, and a population of 322,759 people (2006 est). The population was 361,222 people in 2010. The population density is 24.62 inhabitants per km2. The province center has a population of 64,606. Districts Kastamonu province is divided into 20 districts (capital district in bold): History It is not definitively known when Kastamonu was first founded. However, some sources dating back to the Early Middle Ages refer to the province. There are also some archeological findings that date to about 100,000 years that suggest the region was inhabited at that time. There are theories that the word Kastamonu derives from Castra Comnenus, the Latin name of the Byzantine castle built by the Comnenus dynasty. With the weakening of the Macedon kings, the Paphlagonia and Bithynia regions were engulfed by the newly formed Pontus kingdom. After the fall of the Pontus kingdom in first century BC, the area was incorporated by the Roman Empire by joining Paphlagonia with Bithynia. The capital center of this new city-state was Pompeiopolis, of which the remains still stand near Task√∂pr√º District in Kastamonu. The region then fell under the hegemony of the Seljuq dynasty (11th century CE), followed by the Danishmends, the Byzantines during the crusades, √áobanoƒülu and Jandarid beyliks. The Ottoman sultan Beyazid I conquered the province in 1392; however, following his capture and death in Battle of Ankara, the area was granted back to the √áandaroƒülu by the Mongol warlord Timur Lenk. Ottoman sultan Mehmed II incorporated the region back into the empire in 1461. During the Ottoman reign, the province boundaries were expanded up to reach Constantinople. The sultan's heirs were often sent to rule the province as governors to gain experience. After the First World War, during the battles of the Turkish War of Independence, Kastamonu played an important role in the supply of ammunition and troops to the ƒ∞nebolu‚ÄìAnkara front, transporting the war machines that would arrive to ƒ∞nebolu by sea from Istanbul (Constantinople) and the Soviets. When the Greeks noticed this activity, the ƒ∞nebolu port was bombarded from the sea on 9 June 1921.  Highlights  Ilƒ±su Waterfall, at K√ºre national Park, near Pƒ±narba≈üƒ±, Kastamonu, Turkey The province is mostly covered with forests, thanks to the mild Black Sea climate. Ilgaz National Park, where a micro-climate dominates due to the mountainous terrain and numerous streams, is 63 km south of the province center of Kastamonu. There is also a ski center with accommodation facilities located near the park. Ilgaz Mountain (highest peak 2587 m) dominates the south of the province where hiking and whitewater rafting is possible at the Ilgaz Stream. The Ilgarini cave at Cide, the Alinca cave at K√ºre and the International Equestrian Tourism Center of Daday are other notable attractions. A 12th-century Byzantine castle, the 13th-century Atabey Mosque and the Ibni Neccar Mosque also located in the province. The Mahmut Bey Mosque, located in the village of Kasaba is known for its elegant wood carvings. Gideros Bay, 13 km to Cide, is a holiday resort with pensions and fish restaurants. Gideros bay, Cide Gideros bay, Cide The ruins of the Roman city-state Pompeiopolis are found near Ta≈ük√∂pr√º. Kastamonu also has many mansions, which are traditionally built with an architectural style unique to this region. Many of these mansions have been restored following a 2000 declaration by the local government to preserve the historical texture.  Economy  According to the 2000 census, 77.5% of the labor force is occupied in agriculture. This ratio is higher than the country average. The second largest sector is public and private services (8.9%). Almost all of the arable land has permanent crops. The agricultural products make up about of 0.01% of the total in Turkey. A large portion of the agricultural produce consists of cereals. Thanks to its widespread forest areas (a total of 57% of the surface area), forestry is also an important industry. Industries largely consist of manufacturing of forestry, agriculture and mining products. Underground resources include copper, mercury, iron ore, chromium, manganese, asbestos, bauxite, graphite, phosphate, kaolinite, clay, limestone, quartz, marble, magnesite, fire clay, coal and nickel. There are also some natural thermal and mineral water springs, of which a few are suitable for economic investments. Kastamonu shares about 0.4% of the GDP, the composition of the GDP is as follows (1998 est.): *Agriculture: 32.8% *Communication and transport: 20% *Services: 16.8% *Industry: 9.5% Transportation is possible only through paved and unpaved highways; a railroad that will connect √áankƒ±rƒ±, Kastamonu and ƒ∞nebolu is under construction. Although the province has a 135 km long coastline to Black Sea, only ƒ∞nebolu has a small port and transportation by the sea is almost non-existent. There are around 112,000 telephone main lines in use, about 200,000 cellphone subscribers and 15,000 Internet users in the province. Miscellaneous *Handcrafts are abundant in Kastamonu, especially in rural areas. Most available are hand-woven textiles. *Several national and local annual festivities also take place in the province. *In a research conducted in the province, 812 different food are identified that are specific to the region. *The provincial soccer team Kastamonuspor competes in the Bank Asya 1st League (1st National Soccer League). *The founder of the Turkish republic, Atat√ºrk had declared the \\"dress code reform\\", which abolished the fez, in Kastamonu in 1925.

It determines the rank of the group of units in the ring of algebraic integers of a number field . The regulator is a positive real number that determines how \\"dense\\" the units are. The statement is that the group of units is finitely generated and has rank (maximal number of multiplicatively independent elements) equal to : where is the number of real embeddings and the number of conjugate pairs of complex embeddings of . This characterisation of and is based on the idea that there will be as many ways to embed in the complex number field as the degree ; these will either be into the real numbers, or pairs of embeddings related by complex conjugation, so that :. Note that if is Galois over then either =0 or =0. Other ways of determining and are * use the primitive element theorem to write , and then is the number of conjugates of that are real, the number that are complex; in other words, if is the minimal polynomial of over , then is the number of real roots and is the number of non-real complex roots of (which come in complex conjugate pairs); * write the tensor product of fields as a product of fields, there being copies of and copies of . As an example, if is a quadratic field, the rank is 1 if it is a real quadratic field, and 0 if an imaginary quadratic field. The theory for real quadratic fields is essentially the theory of Pell's equation. The rank is positive for all number fields besides and imaginary quadratic fields, which have rank 0. The 'size' of the units is measured in general by a determinant called the regulator. In principle a basis for the units can be effectively computed; in practice the calculations are quite involved when is large. The torsion in the group of units is the set of all roots of unity of , which form a finite cyclic group. For a number field with at least one real embedding the torsion must therefore be only . There are number fields, for example most imaginary quadratic fields, having no real embeddings which also have for the torsion of its unit group. Totally real fields are special with respect to units. If is a finite extension of number fields with degree greater than 1 and the units groups for the integers of and have the same rank then is totally real and is a totally complex quadratic extension. The converse holds too. (An example is equal to the rationals and equal to an imaginary quadratic field; both have unit rank 0.) The theorem not only applies to the maximal order but to any order . There is a generalisation of the unit theorem by Helmut Hasse (and later Claude Chevalley) to describe the structure of the group of -units, determining the rank of the unit group in localizations of rings of integers. Also, the Galois module structure of has been determined. The regulator Suppose that are a set of generators for the unit group modulo roots of unity. If is an algebraic number, write for the different embeddings into or , and set to 1 or 2 if the corresponding embedding is real or complex respectively. Then the matrix whose entries are , has the property that the sum of any row is zero (because all units have norm 1, and the log of the norm is the sum of the entries in a row). This implies that the absolute value of the determinant of the submatrix formed by deleting one column is independent of the column. The number is called the regulator of the algebraic number field (it does not depend on the choice of generators ). It measures the \\"density\\" of the units: if the regulator is small, this means that there are \\"lots\\" of units. The regulator has the following geometric interpretation. The map taking a unit to the vector with entries has an image in the -dimensional subspace of consisting of all vectors whose entries have sum 0, and by Dirichlet's unit theorem the image is a lattice in this subspace. The volume of a fundamental domain of this lattice is . The regulator of an algebraic number field of degree greater than 2 is usually quite cumbersome to calculate, though there are now computer algebra packages that can do it in many cases. It is usually much easier to calculate the product of the class number and the regulator using the class number formula, and the main difficulty in calculating the class number of an algebraic number field is usually the calculation of the regulator. Examples }}, where and . The area of the fundamental domain is approximately 0.910114, so the regulator of is approximately 0.525455. *The regulator of an imaginary quadratic field, or of the rational integers, is 1 (as the determinant of a 0 √ó 0 matrix is 1). *The regulator of a real quadratic field is the logarithm of its fundamental unit: for example, that of is . This can be seen as follows. A fundamental unit is , and its images under the two embeddings into are and . So the matrix is ::\\\\left[1\\\\times\\\\log\\\\left\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}\\\\right, \\\\quad 1\\\\times \\\\log\\\\left\\\\frac{-\\\\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}\\\\right\\\\ \\\\right]. *The regulator of the cyclic cubic field , where is a root of , is approximately 0.5255. A basis of the group of units modulo roots of unity is where and . Higher regulators A 'higher' regulator refers to a construction for a function on an algebraic -group with index that plays the same role as the classical regulator does for the group of units, which is a group . A theory of such regulators has been in development, with work of Armand Borel and others. Such higher regulators play a role, for example, in the Beilinson conjectures, and are expected to occur in evaluations of certain -functions at integer values of the argument. See also Beilinson regulator. Stark regulator The formulation of Stark's conjectures led Harold Stark to define what is now called the Stark regulator, similar to the classical regulator as a determinant of logarithms of units, attached to any Artin representation. -adic regulator Let be a number field and for each prime of above some fixed rational prime , let denote the local units at and let denote the subgroup of principal units in .

The -adic regulator is the determinant of the matrix formed by the -adic logarithms of the generators of this group. Leopoldt's conjecture states that this determinant is non-zero.Neukirch et al.

These add-ons usually add new game areas, weapons, objects, characters, or an extended storyline to an already-released game. While board game expansions are typically designed by the original creator, video game developers sometimes contract out development of the expansion pack to a third-party company, it may choose to develop the expansion itself, or it may do both. Board games and tabletop RPGs may have been marketing expansions since the 1970s, and video games have been releasing expansion packs since the 1980s, early examples being the Dragon Slayer games Xanadu Scenario II and Sorcerian.Sorcerian (PC), GameCola.net, 30 October 2010 Other terms for the concept are module and, in certain games' marketing, adventure. Characteristics The price of an expansion pack is usually much less than that of the original game. As expansion packs consist solely of additional content, most require the original game in order to play. Games with many expansions often begin selling the original game with prior expansions, such as The Sims Deluxe Edition (The Sims with The Sims: Livin' Large). These bundles make the game more accessible to new players. When games reach the end of their lifespan, the publisher often releases a 'complete' or 'gold' collection which includes the game and all its subsequent expansions. Stand- alone expansion packs Some expansion packs do not require the original game in order to use the new content, as is the case with Half-Life: Blue Shift, Uncharted: The Lost Legacy or Sonic & Knuckles. The same art and sound and code is used from the original game, and it takes place in the same active story as the original. In some cases, a stand-alone expansion such as Heroes of Might and Magic III: The Shadow of Death, or Dungeon Siege: Legends of Aranna includes the original game. Console game expansion packs Expansion packs are most commonly released for PC games, but are becoming increasingly prevalent for video game consoles, particularly due to the popularity of downloadable content. The increasing number of multi-platform games has also led to the release of more expansion packs on consoles, especially stand-alone expansion packs (as described above). Command & Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath, for example, requires the original Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars to play on the PC, but Xbox 360 versions of both the original Tiberium Wars and Kane's Wrath are available, neither of which require one another. Grand Theft Auto: London 1969 was the first expansion pack released for the PlayStation. The game required the player to insert the London disc, remove it, insert the original Grand Theft Auto disc, remove it, then insert the London media again in order to play. Sonic & Knuckles for the Mega Drive/Genesis was unusual in that it functioned as both a stand-alone cartridge and as an expansion pack for both Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and Sonic the Hedgehog 3. Collectible card game expansions Collectible card games, or CCGs for short, are typically released as expansion sets, composed of booster packs. CCGs may be referred to as \\"living\\" or \\"dead\\", and living CCGs are routinely published with supplementary expansions. CCGs generally don't have a core set that is reprinted indefinitely, instead, they are retired and replaced with new expansions on a quarterly or bi-annual basis. Expansions usually introduce new rules, or game mechanics, expanding the games library of cards and rules set.

The defining feature of a resultant force, or resultant force-torque, is that it has the same effect on the rigid body as the original system of forces.H. Dadourian, Analytical Mechanics for Students of Physics and Engineering, Van Nostrand Co., Boston, MA 1913 The point of application of the resultant force determines its associated torque. The term resultant force should be understood to refer to both the forces and torques acting on a rigid body, which is why some use the term resultant force-torque. Illustration The diagram illustrates simple graphical methods for finding the line of application of the resultant force of simple planar systems. #Lines of application of the actual forces {\\\\scriptstyle \\\\vec{F}_{1}} and \\\\scriptstyle \\\\vec{F}_{2} in the leftmost illustration intersect. After vector addition is performed \\"at the location of \\\\scriptstyle \\\\vec{F}_{1}\\", the net force obtained is translated so that its line of application passes through the common intersection point. With respect to that point all torques are zero, so the torque of the resultant force \\\\scriptstyle \\\\vec{F}_{R} is equal to the sum of the torques of the actual forces. #Illustration in the middle of the diagram shows two parallel actual forces. After vector addition \\"at the location of \\\\scriptstyle\\\\vec{F}_{2}\\", the net force is translated to the appropriate line of application, whereof it becomes the resultant force \\\\scriptstyle \\\\vec{F}_{R}. The procedure is based on decomposition of all forces into components for which the lines of application (pale dotted lines) intersect at one point (the so-called pole, arbitrarily set at the right side of the illustration). Then the arguments from the previous case are applied to the forces and their components to demonstrate the torque relationships. #The rightmost illustration shows a couple, two equal but opposite forces for which the amount of the net force is zero, but they produce the net torque \\\\scriptstyle\\\\tau = Fd where \\\\scriptstyle d is the distance between their lines of application. This is \\"pure\\" torque, since there is no resultant force. Bound vector A force applied to a body has a point of application. The effect of the force is different for different points of application. For this reason a force is called a bound vector, which means that it is bound to its point of application. Forces applied at the same point can be added together to obtain the same effect on the body. However, forces with different points of application cannot be added together and maintain the same effect on the body. It is a simple matter to change the point of application of a force by introducing equal and opposite forces at two different points of application that produce a pure torque on the body. In this way, all of the forces acting on a body can be moved to the same point of application with associated torques. A system of forces on a rigid body are combined by moving the forces to the same point of application and computing the associated torques. The sum of these forces and torques yields the resultant force- torque. Associated torque If a point R is selected as the point of application of the resultant force F of a system of n forces Fi then the associated torque T is determined from the formulas : \\\\mathbf{F} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\mathbf{F}_i, and : \\\\mathbf{T} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n (\\\\mathbf{R}_i-\\\\mathbf{R})\\\\times \\\\mathbf{F}_i. It is useful to note that the point of application R of the resultant force may be anywhere along the line of action of F without changing the value of the associated torque. To see this add the vector kF to the point of application R in the calculation of the associated torque, : \\\\mathbf{T} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n (\\\\mathbf{R}_i-(\\\\mathbf{R}+k\\\\mathbf{F}))\\\\times \\\\mathbf{F}_i. The right side of this equation can be separated into the original;formula for T plus the additional term including kF, : \\\\mathbf{T} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n (\\\\mathbf{R}_i-\\\\mathbf{R})\\\\times \\\\mathbf{F}_i - \\\\sum_{i=1}^n k\\\\mathbf{F}\\\\times \\\\mathbf{F}_i=\\\\sum_{i=1}^n (\\\\mathbf{R}_i-\\\\mathbf{R})\\\\times \\\\mathbf{F}_i, because the second term is zero. To see this notice that F is the sum of the vectors Fi which yields :\\\\sum_{i=1}^n k\\\\mathbf{F}\\\\times \\\\mathbf{F}_i = k\\\\mathbf{F}\\\\times(\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\mathbf{F}_i )=0, thus the value of the associated torque is unchanged. Torque-free resultant It is useful to consider whether there is a point of application R such that the associated torque is zero. This point is defined by the property : \\\\mathbf{R} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{F} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\mathbf{R}_i \\\\times \\\\mathbf{F}_i, where F is resultant force and Fi form the system of forces. Notice that this equation for R has a solution only if the sum of the individual torques on the right side yield a vector that is perpendicular to F. Thus, the condition that a system of forces has a torque-free resultant can be written as :\\\\mathbf{F}\\\\cdot(\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\mathbf{R}_i \\\\times \\\\mathbf{F}_i )=0. If this condition is satisfied then there is a point of application for the resultant which results in a pure force. If this condition is not satisfied, then the system of forces includes a pure torque for every point of application. Wrench The forces and torques acting on a rigid body can be assembled into the pair of vectors called a wrench.R. M. Murray, Z. Li, and S. Sastry, A Mathematical Introduction to Robotic Manipulation, CRC Press, 1994If a system of forces and torques has a net resultant force F and a net resultant torque T, then the entire system can be replaced by a force F and an arbitrarily located couple that yields a torque of T. In general, if F and T are orthogonal, it is possible to derive a radial vector R such that \\\\mathbf{R}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{F} = \\\\mathbf{T} , meaning that the single force F, acting at displacement R, can replace the system. If the system is zero-force (torque only), it is termed a screw and is mathematically formulated as screw theory.R. S. Ball, The Theory of Screws: A study in the dynamics of a rigid body, Hodges, Foster & Co., 1876 J. M. McCarthy and G. S. Soh, Geometric Design of Linkages. 2nd Edition, Springer 2010 The resultant force and torque on a rigid body obtained from a system of forces Fi i=1,...,n, is simply the sum of the individual wrenches Wi, that is : \\\\mathsf{W} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\mathsf{W}_i = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n (\\\\mathbf{F}_i, \\\\mathbf{R}_i\\\\times\\\\mathbf{F}_i). Notice that the case of two equal but opposite forces F and -F acting at points A and B respectively, yields the resultant W=(F-F, A√óF - B√ó F) = (0, (A-B)√óF). This shows that wrenches of the form W=(0, T) can be interpreted as pure torques.

He is known for creating immersive sim games, which give players a wide variety of choices in how to progress. Consequences of those choices are then shown in the simulated game world in subsequent levels or missions. He is best known for the critically acclaimed video game Deus Ex that embodies the choice and consequence philosophy while combining elements of the first-person shooter, role-playing, and adventure game genres. In addition to Deus Ex, Spector is known for his work while employed by Looking Glass Studios, where he was involved in the creation of several acclaimed titles including Ultima Underworld, Ultima Underworld II, System Shock, and Thief: The Dark Project. He is employed by OtherSide Entertainment, where he is part of the development team for the upcoming game System Shock 3. Early life Spector grew up in Manhattan, which he described as a sometimes hostile environment where \\"short, pudgy, Jewish kids didn't fare well\\". He showed an intense devotion to whatever topic became his focus at any given time, from dinosaurs and airplanes as a small boy, to an interest in law by the sixth grade. At age 13, Spector had decided he wanted to be a film critic, and by high school, his interests expanded to include cars and basketball. Spector and game designer Greg Costikyan were friends since high school. Spector attended Northwestern University in Illinois, still intending to become a film critic, stating that he \\"knew more about movies than a lot of my teachers\\". Spector earned his BS in Communications at Northwestern, and went on to earn his MA in Radio-TV-Film at the University of Texas at Austin in 1980. His thesis was a critical history of Warner Bros. cartoons. All through college, Spector enjoyed gaming, and recalls that he \\"played Avalon Hill games mainly, and a lot of OGRE and G.E.V. games, and Rivets from Metagaming. It was all boardgames until I became friends with science-fiction writers who were into D&D; games, so I gave the game a try. I was hooked.\\" Spector taught several undergraduate classes at the University of Texas at Austin, on the history, theory, and criticism of film.  Career = Tabletop role-playing games  In 1983, after a job at the Harry Ransom Center as an archivist in charge of the David O. Selznick collection ended after a few months, Spector recalls that he \\"was sitting around, wondering how I was going to pay the next month's rent, when I got a call from Chris Frink. He was a writer for a weekly entertainment magazine I used to edit in college. Anyway, he said that he was now editor of Space Gamer magazine and asked if I wanted a job. So, in the fall of 1983, I started as an editor.\\" Within a short time, Spector became the editor-in-chief for all Steve Jackson Games products, the company that owned and published Space Gamer magazine. Spector began producing role-playing games for the company, stating, \\"I supervised game development, typesetting, and the art and graphic departments.\\" Greg Costikyan developed Steve Jackson Games' first complete role-playing system, Toon (1984), based on an idea by Jeff Dee; Costikyan intended the game to be an article in Fantasy Gamer magazine, but Spector liked it enough that he expanded it into a full game. Spector wrote the Paranoia game supplement Send in the Clones (1985) with Allen Varney. Spector also worked on the GURPS role-playing game. In March 1987 he was hired by TSR, initially working on games such as Top Secret/S.I. and the Marvel Super Heroes role-playing game. He also worked on The Bullwinkle and Rocky Party Roleplaying Game, and the second edition AD&D; rules set, as well as board games, choose-your-own-adventure books, and novels. Spector spent some time in TSR's R&D; department, helping launch, among other things, Spelljammer.  Origin and Looking Glass  In 1989, Spector entered the video game industry and joined Origin, where he co-produced Ultima VI and Wing Commander and produced Ultima Underworld and Ultima Underworld II, Ultima VII Part Two: Serpent Isle, System Shock, Wings of Glory, Bad Blood, Martian Dreams, and others. He later became general manager of Looking Glass Austin. He worked briefly on Dark Camelot, which later became Thief: The Dark Project. However, Spector left Looking Glass soon afterward, just before Thief shipped, to pursue other interests. According to Spector, his decision to dissolve the Austin branch was prompted by the company's ongoing financial struggles and the realization that \\"continued existence of the Austin Studio was going to jeopardise the existence of Looking Glass overall\\".  Ion Storm  In 1996, Spector was about to sign a contract with EA to do an unannounced project (which was revealed to be a \\"Command & Conquer Role-Playing Game\\") when he got a call from John Romero to join him at Ion Storm; Romero persuaded Spector by offering him the chance to make the game of his dreams with no creative interference and a big marketing budget. Spector later agreed. In 1997 he founded Ion Storm's Austin development studio, and his \\"dream project\\" later became the award-winning action/RPG called Deus Ex. As Ion Storm studio director, he oversaw development of Deus Ex: Invisible War (2003) and Thief: Deadly Shadows (2004). In 2004, Spector left Ion Storm to \\"pursue personal interests outside the company\\". Ion Storm was closed by owners Eidos Interactive in February 2005.  Disney  Spector in 2006 In 2005, it was announced that he had established a new studio Junction Point Studios. Somewhere between the end of 2005 and mid-2007, Junction Point Studios and Warren worked on an additional Episode for Half-Life 2 that was ultimately cancelled by Valve. A job advertisement for the studio called for artists for a game that has \\"classic Hollywood cartoons\\" featuring \\"cartoon mice, cats and wabbits\\". On July 13, 2007, it was announced that Disney Interactive had acquired Junction Point Studios. His first project with Disney Interactive was a project involving Disney characters, titled Epic Mickey. The game is a steampunk-themed and designed exclusively for the Wii; the game was released in 2010. In January 2013, it was announced that Warren Spector had left Disney Interactive following the closure of Junction Point Studios.  University of Texas  After leaving Disney Interactive, Spector worked with the University of Texas at Austin to build a new post-baccalaureate game development program ‚Äì the Denius-Sams Gaming Academy. He worked with UT staff to create a curriculum and plan out courses and labs.  OtherSide Entertainment  In February 2016, Spector announced he had joined OtherSide Entertainment, a studio formed by Paul Neurath in 2014 and includes several previous Looking Glass developers, as their Studio Director, after having been in an advisory role from its inception. He will be helping the studio with their current development of System Shock 3 and Underworld Ascendant, the spiritual successor to Ultima Underworld which both Spector and Neurath worked on in the early 1990s. Though Spector had completed two-and-a-half years of a three-year tenure at the University of Texas, he jumped at the chance to work on a System Shock when Neurath approached him with the offer. He also believed the opportunity would help garner good favor from players that had been disappointed by his choice to work on Epic Mickey, even though he states that game had still been based on his past design philosophy used in the development of System Shock and Deus Ex. Personal life Warren met Caroline Chase in 1984 at a comic book store in Austin, Texas, where she was employed. After Chase got a job at Steve Jackson Games, the two began a relationship. They were married on April 11, 1987. The couple sometimes worked together, such as on game supplements for the Marvel Super Heroes role-playing game. The two reside in Austin, Texas. Caroline is a fantasy writer.

It is not a true cedar of the genus Cedrus. Distribution Thuja plicata is among the most widespread trees in the Pacific Northwest. It is associated with Douglas-fir and western hemlock in most places where it grows. It is found at the elevation range of sea level to a maximum of above sea level at Crater Lake in Oregon. In addition to growing in lush forests and mountainsides, western redcedar is also a riparian tree, growing in many forested swamps and streambanks in its range. The tree is shade-tolerant and able to reproduce under dense shade. It has been introduced to other temperate zones, including western Europe, Australia (at least as far north as Sydney), New Zealand, the eastern United States (at least as far north as Central New York), and higher elevations of Hawaii. The species is naturalized in Britain. Description Thuja plicata is a large to very large tree, ranging up to tall and in trunk diameter. Trees growing in the open may have a crown that reaches the ground, whereas trees densely spaced together will exhibit a crown only at the top, where light can reach the leaves. It is long-lived; some individuals can live well over a thousand years, with the oldest verified being 1460 years. The foliage forms flat sprays with scale- like leaves in opposite pairs, with successive pairs at 90 degrees to each other. The foliage sprays are green above and green marked with whitish stomatal bands below; they are strongly aromatic, with a scent reminiscent of pineapple when crushed. The individual leaves are long and broad on most foliage sprays, but up to long on strong-growing lead shoots. The cones are slender, long, and broad, with 8 to 12 (rarely 14) thin, overlapping scales. They are green to yellow-green, ripening brown in fall about six months after pollination, and open at maturity to shed the seeds. The seeds are 4 to 5 mm long and broad, with a narrow papery wing down each side. The pollen cones are long, red or purple at first, and shed yellow pollen in spring. Thuja bark ≈Åazienki.JPGThe bark is fibrous and longitudinally fissured. Thuja plicata kz3.JPGThe leaves have white markings on the undersides of the flat foliage sprays. Thuja plicata 21 4 2017 Kaisaniemi 0016 (cropped).jpgA shoot with pollen cones. Thuja plicata 43569.JPGA shoot with mature seed cones, Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest Taxonomy and name Keats Island, British Columbia, in May 2017 Thuja plicata is one of two Thuja species native to North America, the other being Thuja occidentalis. The species name plicata derives from the Latin word and means \\"folded in plaits\\" or \\"braided,\\" a reference to the pattern of its small leaves. Most authorities, both in CanadaBritish Columbia Forests & Range Tree Book: Thuja plicataBritish Columbia Tree Species Compendium Western redcedar and the United States cite the English name in two words as western redcedar, or occasionally hyphenated as western red-cedar, to indicate it is not a true cedar (Cedrus), but it is also cited as western red cedar in some popular works. In the American horticultural trade, it is also known as the giant arborvitae, by comparison with arborvitae for its close relative Thuja occidentalis. Other names include giant redcedar, Pacific redcedar, shinglewood, British Columbia cedar, canoe cedar, and red cedar. Arborvitae comes from the Latin for \\"tree of life\\"; coincidentally, Native Americans of the West coast also address the species as \\"long life maker\\". One endonymous name for the tree is the Halkomelem word ,Dictionary of Upriver Halkomelem, Volume II pp. 1605. Galloway, Brent Douglas from the roots , meaning \\"scratch\\" or \\"line\\", and , \\"bark\\";Dictionary of Upriver Halkomelem, Volume I pp. 996. Galloway, Brent Douglas the former root may be in reference to both the lined or \\"folded/braided\\" appearance of the bark and the tree's ubiquity in carving and other forms of woodwork. Pathology Western redcedar shows susceptibility of varying degrees to the following soil pathogens: Armillaria ostoyae, Fomitopsis pinicola, Heterobasidion annosum, Phaeolus schweinitzii, Phellinus weirii, Rhizinia undulata, and Postia sericeomollis. While western redcedar is a host to P. weirii, the fungus which causes the disease laminated root rot, redcedar is rated as resistant while other conifers are rated as highly susceptible or susceptible. Instead of laminated root rot, P. weirri in western redcedar expresses as a butt rot that can extend 2-3 m up the boles of living trees with the most extreme cases reaching 10 m. While the heart rot caused by the redcedar form of P. weirii does not kill the tree outright, it does severely weaken the lower portion of the bole which makes the tree highly susceptible to stem breakage. P. sericeomollis is responsible for brown cubical butt and pocket rot of cedar. It is the second-most common cause of decay in western redcedar following P. weirii. Rather than forming a single column of decay in the heartwood, though, P. sericeomollis tends to cause rings or pockets of decay in the lower bole. In addition to P. weirii, western redcedar is also less susceptible to H. annosum and A. ostoyae than other conifer species. Studies have found that western redcedar produces a phytochemical called thujaplicin which has been credited with granting the species its natural resistance to fungal attacks. Because of these natural defenses, it has been suggested that western redcedar may serve as a suitable alternative to other conifers when regenerating a site affected by these pathogens.Minore, D. (1990). Western redcedar. In Silvics of North America vol.1: Conifers. (1990). Burns, R.M. & Honkala, B.H. (tech. Coords). Agriculture Handbook 654. USDA Forest Service: Washington DC. Insects It attracts the western cedar borer and cedar bark beetle. Notable specimens The \\"Quinault Lake Redcedar\\" was the largest western redcedar in the world. The largest living specimen is the Cheewhat Giant, in Pacific Rim National Park Reserve on Vancouver Island, at . The tallest known individual is the Willaby Creek Tree south of Lake Quinault, in height. The \\"Quinault Lake Redcedar\\" was the largest known western redcedar in the world, with a wood volume of . Located near the northwest shore of Lake Quinault north of Aberdeen, Washington, about from the Pacific Ocean, it was one-third the volume of the largest known tree, a giant sequoia named \\"General Sherman\\". The Quinault Lake Redcedar was tall with a diameter of at breast height. The \\"Quinault Lake Red Cedar\\" was destroyed by a series of storms in 2014 and 2016 and is now only a glorified stump. The fifth known largest was the Kalaloch Cedar in the Olympic National Park, at , until it was destroyed by storm in March 2014.Exotic Hikes, \\"Olympic National Park‚Äôs Kalaloch Cedar Destroyed by Storm\\" A redcedar over tall, in diameter, and over 700 years old stood in Cathedral Grove on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, before it was set on fire and destroyed by vandals in 1972. That tree now lies in \\"Giant's Grave\\", a self-dug 'grave' created by the force of its own impact.Picture of the Cathedral Grove stump. Uses=Timber National Assembly for Wales The soft red-brown timber has a tight, straight grain and few knots. It is valued for its distinct appearance, aroma, and its high natural resistance to decay, being extensively used for outdoor construction in the form of posts, decking, shingles, and siding. It is commonly used for the framing and longwood in lightweight sail boats and kayaks. In larger boats it is often used in sandwich construction between two layers of epoxy resin and/or fibreglass or similar products. Due to its light weight ‚Äì dried ‚Äì it is about 30% lighter than common boat building woods, such as mahogany. For its weight it is quite strong but can be brittle. It glues well with epoxy resin or resorcinol adhesive. The wood typically used as an insect-repelling closet lining and to make cedar chests is a different species, Juniperus virginiana (also known as red cedar). Its light weight, strength, and dark, warm sound make it a popular choice for guitar soundboards. Cultivation Like its relative Thuja occidentalis and many other conifer species, Thuja plicata is grown as an ornamental tree, and for screens and hedges, throughout the world in gardens and parks. A wide variety of forms, sizes, and colours is available. ;Cultivars The following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit: *'Atrovirens' *'Aurea' *'Stoneham gold' *'Whipcord'  Other uses  It is also widely used throughout Europe and America for making beehive frames.  Chemistry  The heartwood of western red cedar contains different chemical substances, such as plicatic acid, thujaplicatin methyl ether, hinokitiol and other thujaplicins, Œ≤-thujaplicinol, thujic acid, methyl thujate, 1,4-cineole and Œ≥-eudesmol. Plicatic acid is believed to be the main irritant and contact allergen responsible for provoking allergic reactions and asthma exaggeration and leading to occupational asthma in woodworkers that are exposed to western red cedar wood dust. Thujaplicins serve as natural fungicides, and thereby prevent the wood from rotting. This effect lasts around a century even after the tree is felled. However, thujaplicins are only found in older trees. Saplings that do not produce the chemical often rot at an early stage, causing some trees to grow with a somewhat hollow, rotten trunk. Due to their fungicidal and anti- browning properties, thujaplicins are used in agriculture for fungal diseases and to prevent post-harvest decay. Thujaplicins, as other tropolones, are potent chelating agents and bind divalent metal ions. Basic and animal studies have shown that thujaplicins may have other biological properties, including antibacterial, antiviral and antioxidant activities, however reliable evidence on their effectiveness is still lacking.  Essential oil  The essential oil of western red cedar leaves contains natural compounds, such as Œ±-thujone, Œ≤-thujone, fenchone, sabinene, terpinen-4-ol and beyerene, which have also been isolated from different other essential oils. Some of these substances are aroma compounds and are used in perfumery. Thujones are GABAA receptor competitive antagonists however because of their high toxicity and convulsive activity they do not have any pharmacological use.  Role in indigenous societies  Klallam people and canoe, ca. 1914 Western red cedar has an extensive history of use by Native Americans of coastal Oregon to southeast Alaska. Some northwest coast tribes refer to themselves as \\"people of the redcedar\\" because of their extensive dependence on the tree for basic materials. The wood has been used for constructing housing and totem poles, and crafted into many objects, including masks, utensils, boxes, boards, instruments, canoes, vessels, houses, and ceremonial objects. Western Red Cedar is also associated with a long tradition of curing and cooking fish over the open fire. Roots and bark are used for baskets, bowls, ropes, clothing, blankets, and rings. History A huge number of archaeological finds point to the continuous use of redcedar wood in native societies. Woodworking tools dating between 8000 and 5000 years ago, such as carved antlers, were discovered in shell middens at the Glenrose site, near Vancouver, British Columbia. In Yuquot, on the west coast of Vancouver Island, tools dating 4000 to 3000 years old have been found. The Musqueam site, also near Vancouver, yielded bark baskets woven in five different styles, along with ropes and ships dated to 3000 years ago. At Pitt River, adzes and baskets were dated around 2900 years aol. Wooden artifacts 1000 years old were unearthed on the east coast of Vancouver Island. Red cedar was used extensively wherever it was found along the northwest coast (British Columbia, Washington state, Parts of Alaska). Evidence of this use is found in CMTs (Culturally Modified Trees) that are found throughout the coast. When First Nations people removed the bark from cedars, it left a scar - which is considered a CMT. Other types of harvest (for planks, tinder, and other uses) leave different types of evidence of cultural modification. A legend amongst the Coast Salish peoples describes the origins of the western redcedar. In this legend, there was a generous man who gave the people whatever they needed. When the Great Spirit saw this, he declared that when the generous man died, a great redcedar tree will grow where he is buried, and that the cedar will be useful to all the people, providing its roots for baskets, bark for clothing, and wood for shelter.  Tools  The wood was worked primarily with the adze, which was preferred over all other tools, even ones introduced by colonizers. Alexander Walker, an ensign on the fur trade ship Captain Cook, reported that the indigenous peoples used an elbow adze, which they valued over tools brought by the Europeans, such as the saw or the axe, going so far as to modify traded tools back into an adze. Tools were generally made from stone, bone, obsidian, or a harder wood such as hemlock. A variety of hand mauls, wedges, chisels, and knives are also used. Excavations done at Ozette, Washington turned up iron tools nearly 800 years old, far before European contact. When James Cook passed the area, he observed that almost all tools were made of iron. There has been speculation on the origin of these iron tools. Some theories include shipwrecks from East Asia or possible contact with iron-using cultures from Siberia, as hinted in the more advanced woodworking found in northern tribes such as the Tlingit.DeCapua, pp. 16‚Äì20  Wood  A pole outside a six-post house at the University of British Columbia Harvesting redcedars required some ceremony and included propitiation of the tree's spirits as well as those of the surrounding trees. In particular, many people specifically requested the tree and its brethren not to fall or drop heavy branches on the harvester, a situation which is mentioned in a number of different stories of people who were not sufficiently careful. Some professional loggers of Native American descent have mentioned that they offer quiet or silent propitiations to trees which they fell, following in this tradition. Felling of large trees such as redcedar before the introduction of steel tools was a complex and time- consuming art. Typically the bark was removed around the base of the tree above the buttresses. Then some amount of cutting and splitting with stone adzes and mauls would be done, creating a wide triangular cut. The area above and below the cut would be covered with a mixture of wet moss and clay as a firebreak. Then the cut would be packed with tinder and small kindling and slowly burned. The process of cutting and burning would alternate until the tree was mostly penetrated through, and then careful tending of the fire would fell the tree in the best direction for handling. This process could take many days. Constant rotation of workers was involved to keep the fires burning through night and day, often in a remote and forbidding location. Once the tree was felled, the work had only just begun, as it then had to be stripped and dragged down to shore. If the tree was to become canoes, then it would often be divided into sections and worked into rough canoe shapes before transport. If it were to be used for a totem pole or building materials, it would be towed in the round to the village. Many trees are still felled in this traditional manner for use as totem poles and canoes, particularly by artists who feel that using modern tools is detrimental to the traditional spirit of the art. Non-traditionalists simply buy redcedar logs or lumber at mills or lumber yards, a practice that is commonly followed by most working in smaller sizes such as for masks and staves. Because felling required such an extraordinary amount of work, if only planks for housing were needed, these would be split from the living tree. The bark was stripped and saved, and two cuts were made at the ends of the planking. Then wedges would be pounded in along the sides and the planks slowly split off the side of the tree. Trees which have been so harvested are still visible in some places in the rainforest, with obvious chunks taken off of their sides. Such trees usually continue to grow perfectly well, since redcedar wood is resistant to decay. Planks are straightened by a variety of methods, including weighing them down with stones, lashing them together with rope, or forcing them between a line of stakes. Illustration of women pulling bark from a tree, from Indian Legends of Vancouver Island by Alfred Carmichael Redcedar wood is used to make huge monoxyla canoes in which the men went out to high sea to harpoon whales and conduct trade. One of those canoes, a craft dug out about a century ago, was bought in 1901 by Captain John Voss, an adventurer. He gave her the name of Tilikum (\\"Relative\\" in Chinook jargon), rigged her, and led her in a hectic three-year voyage from British Columbia to London. Redcedar branches are very flexible and have good tensile strength. They were stripped and used as strong cords for fishing line, rope cores, twine, and other purposes where bark cord was not strong enough or might fray. Both the branches and bark rope have been replaced by modern fiber and nylon cordage among the aboriginal northwest coast peoples, though the bark is still in use for the other purposes mentioned above.  Bark  At the right time of year, the bark is easily removed from live trees in long strips. It is harvested for use in making mats, rope and cordage, basketry, rain hats, clothing, and other soft goods. The harvesting of bark must be done with care, as stripping too much bark will kill the tree. To prevent this, the harvester usually only harvests from trees which have not been stripped before. After harvesting, the tree is not used for bark again, although it may later be felled for wood. Stripping bark is usually started with a series of cuts at the base of the tree above any buttresses, after which the bark is peeled upwards. To remove bark high up, a pair of platforms strung on rope around the tree are used and the harvester climbs by alternating between them for support. Since redcedars lose their lower branches as all tall trees do in the rainforest, the harvester may climb or more into the tree by this method. The harvested bark is folded and carried in backpacks. It can be stored for quite some time as mold does not grow on it, and is moistened before unfolding and working. It is then split lengthwise into the required width and woven or twisted into shape. Bark harvesting was mostly done by women, despite the danger of climbing 10 meters in the air, because they were the primary makers of bark goods. Today bark rope making is a lost art in many communities, although it is still practiced for decoration or art in a few places. Other uses of bark are still common for artistic or practical purposes. In recent years there has been a revival of cedar weaving in some communities, and along with it, new forms of cedar bark products. For example, in some recent weddings cedar roses are used to decorate the tables. Legal status Western red cedar is export-restricted in the United States under the Export Administration Regulations.  Health and safety  Western red cedar is highly allergenic and woodworkers or loggers who work with it may have adverse reactions, including the development of occupational asthma, exacerbation of existing asthma, reduction of lung function, and eye irritation. Approximately 5% of workers are allergic to western red cedar. The US Occupational Safety and Health Administration has set a permissible exposure limit for red cedar dust of 2.5 mg/m3 as a time-weighted average over 8 hours.

Water conservation includes all the policies, strategies and activities to sustainably manage the natural resource of fresh water, to protect the hydrosphere, and to meet the current and future human demand. Population, household size and growth and affluence all affect how much water is used. Factors such as climate change have increased pressures on natural water resources especially in manufacturing and agricultural irrigation. Many countries have already implemented policies aimed at water conservation, with much success. The goals of water conservation efforts include: * Ensuring the availability of water for future generations where the withdrawal of freshwater from an ecosystem does not exceed its natural replacement rate. * Energy conservation as water pumping, delivery and wastewater treatment facilities consume a significant amount of energy. In some regions of the world over 15% of total electricity consumption is devoted to water management. * Habitat conservation where minimizing human water usage helps to preserve freshwater habitats for local wildlife and migrating waterfowl, but also water quality. Strategies The key activities to conserve water are as follows: *Any beneficial reduction in water loss, use and waste of resources. *Avoiding any damage to water quality. *Improving water management practices that reduce the use or enhance the beneficial use of water. One of the strategies in water conservation is rain water harvesting. Digging ponds, lakes, canals, expanding the water reservoir, and installing rain water catching ducts and filtration systems on homes are different methods of harvesting rain water. Many people in many countries keep clean containers so they can boil it and drink it, which is useful to supply water to the needy. Harvested and filtered rain water can be used for toilets, home gardening, lawn irrigation, and small scale agriculture. Another strategy in water conservation is protecting groundwater resources. When precipitation occurs, some infiltrates the soil and goes underground. Water in this saturation zone is called groundwater. Contamination of groundwater causes the groundwater water supply to not be able to be used as a resource of fresh drinking water and the natural regeneration of contaminated groundwater can take years to replenish. Some examples of potential sources of groundwater contamination include storage tanks, septic systems, uncontrolled hazardous waste, landfills, atmospheric contaminants, chemicals, and road salts. Contamination of groundwater decreases the replenishment of available freshwater so taking preventative measures by protecting groundwater resources from contamination is an important aspect of water conservation. An additional strategy to water conservation is practicing sustainable methods of utilizing groundwater resources. Groundwater flows due to gravity and eventually discharges into streams. Excess pumping of groundwater leads to a decrease in groundwater levels and if continued it can exhaust the resource. Ground and surface waters are connected and overuse of groundwater can reduce and, in extreme examples, diminish the water supply of lakes, rivers, and streams. In coastal regions, over pumping groundwater can increase saltwater intrusion which results in the contamination of groundwater water supply. Sustainable use of groundwater is essential in water conservation. A fundamental component to water conservation strategy is communication and education outreach of different water programs. Developing communication that educates science to land managers, policy makers, farmers, and the general public is another important strategy utilized in water conservation. Communication of the science of how water systems work is an important aspect when creating a management plan to conserve that system and is often used for ensuring the right management plan to be put into action. \\"Water Conservation Day\\" is celebrated on 22nd of March.  Social solutions  Drip irrigation system in New Mexico Water conservation programs involved in social solutions are typically initiated at the local level, by either municipal water utilities or regional governments. Common strategies include public outreach campaigns,\\"Water - Use It Wisely.\\" U.S. multi-city public outreach program. Park & Co., Phoenix, AZ. Accessed 2010-02-02. tiered water rates (charging progressively higher prices as water use increases), or restrictions on outdoor water use such as lawn watering and car washing. Document No. EPA-832-B-02-003. Cities in dry climates often require or encourage the installation of xeriscaping or natural landscaping in new homes to reduce outdoor water usage. Most urban outdoor water use in California is residential, illustrating a reason for outreach to households as well as businesses. One fundamental conservation goal is universal metering. The prevalence of residential water metering varies significantly worldwide. Recent studies have estimated that water supplies are metered in less than 30% of UK households.\\"Time for universal water metering?\\" Innovations Report. May 2006. Although individual water meters have often been considered impractical in homes with private wells or in multifamily buildings, the US Environmental Protection Agency estimates that metering alone can reduce consumption by 20 to 40 percent. In addition to raising consumer awareness of their water use, metering is also an important way to identify and localize water leakage. Water metering would benefit society, in the long run, it is proven that water metering increases the efficiency of the entire water system, as well as help unnecessary expenses for individuals for years to come. One would be unable to waste water unless they are willing to pay the extra charges, this way the water department would be able to monitor water usage by the public, domestic and manufacturing services. Some researchers have suggested that water conservation efforts should be primarily directed at farmers, in light of the fact that crop irrigation accounts for 70% of the world's fresh water use. The agricultural sector of most countries is important both economically and politically, and water subsidies are common. Conservation advocates have urged removal of all subsidies to force farmers to grow more water-efficient crops and adopt less wasteful irrigation techniques. New technology poses a few new options for consumers, features such as full flush and half flush when using a toilet are trying to make a difference in water consumption and waste. It is also possible to use/\\"pollute\\" the water in stages (keeping use in flush toilets for last), hereby allowing more use of the water for various tasks within a same cycle (before it needs to be purified again, which can also be done in-situ). Earthships often use such a setup. Also available are modern shower heads that help reduce wasting water: Old shower heads are said to use 5-10 gallons per minute, while new fixtures available use 2.5 gallons per minute and offer equal water coverage. Another method is to recycle the water of the shower directly, by means a semi-closed system which features a pump and filter. Such a setup (called a \\"water recycling shower\\") has also been employed at the VIRTUe LINQ house. Besides recycling water, it also reuses the heat of the water (which would otherwise be lost).Team VIRTUe bouwt slim en duurzaam huis dat mens en technologie verbindtTeam VIRTUe presenting LINQ  Household applications  The Home Water Works website contains useful information on household water conservation. Contrary to the popular view that the most effective way to save water is to curtail water-using behavior (e.g., by taking shorter showers), experts suggest the most efficient way is replacing toilets and retrofitting washers; as demonstrated by two household end use logging studies in the US. Water-saving technology for the home includes: *Low-flow shower heads sometimes called energy-efficient shower heads as they also use less energy *Low-flush toilets, composting toilets and incinerating toilets. Composting toilets have a dramatic impact in the developed world, as conventional Western flush toilets use large volumes of water *Dual flush toilets include two buttons or handles to flush different levels of water. Dual flush toilets use up to 67% less water than conventional toilets *Faucet aerators, which break water flow into fine droplets to maintain \\"wetting effectiveness\\" while using less water. An additional benefit is that they reduce splashing while washing hands and dishes *Raw water flushing where toilets use sea water or non-purified water (i.e. greywater) *Wastewater reuse or recycling systems, allowing: **Reuse of graywater for flushing toilets or watering gardens **Recycling of wastewater through purification at a water treatment plant. See also Wastewater - Reuse *Rainwater harvesting *High-efficiency clothes washers *Weather-based irrigation controllers *Garden hose nozzles that shut off the water when it is not being used, instead of letting a hose run. *Low flow taps in wash basins *Swimming pool covers that reduce evaporation and can warm pool water to reduce water, energy and chemical costs. *Automatic faucet is a water conservation faucet that eliminates water waste at the faucet. It automates the use of faucets without the use of hands.  Commercial applications  Many water-saving devices (such as low-flush toilets) that are useful in homes can also be useful for business water saving. Other water-saving technology for businesses includes: *Waterless urinals (also can be installed in schools) *Waterless car washes *Infrared or foot-operated taps, which can save water by using short bursts of water for rinsing in a kitchen or bathroom *Pressurized waterbrooms, which can be used instead of a hose to clean sidewalks *X-ray film processor re-circulation systems *Cooling tower conductivity controllers *Water-saving steam sterilizers, for use in hospitals and health care facilities *Rain water harvesting *Water to Water heat exchangers.  Agricultural applications  center pivot design Water is a very important part in irrigation. Plants always take a lot of ground water thus ground water should be replenished. For crop irrigation, optimal water efficiency means minimizing losses due to evaporation, runoff or subsurface drainage while maximizing production. An evaporation pan in combination with specific crop correction factors can be used to determine how much water is needed to satisfy plant requirements. Flood irrigation, the oldest and most common type, is often very uneven in distribution, as parts of a field may receive excess water in order to deliver sufficient quantities to other parts. Overhead irrigation, using center-pivot or lateral-moving sprinklers, has the potential for a much more equal and controlled distribution pattern. Drip irrigation is the most expensive and least-used type, but offers the ability to deliver water to plant roots with minimal losses. However, drip irrigation is increasingly affordable, especially for the home gardener and in light of rising water rates. Using drip irrigation methods can save up to 30,000 gallons of water per year when replacing irrigation systems that spray in all directions. There are also cheap effective methods similar to drip irrigation such as the use of soaking hoses that can even be submerged in the growing medium to eliminate evaporation. As changing irrigation systems can be a costly undertaking, conservation efforts often concentrate on maximizing the efficiency of the existing system. This may include chiselling compacted soils, creating furrow dikes to prevent runoff, and using soil moisture and rainfall sensors to optimize irrigation schedules. Usually large gains in efficiency are possible through measurement and more effective management of the existing irrigation system. The 2011 UNEP Green Economy Report notes that \\"[i]mproved soil organic matter from the use of green manures, mulching, and recycling of crop residues and animal manure increases the water holding capacity of soils and their ability to absorb water during torrential rains\\",UNEP, 2011, Towards a Green Economy: Pathways to Sustainable Development and Poverty Eradication, www.unep.org/greeneconomy which is a way to optimize the use of rainfall and irrigation during dry periods in the season. = Water reuse = Water shortage has become an increasingly difficult problem to manage. More than 40% of the world's population live in a region where the demand for water exceeds its supply. The imbalance between supply and demand, along with persisting issues such as climate change and population growth, has made water reuse a necessary method for conserving water. There are a variety of methods used in the treatment of waste water to ensure that it is safe to use for irrigation of food crops and/or drinking water. Seawater desalination requires more energy than the desalination of fresh water. Despite this, many seawater desalination plants have been built in response to water shortages around the world. This makes it necessary to evaluate the impacts of seawater desalination and to find ways to improve desalination technology. Current research involves the use of experiments to determine the most effective and least energy intensive methods of desalination. Sand filtration is another method used to treat water. Recent studies show that sand filtration needs further improvements, but it is approaching optimization with its effectiveness at removing pathogens from water. Sand filtration is very effective at removing protozoa and bacteria, but struggles with removing viruses. Large-scale sand filtration facilities also require large surface areas to accommodate them. The removal of pathogens from recycled water is of high priority because wastewater always contains pathogens capable of infecting humans. The levels of pathogenic viruses have to be reduced to a certain level in order for recycled water to not pose a threat to human populations. Further research is necessary to determine more accurate methods of assessing the level of pathogenic viruses in treated wastewater.  Wasting of water  Leaking garden hose bib Wasting of water (also called \\"water waste\\" in the US) is the flip side of water conservation and, in household applications, it means causing or permitting discharge of water without any practical purpose. Inefficient water use is also considered wasteful. By EPA estimate, household leaks in the US can waste approximately 900 billion gallons (3.4 billion cubic meters) of water annually nationwide. Generally, water management agencies are reluctant or unwilling to give a concrete definition to the somewhat fuzzy concept of water waste. However, definition of water waste is often given in local drought emergency ordinances. One example refers to any acts or omissions, whether willful or negligent, that are ‚Äúcausing or permitting water to leak, discharge, flow or run to waste into any gutter, sanitary sewer, watercourse or public or private storm drain, or to any adjacent property, from any tap, hose, faucet, pipe, sprinkler, pond, pool, waterway, fountain or nozzle.‚Äù. In this example, the city code also clarifies that ‚Äúin the case of washing, ‚Äúdischarge,‚Äù ‚Äúflow‚Äù or ‚Äúrun to waste‚Äù means that water in excess of that necessary to wash, wet or clean the dirty or dusty object, such as an automobile, sidewalk, or parking area, flows to waste. Water utilities (and other media sources) often provide listings of wasteful water-use practices and prohibitions of wasteful uses. Examples include utilities in San Antonio, Texas. Las Vegas, Nevada, California Water Service company in California, and City of San Diego, California. The City of Palo Alto in California enforces permanent water use restrictions on wasteful practices such as leaks, runoff, irrigating during and immediately after rainfall, and use of potable water when non-potable water is available. Similar restrictions are in effect in the State of Victoria, Australia. Temporary water use bans (also known as \\"hosepipe bans\\") are used in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.Water UK http://www.water.org.uk/consumers/tubs Strictly speaking, water that is discharged into the sewer, or directly to the environment is not wasted or lost. It remains within the hydrologic cycle and returns to the land surface and surface water bodies as precipitation. However, in many cases, the source of the water is at a significant distance from the return point and may be in a different catchment. The separation between extraction point and return point can represent significant environmental degradation in the watercourse and riparian strip. What is \\"wasted\\" is the community's supply of water that was captured, stored, transported and treated to drinking quality standards. Efficient use of water saves the expense of water supply provision and leaves more fresh water in lakes, rivers and aquifers for other users and also for supporting ecosystems. A concept that is closely related to water wasting is \\"water-use efficiency.\\" Water use is considered inefficient if the same purpose of its use can be accomplished with less water. Technical efficiency derives from engineering practice where it is typically used to describe the ratio of output to input and is useful in comparing various products and processes. For example, one showerhead would be considered more efficient than another if it could accomplish the same purpose (i.e., of showering) by using less water or other inputs (e.g., lower water pressure). Urinals are more efficient than toilet stalls in public restrooms for men or boys in situations where the user only needs to urinate; and although this is a natural function, urinals offer considerably less privacy. The technical efficiency concept is not useful in making decisions of investing money (or resources) in water conservation measures unless the inputs and outputs are measured in value terms. This expression of efficiency is referred to as economic efficiency and is incorporated into the concept of water conservation.

It is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant. Taxonomy The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. There are over 30 synonyms in Kew's Plants of the World Online database. Common names Additional common names include swamp cedar, American arborvitae, and eastern arborvitae. The name arborvitae is particularly used in the horticultural trade in the United States. It is Latin for \\"tree of life\\" - due to the supposed medicinal properties of the sap, bark, and twigs.Thuja, American Cancer Society, last revised 6/19/2007. available online It is sometimes called white-cedar (hyphenated) or whitecedar (one word) to distinguish it from Cedrus, a distantly related genus of trees also known as cedars. Description Unlike the closely related western red cedar (Thuja plicata), northern white cedar is only a small or medium-sized tree, growing to a height of tall with a trunk diameter, exceptionally to tall and diameter. The tree is often stunted or prostrate in less favorable locations. The bark is red-brown, furrowed and peels in narrow, longitudinal strips. Northern white cedar has fan-like branches and scaly leaves. The foliage forms in flat sprays with scale-like leaves long. The seed cones are slender, yellow-green, ripening to brown, long and broad, with 6-8 overlapping scales. They contain about 8 seeds each. The branches may take root if the tree falls. Distribution Northern white cedar is native to an area in the southern part of eastern Canada and the adjacent part of the northern United States. It extends from southeastern Manitoba east throughout the Great Lakes region and into Ontario, Qu√©bec, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. There are isolated populations in west-central Manitoba, and to the south in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Ohio, and Illinois and in the Appalachian Mountains of Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia. In Canada, its range reaches the Arctic treeline and the southern tip of Hudson Bay. It grows mainly in places with cooler summers, with an average temperature of in July, and a shorter growing season, from 90 to 180 days. Ecology A swamp along the Superior Hiking Trail in November with white cedars (left) and other trees and shrubs Northern white cedar grows naturally in wet forests, being particularly abundant in coniferous swamps where other larger and faster- growing trees cannot compete successfully. It also occurs on other sites with reduced tree competition, such as cliffs. Although not currently listed as endangered, wild white cedar populations are threatened in many areas by high deer numbers; deer find the soft evergreen foliage a very attractive winter food, and strip it rapidly. The largest known specimen is tall and diameter, on South Manitou Island within Leelanau County, Michigan. Northern white cedar can be a very long-lived tree in certain conditions, with notably old specimens growing on cliffs where they are inaccessible to deer and wildfire; the oldest known living specimen is just over 1,100 years old, but a dead specimen with over 1,650 growth rings has been found. Despite their age, these very old trees are small and stunted due to the difficult growing conditions. The Witch Tree, a T. occidentalis growing out of a cliff face on Lake Superior in Minnesota, was described by the French explorer Sieur de la Verendrye as being a mature tree in 1731; it is still alive today. Old trees growing on a rock ledge in Potawatomi State Park, Wisconsin Specimens found growing on cliff faces in southern Ontario are the oldest trees in Eastern North America and all of Canada, growing to ages in excess of 1,653 years. Uses Thuja occidentalis is a tree with important uses in traditional Ojibwe culture. Honored with the name Nookomis Giizhik (\\"Grandmother Cedar\\"), the tree is the subject of sacred legends and is considered a gift to humanity for its myriad uses, among them crafts, construction, and medicine.Geniusz, Wendy Makoons (2009). Our Knowledge is not Primitive. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press It is one of the four plants of the Ojibwe medicine wheel, associated with the north. The foliage is rich in Vitamin C and is believed to be the annedda which cured the scurvy of Jacques Cartier and his party in the winter of 1535‚Äì1536. Due to the presence of the neurotoxic compound thujone, internal use can be harmful if used for prolonged periods or while pregnant. It is commercially used for rustic fencing and posts, lumber, poles, shingles and in the construction of log cabins. It is the preferred wood for the structural elements, such as ribs and planking, of birchbark canoes and the planking of wooden canoes. The essential oil within the plant has been used for cleansers, disinfectants, hair preparations, insecticides, liniment, room sprays, and soft soaps. There are some reports that the Ojibwa made a soup from the inner bark of the soft twigs. Others have used the twigs to make teas to relieve constipation and headache. Cultivation A grove of a columnar ornamental variety in Powsin Botanical Garden, Warsaw, Poland Thuja occidentalis is widely used as an ornamental tree, particularly for screens and hedges, in gardens, parks and cemeteries. Over 300 cultivars exist, showing great variation in colour, shape and size, with some of the more common ones being: 'Degroot's Spire', 'Ellwangeriana', 'Hetz Wintergreen', 'Lutea', 'Rheingold', 'Smaragd' (a.k.a. 'Emerald Green'), 'Techny', and 'Wareana'. It was introduced into Europe as early as 1540. The following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit: 'Danica', 'Holmstrup', 'Rheingold', and 'Smaragd'.

Although originally informed by and borrowing from classical, modern, and jazz styles, it has come to incorporate elements from many styles of dance. Due to its technical similarities, it is often perceived to be closely related to modern dance, ballet, and other classical concert dance styles. In terms of the focus of its technique, contemporary dance tends to combine the strong but controlled legwork of ballet with modern that stresses on torso. It also employs contract-release, floor work, fall and recovery, and improvisation characteristics of modern dance. Unpredictable changes in rhythm, speed, and direction are often used, as well. Additionally, contemporary dance sometimes incorporates elements of non-western dance cultures, such as elements from African dance including bent knees, or movements from the Japanese contemporary dance, Butoh. History Contemporary dance performed by Le Sacre Contemporary dance draws on both classical ballet and modern dance, whereas postmodern dance was a direct and opposite response to modern dance. Merce Cunningham is considered to be the first choreographer to \\"develop an independent attitude towards modern dance\\" and defy the ideas that were established by it. In 1944 Cunningham accompanied his dance with music by John Cage, who observed that Cunningham's dance \\"no longer relies on linear elements (...) nor does it rely on a movement towards and away from climax. As in abstract painting, it is assumed that an element (a movement, a sound, a change of light) is in and of itself expressive; what it communicates is in large part determined by the observer themselves.\\" Cunningham formed the Merce Cunningham Dance Company in 1953 and went on to create more than one hundred and fifty works for the company, many of which have been performed internationally by ballet and modern dance companies. Cunningham's key ideas Cunningham's key ideas include- * Contemporary dance does refuse the classical ballet's leg technique in favor of modern dance's stress on the torso * Contemporary dance is not necessarily narrative form of art * Choreography that appears disordered, but nevertheless relies on technique * Unpredictable changes in rhythm, speed, and direction * Multiple and simultaneous actions * Suspension of perspective and symmetry in ballet scenic frame perspective such as front, center, and hierarchies * Creative freedom * \\"Independence between dance and music\\" * Dance to be danced, not analyzed * Innovative lighting, sets, and costumes in collaboration with Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, and Jasper Johns Other pioneers of contemporary dance (the offspring of modern and postmodern) include Ruth St. Denis, Doris Humphrey, Mary Wigman, Pina Bausch, Francois Delsarte, √âmile Jaques-Dalcroze, Paul Taylor, Rudolph von Laban, Loie Fuller, Jos√© Lim√≥n and Marie Rambert. Choreographer's role There is usually a choreographer who makes the creative decisions and decides whether the piece is an abstract or a narrative one. Dancers are selected based on their skill and training. The choreography is determined based on its relation to the music or sounds that is danced to. The role of music in contemporary dance is different from in other genres because it can serve as a backdrop to the piece. The choreographer has control over the costumes and their aesthetic value for the overall composition of the performance and also in regards to how they influence dancers‚Äô movements. Dance technique Le Sacre du Tempo Dance techniques and movement philosophies employed in contemporary dance may include Contemporary ballet, Dance improvisation, Interpretive dance, Lyrical dance, Modern dance styles from United States such as Graham technique, Humphrey-Weidman technique and Horton technique, Modern dance of Europe Bartenieff Fundamentals and the dance technique of Isadora Duncan (also see Free dance). Contemporary dancers train using contemporary dance techniques as well as non-dance related practices such as Pilates, Yoga, the acting practice of Corporeal mime - √âtienne Decroux technique and somatic practices such as Alexander technique,The Juilliard School - Dance Division - Curriculum Outline Feldenkrais Method, Sullivan Technique and Franklin-Methode, American contemporary techniques such as Jos√© Lim√≥n technique and Hawkins technique and Postmodern dance techniques such as Contact improvisation and Cunningham technique, and Release technique. Some well-known choreographers and creators of contemporary dance created schools and techniques of their own. Paul Taylor developed a dance technique called Taylor technique, which is now taught at modern dance schools like The Ailey School in New York City. Dance and Technology Reflecting the situation in society at large, contemporary dance is increasingly incorporating overtly technological elements, and, in particular, robots. Robotics engineer/dancer Amy LaViers, for example, has incorporated cell phones in a contemporary dance piece calling attention to the issues surrounding our ever-increasing dependence on technology.

The film provoked controversy in the United Kingdom and the United States because of its graphic depictions of sado-masochism.  Plot  Olivier (Depardieu) is a small-time crook. He and a friend happen to meet a woman, Ariane (Ogier) whose plumbing needs to be fixed. They fix the pipes and learn that the landlord downstairs is away. They take the opportunity to burgle him. However they discover that in fact downstairs Ariane has a torture chamber‚Äîshe is a professional dominatrix. At Ariane's request, Olivier assists her with her work and slowly becomes obsessed with her, but struggles with her sado-masochistic activities. Olivier tries to understand and take control of Ariane, whom he believes frightened in her job; however, as their love blossoms, their natural roles of dominant and submissive cannot be overcome.

Examiners' reports agreed that the film was well made and not exploitative, but under their censorship standards of the time it had to be refused a certificate: \\"the actual scenes of fetishism are miles in excess of anything we have ever passed in this field\\".BBFC examiners' report, 14 October 1976, PDF included on BFI Ma√Ætresse DVD. This meant that it could not be shown in a public cinema, but in 1980, it was given showings in private clubs and subsequently re-examined, and in February 1981 was granted an X certificate in a cut version. To gain the certificate, a total of 4 minutes and 47 seconds' footage was removed from three scenes, most notably the scene in which Ariane nails a client's penis to a plank of wood, an act that was not simulated (and was not performed onscreen by Bulle OgierBulle Ogier interview, Films Illustrated magazine, October 1980.). In 2003, the film was submitted for a third time, and was passed for an 18 certificate with all previous cuts waived. In November 2012, Ma√Ætresse was released in a new Blu-ray Disc/DVD dual-format edition by the BFI, its first appearance on Blu-ray Disc. The film was rated X in the United States. The film was rated R18 in New Zealand for sexual violence, sex scenes and offensive language.

It is native to northeastern parts of East Asia and North Asia, but is also now naturalised as an introduced species in other regions of the Asian continent. Description A monoecious tree, it is small, slow- growing, reaching and trunk diameter (exceptionally to tall and diameter in very old trees). The foliage forms in flat sprays with scale-like leaves long, which are bright green in colour but may turn brownish or coppery orange in winter. The cones are long, green ripening brown in about eight months from pollination, and have 6‚Äì12 thick scales arranged in opposite pairs. The seeds are long, with no wing. The branches are relatively short, loosely arranged and, usually, sharply directed upwards, and the bark, brownish, is detached in narrow vertical strips. The twigs are compressed and are arranged in vertical planes. The leaves, arranged in four rows, fleshy, opposite, decussate, truncated, imbricated as adults, somewhat curved inwards, of uniform green color and with a resiniferous gland on the underside. The female cones, of pink-salmon color and later bluish-greenish when immature, centimetric and of annual maturation, are oval with 6-8 flattened, thick scales, coriaceous and provided with an apical hook. Kremer BP, Trees, Editorial Blume, Barcelona, 1986, Thuja orientalis L., p. 78 Taxonomy Although generally accepted as the only member of its genus, it has been suggested that the closely related species Microbiota decussata could be included in Platycladus, but this is not widely followed. Other fairly close relatives are Juniperus and Cupressus, both of these genera being graft-compatible with Platycladus. In older texts, Platycladus was often included in Thuja, which is reflected in one of its common names, \\"oriental thuja\\". But it is only distantly related to the genus Thuja. Differences include its distinct cones, wingless seeds, and its almost scentless foliage. Etymology The binomial Platycladus means \\"with broad or flattened shoots\\". The qualifier orientalis refers to its native habitat in China. The common name 'arborvitae' is from Latin, 'tree of life', and is based on its association with long life and vitality in Buddhist thought in China. This is probably based on the tree's unchanging evergreen nature in the cold dry climate of northwest China, and its longevity; some of the larger specimens planted around Buddhist temples in China are said to be in excess of 1,000 years old. It is called () in Chinese. Distribution It is native to northwestern China, but it is delicate to distinguish the areas where they are native safely from those where they have been introduced. It is distributed in Manchuria, Russian Far East (Amur and Khabarovsk), and now it is naturalised in Korea, Japan, India, Florida and Iran as well. It is also cultivated in many parts of the world in parks, gardens, home yards, cemeteries and for hedges.Armin Jagel, Veit Martin Doerken: Morphology and morphogenesis of the seed cones of the Cupressaceae - part II: Cupressoideae. Bull. CCP 4 (2), 2015, pp. 51-78 Uses Resistant to drought, it is very often used as an ornamental tree, both in its homeland, where it is associated with long life and vitality, and very widely elsewhere in temperate climates. It is suitable for form cuts and year-round opaque hedges, but also forms impressive slender solitary trees. Several cultivars have been selected, of which 'Aurea Nana' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. The wood is used in Buddhist temples both for (lavairos) construction work, and chipped, for incense burning. Its twigs and leaves contain 0.12% essential oil containing pinene and probably caryophyllene. The roots contain up to 2.75% of gasoline.Armin Jagel, Thomas St√ºtzel: Studies on the morphology and morphogenesis of the seed cones of Platycladus orientalis (L.)

The family moved to Kristinehamn in the year 1867. He later studied at Uppsala University and worked as a journalist in Karlstad.Gustaf Fr√∂ding, Swedish Lyric Poet by Charles Wharton Stork, (Cedar Falls, IA: The North American Review, 1916). Vol. 204, No. 733 (December), pp. 897-908. Poetry His poetry combines formal virtuosity with a sympathy for the ordinary, the neglected and the down-trodden, sometimes written in his own regional dialect. It is highly musical and lends itself to musical setting; many of his poems have been set to music and recorded by Swedish singers such as Olle Adolphson, Monica Zetterlund, the V√§rmland group Sven-Ingvars and the Swedish band Mando Diao. Fr√∂ding wrote openly about his personal problems with alcohol and women and had to face a trial for obscenity.  Sickness  Gustaf Fr√∂ding and Verner von Heidenstam dressed in togas, the day after Heidenstams marriage at Bl√• Jungfrun The latter part of his life he spent in different mental institutions and hospitals to cure his mental illness and alcoholism, and eventually diabetes. During the first half of the 1890s he spent a couple of years at the Suttestad institution in Lillehammer, Norway, where he finished his work on his third book of poetry St√§nk och flikar, which was published in 1896. He wrote much of the material at a mental institution in G√∂rlitz, Germany. In 1896 he moved back to Sweden. But as the year neared Christmas, his sister Cecilia made the difficult decision to make him stay at a hospital in Uppsala. Under the care of professor Frey Svenson Fr√∂ding got away from liquor and women, except one, Ida B√§ckman. To this day, people think that Ida B√§ckman wanted to marry Fr√∂ding and corrupt him in some way. Later she wrote books but they were always judged harshly and never got good reviews. She is about to have her name cleared in Sweden. Fr√∂ding never married Ida. She was never asked to stop visiting Fr√∂ding by professor Svenson and Cecilia Fr√∂ding. Instead Fr√∂ding grew fond of a nurse named Signe Trotzig. When he left hospital in Uppsala she stayed with him to the day he died. A play by Swedish playwright Gottfrid Grafstr√∂m, called Sjung vackert om k√§rlek, about Fr√∂ding's time at the mental institution in Uppsala was first performed at Dramaten in 1973 and has had periodic revivals since.

Geography and ecology Jiaozhou Bay is a natural inlet of the Yellow Sea (), with 10 to 15 meters depth to the seabed and deeper, dredged channels to three major ports around the bay: Qingdao, Huangdao, and Hongdao, all of which are ice-free during winter. It is located on the southern coast of the Shandong Peninsula () in East China, and separates Huangdao District from Qingdao City and borders on Jiaozhou City.

Postcard, ca. 1900 Jiaozhou Bay was known formerly as Jiao'Ao. The area became widely known to Europeans after the German Empire in March 1898 concluded a lease with the Qing government of China. The area was transferred to German rule on a 99-year lease (or until 1997, as the British did in Hong Kong's New Territories and as the French did in Kouang-Tch√©ou- Wan), and it became known as the Kiautschou Bay concession. The village of Tsingtau became the German colony of Tsingtau, and the area became a focus for German commercial development in China, while for the Imperial German Navy it was the base for their Far East Squadron. Because of land speculation in Germany's African colonies, a land value tax was introduced as the only tax in the colony. It was a great success, bringing wealth quite rapidly to the colony and also financial stability. The colony was the only government authority ever to exclusively rely on the single tax on land value, and is used as an academic case study to this day about the viability of such a tax system. The German colony also issued currency.Owen Linzmayer, Bank Note Book - Kiau Chau chapter, 7-page catalogue covering notes issued by the Deutsch- Asiatische Bank (German-Asian Bank) from 1907 to 1914, and the Greater Japan Imperial Government in 1914.

This came into force on 23 August 1914, the day of Japan‚Äôs declaration of war on Germany, after a Japanese ultimatum for unconditional German evacuation of the colony had expired. Following a two month military siege by British and Japanese forces, the colony was forced to surrender. It was then occupied by the British and Japanese. The Republic of China declared war on Imperial Germany on 14 August 1917, since as an member of the victorious allies, China fully expected the former German colony would be returned to them. Instead, the Treaty of Versailles acceded to Japanese demands at the Paris Peace Conference and assigned all former German Pacific territories and islands north of the equator to Japan, including Jiaozhou Bay. This unexpected decision led to China-wide protests known as the \\"May Fourth Movement\\", which is now regarded as a significant event of modern Chinese history. As a result, the Beiyang government refused to sign the Treaty. This situation was known as the \\"Shandong Problem\\". It eventually was resolved through mediation by the United States, which led to the former colony's return to Chinese sovereignty in February 1922. Connection project Jiaozhou Bay is situated wholly within Qingdao prefecture. Counterclockwise, the bordering divisions are Shinan District, Shibei District, Sifang District, Licang District, Chengyang District, Jiaozhou City, Jiaonan City and Huangdao District. The entrance to the bay is 6.17 km wide. In 1993, Qingdao City decided to build a traffic corridor for the Jiaozhou Bay region, which includes a tunnel under the inlet and a bridge across Jiaozhou Bay. In December 2006 the construction process started with an estimated completion target of 2011. *The Jiaozhou Bay Bridge, at , is the world's longest bridge over water, surpassing the cross-sea Donghai Bridge in length.

Biography Fea was born in Turin, a son of Paolo Fea, who was professor of painting at Accademia Albertina, and Anna Roda. In 1872 he became an assistant at the Museum of Natural History in Genoa. He made several foreign trips to collect specimens, including visits to Burma (1885‚Äì89) and the Cape Verde Islands (1898), the islands in the Gulf of Guinea (S√£o Tom√©, Pr√≠ncipe, Fernando Po, Annob√≥n, 1900‚Äì02) and Cameroon and French Congo (1902). He spent four years in Burma, accumulating large collections of insects and birds. He then planned an expedition to Malaysia, but his poor health made it necessary to choose somewhere with a drier climate, hence his visit to the Cape Verdes. He was disappointed by the amount of wildlife he found there, but was still able to collect forty-seven species of birds, eleven of which were new for the islands. His collections are in the Genoa museum. While on the Cape Verde Islands Fea collected a specimen of an unknown petrel. This was named Fea's petrel in 1899 by his friend Tommaso Salvadori.

It connects SR 1 in Laguna Beach through the San Joaquin Hills with several freeways in Irvine, ending at the SR 241, a toll road in the latter city. It is built as an expressway from SR 73 to Laguna Canyon Road (just south of I-405 in Irvine), and past this, SR 133 is a freeway (the Laguna Freeway) to I-5, and a tollway (part of the Eastern Toll Road) to SR 241 near the Santa Ana Mountains. SR 133 was constructed as a county road by the 1910s; the portion from I-405 to I-5 was upgraded to a freeway four decades later. Plans to extend the freeway south were canceled by the state, and the southern part of the road remains an undivided highway. In 1998, the majority of the Eastern Transportation Corridor opened, and the connector between I-5 and SR 241 was designated as a toll extension of SR 133. Route description State Route 133 begins at the Pacific Coast Highway (SR 1) as Broadway in Laguna Beach, a block from the Pacific Ocean. The name changes to Laguna Canyon Road as the highway leaves downtown Laguna Beach and enters Laguna Canyon, soon narrowing to one lane in each direction. After entering the canyon, which lies between Laguna Coast Wilderness Park (west side of SR 133) and Aliso and Wood Canyons Wilderness Park (east side of SR 133), the first major intersection is with El Toro Road (County Route S18). SR 133 widens to four lanes and becomes a highway after its interchange with the San Joaquin Hills Toll Road (SR 73).Google Maps street maps and USGS topographic maps, accessed December 2007 via ACME Mapper As it continues through the Laguna Coast Wilderness Park, SR 133 follows a four-lane alignment on the west side of the canyon, moved from the old two- lane road in the center of the canyon in late 2006. Laguna Canyon Road splits to the northwest where the canyon ends in Irvine. North of the park, the highway becomes the Laguna Freeway after crossing an at-grade intersection with Laguna Canyon Road, followed by an interchange at exit 8, San Diego Freeway (I-405). SR 133 then continues as a freeway and serves Barranca Parkway and the Santa Ana Freeway (I-5). After crossing I-5, SR 133 becomes part of the Eastern Toll Road along the northwest side of Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, crossing an interchange with Irvine Boulevard at exit 12 before ending at SR 241. SR 133 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System north of SR 73, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. History As part of its construction of concrete roads, started by a 1913 bond issue, Orange County paved the county road through Laguna Canyon, connecting State Highway Route 2 (the forerunner of U.S. Hwy. 101 and I-5) at Irvine with Laguna Beach, by 1917.Ben Blow, California Highways: A Descriptive Record of Road Development by the State and by Such Counties as Have Paved Highways, 1920 (Archive.org or Google Books), pp. 192-196Official Automobile Blue Book, Volume Eight, 1918, p. 548 The road was added to the state highway system in 1933 as Route 185, an unsigned designation.: \\"State Highway Route 60 near Laguna Beach to State Highway Route 2 near Irvine.\\": \\"Route 185 is from Route 60 near Laguna Beach to Route 2 near Irvine.\\" The entire route was added to the new California Freeway and Expressway System in 1959; the planned upgrade had already been named the Laguna Freeway by the California Highway Commission on November 26, 1957.California Department of Transportation, 2007 Named Freeways, Highways, Structures and Other Appurtenances in California , p. 73 The highway received a sign route number--State Route 133--in the 1964 renumbering.: \\"Route 133 is from Route 1 near Laguna Beach to Route 5 near Irvine.\\" Opening of the first--and only--piece of the Laguna Freeway was celebrated in Laguna Beach on October 1, 1952, connecting the north end of Laguna Canyon with a planned extension of the Santa Ana Freeway at a trumpet interchange and bypassing the old route on Sand Canyon Avenue. There were initially no other interchanges along the route.Long Beach Press-Telegram, Laguna Freeway Unit Dedication Oct. 1, September 29, 1952Los Angeles Times, Traffic Opens on Laguna Highway Unit, October 2, 1952, p. A6 The state decided not to build the remainder of the freeway in late 1975,Thomas Fortune, Los Angeles Times, State Cancels Its Plans for Laguna Canyon Freeway, October 17, 1975 and in 1996 the portion south of SR 73 was removed from the Freeway and Expressway System.: \\"Route 133 from Route 73 to Route 241.\\"; \\"Route 133 is from Route 1 near Laguna Beach to Route 241.\\" Widening of the part north of SR 73 to a four-lane expressway was completed in late 2006, moving the road out of the canyon bottom and allowing better access to areas in Laguna Coast Wilderness Park.Pat Brennan, Orange County Register, Nature's new scene, November 3, 2006 A new State Route 231 was added to the state highway system in 1988, connecting I-5 northwest of Irvine with SR 91, and in 1991 the south end was shifted southeast to the north end of SR 133, with the old route becoming SR 261. To prevent the route from changing numbers as it crossed I-5, the southern portion was renumbered SR 133 in 1996, with the remainder becoming an extended SR 241. The Eastern Transportation Corridor, which includes SR 133 north of I-5, was completed on October 15, 1998, opening a new shortcut from Orange County to the northeast.Megan Garvey, Los Angeles Times, Latest Toll Road in O.C. Is Major Test for Concept, October 15, 1998 Tolls The tolled portion of SR 133 (from I-5 in the south to SR 241 in the north) employs a barrier toll system, where drivers are charged flat-rate tolls based on what particular toll booths they pass through. Since May 13, 2014, the road has been using an all-electronic, open road tolling system. And on October 2, 2019, the license plate tolling program, under the brand name \\"ExpressAccount\\", was discontinued. Drivers may still pay using the FasTrak electronic toll collection system, via a one time payment online, or in person at Transportation Corridor Agencies's customer service center in Irvine. Those using Fastrak are charged a lower toll than those using the other two methods. Drivers must pay within 5 days after their trip on the toll road or they will be assessed a toll violation. Tolls are collected at the northbound exit and southbound entrance of Irvine Boulevard, and at the Orange Grove Toll Plaza, which spans the on-and off-ramps to Northbound SR 241 (traffic to and from Southbound SR 241 instead pay at the Tomato Springs Toll Plaza located on SR 241 immediately south of the 133/241 interchange). , the standard two-axle car toll for both the northbound offramp and southbound onramp of Irvine Boulevard is a flat rate of $2.04. The Orange Grove Toll Plaza instead uses a congestion pricing scheme based on the time of day for FasTrak users, while non-FasTrak drivers must pay the maximum toll for peek weekday hours ($3.36 for the standard two-axle car), regardless of the day and time.

He was a close friend and patron of John Sell Cotman. He is considered to be a member of the Norwich School of painters. Life Bulwer was born at Aylsham in Norfolk, the son of James Bulwer and Mary Seaman, and was baptised by his parents on 23 March 1794, at St Michael and All Angels, the town's parish church.James Bulwer in \\"Parish registers, 1550-1900\\", FamilySearch (James Bulwer). He studied at Jesus College, Cambridge. During his time at Cambridge he took drawing lessons from the famous landscape artist John Sell Cotman and became a fellow of the Linnean Society due to his interest in mollusks, one of his three proposers being William Elford Leach. In 1818 he was made a deacon and in 1822 he became a priest. In 1823 he became curate of Booterstown in Dublin, moving to Bristol in 1831 and St James's, Piccadilly in 1833. He spent several winters travelling in Spain, Portugal and the Madeira Islands, sometimes in the company of the philosopher and traveller Alfred Lyall. In the spring of 1825 Bulwer collected a specimen of an unknown petrel in the Madeira Islands. This was described by William Jardine and P. J. Selby in 1828 and given the common name of Bulwer's petrel. The petrel genus of Bulweria was also named for him. Bulwer left London in 1839 and moved back to Norfolk, becoming curate of Blickling Hall and later of Hunworth. He renewed his acquaintance with John Sell Cotman when his sons attended King's College School, and several of his sketches of Spain and Madeira inspired Cotman's watercolours. His son James Redfoord Bulwer became a lawyer and a Member of parliament and also played first-class cricket.

Golden key Medallion used for graduation/recognition. History Golden Key National Honor Society was founded by James W. Lewis at Georgia State University in Atlanta, Georgia in 1977.Andrew Brownstein, \\"Dishonor Society\\". The Chronicle of Higher Education. March 22, 2002. The original intent of the society was to create a new academic honor organization that was the equal of longstanding honor societies such as Phi Beta Kappa, but which did not carry the same perceived elitism of older institutions, operating more strictly on merit standards (by accepting students in the top 15% of their college classes, and permitting part-time and transfer students who excelled academically). The society expanded over the course of the 1980s on a minimal budget, increasing the number of schools at which it had chapters and membership at those chapters. Lewis moved the institution's headquarters to a former Church of Christ Scientist building in the Druid Hills area of Atlanta in 1984. In the late 1980s, the society began attracting corporate sponsorships, providing data about its students to its sponsors, and holding large sponsored networking events, arguing that the strategy increased students' competitiveness in the job market. It expanded to Australia in the mid-1990s, and in 2000 changed its name to Golden Key International Honour Society in order \\"to reflect [its] international presence\\". Lewis, who by the late 1990s was making more than $300,000 as chairman of the organization, stepped down in January 2000 after being pressured by his board, and was replaced by Carl Patton. Patton resigned in 2002 after a round of negative press coverage about the society.Paige Shamsi, Golden Key Honor Society comes under fire for lowering standards. Student Life, April 18, 2002. By 2002, the society was \\"one of the largest collegiate honor societies in the world\\", with an annual budget of US$10.9 million and over 120,000 inductees annually.

Georgia Center for Nonprofits, May 2015. It manages approximately 400 campus chapters worldwide. In its early years, Golden Key anticipated volunteerism drives on college campuses by organizing community service efforts, such as working in soup kitchens, reading to children at libraries, and doing tax preparation help for low-income and immigrant populations. Since chapters are not centrally managed, charity and volunteer efforts are now fostered through a system called SPARK a Change, which allows chapters to determine the causes they support and the level of involvement of students. Golden Key offers r√©sum√© and graduate program assistance, career planning and opportunities, leadership opportunities in local chapters, and networking events. It also offers scholarships, awards, research grants, travel support for academic conference attendance, and student loan debt relief to its members. The organization operates as a non-profit under section 501(c)(3) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Golden Key sought and was denied acceptance to the Association of College Honor Societies in 1984 and 1997. Golden Key was accepted by the ACHS in 2005. Golden Key resigned from the Association of College Honor Societies in December 2013 after what the ACHS indicated was \\"a series of on-going discussions and correspondence.\\" Criticism A 1999 article in the University of British Columbia student newspaper, The Ubyssey, examined the society's finances and scholarship practices after it established a chapter on campus in 1998.Irfan Dhalla, \\"Students Getting Bamboozled?\\".

Archived at Ubyssey obtained the organization's IRS filings for 1997 and noted \\"Golden Key spent just $289,461 (US dollars) on scholarships, less than 5 per cent of their total expenditures for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1997.\\" Golden Key reported on its own website in 2009 that it had increased scholarship disbursals to over $500,000 annually,Students should take caution when picking honor societies. The Daily Nebraskan, February 10, 2009. but a later report indicated that spending on member events and scholarships in 2014 were less than $200,000. A 2002 report by The Chronicle of Higher Education reported that there were conflicts within the society's administration over the lowering of academic standards required for admission and inflated recruitment numbers from local university chapters. The society's aggressive marketing techniques toward eligible members were criticized in 2002 by the president of the National Collegiate Honors Council. The business practices of Golden Key also attracted the Chronicle's notice, as well as that of the Washington Post. Sponsoring corporations, who paid a minimum of $55,000 a year (2002) to access Golden Key's membership lists, sent students \\"mass mailings for such products as credit cards and auto insurance.\\" Golden Key responded to these criticisms by stating that it was standard practice among alumni groups and honor societies. The Chronicle quoted former employees who thought the institution's expenditures on parties and upper executive salaries, as well as its maintenance of the Druid Hills headquarters, were lavish and inconsistent with the former ideal of \\"a student-centered, nonprofit organization.\\" The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported poor accounting practices under Lewis's tenure in the late 1990s, and investigators were unable to determine exactly how much he was paid due to bookkeeping discrepancies.John McCosh, \\"Golden Key founder loses luster\\".

He subsequently became a critic of U.S. foreign policy, particularly the covert activities of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) about which he had considerable inside knowledge. Prouty was the inspiration for the character \\"Mr. X\\" in Oliver Stone's film JFK. Education Prouty was born in Springfield, Massachusetts on January 24, 1917. In 1941, he earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Massachusetts Amherst (then known as Massachusetts State College).\\"L. Fletcher Prouty.\\" Contemporary Authors Online. Detroit: Gale, 2003. Biography in Context. Web. 9 Dec. 2013. Prouty also graduated from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison Graduate School of Banking. World War II Prouty was commissioned as a reserve 2nd lieutenant in the cavalry on June 9, 1941 and began his military career with the 4th Armored Division in Pine Camp, New York. He was promoted to 1st lieutenant on February 1, 1942. He transferred to the United States Army Air Forces on November 10, 1942 and earned his pilot wings that same month. He arrived in British West Africa in February 1943 as a pilot with Air Transport Command.Arlington National Cemetery website In the summer of 1943 he was the personal pilot of General Omar Bradley, General John C. H. Lee and General C. R. Smith (Founder and President of American Airlines), among others. He flew the U.S. Geological Survey Team in Saudi Arabia, October 1943, to confirm oil discoveries in preparation for the Cairo Conference. He was assigned to special duties at the Cairo Conference and the Tehran Conference November‚ÄìDecember 1943. He flew Chiang Kai-shek's Chinese delegation (T. V. Soong's delegates) to Tehran. An important mission he was involved in was the evacuation of the British commandos made famous by the novel Guns of Navarone involved in the Battle of Leros from Leros to Palestine. He was promoted to captain on February 1, 1944. In 1945 he was transferred to the Southwest Pacific and flew in New Guinea, Leyte and was on Okinawa at the end of war. He landed near Tokyo at the time of the surrender with the first three planes carrying General Douglas MacArthur's bodyguard troops. He flew out with American POWs. Post-war years Between 1946‚Äì49 he was assigned by the U.S. Army to Yale University, where he also taught, to begin the first USAF ROTC program. From 1950‚Äì52 he transferred to Colorado Springs to establish Air Defense Command. From 1952‚Äì54 he was assigned to Korean War duties in Japan where he served as Military Manager for Tokyo International Airport (Haneda) during the US Occupation. Prouty was assigned to coordinate operations between the USAF and the CIA in 1955. As a result of a CIA Commendation for this work he was awarded the Legion of Merit by the US Air Force, and was promoted to Colonel being assigned to the Office of the Secretary of Defense. With the creation of the Defense Intelligence Agency by Secretary Robert McNamara and the termination of the OSO, he was transferred to the Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to create a similar worldwide office. He was the Chief of Special Operations with the Joint Staff all during 1962‚Äì1963. He received orders to travel as the Military Escort officer for a group of VIPs who were being flown to the South Pole, November 10‚Äì28, 1963, to activate a nuclear power plant for heat, light and sea water desalination at the United States Navy Base at McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. Retiring as a Colonel in the U.S. Air Force in 1964, he was awarded one of the first three Joint Service Commendation Medals by General Maxwell D. Taylor, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Post retirement He was a Senior Director of Public Affairs for Amtrak during the 1970s, and a director of the National Railroad Foundation and Museum. Prouty authored books including The Secret Team: The CIA and Its Allies in Control of the United States and the World and JFK: The CIA, Vietnam, and the Plot to Assassinate John F. Kennedy and numerous articles on railroads including the entries on Railroad Engineering and Foreign Railroad Technology for McGraw-Hill's encyclopedias. Prouty served as a technical adviser to Oliver Stone's 1991 film JFK. He was the inspiration for the mysterious \\"X\\" (played by Donald Sutherland), who assists Jim Garrison in the movie. Colonel Prouty died on June 5, 2001 at Alexandria Hospital in Alexandria, Virginia. His funeral service was held the next day at the Fort Meyer Chapel. He was interred in Arlington National Cemetery. Controversial claims As a critic of the CIA, Prouty pointed out its influence in global matters, outside the realm of U.S. congressional and government oversight. His works detailed the formation and development of the CIA, the origins of the Cold War, the U-2 incident, the Vietnam War, and the John F. Kennedy assassination. Prouty wrote that he believed Kennedy's assassination was a coup d'etat, and that there is a secret, global \\"power elite,\\" which operates covertly to protect its interests‚Äîand in doing so has frequently subverted democracy around the world. Alexander Butterfield On July 12, 1975, prior to closed-door questioning by the staff of the House Select Intelligence Committee, Prouty told reporters that Alexander Butterfield was a contact for the CIA at the White House. He said he had learned the information over four years earlier from E. Howard Hunt while doing work for the National League of Families. Prouty said that most federal government departments, including the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department, had similar CIA contacts and that he assumed that former President Richard Nixon was aware of Butterfield's role. Senator Frank Church said the Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities had found no evidence that the CIA planted an undercover agent within the White House or other government agencies. A few days later, Prouty partially walked back his comments in a telephone interview: \\"They may have told me the wrong name in order to cover up the real informer.\\" In a telephone statement to UPI that same day, Butterfield called the allegations \\"wholly false and defamatory\\" and stated had never met nor seen Hunt and had just recently heard of Prouty. In an interview with CBS News from Eglin Air Force Base where he was serving his prison term for his involvement in the Watergate scandal, Hunt denied the allegation calling it an \\"unfortunate invention on Mr. Prouty's part.\\" Also interviewed by CBS, Prouty again stated it was Hunt who told him about Butterfield. On July 19, Church said that his committee found that there was \\"no scintilla of evidence\\" to support Prouty's allegations, and that his committee had ruled out the possibility that Butterfield served as a liaison officer for the CIA. Church also stated, \\"on close interrogation, Mr. Prouty is unable to substantiate his earlier statement and acknowledges this to be the case.\\" Kennedy assassination According to Prouty, people within the intelligence and military communities of the United States government conspired to assassinate Kennedy. He maintained that their actions were a coup d'√©tat to stop the President from taking control of the CIA after the Bay of Pigs Invasion. Prouty stated that the assassination was orchestrated by Edward Lansdale (\\"General Y\\" in Oliver Stone's film JFK) and that Lansdale appeared in photographs of the \\"three tramps.\\" In 1975, Prouty appeared with Richard Sprague at a news conference in New York to present what they believed was photographic evidence of a conspiracy. According to Prouty, the movement of Kennedy after a bullet struck his head was consistent with a shot from the grassy knoll. He also suggested that the actions of a man with an umbrella, the \\"Umbrella Man\\", were suspicious. Church of Scientology In the 1980s, Prouty was hired by the Church of Scientology as a consultant to investigate L. Ron Hubbard's military record. Hubbard, the founder of Scientology, had said that he had sustained combat injuries during his military service in World War II and that he healed himself through measures that would become Dianetics.Sappell, Joel; Welkos, Robert (June 24, 1990). \\"The Making of L. Ron Hubbard: Creating the Mystique.\\" Los Angeles Times, p. A38:1 However, Hubbard's military record does not show that he was wounded in combat. Church officials have stated that those records were incomplete and may have been falsified. Prouty, according to Church of Scientology spokesman Tommy Davis, reported that Hubbard was an intelligence agent, and because of this his military discharge papers were \\"sheep dipped,\\" meaning two sets of government records were created documenting Hubbard's service. Anti-semitic organization controversy Prouty was a featured speaker at the 1990 convention of the Liberty Lobby. Prouty was also named to the advisory board for the Lobby's Populist Action Committee. Prouty also sold the reprint rights for The Secret Team of the Noontide Press, the publishing arm for the Institute for Historical Review, a holocaust denial organization. Prouty denied having known of the racist and antisemitic associations of the Lobby, noted that he also spoke at a ceremony at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, and assured Oliver Stone \\"... that he was neither a racist nor an anti-Semite... but merely a writer in need of a platform.\\" In a response to an article about Prouty in Esquire, which he labeled a \\"character assassination\\", Stone lamented Prouty's association with the Liberty Lobby but questioned its relevance to Prouty's reliability as a source. In an obituary in The Guardian, Michael Carlson wrote that \\"[a]lthough Prouty himself never espoused such [anti-semitic] beliefs, the connection enabled critics to dismiss his later writings.\\" Awards Decorations awarded to Prouty during his career:http://www.apfn.net/dcia/prouty.html * Command Pilot Wings * Office of the Secretary of Defense Identification Badge * Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Identification Badge * Legion of Merit * Joint Service Commendation Medal * American Defense Service Medal * American Campaign Medal * European- African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal * Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal * World War II Victory Medal * Army of Occupation Medal with \\"Japan\\" clasp * Korean Service Medal * National Defense Service Medal with star * Air Force Longevity Service Ribbon with four oak leaf clusters * Philippine Liberation Medal * United Nations Korea Medal Interviews *‚ÄúAn Interview with Colonel Fletcher Prouty‚Äù.

His father had made a fortune from a large import business, ensuring that his son never had to work. At the age of sixteen Cory developed an interest in ornithology and began a skin collection. Due to his ability to travel anywhere he wished, this soon became the best collection of birds of the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico in existence. In February 1876, the nineteen year old Cory was elected a member of Nuttall Ornithological Club, America's first ornithological organization. It was here that he met the leading ornithologists of Massachusetts at the time, such as William Brewster, Henry Henshaw, Ruthven Deane, Charles Johnson Maynard, with Joel Asaph Allen soon to join as well. Starting in 1876, he briefly attended Harvard and the Boston University School of Law but soon left to continue his travelling. In 1877, he went collecting in Florida, followed by a trip to the Magdalen Islands in 1878, and another to the Bahamas the next year. In 1880, he collected in Europe, and then he returned to the West Indies in 1881. In 1883, he was one of the forty-eight ornithologists invited to become founders of the American Ornithologists' Union and one of those who attended the founding convention in New York City. The next year he visited the Dakota Territory and Montana with his friend, Martin A. Ryerson, to collect specimen. The rest of the 1880s saw him in Cuba, Mexico, and Canada. In 1887, Cory was made the curator of birds at the Boston Society of Natural History. In 1882, Cory purchased Great Island in West Yarmouth, Massachusetts as a summer retreat and game preserve, and set about the restoration of its Point Gammon Light as an ornithological observatory. While summering there on Cape Cod, Cory entertained dignitaries such as President Grover Cleveland, and frequently sponsored community sporting and cultural events. From 1888 to 1892, he and friend Charles Richard Crane funded and played on the Hyannis town team in what is now the Cape Cod Baseball League. At Cory and Crane's expense, various well-known professional and amateur players were brought in to play alongside the Hyannis locals. In 1888, Cory outfitted his club in \\"suits which were of the best white flannel and red stockings,\\" and secured the services of pitcher Dick Conway and catcher Mert Hackett, both formerly of the major league Boston Beaneaters. In 1889, Cory brought back Hackett, and also enlisted Barney Gilligan, who had played for the 1884 major league champion Providence Grays. After the 1891 season, Cory published an extended ode to his ballclub in the style of Ernest Thayer's Casey at the Bat. When Cory's collection of 19,000 bird specimens became too large to keep in his house he donated them to The Field Museum in Chicago, and he was given the position of Curator of Ornithology. Cory's collection of 600 ornithological volumes were purchased by Edward E. Ayer in 1894, and in turn donated to the museum. Cory lost his entire fortune in 1906, and took a salaried position at the museum as Curator of Zoology, remaining there for the rest of his life. Cory made routine collecting trips in Florida and the West Indies. He sometimes financed trips for other naturalists. Cory was a director in many corporations. Cory wrote many books, including The Birds of Haiti and San Domingo (1885), The Birds of the West Indies (1889) and The Birds of Illinois and Wisconsin (1909). His last major work was the four-part Catalogue of the Birds of the Americas, which was completed after his death by Carl Edward Hellmayr. Cory was the first person to describe Cory's shearwater as a species. It had previously been described by Giovanni Antonio Scopoli in 1769, but he had believed it to be a race of another shearwater. Cory participated in the 1904 Summer Olympics as a golfer. He competed in the individual event but did not finish.

The district is named after the River Rother which flows within its boundaries. History The District of Rother was formed on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, by the merger of the Municipal Borough of Bexhill, the Municipal Borough of Rye and Battle Rural District. It is one of three districts within the county without borough status and is the easternmost one: the other two being Lewes to the west, and Wealden in the centre. The borough of Hastings lies surrounded by Rother. Governance Rother District Council is elected every four years, with currently 38 councillors being elected at each election. From 1983 until 2019, the Conservatives have had a majority on the council, apart from between 1991 and the 1999 election when no party had a majority. Since 2019, the 'Rother Alliance' has controlled the council, formed of a mixture of Independent, Liberal Democrat, Labour and Green Party councillors. As of the last election in 2019 the council was composed of the following councillors:- Geography Rother District covers two areas of relief: to the south, a section of the High Weald; and to the north the lower land, named the Rother Levels, across which flow the River Rother, which rises on the Weald and flows easterly towards Rye Bay, and its tributaries. For much of the course of the main river it constitutes the boundary between East Sussex and Kent, and is given the alternative title of the ‚Äô‚ÄôKent Ditch‚Äô‚Äô. Tributaries of the river include the Rivers Dudwell, Tillingham and Brede. The district reaches the coast in the vicinity of Bexhill, and on the shores of Rye Bay. Climate Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year round. The K√∂ppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is \\"Cfb\\" (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate).Climate Summary for Rother, UK Demographics Rother has one of the oldest populations (with a median age of 52 years)ONS - Median age for local authorities, mid 2015 and the lowest per capita incomeONS https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/annualsurveyofhoursandearnings/2018 and data tables in the UK. Transport There are several main roads crossing the district. The major trunk road is the A21, London to Hastings road; it is joined by the A28 road from Ashford road near Hastings; which in turn is crossed by the A268 Hawkhurst to Rye road. There is also the A259 coastal route The Hastings Line, East Coastway Line and the Marshlink Line are the three railway lines in the District; The Kent and East Sussex Railway tourist line terminates at Bodiam. Long-distance footpaths include the Sussex Border Path; and the Saxon Shore Way, which links with the 1066 Country Walk. Landmarks Major landmarks include Bodiam and Camber Castles; and Battle Abbey.

Erected on the idea of \\"blood and soil\\", inspired by the one-body-metaphor (Volksk√∂rper, literally \\"body of the people\\", \\"ethnic body\\") and the idea of naturally grown communities in unity, it was characterized by organicism, racialism, populism, agrarianism, romantic nationalism and‚Äìas a consequence of a growing exclusive and ethnic connotation‚Äìby antisemitism from the 1900s onward. The V√∂lkisch movement was not a homogeneous set of beliefs, but rather a \\"variegated sub- culture\\" that rose in opposition to the socio-cultural changes of modernity. The \\"only denominator common\\" to all V√∂lkisch theorists was the idea of a national rebirth, inspired by the (reconstructed) traditions of the Ancient Germans. This rebirth would have been achieved by either \\"Germanizing\\" Christianity (an Abrahamic, i.e. Semitic, religion that spread into Europe from the Near East) or by rejecting any Christian heritage that existed in Germany in order to revive pre-Christian Germanic paganism. In a narrow definition, the term is used to designate only groups that consider human beings essentially preformed by blood, or by inherited characteristics.Hans J√ºrgen Lutzh√∂ft (1971). Der Nordische Gedanke in Deutschland 1920‚Äì1940 (Stuttgart. Ernst Klett Verlag), p. 19. The V√∂lkischen are often encompassed in a wider Conservative Revolution by scholars, a German national conservative movement that rose in prominence during the Weimar Republic (1918‚Äì1933).  Translation  The adjective V√∂lkisch () is derived from the German word Volk (cognate with the English \\"folk\\"), which has overtones of \\"nation\\", \\"race\\" or \\"tribe\\".James Webb. 1976. The Occult Establishment. La Salle, Illinois: Open Court. . pp. 276‚Äì277 While V√∂lkisch has no direct English equivalent, it could be loosely translated as \\"ethno-nationalist\\" or, closer to its original meaning, as \\"bio-mystical racialist\\". Jefferson Chase, in his translation of Volker Ullrich's biography of Hitler, chose to use \\"ethnic chauvinist\\" or \\"ethno-chauvinist\\" as the translation. If V√∂lkisch writers used terms like Nordische Rasse (\\"Nordic race\\") and Germanentum (\\"Germanic peoples\\"), their concept of Volk could, however, also be more flexible, and understood as a Gemeinsame Sprache (\\"common language\\"),Georg Schmidt-Rohr: Die Sprache als Bildnerin. 1932. or as an Ausdruck einer Landschaftsseele (\\"expression of a landscape's soul\\"), in the words of geographer Ewald Banse.Ewald Banse. Landschaft und Seele. M√ºnchen 1928, p. 469. The defining idea which the V√∂lkisch movement revolved around was that of a Volkstum, literally the \\"folkdom\\" or the \\"culture of the Volk\\". Other associated German words include Volksboden (the \\"Volk's essential substrate\\"), Volksgeist (the \\"spirit of the Volk\\"), Volksgemeinschaft (the \\"community of the Volk\\"), as well as Volkst√ºmlich (\\"folksy\\" or \\"traditional\\") and Volkst√ºmlichkeit (the \\"popular celebration of the Volkstum\\").  Definition  It was not a unified movement but rather \\"a cauldron of beliefs, fears and hopes that found expression in various movements and were often articulated in an emotional tone\\".Petteri Pietik√§inen, \\"The Volk and Its Unconscious: Jung, Hauer and the 'German Revolution. Journal of Contemporary History 35.4 (October 2000: 523‚Äì539), p. 524 According to historian Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, V√∂lkisch denoted the \\"national collectivity inspired by a common creative energy, feelings and sense of individuality. These metaphysical qualities were supposed to define the unique cultural essence of the German people.\\" According to journalist Peter Ross Range, \\"V√∂lkisch is very hard to define and almost untranslatable into English. The word has been rendered as popular, populist, people's, racial, racist, ethnic-chauvinist, nationalistic, communitarian (for Germans only), conservative, traditional, Nordic, romantic ‚Äì and it means, in fact, all of those. The v√∂lkisch political ideology ranged from a sense of German superiority to a spiritual resistance to 'the evils of industrialization and the atomization of modern man,' wrote scholar David Jablonsky. But its central component, as Harold J. Gordon, Jr., noted, was always racism\\".Peter Ross Range (2016), 1924: The Year That Made Hitler, New York: Little, Brown and Company. p. 27. V√∂lkisch thinkers tended to idealize the myth of an \\"original nation\\", that still could be found at that time in the rural regions of Germany, a form of \\"primitive democracy freely subjected to their natural elites.\\" The notion of \\"people\\" (Volk) subsequently turned into the idea of a \\"racial essence\\", and V√∂lkisch thinkers referred to the term as a birth-giving and quasi-eternal entity‚Äîin the same way as they would write on \\"the Nature\\"‚Äîrather than a sociological category. The movement combined sentimental patriotic interest in German folklore, local history and a \\"back-to-the-land\\" anti-urban populism with many parallels in the writings of William Morris. \\"In part this ideology was a revolt against modernity\\", Nicholls remarked.A. J. Nicholls, reviewing George L. Mosse, The Crisis in German Ideology: Intellectual Origins of the Third Reich, in The English Historical Review 82 No. 325 (October 1967), p. 860. Mosse was characterised as \\"the foremost historian of v√∂lkisch ideology\\" by Petteri Pietik√§inen 2000:524 note 6. As they sought to overcome what they felt was the malaise of a scientistic and rationalistic modernity, Volkisch authors imagined a spiritual solution in a Volks essence perceived as authentic, intuitive, even \\"primitive\\", in the sense of an alignment with a primordial and cosmic order.  History = Origins in the 19th century  The V√∂lkisch movement emerged in the late 19th century, drawing inspiration from German Romanticism and the history of the Holy Roman Empire, and what many saw as its harmonious hierarchical order. The delayed unification of the German-speaking peoples under a single German Reich in the 19th century is cited as conducive to the emergence of the V√∂lkisch movement. Despite the previous lower-class connotation associated to the word Volk, the V√∂lkisch movement saw the term with a noble overtone suggesting a German ascendancy over other peoples. Thinkers led by Arthur de Gobineau (1816‚Äì1882), Georges Vacher de Lapouge (1854‚Äì1936), Houston Stewart Chamberlain (1855‚Äì1927), Ludwig Woltmann (1871‚Äì1907) or Alexis Carrel (1873‚Äì1944) were inspired by Darwin's theory of evolution in advocating a \\"race struggle\\" and a hygienist vision of the world. They had conceptualized a racialist and hierarchical definition of the peoples of the world where Aryans (or Germans) had to be at the summit of the white race. The purity of the bio- mystical and primordial nation theorized by the V√∂lkisch thinkers then began to be seen as having been corrupted by foreign elements, Jewish in particular.  Before World War I  The same word Volk was used as a flag for new forms of ethnic nationalism, as well as by international socialist parties as a synonym for the proletariat in the German lands. From the left, elements of the folk-culture spread to the parties of the middle classes.George L. Mosse, The Crisis of German Ideology: Intellectual Origins of the Third Reich (London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson 1966) sees this in the context of a broader revolt against modernity, contrasting healthy rural life with the debased materialism of city culture. Although the primary interest of the Germanic mystical movement was the revival of native pagan traditions and customs (often set in the context of a quasi-theosophical esotericism), a marked preoccupation with purity of race came to motivate its more politically oriented offshoots, such as the Germanenorden (the Germanic or Teutonic Order), a secret society founded at Berlin in 1912 which required its candidates to prove that they had no \\"non-Aryan\\" bloodlines and required from each a promise to maintain purity of his stock in marriage. Local groups of the sect met to celebrate the summer solstice, an important neopagan festivity in v√∂lkisch circles (and later in Nazi Germany), and more regularly to read the Eddas as well as some of the German mystics. Not all folkloric societies with connections to Romantic nationalism were located in Germany. The V√∂lkisch movement was a force as well in Austria.Austrian manifestations were surveyed by Rudolf G. Ardelt, Zwischen Demoktratie und Faschismus: Deutschnationales Gedankengut in √ñsterreich, 1919-1930 (Vienna and Salzburg) 1972, not translated into English. Meanwhile the community of Monte Verit√† ('Mount Truth') which emerged in 1900 at Ascona, Switzerland is described by the Swiss art critic Harald Szeemann as \\"the southernmost outpost of a far-reaching Nordic lifestyle-reform, that is, alternative movement\\".Heidi Paris and Peter Gente (1982). Monte Verita: A Mountain for Minorities. Translated by Hedwig Pachter, Semiotext, the German Issue IV(2):1.  Weimar Republic  The political agitation and uncertainty that followed WWI nourished a fertile background for the renewed success of various V√∂lkish sects that were abundant in Berlin at the time, but if the V√∂lkisch movement became significant by the number of groups during the Weimar Republic, they were not so by the number of adherents. A few V√∂lkische authors tried to revive what they believed to be a true German faith (Deutschglaube), by resurrecting the cult of Ancient Germanic gods. Various occult movements such as ariosophy were connected to V√∂lkisch theories, and artistic circles were largely present among the V√∂lkischen, like the painters Ludwig Fahrenkrog (1867-1952) and Fidus (1868-1948). By May 1924, essayist Wilhelm Stapel perceived the movement as capable of embracing and reconciling the whole nation: in his view, V√∂lkisch had an idea to spread instead of a party programme and were led by heroes ‚Äî not by \\"calculating politicians\\".Wilhelm Stapel, \\"Das Elementare in der v√∂lkischen Bewegung\\", Deutsches Volkstum, 5 May 1924, pp. 213‚Äì15. Scholar Petteri Pietik√§inen also observed V√∂lkisch influences on Carl Gustav Jung.  Influence on Nazism  The v√∂lkisch ideologies were influential in the development of Nazism. Indeed, Joseph Goebbels publicly asserted in the 1927 Nuremberg rally that if the populist (v√∂lkisch) movement had understood power and how to bring thousands out in the streets, it would have gained political power on 9 November 1918 (the outbreak of the SPD-led German Revolution of 1918‚Äì1919, end of the German monarchy).Calvin.edu Nazi racial understanding was couched in v√∂lkisch terms, as when Eugen Fischer delivered his inaugural address as Nazi rector, The Conception of the V√∂lkisch state in the view of biology (29 July 1933).Franz Weidenreich in Science, New Series, 104, No. 2704 (October 1946:399). Karl Harrer, the Thule member most directly involved in the creation of the DAP in 1919, was sidelined at the end of the year when Hitler drafted regulations against conspiratorial circles, and the Thule Society was dissolved a few years later. The v√∂lkisch circles handed down one significant legacy to the Nazis: In 1919, Thule member Friedrich Krohn designed the original version of the Nazi swastika. In January 1919, the Thule Society was instrumental in the foundation of the Deutsche Arbeiter-Partei (German Workers' Party, or DAP), which later became the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP), commonly called the Nazi Party. Thule members or visiting guests that would later join the Nazi Party included Rudolf Hess, Alfred Rosenberg, Hans Frank, Gottfried Feder, Dietrich Eckart and Karl Harrer. Notably Adolf Hitler never was a member of the Thule Society and Rudolf Hess and Alfred Rosenberg were only visiting guests of the Thule Society in the early years before they came to prominence in the Nazi movement.

Fletcher Prouty, a former colonel in the US Air Force, first published in 1973.  Background  From 1955 to 1963 Prouty was the \\"Focal Point Officer\\" for contacts between the CIA and the Pentagon on matters relating to military support for \\"special operations\\" but he was not assigned to the CIA and was not bound by any oath of secrecy. (From the first page of the 1974 Printing) It was one of the first tell-all books about the inner workings of the CIA and was an important influence on the Oliver Stone movie JFK. The book details how the CIA started as a think tank to analyze intelligence and states that the CIA had no authority to run their own agents or to carry out covert operations but that they quickly did both and much more. The book provides many details about the organization's activities and how they operate. In Prouty's own words, from the 1997 edition of The Secret Team: ::\\"This is the fundamental game of the Secret Team. They have this power because they control secrecy and secret intelligence and because they have the ability to take advantage of the most modern communications system in the world, of global transportation systems, of quantities of weapons of all kinds, and when needed, the full support of a world-wide U.S. military supporting base structure. They can use the finest intelligence system in the world, and most importantly, they have been able to operate under the canopy of an assumed, ever-present enemy called \\"Communism.\\" It will be interesting to see what \\"enemy\\" develops in the years ahead. \\" [L. Fletcher Prouty, Alexandria, VA 1997] Secret Team The Secret Team, or ST, is a phrase coined by L. Fletcher Prouty in 1973, alleging a covert alliance between the United States' military, intelligence, and private sectors to influence political decisions. He suggests the existence of a covert alliance between certain people within the U.S. intelligence community, the United States military, and American private industry who use their collective wealth, influence, and resources to manipulate current events to steer public policy and maximize profits. The term is pejorative since he accuses the organizations of prioritizing their personal fortunes above the national interest, as well as eliminating any opposition, whether through targeted propaganda or assassination. Eisenhower's alleged prediction According to Prouty, the existence of ST was predicted and warned of by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in his farewell address to the nation in 1961 when he spoke of the military-industrial complex. Prouty states that after eight years of exposure to the American defense establishment as president, Eisenhower knew that a disproportionate amount of influence rested in the hands of the ST, and he warned the public that this influence threatened the purity of American democracy.

Early life Alessandro Moreschi was born into a Roman Catholic family in the town of Monte Compatri in the Papal States, near Frascati (Lazio). It is possible that he was born with an inguinal hernia, for which castration was still thought to be a cure in nineteenth-century Italy.Clapton, N: Moreschi and the Voice of the Castrato (London, 2008), pp. 60‚Äì62 Another possibility is that he was castrated later, around 1865, which would have been more in line with the centuries-old practice of castrating vocally talented boys well before puberty. In any case, much later in life, he referred to his enjoyment of singing as a boy in the chapel of the Madonna del Castagno, just outside his native town.Clapton, p. 62 Early career Young Alessandro Moreschi (c. 1880). It seems likely that Moreschi's singing abilities came to the notice of Nazareno Rosati, formerly a member of the Sistine Chapel choir, who was acting as a scout for new talent, and took him to Rome in about 1870. Moreschi became a pupil at the Scuola di San Salvatore in Lauro, where he was taught by Gaetano Capocci, maestro di cappella of the Papal basilica of St John Lateran. In 1873, aged only fifteen, he was appointed First Soprano in the choir of that basilica,Clapton, p. 75 and also became a regular member of the groups of soloists hired by Capocci to sing in the salons of Roman high society.Clapton, pp. 76‚Äì78 His singing at such soir√©es was vividly described by Anna Lillie de Hegermann-Lindencrone, the American wife of the Danish Ambassador to the Holy See: In 1883, Capocci presented a special showcase for his prot√©g√©: the first performance in Italy of the oratorio Christus am √ñlberge by Beethoven, in which Moreschi sang the demanding coloratura role of the Seraph.Clapton, pp. 81‚Äì82 On the strength of this performance, he became known as l'Angelo di Roma, and shortly after, having been auditioned by all the members of the Sistine Chapel Choir, he was appointed First Soprano there, a post he held for the next thirty years.Clapton, pp. 102‚Äì03 Sistine Chapel choir Moreschi's Director at the Sistine was Domenico Mustaf√†, himself once a fine castrato soprano, who realised that Moreschi was, amongst other things, the only hope for the continuation of the Sistine tradition of performing the famous setting of the Miserere by Gregorio Allegri during Holy Week. When Moreschi joined the Sistine choir, there were still six other castrato members, but none of them was capable of sustaining this work's taxing soprano tessitura.Clapton, pp. 104‚Äì07 Moreschi's star status sometimes seems to have turned his head: \\"Moreschi's behaviour was often capricious enough to make him forget a proper professional bearing, as on the occasion after a concert when he paraded himself among the crowd like a peacock, with a long, white scarf, to be congratulated ...\\"translated from Devoti, L: Alessandro Moreschi detto \\"L‚Äôangelo di Roma\\" 1858‚Äì1922, in R Lefevre and A Morelli (eds): Musica e musicisti nel Lazio (Rome, 1985), p. 467 The Sistine Chapel Choir was run on traditional lines centuries old, and had a strict system of hierarchies. In 1886, the senior castrato, Giovanni Cesari, retired, and it was probably then that Moreschi took over as Direttore dei concertisti (Director of soloists).Clapton, pp. 116‚Äì17 In 1891 Moreschi took his turn as segretario puntatore, being responsible for the day-book of the choir's activities, and the following year was appointed maestro pro tempore, a largely administrative post concerned with calling choir meetings, fixing rehearsals, granting leave of absence and the like. During this year, Alessandro was also responsible for overseeing the choir's correct performance of its duties in the Sistine Chapel. Artistically speaking, the job involved him in choosing soloists and in developing repertoire. This entire period was one of great upheaval within the Sistine choir's organisation as well as Catholic church music at large: the reforming movement known as Cecilianism, which had originated in Germany, was beginning to have its influence felt in Rome. Its calls for the Church's music to return to the twin bases of Gregorian chant and the polyphony of Palestrina were a direct threat to both the repertoire and the practice of the Sistine Chapel. These were resisted by Mustaf√†, but time was against him. In 1898, he celebrated fifty years as a member of the Sistine, but also appointed Lorenzo Perosi as joint Perpetual Director. This 26-year-old priest from Tortona in Piedmont turned out to be a real thorn in Mustaf√†'s side. Moreschi was very much a silent witness to the struggles between the forces of tradition and reform, but was also caught up in secular matters: on 9 August 1900, at the express request of the Italian royal family, he sang at the funeral of the recently assassinated king, Umberto I. This was all the more extraordinary because the Papacy still had no formal contact with the Italian secular state, which it regarded as a mere usurper (see Unification of Italy).for details of this period of Moreschi's life and the upheavals in the Sistine Choir, see Clapton, pp. 124‚Äì72 passim In the spring of 1902, in the Vatican, Moreschi made the first of his recordings for the Gramophone & Typewriter Company of London. He made additional recordings in 1904: there are seventeen tracks in all. Between these two sessions, several most fateful events occurred: in 1903 the aged Mustaf√† finally retired, and a few months later Pope Leo XIII, a strong supporter of Sistine tradition, died. His successor was Pope Pius X, an equally powerful advocate of Cecilianism. One of the new pontiff's first official acts was the promulgation of the motu proprio, Tra le sollecitudini (\\"Amidst the Cares\\"), which appeared, appropriately enough, on St Cecilia's Day, 22 November 1903. This was the final nail in the coffin of all that Mustaf√†, Moreschi and their colleagues stood for, since one of its decrees stated: \\"Whenever ... it is desirable to employ the high voices of sopranos and contraltos, these parts must be taken by boys, according to the most ancient usage of the Church.\\" Perosi, a fanatical opponent of the castrati, had triumphed and Moreschi and his few remaining colleagues were to be pensioned off and replaced by boys. A singing pupil of Moreschi's, Domenico Mancini, was such a good imitator of his master's voice that Perosi took him for a castrato (for all that castration had been banned in Italy in 1870), and would have nothing to do with him. Mancini became a professional double-bass player.again see Clapton, pp. 158‚Äì72 for further details Officially, Alessandro was a member of the Sistine choir until Easter 1913 (at which date he qualified for his pension after thirty years' service), and remained in the choir of the Cappella Giulia of St Peter's, Rome until a year after that. Around Easter 1914 he met the Viennese musicologist Franz Hab√∂ck, author of the important book Die Kastraten und ihre Gesangskunst (The Castrati and their Art of Singing, published in Berlin in 1927), who had plans to cast Moreschi in concerts reviving the repertoire of the great eighteenth-century castrato Farinelli. These never came to fruition: by this date Moreschi (now fifty-five years old) no longer had the required high soprano range, and in any case he had never had the necessary virtuoso operatic training.Clapton, pp. 185‚Äì86 Retirement and death In retirement, Moreschi lived in his apartment at 19 Via Plinio, a few minutes' walk from the Vatican, where he died at the age of 63, possibly of pneumonia. His funeral Mass was a large and public affair in the church of San Lorenzo in Damaso, and was conducted by Perosi, who, in spite of his antipathy towards castrati, felt a \\"great friendship which bound them together\\".translated from Il Giornale d‚ÄôItalia 30 April 1922, p. 2 Moreschi was buried in the family vault in the Cimitero del Verano, the great \\"city of the dead\\" not far from Rome's Tiburtina station. His colleague Domenico Salvatori lies in the same tomb.see Clapton, pp. 188, 194. Appearance According to Hab√∂ck, \\"Moreschi's external appearance differs little from that usual for a singer. He is of medium or rather small stature. His likeable face is completely beardless; his chest remarkably broad and powerful. His speaking voice has a metallic quality, like a very high-speaking tenor. His voice and demeanour make a youthful impression, reinforced by his lively conversation, which add to the altogether charming picture that the singer presents.\\"translated from Hab√∂ck, F: Die Kastraten und ihre Gesangskunst (Berlin, 1927), p 185 Recordings All of Moreschi's recordings were made in Rome in two sets of recording sessions for the Gramophone & Typewriter Company. The first series of recordings were made on 3 and 5 April 1902 by Will and Fred Gaisberg. Eighteen usable sides by the members of the Sistine Chapel Choir were captured on wax, four of them solos by Moreschi. Decades later Fred Gaisberg recalled making these historic first recordings in the Vatican: \\"Selecting a great salon with walls covered with Titians, Raphaels, and Tintorettos, we mounted our grimy machine right in the middle of the floor.\\"Gaisberg, F: Notes from my Diary, Recording of Actual Performances (\\"Gramophone\\", xxii, no 256, (September 1944), p 43) The second set of recordings was made in Rome in April 1904, under the direction of W. Sinkler Darby. CDs on the Opal and Pearl labels reproduce the recordings. Critical opinion Critical opinion is divided about Moreschi's recordings:Hab√∂ck wrote glowingly of his live performance; see Die Kastraten und ihre Gesangskunst, pp. 185‚Äì86 some say they are of little interest other than the novelty of preserving the voice of a castrato, and that Moreschi was a mediocre singer, while others detect the remains of a talented singer unfortunately past his prime by the time he recorded. (Moreschi was in his mid-forties when he made his recordings.) Still others feel that he was a very fine singer indeed, and that much of the \\"difficulty\\" in listening to Moreschi's recordings stems from changes in taste and singing style between his time and ours. His vocal technique can certainly seem to grate upon modern ears, but many of the seemingly imperfect vocal attacks, for example, are in fact grace notes, launched from as much as a tenth below the note ‚Äì in Moreschi's case, this seems to have been a long-standing means of drawing on the particular acoustics of the Sistine Chapel itself. The dated aesthetic of Moreschi's singing, involving extreme passion and a perpetual type of sob, often sounds bizarre to the modern listener, and can be misinterpreted as technical weakness or symptomatic of an aging voice.A range of critical opinion can be read in, for example: Donington, R: A Performer's Guide to Baroque Music London, 1973, (pp. 73‚Äì74); Shawe-Taylor, D: A Castrato Voice on the Gramophone, appendix to Heriot, A: The Castrati in Opera (repr. London, 1975), pp. 225‚Äì27; Scott, M: The Record of Singing (London, 1977), pp. 10‚Äì11; Law, J: Alessandro Moreschi Reconsidered: A Castrato on Records (in \\"The Opera Quarterly\\", 1984 2(2), pp. 1‚Äì12); sleeve-notes to Alessandro Moreschi the Last Castrato Complete Vatican Recordings (Opal CD 9823); Clapton, N: Alessandro Moreschi and the Voice of the Castrato (London, 2008), pp. 197‚Äì216 passim The standard of his recordings is certainly variable; Moreschi recorded two versions of Rossini's \\"Crucifixus\\". In the first, Moreschi's first side from his first recording session in 1902, he sings off key, and continues to do so for several bars.Opal CD 9823, track 7, passage from 2'04 to 2'16 Whatever modern opinion may be of his recordings, the enthusiastic applause of his colleagues attests to their appreciation on at least one occasion, as can be heard at the end of his rendering of Tosti's song \\"Ideale\\".this can be heard at the end of track 3 on OPAL CD 9823 The best-known piece Moreschi recorded is the Bach/Gounod \\"Ave Maria\\" (though the Sistine Chapel choir recorded Mozart's Ave verum corpus, Moreschi's voice is not individually audible). Perhaps only here does Moreschi's singing approach the type of star quality that the great castrato performances of the Baroque era must have possessed; there is great fervour in the singing ‚Äì the above- mentioned \\"tear in every note\\" ‚Äì and Moreschi takes the climactic high B natural without apparent effort.OPAL CD 9823, track 12 References * de Hegermann-Lindencrone, A L: The Sunny Side of Diplomatic Life (New York, 1914) * Hab√∂ck, F: Die Kastraten und ihre Gesangskunst (Berlin, 1927) * Clapton, N: Alessandro Moreschi and the Voice of the Castrato (London, 2008) External links * The complete text of Tra le sollecitudini is available on-line in English at Tra Le Sollecitudini Instruction on Sacred Music * 1904 Recording of Bach/Gounod: Ave Maria Category:1858 births Category:1922 deaths Category:People from Monte Compatri Category:Castrati Category:Italian Roman Catholics Category:Italian opera singers Category:Burials at Campo Verano Category:19th-century Italian singers Category:19th-century male singers ","title":"Alessandro Moreschi"},{"id":"460394","text":"Keywords are the words that academics use to reveal the internal structure of an author's reasoning.

Each category serves its own function, as do the keywords inside of a given category. When someone uses a search engine, they type in one or more words describing what they are looking for: 'Norwich florist' or 'cheap holidays Greece', for example. These words or phrases are known as keywords. Corpus linguistic keywords In corpus linguistics, key words are words that appear with statistically unusual frequency in a text or a corpus of texts. They are identified by software that compares a word-list of the text with a word-list based on a larger reference corpus. A suitable term for the phenomenon is keyness. The procedure used, for example by WordSmith, to list key words and phrases and plot where they appear in texts. These items are very often of interest‚Äîparticularly those human readers would not likely notice, such as prepositions, time adverbs, and pronouns.

His circus became famous in the UK for its Christmas shows at Olympia in West London. His troupe was the last to perform with live animals on the Drury Lane Theatre stage. Early life Born in August 1873, Bertram was the son of Halford Mills of Paddington, London, an undertaker and the owner of the Reformed Funeral Company, a coach building works and the Undertakers Journal. Halford Mills was described as a \\"pioneer of embalming\\". Bertram was brought up on two small farms at Chalfont St. Giles (which his father owned for the purpose of sending his horses there to rest), where he developed his passion for horseback riding. He left school aged fifteen and started washing down the coaches for the family business, which was started by his grandfather (who used to be an evangelical preacher). Within a year he was driving a four-in- hand from London to Oxford wearing a cornflower in his morning coat, for which he later became recognised.  Career  He continued working for the family firm until the outbreak of World War I when he joined and served with the Royal Army Medical Corps, rising to the rank of Captain. On leaving the army he became interested in the \\"Wilkins and Young Circus\\". He made a wager with a friend that he could form a circus company and within a year be as good as they were. He did just that and thus the \\"Bertram Mills International Circus\\" was formed. The circus very quickly became a household name and the annual Christmas event became especially well-known. He made a point of inviting orphans to see the shows free. By 1930 (its heyday would last for the next thirty years, when it was the best and most famous live show) he had inaugurated a touring circus which became unique amongst British circuses, always appearing at Olympia for the Christmas season. VistaScreen released 3 different series of stereoviews featuring the circus. The guest lists indicate the show's renown; the Royal family, who were great supporters, attended every year, and Winston Churchill and similar dignitaries were also annual guests.  Personal life and family  Bertram Mills married his wife, Ethel (d. 1960), in 1901. They were parents of a daughter and two sons, Bernard Notley and Cyril Bertram Mills. After their father's death on 16 April 1938, both Bernard and Cyril took over running the Bertram Mills Circus, sustaining its success until the early 1960s, when it was finally disbanded due to widespread television viewing. Cyril Mills served with MI5 during World War II and was the spymaster who controlled Juan Pujol Garcia, codenamed \\"Garbo\\". Bertram Mills was cremated (his father had been one of the first three undertakers to offer this service in London) and is buried with his wife at Chalfont St Giles in Buckinghamshire, England.

E. Lawrence's appended translation of the caveat (Faisal could not read or write English). The Faisal‚ÄìWeizmann Agreement was a 3 January 1919 agreement between Emir Faisal, the third son of Hussein ibn Ali al-Hashimi, King of the short-lived Kingdom of Hejaz, and Chaim Weizmann, a Zionist leader who had negotiated the 1917 Balfour Declaration with the British Government, signed two weeks before the start of the Paris Peace Conference. Together with a letter written by T. E. Lawrence in Faisal's name to Felix Frankfurter in March 1919, it was one of two documents used by the Zionist delegation at the Peace Conference to argue that the Zionist plans for Palestine had prior approval of Arabs. The agreement was presented to Faisal in his room at the Carlton Hotel on 3 January in English, which Faisal could not read, and its contents were explained to Faisal by Lawrence as the sole translator. Faisal signed the document in the same meeting, without consulting his advisors awaiting him in a separate room, but added a caveat in Arabic next to his signature, such that Faisal considered the agreement was conditional on Palestine being within the area of Arab independence. The Zionist Organization submitted the Agreement to the Paris Peace Conference without the caveat. Yoav Gelber described the document as \\"of propaganda value only\\", since it quickly became clear that Faisal's conditions would not be met. Background: status of Palestine At the time the agreement was made, there had preceded it (apart from the Balfour Declaration) the McMahon-Hussein Correspondence, the Sykes-Picot Agreement, the Hogarth message, the Bassett Letter, the Declaration to the Seven and the Anglo-French Declaration. Of these, the Sykes-Picot Agreement had been made public by the Bolsheviks and the Declaration to the Seven as well as the Anglo-French Declaration were also public documents. The Sykes‚ÄìPicot Agreement had called for an \\"Arab State or a Confederation of Arab States ... under the suzerainty of an Arab chief\\". The French and British also proposed an international administration in the \\"brown area\\" (an area including Jerusalem, similar to and smaller than Mandate Palestine), the form of which was to be decided upon after consultation with Russia, and subsequently in consultation with the other Allies, \\"and the representatives of the Shereef of Mecca\\".The Sykes-Picot Agreement Henry McMahon had exchanged letters with Faisal's father Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca in 1915, in which he had promised Hussein control of Arab lands with the exception of \\"portions of Syria\\" lying to the west of \\"the districts of Damascus, Homs, Hama and Aleppo\\". Palestine lies to the southwest of these areas and wasn't explicitly mentioned. That modern-day Lebanese region of the Mediterranean coast was set aside as part of a future French Mandate. After the war the extent of the coastal exclusion was hotly disputed. Hussein had protested that the Arabs of Beirut would greatly oppose isolation from the Arab state or states, but did not bring up the matter of Jerusalem or Palestine. Between 1916 and 1920, the British government interpreted these commitments as including Palestine in the Arab area. However, in the 1922 Churchill White Paper they argued instead that Palestine had been excluded. On the basis of McMahon's assurances the Arab Revolt began on 5 June 1916. However, the British and French also secretly concluded the Sykes‚ÄìPicot Agreement on 16 May 1916.Khouri, Fred John (1985). The Arab- Israeli Dilemma. Syracuse University Press. , pp. 8‚Äì10. This agreement divided many Arab territories into British- and French-administered areas and allowed for the internationalisation of Palestine. Hussein learned of the agreement when it was leaked by the new Russian government in December 1917, but was satisfied by two disingenuous telegrams from Sir Reginald Wingate, High Commissioner of Egypt, assuring him that the British government's commitments to the Arabs were still valid and that the Sykes-Picot Agreement was not a formal treaty. Following the publication of the Balfour Declaration the British had dispatched Commander David George Hogarth to see Hussein in January 1918 bearing the message that the \\"political and economic freedom\\" of the Palestinian population was not in question. Hogarth reported that Hussein \\"would not accept an independent Jewish State in Palestine, nor was I instructed to warn him that such a state was contemplated by Great Britain\\".Huneidi, Sahar (2000). A Broken Trust: Herbert Samuel, Zionism and the Palestinians, 1920‚Äì1925. IB Tauris. , p. 66. According to Isaiah Friedman, Hussein was not perturbed by the Balfour Declaration and on 23 March 1918, in Al Qibla, the daily newspaper of Mecca, attested that Palestine was \\"a sacred and beloved homeland of its original sons\\", the Jews; \\"the return of these exiles to their homeland will prove materially and spiritually an experimental school for their [Arab] brethren.\\" He called on the Arab population in Palestine to welcome the Jews as brethren and cooperate with them for the common welfare.Palestine, a Twice-promised Land?: The British, the Arabs & Zionism, 1915‚Äì1920 By Isaiah Friedman, page 171 Whereas Kedourie (as well as Friedman) have argued that Hussein accepted the Balfour Declaration,Friedman, 2000, p. 328.Kedourie, 2002, p. 257. Charles D.Smith has argued that both Friedman and Kedourie misrepresent documents and violate scholarly standards in order to reach their conclusions. while Schneer says that historians have spilled oceans of ink tracing the initial reactions of Hussein and his sons to the Balfour Declaration without settling the debate, noting that Hussein considered Palestine to be Arab land. Continuing Arab disquiet over Allied intentions also led during 1918 to the British Declaration to the Seven and the Anglo-French Declaration, the latter promising \\"the complete and final liberation of the peoples who have for so long been oppressed by the Turks, and the setting up of national governments and administrations deriving their authority from the free exercise of the initiative and choice of the indigenous populations\\"{.Report of a Committee Set up to Consider Certain Correspondence Between Sir Henry McMahon and the Sharif of Mecca in 1915 and 1916 , UNISPAL, Annex A, paragraph 19. Prelude to the Agreement Emir Faisal I and Chaim Weizmann (left, wearing Arab headdress as a sign of friendship) in 1918 in Transjordan Weizmann first met Faisal in June 1918, during the British advance from the South against the Ottoman Empire in World War I. As leader of an impromptu \\"Zionist Commission\\", Weizmann traveled to southern Transjordan for the meeting. Weizmann had assured Faisal that \\"the Jews did not propose to set up a government of their own but wished to work under British protection, to colonize and develop Palestine without encroaching on any legitimate interests\\".C.D. Smith, 2001, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 4th ed., , p. 80 Antonius commented in 1938 that: \\"The combined effect of those assurances had been to induce in him a belief that there was nothing either in the Zionist aspirations as such or in the policy professed by the British Government in regard to their fulfilment that would interfere with Arab political and economic freedom in Palestine\\". Weizmann's intended purpose was to forge an agreement between Faisal and the Zionist movement to support an Arab Kingdom and Jewish settlement in Palestine, respectively. The wishes of the Palestinian Arabs were to be ignored, and, indeed, both men seem to have held the Palestinian Arabs in considerable disdain. In the event, Weizmann and Faisal established an informal agreement under which Faisal would support close Jewish settlement in Palestine while the Zionist movement would assist in the development of the vast Arab nation that Faisal hoped to establish. After concerns were expressed by Cecil regarding draft proposals put forward by the Advisory Committee on Palestine (chaired by Herbert Samuel), Balfour suggested to Weizmann that \\"it would be very helpful indeed if the Zionists and Feisal could act unitedly and reach an agreement on certain points of possible conflict'.Weizmann and Faisal met again on 11 December 1918, while both were in London preparing their statements for the upcoming peace conference in Paris. Two weeks prior to signing the agreement, on 12 December 1918, Faisal was quoted in The Times, in a piece which Ali Allawi writes was \\"no doubt instigated by Lawrence and the Foreign Office\\": > The two main branches of the Semitic family, Arabs and Jews, understand one > another, and I hope that as a result of interchange of ideas at the Peace > Conference, which will be guided by ideals of self-determination and > nationality, each nation will make definite progress towards the realization > of its aspirations. Arabs are not jealous of Zionist Jews, and intend to > give them fair play and the Zionist Jews have assured the Nationalist Arabs > of their intention to see that they too have fair play in their respective > areas. Turkish intrigue in Palestine has raised jealousy between the Jewish > colonists and the local peasants, but the mutual understanding of the aims > of Arabs and Jews will at once clear away the last trace of this former > bitterness, which, indeed, had already practically disappeared before the > war by the work of the Arab Secret Revolutionary Committee, which in Syria > and elsewhere laid the foundation of the Arab military successes of the past > two years.'Jews And Arabs in Syria: The Emir Feisul Looks to a Bright > Future', The Times, Thursday, 12 December 1918; pg. 7; Issue 41971; col B. Two days prior to the agreement, on 1 January 1919, Faisal's delegation submitted a statement to the Peace Conference, and a further memorandum was submitted on 29 January. The statement referred to the goal to \\"unite the Arabs eventually into one nation\\", defining the Arab areas as \\"from a line Alexandretta ‚Äì Persia southward to the Indian Ocean\\" (1 January) or \\"from the line Alexandretta ‚Äì Diarbekr southward to the Indian Ocean\\" (29 January). The latter memorandum described boundaries of any new states as \\"matters for arrangement between us, after the wishes of their respective inhabitants have been ascertained\\" in a reference to US President Woodrow Wilson's policy of self determination. Agreement They signed the written agreement, which bears their names, on 3 January 1919. Faisal was not explicitly authorised by his father to enter into such an agreement, with his instructions from his father limited to the requirement that he accept only fulfilment of the previous British promises for Arab independence; the caveat was added as a result. The next day, Weizmann arrived in Paris to head the Zionist delegation to the Peace Conference.  Text of the Agreement  Agreement Between Emir Feisal and Dr. Weizmann 3 January 1919''' His Royal Highness the Emir Feisal, representing and acting on behalf of the Arab Kingdom of Hedjaz, and Dr. Chaim Weizmann, representing and acting on behalf of the Zionist Organization, mindful of the racial kinship and ancient bonds existing between the Arabs and the Jewish people, and realizing that the surest means of working out the consummation of their natural aspirations is through the closest possible collaboration in the development of the Arab State and Palestine, and being desirous further of confirming the good understanding which exists between them, have agreed upon the following: Articles: Given under our hand at London, England, the third day of January, one thousand nine hundred and nineteen Chaim Weizmann Feisal Ibn-Hussein  Main points of the agreement  * The agreement committed both parties to conducting all relations between the groups by the most cordial goodwill and understanding, to work together to encourage immigration of Jews into Palestine on a large scale while protecting the rights of the Arab peasants and tenant farmers, and to safeguard the free practice of religious observances. The Muslim Holy Places were to be under Muslim control. * The Zionist movement undertook to assist the Arab residents of Palestine and the future Arab state to develop their natural resources and establish a growing economy. * The boundaries between an Arab State and Palestine should be determined by a Commission after the Paris Peace Conference. * The parties committed to carrying into effect the Balfour Declaration of 1917, calling for a Jewish national home in Palestine. * Disputes were to be submitted to the British Government for arbitration. Weizmann signed the agreement on behalf of the Zionist Organization, while Faisal signed on behalf of the short-lived Arab Kingdom of Hedjaz. Faisal's caveat Faisal conditioned his acceptance on the fulfillment of British wartime promises to the Arabs, who had hoped for independence in a vast part of the Ottoman Empire. He appended to the typed document a hand-written statement, next to which Lawrence added a slightly inaccurate translation: { class=\\"wikitable mw-collapsible\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\" - ! colspan=\\"3\\" Text of the caveat - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width: 33%;\\"  Original ArabicAl- Mamlaka, 24 September 2018, ŸÇŸÜÿßÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÖŸÑŸÉÿ© - ÿßŸÑÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿπŸÖÿßÿ± ÿÆÿØÿπ Ÿàÿ≠ÿßÿ±ÿ® ÿßŸÑŸáÿßÿ¥ŸÖŸäŸäŸÜ ŸÑŸÉŸÜŸáŸÖ ÿ£ÿµÿ±Ÿàÿß ÿπŸÑŸâ ÿπÿ±Ÿàÿ®ÿ© ŸÅŸÑÿ≥ÿ∑ŸäŸÜ [Colonialism deceived and fought the Hashemites, but they insisted on the Arabism of Palestine]: \\"...

Allawi interprets Faisal as referring to his memorandum submitted on 1 January. Subsequent discussions=Paris Peace Conference Faisal submitted his written proposals to the Conference on 27 January.

Lawrence 1990 Atheneum pages 606‚Äì7 according to Bonsal's memoirs, stated very different views from the agreement with Weizmann: > If the views of the radical Zionists, as presented to the Peace Conference, > should prevail, the result will be a ferment, chronic unrest, and sooner or > later civil war in Palestine. But I hope I will not be misunderstood. I > assert that we Arabs have none of the racial or religious animosity against > the Jews which unfortunately prevail in many other regions of the world. I > assert that with the Jews who have been seated for some generations in > Palestine our relations are excellent. But the new arrivals exhibit very > different qualities from those \\"old settlers\\" as we call them, with whom we > have been able to live and even co-operate on friendly terms. For want of a > better word I must say that new colonists almost without exception have come > in an imperialistic spirit. They say that too long we have been in control > of their homeland taken from them by brute force in the dark ages, but that > now under the new world order we must clear out; and if we are wise we > should do so peaceably without making any resistance to what is the fiat of > the civilised world.S. Bonsal, Suitors and Suppliants, The Little Nations at > Versailles, Prentice Hall 1946 p. 56 Faisal made his appearance before the Supreme Council on 6 February and, in a further sign that his Zionist sympathy might be wavering, suggested that \\"Palestine, in consequence of its universal character, be left on one side for the mutual consideration of all parties concerned\\". The Zionists written submission was made on 3 February with their appearance before the Supreme Council on 27 February. Le Matin interview A 1 March interview by Le Matin quoted Faisal as saying: > This feeling of respect for other religions dictates my opinion about > Palestine, our neighbor. That the unhappy Jews come to reside there and > behave as good citizens of this country, our humanity rejoices given that > they are placed under a Muslim or Christian government mandated by The > League of Nations. If they want to constitute a state and claim sovereign > rights in this region, I forsee very serious dangers. It is to be feared > that there will be a conflict between them and the other races. Frankfurter correspondence Letter to Felix Frankfurter written by T. E. Lawrence in the name of Prince Faisal, March 1919 Although Allawi states that Faisal had been misquoted he says that the Le Matin interview resulted in difficulties with the Zionists leading to a meeting between Faisal and Frankfurter followed by Lawrence drafting of a letter to Felix Frankfurter, President of the Zionist Organization of America, on 3 March 1919, signed by Faisal: > \\"The Arabs, especially the educated among us, look with the deepest sympathy > on the Zionist movement. Our deputation here in Paris is fully acquainted > with the proposals submitted yesterday by the Zionist Organization to the > Peace Conference, and we regard them as moderate and proper.\\"Letter by Emir > Feisal to Felix Frankfurter, published in full at amislam.com (collection of > correspondence). Frankfurter replied on 5 March \\"..These aims are now before the Peace Conference as definite proposals by the Zionist Organisation. We are happy indeed that you consider these proposals 'moderate and proper,' and that we have in you a staunch supporter for their realisation.\\" =Controversy= When the letter was tabled at the Shaw Commission in 1929, Rustam Haidar spoke to Faisal in Baghdad and cabled that Faisal had \\"no recollection that he wrote anything of the sort\\". In January 1930, Haidar wrote to a newspaper in Baghdad that Faisal: \\"finds it exceedingly strange that such a matter is attributed to him as he at no time would consider allowing any foreign nation to share in an Arab country\\". Awni Abd al-Hadi, Faisal's secretary, wrote in his memoirs that he was not aware that a meeting between Frankfurter and Faisal took place and that: \\"I believe that this letter, assuming that it is authentic, was written by Lawrence, and that Lawrence signed it in English on behalf of Faisal. I believe this letter is part of the false claims made by Chaim Weizmann and Lawrence to lead astray public opinion.\\" According to Allawi, the most likely explanation for the Frankfurter letter is that a meeting took place, a letter was drafted in English by Lawrence, but that its \\"contents were not entirely made clear to Faisal. He then may or may not have been induced to sign it\\", since it ran counter to Faisal's other public and private statements at the time. Mack notes that Frankfurter reprinted the letter in the October 1930 issue of The Atlantic Monthly, vouched for its authenticity, commenting \\"Prince Feisal's letter was a document prepared under the most responsible conditions\\" and that although Faisal objected to interpretations that understood his letter to mean consent to Zionist policy, he did not disavow its authorship. Failure of the Agreement=Syrian National Congress and Kingdom of Syria Book of the Independence of Syria, 8 March 1920, showing the declared borders of Faisal's Arab Kingdom of Syria, including Palestine. In October 1918, British and Arab forces had captured Damascus during the Arab Revolt and Faisal formed a government. In May 1919, elections were held for the Syrian National Congress. On 2 July 1919 the Congress in a memorandum presented to the King-Crane Commission completely opposed any migration to Palestine and the latter not to be separated from Syria. According to C.D. Smith, the Syrian National Congress had forced Faisal to back away from his tentative support of Zionist goals.C.D. Smith, 2001, Palestine and the Arab- Israeli Conflict, 4th ed., , p. 111 At this point, the Agreement could be seen as a dead letter.Zionism, Post-Zionism & the Arab Problem: A Compendium of Opinions about the Jewish State Yosef Mazur WestBow Press 2012 p. 123 On 7 March 1920, Faisal was proclaimed King of Arab Kingdom of Syria (Greater Syria). In April 1920, the San Remo conference gave France the mandate for Syria, which led to the Franco-Syrian War. In the Battle of Maysalun on 24 July 1920, the French were victorious and Faisal was expelled from Syria after which he contended that the conditions he appended were not fulfilled and the agreement therefore moot. According to contemporaries, including Gertrude Bell and T. E. Lawrence, the French, with British support, betrayed Faisal and the Arab cause rendering the treaty invalid.Georgina Howell, 2006, Gertrude Bell: Queen of the Desert, Shaper of Nations Hussein's views St. John Philby, a British representative in Palestine, later stated that Hussein bin Ali, the Sharif of Mecca and King of Hejaz, on whose behalf Faisal was acting, had refused to recognize the agreement as soon as it was brought to his notice.News Chronicle, 9 July 1937, quoted by 'Palestine, star or crescent?', Neville Barbour, Odyssey Press, New York, 1947, p. 100 Disclosure of the agreement The agreement was first disclosed to the public in 1936. It was noted by UNSCOP that \\"To many observers at the time, conclusion of the Feisal- Weizmann Agreement promised well for the future co-operation of Arab and Jew in Palestine\\", and further referring to the 1937 report of the Palestine Royal Commission which noted that \\"Not once since 1919 had any Arab leader said that co-operation with the Jews was even possible\\" despite expressed hopes to the contrary by British and Zionist representatives.Peel Commission Report, p78 UNSCOP did not regard the agreement as ever being valid,Official Records of the Second Session of the General Assembly (A/364) , United Nations, 3 September 1947 although Weizmann asserted that the treaty should be considered valid while at the same time agreeing that Faisal had the right to void it after losing Syria to the French. In popular culture Faisal-Weizmann agreement is described in one stanza of the Urdu philosophical poetry book Bang-e-dara by Allama Iqbal (written in 1924).
