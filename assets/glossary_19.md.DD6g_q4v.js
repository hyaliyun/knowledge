She is known for her layered, personal, and poetic approach to contentious histories and current events through experiments with the moving image. Regarded as one of the pioneers of her home country Vietnam's independent cinema, Thi is seen as the most notable video artist in Vietnam's contemporary art scene. She plays an important role in the country's cinema, with works shown in international festivals and exhibitions. Inspired by her heritage, her pieces are powerful and haunting, and they focus on social and cultural issues, especially the complex, traumatic history of Vietnam and its after-effects in the present. In her longer documentary films, she employs calm and quiet visuals while eschewing voiceovers in order to let the people of her country speak directly to the camera. Her diverse practice has consistently investigated the role of memory in the necessary unveiling of hidden, displaced, or misinterpreted histories, and she has examined the position of artists in the Vietnamese society.  Styles and Themes  Nguyen's works dealt with unspoken histories in Vietnam and called into question national agendas and societal norms. Her nuanced treatment of provocative and political content encapsulates the complexities of Southeast Asian history and the perplexing (and sometimes frustrating) role of the artist working within this multi-faceted sociopolitical framework. Her practice has consistently investigated the role of memory in the necessary unveiling of hidden, displaced, or misinterpreted histories, often making use of original documentary footage or undertaking extensive investigative field work. Her materials are diverse ‚Äì from video and photographs shot by herself, to those appropriated from various sources including press photos, corporate videos, and classic films. Her practice traverses boundaries between film and video art, installation and performance. Trinh Thi is interested in History, the Truth, in taboo subjects. She gives voice to marginalized people in society, to those who have suffered trauma in the past. She is a filmmaker who dares to question the country's history, one that differs from the reconstruction produced by propaganda. Trinh Thi leads searches not only for reality, but is also for images. In her quest, she is constantly experimenting with new structures, formal tests on her creative path. She goes from the live-movie (Love man love woman) to found-footage thumbnail (Song to the front), from experimental documentary (Chronicle of a Tape Recorded Over) to video installations (Unsubtitled, Que faire). At the core of her work, a progressive exploration of her personal vision, Trinh Thi pays attention to gestural details, to the expressive faces of people who expose themselves and emerge from the backdrop of a chaotic world. Her gaze is silent, anxious, humanist.  Life and education  Nguyen Trinh Thi studied journalism, photography, international relations, and ethnographic film in the United States. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Russian and English from Hanoi Foreign Studies College, Hanoi, in 1994; a master's degree in Professional Journalism, University of Iowa, Iowa City, in 1999; and Master of Pacific International Affairs, University of California, San Diego (UCSD), in 2005. After studying journalism and photography at the University of Iowa; and international studies and ethnographic film at University of California, San Diego, she decided to return to Vietnam to pursue a career as an independent filmmaker at a time when this concept was still foreign and filmmaking was very difficult due to censorship. Thi returned to her home country, Vietnam, after spending many years in the United States, where she studied journalism and filmmaking among other things. Here, documentary films had primarily been the domain of the Vietnam Documentary & Scientific Studio, which produces films by order of the government. A free documentary film scene was practically non-existent, for numerous reasons: There was no access to work opportunities, production budgets and distribution channels, as well as to training opportunities, contacts to the international scene and knowledge about the development trends of documentary films elsewhere in the world. This was augmented by the pressure of censorship and the lack of interest of the general public, which equated documentary films with propaganda. So there were many different obstacles preventing a documentary film culture from developing in Vietnam. In 2009, Nguyen founded and directs Hanoi DocLab, an educational center and studio for the production of documentary films and video art in Hanoi. Work=Letters from Panduranga (2015) = Through a network of Champa scholars, Nguyen spent a number of residency periods in Ninh Thuan between 2013 and 2015. Letters from Panduranga extends her experimentation between documentary and fiction in an essay film portraying a Cham community living in the most southern and last surviving territory of Champa, an ancient kingdom dating back nearly two thousand years and conquered by Dai Viet (present day Vietnam) in 1832. The essay film, made in the form of a letter exchange between two filmmakers, was inspired by the fact that the Vietnamese government is to build Vietnam's first two nuclear power plants in Ninh Thuan, right at the spiritual heart of the Cham people, threatening the survival of this ancient matriarchal Hindu culture. Public discussions regarding the project have been largely absent in Vietnam due to strict government controls over public speech and media, and local communities have also been excluded from consultations. The film alludes to the legacy of war and colonialism; exploring and reflecting on landscape and portrait, documentary and fiction, and art and ethnography as methods of working in film and art, and their limitations in accessing other cultures, peoples, and experiences, as well as history and the past. Nguyen Trinh Thi says, \\"As artists, we have contradictory desires: to be engaged, but also to disappear.\\" Among other references are facts relating to the United States' destructive bombing during the Vietnam War, artifacts from colonial exhibitions and art collections, the vulgar place of tourists and the cultural policies of UNESCO, and quotes from one of Nguyen's main influences, Chris Marker, notably his film essay Letter from Siberia (1957), and Statues Also Die (1953), both of which were incisive and novel in their critique of the impacts of industrial and colonial movements. In previously mentioned Art Radar interview it was asked: In Letters from Panduranga, you said you did not want to speak on behalf of the \\"other\\" ‚Äì the Cham community. However, they are part of contemporary Vietnam and their history has been subsumed into Vietnamese history. Why were you nervous to represent the Cham people? To which Nguyen responded: Although we are all part of Vietnam now, we belong to very different groups. Vietnam is a national group, but there are so many methods of categorisation. My biggest concern was that I was imposing my perspective and vision on them. After the trip, I made a version that was more like a documentary, but I didn't like it. It felt like the film was pretending to be objective, without really reflecting the depth and complexity of the story. Letters from Panduranga is not a film solely about the Cham people. I tried to connect their struggle to a broader issue ‚Äì suppression of our voices. As I mentioned earlier, the underlying theme is power structures and who can use the image. =Song to the Front (2011‚Äì2012) = Nguyen Trinh Thi re-edited the historical Vietnamese war film, B√†i Ca Ra Tr·∫≠n, which was originally produced in 1973 by the Vietnam Feature Film Studio. She transformed the obscure black-and-white classic into a vignette that deconstructed the melodramatic and romanticized elements of social-realist drama. An original Northern Vietnamese film, Song to the Front is a propagandist story of patriotism, a typical genre of this style of cinema that glorifies the heroic struggle of the proletariat class. Nguyen uses a form of suspense editing akin to the mastery of Hitchcock, where the composition of the lens, grade of color, and sound dramatizes the narrative. In Nguyen's edit, this near-blinded young man is shown as a human being with emotion who transforms into a fighting machine. A starry-lit sky cuts in and then a series of birds take flight. This young man's eyes may be bandaged but his memories give him strength. After receiving surgery for his battle wounds, this heroic soldier is very weak with poor sight, but determined to continue to fight. The piece ends with the sounds of firing bullets and a young man's crazed glee at qualifying as marksman to return to the front with a gun in his hands. Nguyen extrapolates the central narrative of the film into a five- minute abstraction, her jump cuts and use of still frames are heightened with her use of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, referring to the ritual in pre- Christian Russia where a young girl dances herself to death ‚Äì a vision that Stravinsky claimed was to propitiate the god of Spring. For Nguyen, these young soldiers who gave their lives for their country are the sacrificed pagans. Her version of 'Song to the Front' plays with the original plot line in a deliberately ambiguous manner, designing an imaginative space for the viewer to reinterpret what were intended to be very literal epics that enforce an ideological view. =Series: \\"Unsubtitled\\" (2010), \\"Que faire\\" (2012), and \\"Solo for a Choir\\" (2013)= In this series, Nguyen explores the possibilities for combining video installation with performance art, and of preserving differences of individuals while creating a sense of collective experience. Nguyen worked on a long-term film project about the Nh√¢n VƒÉn‚ÄìGiai Ph·∫©m affair ‚Äì the suppressed literary movement of the 1950s and the only instance of widespread intellectual dissidence ever to occur in North Vietnam ‚Äì and its legacy of dissent in Vietnamese art over the past five decades. Thematically, she continues to study these issues and reflects on the history and development of the role and position of the artist in Vietnamese society and issues related to Vietnam's problems concerning censorship and artist freedom of expression. Nguyen invited nineteen Hanoi artists who make up the social constellation of Nha San Studio to face the camera, eat a food item of their choice, and to then state their name followed by the food item they had just consumed. Individually, these are statements parodying the Maoist practice of self-criticism, interrogation sessions where the artist in question must unequivocally explain the meaning of his work. Collectively, the chorus evokes a quiet protest against the long-running methods of surveillance and intimidation that are still pervasive in Vietnam. =Landscape Series #1 (2013)= Nguyen's Landscape Series #1 (2013) meditates on the idea of the landscape \\"as the silent witness of history.\\" During her search for photos, Nguyen came across hundreds of images of unidentified people in landscapes in the same position: pointing to indicate a past event, the location of something gone, something lost or missing. In these images, the figures are all in a similar pose, pointing at something unseen in the distance ‚Äì a drama, a disappearance, a tragic episode, something that clearly seems to represent a past or a present threat, a yawning gap ‚Äì which, since it cannot be seen, can only be pointed out. Together these anonymous witnesses, portrayed in compelling uniformity by innumerable Vietnamese press photographers, seem to be indicating a direction, a way forward out of the past, a fictional journey. =Love Man Love Woman (2007)= Nguyen's documentary Love Man Love Woman (2007) explores the lives of gay men in Vietnam and focuses on the prevalent theme of repression in society. The film portrays master Luu Ngoc Duc, a famous spirit medium in Hanoi, as well the Mother Goddess cult in Vietnam, whose communities offer a haven to many gay Vietnamese. The Dong Co, or the religion's priestesses, perform rites and rituals that include dazzling altars, flamboyant costumes, candles, incense, sequins, and feathers. Love Man Love Woman is not an ethnographic film about the Dao Mau community. The essence of the film is Master Luu Ngoc Duc, a spirit medium of the religion. He has a very rich Vietnamese vocabulary and was always quoting literature, poetry and folk phrases. It is amazing to watch him talk, and that kind of language is dying. Young people don't talk like that anymore, even I find my Vietnamese so poor. She has produced documentary and experimental films that have been screened in film festivals in USA, China, Cambodia, Indonesia, Brazil, and in Europe. She has taken part in international exhibitions such as Singapore Biennale 2013, Jakarta Biennale 2013, Move on Asia: Video Art in Asia 2002 to 2012 (ZKM Museum of Contemporary Art, Germany 2013), Women in Between: Asian Women Artists 1984-2012 (Fukuoka Asian Art Museum, Japan 2012),and Kuandu Biennale (Taiwan 2010). Based in Hanoi, she also founded and directs Hanoi DOCLAB, a center for documentary films and the moving image since 2009. She's had participation in the International Short Film Festival Oberhausen; Arthub, Bangkok. Exhibitions a.o. at the Tate Modern, London; Stenersen Museet, Oslo. Solo exhibitions a.o. at NhaSan Studio, Hanoi; Kuandu Biennale, Taipei. Two of her video works, Love Man Love Woman (2007) and Letters from Panduranga (2015) were showcased at NTU Centre for Contemporary Art Singapore (NTU CCA Singapore) for the exhibition \\"Ghosts and Spectres‚ÄîShadows of History\\", which ended on 19 November 2017.  DocLab  Thi worked together with a group of filmmakers and artists to elaborate a concept for a centre for documentary films and video art, described as \\"a centre with its focus on education, art, research and experimentation\\". The name was suddenly there, DocLab, a lab for experiments and a Vietnamese play with the sound of words and their meanings, and the right place was also found promptly: in the building of the Hanoi Goethe Institute, as, due to the cultural agreement, this was the only place with free access and a censure- free area. Despite considerable resistance, Thi and a small group of Vietnamese filmmakers and artists have succeeded in building a centre step by step with the help of the Goethe Institute which provides training and promotes exchange in the area of documentary films besides having produced a community of committed young filmmakers who are increasingly networked with the international scene, thereby pushing open a door to the world for Vietnamese documentary films. In 2007, she founded Hanoi Independent Documentary & Experimental Filmmakers Forum (Hi-DEFF) to encourage independent filmmaking in Vietnam and collaborations among artists, filmmakers and others that holds biweekly documentary and experimental film screenings in Hanoi. Nguyen is the founding director of Hanoi DocLab (2009), a centre which provides training besides having produced a community of committed young filmmakers who are increasingly networked with the international documentary scene, where she continues to teach today. DOCLAB is a center/lab for documentary filmmaking and video art opened in October 2009 and based at the Goethe Institute in Hanoi. Their activities include: ‚Ä¢ Basic film and video training courses ‚Ä¢ Editing, sound-designing and writing workshops ‚Ä¢ Weekly screenings and discussions opened for everyone ‚Ä¢ Editing lab for filmmakers and video artists ‚Ä¢ Video/film and book library accessible to the public In a 2017 interview with Art Radar when asked, \\"Do you think that it is part of the role of the artist in Southeast Asia to create platforms for public exposure in the arts?\\" She answered: \\"DOCLAB came out of a need to start a community. Before I moved back to Vietnam, there were not many independent artist communities in Hanoi. Community is very important when you work as an independent artist. When I lived in Los Angeles, I was close to the Echo Park Film Center and it was very inspiring for me. When I moved back to Hanoi, I became involved in different film projects and learned more about the local conditions through those experiences. When the Goethe Institute offered a grant to do something in documentary film, I already had an idea about what we needed locally and the best approach to take in building such an organisation. Over the years, DOCLAB became a complete system with training courses, screenings, exchange, and now we even have festivals. I taught there for the first three years but now I've stopped to focus on my own work.\\" In a 2010 interview\\"DISPATCH.\\" Interview by Zoe Butt. INDEPENDENT CURATORS INTERNATIONAL, April 1, 2010, 1-4. Accessed November 18, 2018. http://curatorsintl.org/images/uploads/DISPATCH_Nguyen.pdf. when asked, \\"what affect do you think this will have on the nurturing of film practice and screening in Vietnam?\\" She answered: \\"I don't have any ambitions in changing the film practice in Vietnam. This is a very small effort; it won't change the industry a bit. I'm also not training professional people. I hope to give people larger exposure to practices of documentary filmmaking in the world, encourage them to create and think for themselves. Actually people who come to the training and screenings come from all kinds of disciplines. We're also hoping to nurture a local audience with a more critical awareness of documentary and experimental film, and video art.\\" Filmography \\"Eleven Men\\": found footage (2016) \\"Jo Ha Kyu\\": experimental film, 10 minutes, HD video, color (2012) \\"I Died for Beauty\\", experimental film, 7 minutes, HD video, color (2012) \\"Rain, Poems, Toilet Paper\\": documentary, 70 minutes, video, color (in production) \\"Song to the Front\\": experimental film, 5 minutes, B&W; (2011) (#1 in project \\"Vietnamese Classics Re-Cut Series\\") \\"Unsubtitled\\": video installation (various loops), HD video, color (2011) \\"Chronicle of a Tape Recorded Over\\": experimental documentary, 25 minutes, video, color (2011) \\"Terminal\\": video, single channel, 5 minutes, color (2009) \\"Spring Comes Winter After\\": experimental video, 6 minutes, color (2009) \\"93 Years, 1383 Days\\": experimental documentary, 30 minutes, video, color (2008) \\"Love Man Love Woman\\": documentary, 52 minutes, video, color (2007) \\"A Chungking Road Opening\\": documentary,20 minutes, video, color (2005) Exhibitions/screenings Nguyen Trinh Thi's documentary and experimental films have been screened at international festivals and art exhibitions including Jeu de Paume, Paris (2015); CAPC mus√©e d'art contemporain de Bordeaux; the Lyon Biennale (2015); Asian Art Biennial, Taipei, Taiwan (2015), Taiwan; 5th Fukuoka Triennale, Fukuoka Asian Art Museum, Japan (2014); Finalist Exhibition, APBF Signature Art Prize, Singapore Art Museum (2014); 15th Jakarta Biennale, Indonesia (2013); \\"If The World Changed,\\" 4th Singapore Biennale (2013); \\"Move on Asia: Video Art in Asia 2002 to 2012,\\" ZKM, Karlsruhe, Germany (2013); Okinawa Prefecture Art Museum, Japan (2012); and DMZ International Documentary Film Festival, Korea (2011); Oberhausen International Film Festival; Bangkok Experimental Film Festival; Artist Films International; Summer Exhibition 2011, DEN FRIE Centre of Contemporary Art, Copenhagen; Unsubtitled, solo video installation, NhaSan Studio, Hanoi; 'PLUS/ Memories and Beyond ‚Äì 10 Solo Exhibitions by 10 Asian Artists', Kuandu Biennale, Taipei; and 'No Soul For Sale 2', Tate Modern, London.

Early life Christie was born on 21 April 1861 at Millbank in Cockpen, near Bonnyrigg, to Alison (n√©e Philp, c.1817‚Äì1894) and John Christie (1824-1902), a Scottish industrialist and landowner. Christie had an elder brother, John Coldwells who died in childhood in his 12th year in 1872, and a younger sister, Alice Margaret. In 1865 Christie's father purchased the Castleton estate in the Ochils, renaming it Cowden Castle, and the family moved there. Christie and her sister were educated at home by her parents and governesses. From an early age she made annual trips with her parents to Europe including Spain, Italy, Germany and the Low Countries. After her mother's death and her sister's marriage Christie continued to travel with her father and also alone or with a friend. She visited Egypt, Palestine and Syria and started to write about her trips. On her father's death in 1902 it was found that he had disinherited both Christie and her sister, leaving the entirety of his estate to an orphanage that he had founded without their knowledge. They contested the will and in 1903 it was settled with the estate being divided between the two sisters and the orphanage. Christie lived on at Cowden Castle and managed the estate.  Travels  After her father's death Christie's travels became more ambitious and she began to travel more widely. From 1904 to 1905 she travelled with her maid, Humphries, initially to India and then on to Kashmir, Tibet, Ceylon, Malaya and Borneo. Being well connected and carrying letters of introduction she attended a banquet with the Maharaja of Kashmir and dined with Lord Kitchener. Her adventures saw her camping in the snow at Chorbat Pass, sailing in a cargo ship full of pigs, travelling by pack horse and cart in the Kashmir wilderness and trekking by foot for in the Desoi mountains. In 1907 she visited China, Korea and Japan. While in Japan Christie was fascinated by the Japanese formal style of gardening, an interest that would inspire her to create a Japanese garden at Cowden Castle. In 1910 she packed a camp bed, stove, lamp, oatmeal and biscuits and travelled to Russian Turkestan. Her journey took her to Constantinople across the Black Sea, through Georgia to the Caspian Sea and onward to Ashkabad and Merv. She travelled by train and boat along the Silk Road, visiting Buhkhara, Samarkand, Kokand, and finally to Andhizan. Christie undertook a further trip to the Russian Empire in 1912. Starting in Saint Petersburg she travelled by train, steamer and droshky to Tashkent, Samarkand and Khiva. She was the first British woman to visit Khiva. In 1914 she visited the United States and Cuba. Christie kept an account of her travels in her diaries and she was in regular correspondence with her sister. She later wrote about her trips to the Russian Empire in the book Through Khiva to golden Samarkand.  World War I  In 1916, Christie travelled to France to become the manager of the L'Oeuvre de la Goutte de Caf√© at Bar-sur-Aube. This network of caf√©s was established by the French and British Red Cross as places for tired soldiers to relax and rest. The caf√© that Christie managed was staffed by five Scottish women and served the soldiers fighting at the Battle of Verdun. From 1918-1919 Christie oversaw another 'LOuevre de la Goutte de Caf√© at Mulhouse.  Japanese garden at Cowden Castle  The grave of Matsuo in Muckhart churchyard After her visit to Japan in 1907 Christie was inspired to create a Japanese garden at her home at Cowden Castle. She employed Taki Handi, from the Royal School of Garden Design in Nagoya, to help plan and design the garden. The burn on the estate was dammed and a hollow made to create an artificial loch. A pond and island garden was developed along with a stroll garden and a tea-house garden. Plants, shrubs, trees and a traditional stone lantern were imported from Japan. The garden was named ShƒÅh-raku-en meaning a place of pleasure or delight. Christie was advised on the form, maintenance and development of the garden by Professor Jijo Soya Suzuki, Master of the Soami School of Imperial Design. Suzuki considered the garden to the best Japanese garden in the Western world. Shinzaburo Matsuo lived and worked at Cowden as gardener from 1925 until his death in 1937. Queen Mary visited the garden in the late 1930s. After Christie's death in 1949 the garden was maintained by workers on the Cowden estate. In 1963 it was vandalised and the tea-houses and bridges were burned, and the lanterns and shrines knocked into the loch. In 2014 Christie's great great niece Sara Stewart started a fundraising campaign to raise ¬£1,000,000 to restore the garden. The garden opened in 2019.  Fellowships  Christie was a fellow Royal Geographical Society of Scotland, she was a Member of Council and in November 1934 she became a Vice-President of the Society. She was also a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. On 15 January 1913 the Royal Geographical Society voted to allow women to be elected members of the Society. On 10 February 1913 Christie was in the first cohort of women to be elected Fellows.  Death  The Christie burial plot in Muckhart churchyard Christie died of leukemia on the 29 January 1949 at Strathearn Road, Edinburgh. She is buried in the Christie family plot at Muckhart churchyard, east of Cowden. Her gardener Matsuo lies just to the south.

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 for having local significance in the themes of commerce and transportation. It was nominated for being one of the best preserved trackside buildings associated with Waseca's economic development as a rail hub. The building is now part of the Miller‚ÄìArmstrong Center, a redeveloped complex containing restaurants, a conference center, and lodging. Description Constructed of red brick, the rectangular building rises three stories and has some decorative brickwork along the roofline. The property was designed with a small front lawn to blend into what was at the time a mixed commercial and residential neighborhood, owing to the early-20th-century need of workers to live close to their places of employment. History Situated at the junction of the Winona and St. Peter Railroad and the Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway by 1867, Waseca quickly attracted many businesses and industries wishing easy access to rail transportation. W. J. Armstrong Company Wholesale Grocers built their warehouse around 1900, served by its own rail siding.

Early life M√©chakra was born in 1949 in Meskiana in northern Aures. At age nine, she began writing; taking notes in a \\"log-book\\" that grew over time. Two events profoundly marked her childhood: her father was tortured by the French during the Algerian Civil War before her eyes, exposed in the street, attached to the barrel of a tank. Little more is known of her life, although Kateb Yacine wrote in the preface to her book that she had a \\"cruel and troubled life\\".  Career  M√©chakra began writing her first novel in 1973, while studying psychiatry at the University of Algiers. Her university thesis in literature was devoted to Apuleius of Madaurus. In Algiers, she met Kateb Yacine before his departure for Rome and Paris. Yamina M√©chakra followed Yachine's style in writing, who gave her extended advice and guidance. She needed to rewrite three times to finish her first book, and \\"La Grotte √©clat√©e\\" was published in 1979. Yamina Mechakra argued that women was the source of the nation and the founding of an independent state. Referring to the Berber queen known as La Kahina, Kateb Yacine titled his preface of the novel as The Children of Kahina. While she continued to write during the succeeding years, but did not publish, confiding to a reporter that she lost her manuscripts. In 1997, when she treated a young boy as a psychiatrist, she was inspired writing her second novel Arris, which was published in 1999.

It is one of fifteen War Crosses designed by Lutyens with similar characteristics, and one of two to serve as a civic memorial in a city. The first proposal for the county's war memorial was to complete the construction of a cloister at Exeter Cathedral to be dedicated to Devon's war dead, but this scheme was abandoned due to lack of funds. After considering multiple proposals, the Devon County War Memorial Committee commissioned Lutyens to design a War Cross instead. The committee chose to site the memorial on the green of Exeter Cathedral after scouting several locations. A war memorial for Exeter itself was being considered concurrently, but the committees for the two projects failed to work together, resulting in two separate memorials‚Äîthe county memorial by the cathedral and Exeter City War Memorial in Northernhay Gardens. The memorial takes the form of a simple cross. Hewn from a single block of granite quarried from Haytor on Dartmoor, it stands just to the west of the cathedral, in alignment with the altar. The cross stands on a granite plinth, which itself sits on three steps. It was unveiled by the Prince of Wales on 16 May 1921. After archaeological excavations took place in the 1970s, the area was remodelled to create a processional way between the memorial and the cathedral. The memorial is a grade II* listed building, part of a \\"national collection\\" of Lutyens' war memorials. Since 2015, all of Lutyens' memorials in England have been protected by listed building status. Background During the aftermath of the First World War, thousands of war memorials were built across Britain. Amongst the most prominent designers of memorials was the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, described by Historic England as \\"the leading English architect of his generation\\". Prior to the First World War, Lutyens established his reputation designing country houses for wealthy patrons, including Castle Drogo to the west of Exeter. Following the war he devoted much of his time to memorialising the casualties. He served as one of the three principal architects to the Imperial War Graves Commission (IWGC) and designed numerous war memorials for towns and villages across Britain, as well as several elsewhere in the Commonwealth. His most famous design was The Cenotaph in London, which became the focus for the national Remembrance Sunday commemorations. The Devon County memorial is one of fifteen War Crosses designed by Lutyens to a similar specification between 1920 and 1925. Most of Lutyens' War Crosses were commissioned for small villages, but the Devon County memorial is one of two commissioned as a civic memorial in a city‚Äîthe other being the York City War Memorial.Skelton, p. 112.Gray, p. 109. Commissioning The 2nd Devonshires' memorial at La Ville-aux-Bois-l√®s- Pontavert, whose construction was supported by the Devon County War Memorial Committee The first proposal to commemorate Devon's war dead came from the Dean of Exeter in December 1918, a month after the signing of the armistice. The Dean suggested that a cloister could be built at Exeter Cathedral, possibly containing a monument, to serve as a war memorial but the idea was abandoned early in 1919 due to a lack of funds. Another proposal which attracted attention in the local media was for the construction of a new wing at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital.Gray, pp. 103‚Äì105. The idea of building a war memorial at all proved controversial‚Äîthe chairman of the local branch of the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilized Sailors and Soldiers felt that the funds would be better spent caring for surviving veterans and condemned the idea of a memorial as a \\"useless waste of money\\". Devon County Council formed the County War Memorial Committee, chaired by Hugh Fortescue, 4th Earl Fortescue, to consider 23 proposals including several submitted by the public.Gray, p. 105. The committee was reliant on public donations and realised that it was unlikely to raise a large sum of money as communities across Devon would be focusing on their own commemorations and commissioning individual war memorials. Despite this, the committee was determined to erect some sort of memorial to the county's war dead, and as a compromise sought a simple but elegant monument.Parker, p. 125. They commissioned Lutyens in 1920 and opted for his War Cross design. The committee considered several potential sites, including Cawsand Beacon on Dartmoor and the Haldon Hills in south Devon, but the committee's preferred location was the cathedral close of Exeter, Devon's county town.Parker, p. 127. The specific site was chosen so that the memorial would be visible from the High Street and Broadgate.Harvey, p. 171. With its remaining funds, the Devon County War Memorial Committee supported the construction of a battlefield memorial at La Ville-aux-Bois-l√®s- Pontavert in France to honour the 2nd Battalion of the Devonshire Regiment, who endured particularly heavy fighting at Bois des Buttes during the Third Battle of the Aisne.Parker, pp. 128‚Äì129.Gray, p. 106. The memorial is one of two major war memorials in Exeter, the other being the Exeter City War Memorial in Northernhay Gardens (the former grounds of Rougemont Castle). Exeter Cathedral also contains memorials to the Devonshire Regiment and the Wessex Field Ambulance. The city war memorial was the responsibility of a separate committee under the authority of Exeter City Council. The city and county memorial committees conspicuously failed to co-operate. According to Sir James Owen, chairman of the city committee, the city offered a joint committee but the county \\"slammed the door in our face\\", while Lord Fortescue accused the city of proceeding with its own project without any discussion with the county. Both committees wanted to design the principal memorial for Devon with the other simply contributing funds, but neither was willing to relinquish control. The result was that two very different memorials were constructed in Exeter‚Äîthe city's memorial takes the form of a figure of Victory on a large pedestal surrounded by further sculptures to form a cross.Gray, p. 108. History and design A view of the memorial and Exeter Cathedral Detail of the inscription on the base The project proceeded simply once the design was agreed. The memorial was built on the Cathedral Green, just to the west of the cathedral itself, in alignment with the altar‚Äîaccording to historian Hazel Harvey, \\"it faces east, standing on a hypothetical line drawn from the high altar through the nave of the cathedral\\". It lies to the northwest of a metal cross, the steeple finial from the church of St Mary Major, Exeter, marking the former location of that building which was demolished in 1971. The memorial takes the form of a granite cross, quarried from Haytor on Dartmoor, and hewn from a single stone‚Äîthe largest Lutyens was able to acquire.Meller, pp. 22‚Äì23. The cross is formed of a tapering flattened hexagonal shaft to which chamfered arms, no wider than the base, are moulded close to the top. It stands on a three-tiered base and a rectangular plinth, which itself sits on three stone steps as is customary for Lutyens' war memorials. The central tier of the base bears the inscription \\"THE COUNTY OF DEVON TO HER GLORIOUS DEAD / 1914‚Äì1919 / TE DEUM LAUDAMUS / 1939‚Äì1945\\". Upon its completion, Lutyens said of the monument, \\"it is very simple and a monolith and its subtlety in line means labour, care and thought. [...] It should endure forever\\". The memorial was unveiled on Whit Monday, 16 May 1921, by the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII), with Lutyens in attendance.Skelton, p. 75. At the unveiling ceremony, Lord Fortescue gave a speech in which he estimated that 11,600 men and women from Devon had been killed while serving in the war. He later stated that some 63,700 (8,000 regulars, 36,700 volunteers, and 19,000 conscripts) had served in the armed forces. The names of the fallen were recorded on a roll of honour, of which three copies were made: one for Exeter Cathedral, one to be held by the county council, and one which the Prince of Wales placed in a hollow in the base of the war memorial. The prince's visit generated considerable excitement in the area. Thousands of people lined the street to greet his motorcade and shops on the High Street hung out banners with welcoming messages. After the unveiling, Edward spent ten days touring the local area.Harvey, pp. 171‚Äì172. Archaeological excavations in the western part of the Cathedral Green in 1971 uncovered the remains of several Roman buildings including baths. The ruins were re-buried due to a lack of funds for preservation work,Bidwell, pp. vii, 22‚Äì24. but were scheduled as an ancient monument. In 1974, a processional way between the war memorial and the cathedral was commissioned from Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe. His design‚Äîwhich was implemented after further excavations took place in 1976‚Äîconsisted of a square forecourt at the west front of the cathedral from which a set of wide, shallow steps lead up to a platform at the memorial, emphasising its alignment with the altar and strengthening its visual connection with the cathedral.Pevsner, p. 410. An inscription was added in 1979 giving the dates of the Second World War. A set of metal railings‚Äîdescribed by author Tim Skelton as \\"an unfortunate addition\\"‚Äîwas erected around the foot of the memorial in 2006 in response to problems with vandalism and anti-social behaviour.Skelton, p. 168. On 16 April 2009, the memorial‚Äîincluding the processional way‚Äîwas designated a grade II* listed building for its special architectural or historic interest, a status which provides legal protection from unauthorised demolition or modification. In November 2015, as part of commemorations for the centenary of the First World War, Lutyens' war memorials were recognised as a \\"national collection\\". All 44 of his free-standing memorials in England were listed or had their listing status reviewed and their National Heritage List for England list entries updated and expanded.

For thousands of years, long before colonization, Coast Salish people have depended on salmon as a staple food source as well as sources for wealth and trade. Salmon is deeply embedded in their culture, identity, and existence as First Nations people of Canada. The five species of Pacific salmon found in waters of British Columbia are Sockeye, Pink, Chum, Coho, and Chinook. They are commonly found in the Fraser, Skeena, Nass, Somass, Thompson, and Adams rivers.Groot, C. and L. Margolis. 1991. Pacific Salmon Life Histories. Vancouver, UBC Press. = Diet = During the winter months, salmon is a main food that provide many sources of nutrients for the Coast Salish people. Salmon is preserved by drying, smoking, canning or freezing the fish. In the Fraser Canyon during the summer months, salmon is hung on racks placed on rock bluff and wind dried. Whereas smoked salmon is hung on poles and racks inside a smoke house for a few days. Alternatively, salmon can also be preserved by canning, where it is cut up into pieces, washed, salted, and then canned. Salmon can be eaten in many different ways such as roasted, boiled, or steamed. To roast it, salmon are placed on stakes around a fire and often eaten as snacks. Boiled and steamed salmon occur in bentwood boxes or open pits. = Cultural significance = Coast Salish housepost and Haida totem pole.

For example, \\"the potlatch functioned as a 'monitoring device' through which the sustainability of a title-holder‚Äôs fishing practices was repeatedly assessed by members of the tribes who potlatched together\\". Decisions about the timing, location, methods and quantity of fishing harvests were made to by community elders with deep knowledge of salmon fishing.Naxaxalhts‚Äôi, Albert (Sonny) McHalsie, \\"We Have to Take Care of Everything That Belongs to Us,\\" in Be of Good Mind: Essays on the Coast Salish, ed. Bruce G. Miller. Vancouver: UBC Press, 2007. 97-98. Fishing was not a distinct occupation but was instead integrated to the cultural laws of these communities. The arrival of canning technologies and commercial fishing industries the fishing practices of Coast Salish people were severely marginalized and altered. They could no longer fish without licenses and became wage workers . \\" Cannery operators considered Indigenous people to be at most \\"helpers\\" in the industrial fishery. As \\"helpers,\\" they were paid only for their labour, and not for the sale of their resources\\".Newell, Tangled Webs, 53, 77. The salmon is also presented as a cultural symbol for Coast Salish people in Totem poles, canoes and oars. In Totem Poles it is present as a symbol of life, abundance, prosperity and nourishment.Squamish Lil'wat Cultural Centre. (n.d.). ANIMAL SYMBOLOGY. Retrieved April 05, 2016, from http://shop.slcc.ca/node/5 It is also represents dependability and the renewing cycle of life, through its death the salmon sustains many other beings and still returns every year providing sustenance for humans and other animals. Ancestrally it is believed that in order for the salmon to return in abundance the following year, it has to be killed and disposed following certain ancestral guidelines. If these procedures are followed then the salmon will return in abundance and the reciprocal relationship will endure. Amongst the Kwak'waka'wakw a traditional ceremony celebrated the salmon spirits by donning individuals with salmon masks that symbolize the power of the salmon. They leap and dance with this masks like the salmon, leaps and swims against the river's current. This ceremony takes them on a spiritual journey \\"undersea world of the salmon people where they in-spirit their relationship with and dependence\\" on salmon. The salmon spirits respond by sending abundant salmon upstream for prosperous harvests. Salmon are at the base of many First Nations culture. There are songs, dances, visual arts and legends based on the lives of salmon. First Nations of B.C., including Bella Coola, Nootka, Tlingit and others, rely on salmon as a primary source of subsistence before the salmon population began declining.  Fishing methods  A diagram of Weir Fishing. The fishing practices and methods of the Coast Salish remain tied to the salmon as a cultural symbol and a source of respect. They fall under the category of artisanal fishing. They employ low-technology, traditional fishing techniques like net-fishing, stone-fishing and weir fishing. These techniques are common and found throughout the world in many different fishing communities, but the Coast Salish First Nations people employed this method in a slightly different way: \\"At the end of the net, a ring of willow was woven into the net, which allowed some salmon to escape\\".Nicholas Xumthoult Claxton, \\" IST√Å S&#262;I√ÅNEW, IST√Å SXOLE: ‚ÄòTo Fish as Formerly:‚Äô The Douglas Treaties and the WS√ÅNE&#262; Reef-Net Fisheries.\\" In Lighting the Eighth Fire: The Liberation, Resurgence, and Protection of Indigenous Nations, ed. Leanne Simpson. Winnipeg, Arbeiter Ring, 2008. 54-55. This was done in order to help with conservation of salmon, and out of respect for the animal. Some communities on Vancouver Island place willow and cedar nets in locations like the mouth of a bay in a perpendicular position to the shore. This way the flow and current of the river drove the salmon easily into their nets. Stone fishing consists of building \\"an arc of carefully positioned stones that created shallow pools from which salmon could be selectively harvested by waiting fishers\\".Charles Menzies and Caroline Butler, \\"Returning to Selective Fishing Through Indigenous Fishing Knowledge,\\"American Indian Quarterly 31, 3 (2007): 451-452. Then at moments of low tide the salmon were easily fished out of the stone traps and harvested. One of the other fishing methods employed by the Coast Salish First Nation people is weir fishing. Weirs are barriers placed across rivers. In this case they are made of wood and are used for fishing. \\"On relatively shallow, slow-moving tributaries, weirs were used to channel fish into traps, or towards fishers with other harvesting equipment. These fence-like structures often had panels that could be removed when not fishing, and had complex underwater channels and impounding pens\\".Keith Thor Carlson, \\"History Wars: Considering Contemporary Fishing Site Disputes,\\" in A Sto:lo Coast Salish Historical Atlas, ed. Keith Thor Carlson. Vancouver: Douglas & McIntyre, 2001. 58. Salmon Weir at Quamichan Village on the Cowichan River, Vancouver Island. Weir fishing remains a controversial method since it is argued, often by canneries, that these barriers impeded salmon from reaching their spawning grounds. Weir fishing is deemed illegal by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO). However, it is argued by some that weir fishing may actually help in the conservation of salmon. \\"Some environmentalists today are looking to weirs and other stationary traps as examples of selective harvesting techniques that could help conserve endangered salmon populations\\". Although they traditionally considered as Artisanal fishing, the methods used by the Coast Salish do not operate at a low scale level. It is estimated that \\"between 4 million and 12 million salmon would have been consumed annually, and this does not include fish harvested for trade, or for ceremonial purposes\\".David A. Smith, \\"Salmon Populations and the Sto:lo Fishery,\\" in A Sto:lo Coast Salish Historical Atlas, ed. Keith Thor Carlson. Vancouver: Douglas & McIntyre, 2001. 120. The organization and sustainment of this fishing system was maintained through careful regulation of \\" timing and level of harvest\\".Douglas Harris, Fish Law and Colonialism: The Legal Capture of Salmon in British Columbia. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2001. 96.  Legislation and policies = Fishing regulations = 300x300pxMany First Nations' communities have conducted their traditional fisheries through special harvesting practices and methods that have successfully sustained these salmon fisheries without the intervention of the Canadian government. Regulation was done by leaders of house groups who coordinated who, when, and how one could fish. The leader was someone who is responsible for the fishing grounds and resources were carefully regulated based on their background knowledge of the extended family, various fishing methods, capacity of dry rack, capacity of camps, number of children in extended families, and number of fishing rocks accessible. Slowly this is being replaced with government regulations and licenses that restrict First Nations and their access to fisheries and salmon which has led to great tension and conflict between the First Nations and non-indigenous fishermen. 1877: Use of weirs for fishing is outlawed. 1880: The Aboriginal Food Fishery was created. This restricted First Nation fishing for food only which to benefit and expand on commercial fishing. 1888: Regulation prohibiting fishing by \\"means of nets or other apparatus without leases or licenses from the Minister of Marine and Fisheries\\". Also indicating that \\"Indians shall, at all times, have liberty to fish for the purpose of providing food for themselves but not for sale, barter or traffic, by any means of other with drift nets or spearing. 1894: The Fishing Regulation Act was amended. Government officials required Aboriginals to acquire a permit to fish for food.Harris, Douglas. Fish Law and Colonialism: The Legal Capture of Salmon in British Columbia. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2001.Landing Native Fisheries: Indian Reserves & Fishing Rights in British Columbia, 1849-1925. Vancouver: UBC Press, 2008. 1917: New amendment that food fishing permits would be subject to the same closed seasons, area, and gear restriction as the non-Native commercial fishery.Newell, Dianne. Tangled Webs of History: Indians and the Law in Canada‚Äôs Pacific Coast Fisheries (Toronto: University of Toronto Press), 1994 1992: Aboriginal Fisheries strategy: Launched by Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) to provide stable fishery management after the Supreme Court of Canada ruling for Sparrow, Van der Peet. The decision found that Musqueam First Nation has an aboriginal right to fish for food, social, and ceremonial purposes, taking priority, after conservation, over other uses of the resource, and the importance of consulting with aboriginal groups when their fishing rights might be affected. 1994: The Allocation Transfer Program (ATP) was created with operating mandate of $4 million. Since this program, 87 community commercial licences have been issued to aboriginal groups. 1996: Federal Fisheries Minister Fred Mifflin announced the Pacific Salmon Revitalization Strategy. Involved an $80 million DFO-funded voluntary licence retirement program. 1998: Establishment of the Pacific Fisheries Adjustment and Restructuring Program (PFAR). This $200 million program allowed commercial licence holders to voluntary relinquish the licences and money were distributed to assist in more selective techniques, habitat restoration, and stewardship projects. = Fishing licences = As the number of non-indigenous fishers increased, more regulations and laws were imposed on the fisheries leading to the Aboriginal Communal Fishing Licences Regulation of 1993. Whereas Coast Salish people had been free to fish when and where they needed, from then on they had to seek fishing licences from the government. Many refused to give up their fishers or buy fisheries licenses and even insisted that the money for the licences belonged to them. In 1890s, only 40 indigenous fishers on the Fraser had licenses that allowed them to catch fish independently from canneries. In 1912, a policy termed \\"bona fide white fishermen\\" gave priority to non-indigenous people of the North Coast.Newell, Dianne. Tangled Webs of History: Indians and the Law in Canada‚Äôs Pacific Coast Fisheries (Toronto: University of Toronto Press), 1994. As well many were denied fishing license due to pressure from the cannery owners. Access to seine licences weren't available to First Nation fishers until 1924, when most non-native fishers have already obtained theirs. Though the government has established treaty rights for Coast Salish people to fish for food, it is still greatly regulated by Department of Fisheries and Oceans with restrictions as to what kind of gear can be used, the hours and days during which gear can be deployed, and the particular species that may be targeted.

On October 28, 1962 at 6:00 PM, Amina Belouizdad announced the birth of the Algerian Radio and Television (RTA) Channel; which replaced the French Radio and Television (RTF) Channel. She influenced generations of Algerians at a time when the RTA was the only available channel on television. In 1982, Belouizdad retired.  Life  Amina Belouizdad was born in 1931 in the neighbourhood of Belcourt (now Belouizdad) in Algiers. Her father, Tahar Ali-Cherif, who was a lawyer by profession, was born in the Kasbah of Algiers, and her mother, Maghnia Abed, was born in Chlef. In 1947 she married Zineddine Belouizdad with whom she had three sons. Career Prior to the Algerian revolution, Amina was expected to fulfill her duties as a wife and mother as dictated by Algerian traditions and customs. However, in order to supplement the family income, she replied to an offer of employment in 1958 from the French Radio and Television (RTF) channel looking for a television presenter. As a fluently bilingual native, she was hired for the position, also adopting the name \\"Amina\\" as it was considered to be more phonetically accessible to a French audience than the name \\"Rabia\\". At the beginning of the Algerian revolution, she devoted herself to supporting wives of imprisoned activists by organizing fundraising. In 1958, she became a bilingual presenter at RTF. She took advantage of her celebrity status to drive her car across military checkpoints to meet militants who, with the help of her husband, stayed in their homes before joining the maquis. One of these militants was Cherif El Hachemi, a colleague at the RTF. Amina continued her career as a television presenter up until her retirement in 1982. Despite her retirement, her popularity ensured that she would continue to be a reference on cultural matters, especially with regard to Chaabi and Andalusian music which she was very passionate about.

It is native to the eastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. It is a bottom-dwelling fish feeding on crustaceans, other invertebrates and fish. The females give birth to live young. Its lifestyle makes it vulnerable to trawling and other fishing methods, populations seem to be declining and it is subject to intensive fishing pressure, with its fins being sold into the Asian market. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being \\"critically endangered\\". Description The blackchin guitarfish is plain brown above and white below, and has a black blotch on its snout, more noticeable in juveniles than adult fish. It is similar in appearance to the common guitarfish (Rhinobatos rhinobatos) which is sympatric (shares the same range). Characteristic differences include the blackchin's smaller eyes, narrower rostral ridges (nearly united at the front), shorter front nasal lobe and narrower back nasal flap. Both species have short thorns present on the inner margins of the eye, on the shoulders and along the spine and tail, but these are less distinct in the blackchin. This species grows to a length of about , although larger fish have been reported from Guinea in West Africa and the Gulf of Gab√®s in the southern Mediterranean. Distribution The blackchin guitarfish is found in the warm temperate and tropical waters of the Mediterranean Sea and the eastern Atlantic Ocean between about 42¬∞N and 17¬∞S, 19¬∞W and 36¬∞E. Its northerly limit is the northern coast of Portugal and its southern limit is Angola. Its range in the Mediterranean Sea it mostly concentrated in the southern and eastern parts. It lives on the continental shelf at depths down to about . Ecology The blackchin guitarfish swims slowly over sandy and muddy stretches of seabed, foraging for shrimps, crabs, other crustaceans, squid and molluscs. Males reach sexual maturity at a length of about in Senegal, and females at about , while in Tunisia the lengths at maturity are and respectively. This fish is ovoviviparous, the eggs being retained in the uterus of the female and the developing young being nourished first by a yolk sac, and later by uterine secretions. Litter size varies between about four and six in Senegal, but larger litters occur in Tunisia. The gestation period is between about five and eight months, there sometimes being a diapause in the embryo's development in colder-water months in Senegal, but no diapause seems to occur in Tunisia. Status The blackchin guitarfish is a low-fecundity fish and mature individuals aggregate off the coast seasonally to deliver their young and mate. At this time, they are particularly vulnerable to fishing activity. This species is particularly valued for its fins which sell at a high price, but the fish are also used for food. They are caught by trawling and gillnets in artisanal fisheries and as bycatch during industrial shrimp fishing. Along with the common guitarfish, they used to be plentiful in the northern Mediterranean and around the Balearic Islands, but seem to no longer be present in these areas. Catches off the coast of Africa have declined also, but data on landings is in short supply. The International Union for Conservation of Nature is concerned about the future of this fish and has assessed its conservation status as being \\"critically endangered\\".

Among the first season staff, only Adam Simon, Brannon Braga and Joe Menosky remained on the show. In an interview with Gavin Hetherington of SpoilerTV, Simon said \\"there were some very talented writers that worked on season one but they also came from very different backgrounds. They had very strong opinions where they wanted things to go, which was great, except they were telling 13 different stories and I was trying to tell one story in 13 episodes.\\" There were inconsistencies with the writing between episodes due to the sometimes clashing writing style, and Simon further commented that \\"sometimes it seemed to me that characters I created suddenly sounded very different [in the episodes Adam didn't write], they weren't even speaking quite the same language from episode to episode which was tough on the actors and on the audience.\\" As a result of this, Elizabeth Sarnoff, Tricia Small and Jon Harmon Feldman did not return for season two. A new writing staff were brought in, and the three remaining writers from season one were joined by Kelly Souders, Brian Peterson, Turi Meyer, Al Septien‚Äîwho all had previously worked on Smallville together‚Äîand Donna Thorland.

The 19,400-seat stadium was designed by Populous and opened on April 13, 2019, during the club's third MLS season. It is located near Interstate 94 and Snelling Avenue, with transit connections provided by the Metro Green Line. On October 23, 2015, team owners announced that Minnesota United would build a stadium on the St. Paul bus barn site. The stadium seats approximately 19,400, was completed in early 2019, and was privately financed for $200 million. On November 25, 2015, Minnesota United FC hired Kansas City-based Populous to design the stadium. On December 9, 2015, the team hired Mortensen Construction as part of the stadium construction along with Populous. Mortensen built U.S. Bank Stadium for the Minnesota Vikings in 2014‚Äì2016, and worked with Populous on three other Twin Cities sports facilities: Target Field, TCF Bank Stadium, and Xcel Energy Center. Construction was completed in February 2019, and the stadium opened two months later on April 13, 2019, with Minnesota United FC hosting New York City FC. Location and transportation Allianz Field is located on the north side of Interstate 94 between Snelling Avenue and Pascal Street in the Midway neighborhood of Saint Paul, Minnesota, halfway between Downtown Minneapolis and Downtown Saint Paul. The stadium is located on several major transit routes, including the Snelling Avenue light rail station on the Metro Green Line and a set of stops served by the A Line bus rapid transit route. The venue has fewer than 1,000 spaces of on-site parking, instead relying on public transit and off-site lots with shuttle buses. Minnesota United has also organized several designated areas for vehicle for hire pickups and dropoffs, as well as 400 parking spaces for bicycles. The city government of Saint Paul projects that 38 percent of match attendees will use public transit, while 23 percent will use off-site parking lots with shuttles, and 11 percent will use private parking closer to the stadium. Design The stadium is a ring-shaped stadium, with seating for approximately 19,400 in the first phase and 24,474 in a future expansion that would fill the four corners. It has a safe standing terrace for 2,920 supporters, named the \\"Wonderwall\\" after the club's unofficial anthem, located behind the south-end goal. The single-tier Wonderwall terrace was designed with a 34.9 percent incline and has no seats. The north end has a brewpub, named Brew Hall, and a manual scoreboard and 90-minute clock that were designed to resemble fixtures at the former home, National Sports Center in Blaine. The stadium was designed by Populous with deliberate sightlines and an \\"intimate atmosphere\\" in mind. The pitch sits above the first row of seats and is composed of of turf from Heath Farms in Wisconsin, installed in October 2019 to replace the original Kentucky bluegrass from Colorado that suffered from drainage issues. A glass-like polymer mesh oval exterior provides the stadium with a sleek facade. It is clad in PTFE, which covers the steel structure that holds the roof in place. With an overhang partially covering the field, the facade is expected to soften the noise towards the neighborhood. Color-changing LEDs light the exterior mesh in the same manner as Allianz Arena in Munich, Germany and MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The first tests of the lighting system in December 2018, which ran overnight in the fog, drew complaints from neighboring residents due to the intensity of the colors. =Green space= The masterplan is pedestrian-oriented and designates of outdoor gathering spaces. The stadium will be ringed by three grassy plazas and a fourth green space will be placed along University Avenue, near Snelling Avenue Station. Pascal Green will be on the east of the stadium; United Champion Plaza will be on the southwest corner; Victory Plaza will be on the north; and Midway Square will be north of Victory Plaza, along Snelling Avenue. Midway Square and Victory Plaza will express the north-south axis of the stadium. These green spaces are planned to be progressively introduced in phases as property owner RK Midway waits for existing leases on its current tenants to end. However, the timeline of these phases has not been released to the city or the public, as of July 2016. The project drew criticism as the full realization of the masterplan could take many years. History=Site= Construction as of September 2017 A masterplan has been drawn up for the redevelopment of the broad area, including the stadium site and adjacent properties owned by RK Midway. This may include building new hotel and office space and the redevelopment of the existing shopping center. The buildings occupied by Rainbow supermarket, Walgreens, Midway Pro Bowl and some adjoining spaces will be torn down. The masterplan calls for the redevelopment to be more pedestrian friendly, to accommodate large numbers of fans walking to and from the transit stations. The southern half of the site was formerly a bus barn used by Metro Transit until it was demolished in 2002. Later a big- box store was pursued for the site but not built. The site was acquired decades earlier by the Metropolitan Council with help from the Federal Transit Administration so development of the site required federal government approval. The property had been the Snelling Shops, where streetcars were built and maintained for the Twin City Rapid Transit Company.Olson, Russel L. - The Electric Railways of Minnesota. Minnesota Transportation Museum, Hopkins/H. M. Smyth Co., St. Paul. (1976). The stadium itself primarily sits on this property. =Naming rights= On July 25, 2017, Allianz Life was announced as the sponsor for the stadium. Allianz Life, a subsidiary of German company Allianz, is headquartered in nearby Golden Valley. It is one of eight sports facilities around the world that is sponsored by Allianz or its subsidiaries. The naming rights agreement with Allianz runs until the end of 2028 and costs an undisclosed amount. On April 17, 2018, Minnesota United announced a 10-year partnership with Fargo, North Dakota-based Bell Bank that included naming Bell a gate sponsor in the southwest corner of Allianz Field. The partnership also involves the bank providing a $1,000 check to a player each match of the 2019 season to be donated to a charity of the player‚Äôs choice. In announcing the partnership, Bell donated $10,000 to goalkeeper Matt Lampson for his LampStrong Foundation charity, which supports cancer patients. Due to the stadium's resemblance to the floating city on Bespin in the fictional Star Wars universe, Allianz Field has gained the nickname \\"Cloud City.\\" =Construction= The stadium was planned to break ground in June 2016, but was delayed while the team awaited a tax-exemption from the state, similar to ones granted to other recent stadium projects. Despite the stadium construction being privately funded, the franchise owners stated that the tax- exemption was needed for the project's viability. In addition, because stadium construction would eliminate Rainbow Foods ‚Äì an anchor tenant in the Midway Shopping Center ‚Äì strip mall owner RK Midway of New York faced lease complications with its smaller tenants. Industry analysts say intense competition between the grocery company SuperValu (which operates Rainbow within the strip mall) and rivals, primarily Hy-Vee, makes it unlikely that Rainbow will agree to terminate its lease early without a signed guarantee against a competitor moving into the shopping center. A ceremonial groundbreaking was held on December 12, 2016, and was attended by MLS commissioner Don Garber. Major construction on the site began in June 2017. Steel erection began in November 2017 and construction reached a halfway milestone in late April 2018. Construction on the stadium was completed by Mortenson Construction on February 27, 2019, after 20 months of work. Major events The first home game at the stadium was held on April 13, 2019, against New York City FC, which was attended by a sellout crowd of 19,796. The match ended in a 3‚Äì3 draw, with the first goal scored by Osvaldo Alonso in the 13th minute. A winter storm arrived in the Twin Cities the day before the match, requiring grounds crews to scrape away snow and ice from the stadium's seats and parts of the pitch. The United States men's national soccer team's opening game of the 2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup was held at Allianz Field on June 18, 2019. =College football= The first college football game at Allianz Field was a rivalry game between St. Thomas and St. John's; it took place on October 19, 2019. St. John's won the game 38-20 in front of a crowd of 19,508. =MLS Cup Playoffs= Following the St. Thomas‚ÄìSt. John's college football game, field crews switched the field back to soccer to prepare for Minnesota United's first MLS Cup Playoffs match, played the following day against the LA Galaxy. Minnesota lost 2‚Äì1 and were subsequently knocked out of the playoffs.

Her work has been compared to that of Dodie Smith, and she is considered to be part of a group of 20th century British women writers including Ivy Compton-Burnett, Angela Thirkell, and E. M. Delafield whose work often examines the situation of middle-class women. Early life Born Diana Godfrey-Faussett-Osborne, Tutton was the youngest of four daughters, and grew up at Pipe Hill House, Lichfield. She and her sisters received a patchy education at the hands of a governess. Second World War Following a wartime marriage to Captain John Tutton, Diana drove a WRVS mobile canteen. She accompanied her husband to Kenya, where she enlisted in the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry. The couple had two daughters, born in 1942 and 1946, after which the family returned to England. British Malaya In 1948, Tutton and her family moved to British Malaya for three years, they returned again for a further two years in 1956. Literary career Tutton is known for three novels in which women feature as the main characters in families with unusual dynamics. Her best-known book, Guard Your Daughters (1953), is about the five mildly unconventional Harvey sisters, who are growing up in rural England shortly after World War II. With a father who writes detective novels and an emotionally fragile mother, the sisters live a somewhat isolated and over-controlled life and are not adept at navigating society outside the family. As the book opens, the oldest sister has recently married, while four of the sisters, all in their teens, still live at home. The book's narrator is middle sister Morgan, and the tone of her first-person account is warm, nostalgic, and lightly comic, with darker undertones surfacing towards the end as the family dysfunctionality more acutely bears on the girls' future lives. A narrative twist in the final pages upends the reader's expectations. Parallels in the cast of characters, first-person narration, and some plot elements have led Guard Your Daughters to be frequently compared to Dodie Smith‚Äôs I Capture the Castle, published five years earlier. Although hailed by John Betjeman as a fine first book whose excellence lay \\"beneath its flashing surface,\\" it has more recently been described as a \\"good children's book\\" version of Smith's novel. It has also been compared to Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, a book that is specifically referenced within the text of Guard Your Daughters. Although it has been much written about in recent years, it was long out of print, until Persephone Books reissued it in 2017. It was a Book of the Month selection of the Franco-British Selection Committee in 1953. Two of Tutton's books centre on taboo relationships. Mamma (1956) is about Joanna Malling, a middle-aged widow who falls in love with her new son-in-law, a man who is much nearer to her own age than to her daughter's. Despite attraction on both sides, the relationship is never consummated, and Tutton ends her book by having the daughter and son-in-law‚Äîwho had both been living with Joanna‚Äîmove away. Even more than with Guard Your Daughters, Tutton takes a story with tragic overtones and treats it on the surface as a social comedy. It was serialized in an abridged version on the BBC program \\"Woman's Hour\\" in 1956, read in ten installments by Jill Balcon. The Young Ones (1959) is about incest. It focuses on the siblings Ned and Julie, the latter of whom is initially thought to be adopted. Narrated by one of their sisters, it describes Ned and Julie's love affair, which continues even after they discover that Julie is not adopted but is Ned's biological sister. Ned and Julie marry nonetheless and attempt, with the narrator's help, to keep the marriage a secret from their relatives and friends. Ned and Julie's marriage ultimately fails. As in Tutton's other novels, there is a strong contrast between the matter-of-fact narrative style and the unusual subject matter.

According to judge and historian Giovanni Bonello, the Majmuna Stone is a \\"spectacular visual relic of the Islamic presence in Malta.\\" It is now exhibited in the Gozo Museum of Archaeology at the Cittadella of Victoria, Gozo. Description The marble stone was originally used in the Roman period as its backside indicates. A relief in the form of a rose was sculpted in the Roman architectural style. It was later reused as a tombstone. It is the only islamic funerary stone in Malta of its period to be still intact in its original size and the only one which gives a date. The Majmuna Stone is the tombstone of a girl called Majmuna, who died on 21 March 1174.page 37 It is a marble slab which has Roman decorations on the back (such reuse was a common occurrence in Islamic North Africa). The Kufic Arabic inscription approximately translates to: > In the name of Allah, the merciful and compassionate. May He be propitious > to the Prophet Muhammad and to his followers and grant them eternal > salvation. > God is great and eternal and He has decreed that his creatures should > perish. Of this the prophet of Allah bears witness. > This is the tomb of Maym≈´nah, daughter of HassƒÅn, son of ‚ÄòAli al-Hudali, > known as Ibn as-Susi. She died ‚Äì Allah's mercy be upon her ‚Äì on Thursday > 16th day of the month of Sha'ban in the year 569, professing that there is > only one God who has no equal. > Look around you! Is there anything everlasting on earth; anything that > repels or casts a spell on death? Death robbed me from a palace and, alas, > neither doors nor bolts could save me. All I did in my lifetime remains, and > shall be reckoned. > Oh he who looks upon this tomb! I am already consumed inside it, and dust > has settled on my eyes. On my couch in my abode there is nothing but tears, > and what is to happen at my resurrection when I shall appear before my > Creator? Oh my brother, be wise and repent. The inscription is dated 1174, almost a century after the Norman invasion of Malta in 1091. It is believed that Islam remained the dominant religion in Malta until the Arabs were expelled in 1224. Recent history Other visual Islamic funerary found at the Domvs Romana in Rabat, Malta The date and location of discovery of the Majmuna Stone are unknown. It is traditionally held that the stone was found in an area known as Ta' Majmuna, between the Gozitan villages of Xewkija and Sannat. However, it is also possible that the stone was not found in Malta at all, and it might originate from Tunisia, North Africa. In his 1772 book Malta illustrata ovvero descrizione di Malta isola del Mare Siciliano e Adriatico, Count Giovannantonio Ciantar wrote about the stone and illustrated it, but he was not able to decipher its writing. Ciantar wrote that the tombstone was located in the courtyard of a private residence. In 1799, during the Maltese uprising against French occupation, Paul I of Russia sent the diplomat Andrey Italinski to ensure the insurgents that they had Russian protection. Italinski examined the stone during his stay in Malta, and was the first person who managed to decipher part of its inscription. In an undated early 19th century scrapbook, Father Giuseppe Carmelo Gristi recorded that the stone was discovered \\"in Malta,\\" and was preserved at Baron Muscat's residence in Valletta. By 1839, the stone belonged to the Xara family, and it was eventually passed down to Baron Sir Giuseppe Maria de Piro. In 1845, de Piro donated it to the Public Library. The stone has been part of the collections of the Gozo Museum of Archaeology since 1960. It has been called \\"the pride and joy\\" of the museum.

It was developed mainly in the second half of the 19th century around industries powered by local water sources, and includes well-preserved architecture from that period. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. Description and history The present village of Whitingham was established in 1822, when a mineral spring with supposed healing properties was found in the area. Sadawga Brook, which feeds the Deerfield River via Harriman Reservoir, drops substantially after leaving Sadawga Lake, and provided a source of water power for industries. By 1840 the village included a gristmill, sawmill, and wood turning shop, along with a small cluster of homes. This economic growth led to the village's increasing importance, resulting in the movement of the town's civic center there from a nearby hill in the 1860s. The village began to decline economically in the early decades of the 20th century, and the sites of some of its mills were flooded by the construction of Harriman Dam in 1924, while others succumbed to fire. The historic village center is stretched along Vermont Route 100, roughly between Sadawga Lake Road and Brook Street, and extends north along School Street almost to Maple Drive. A few properties on Brook Street and Stimpson Hill Road that lie adjacent to these are also included. Most of the buildings in the district are residential wood frame structures, in vernacular interpretations of the Greek Revival and Gothic Revival. Other buildings of note are the Greek Revival Whitingham Community Church (1862), Green Mountain Hall (formerly the c. 1860 Universalist Church, also Greek Revival), and the c. 1870 Number Nine Schoolhouse.

He was a professor at City University of New York (1934-1969) and Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons (1955-1969). He was chairman of the Colorado Regional Cancer Center's Support Review Committee of the National Cancer Institute. Early life and education Born in Ny√≠rcs√°sz√°ri, Hungary, Ernest Borek moved with his family to New York City at the age of 14. He graduated from the City College of New York and obtained his PhD in biochemistry from Columbia University.  Scientific career  Borek was on the faculty of the Department of Chemistry of the City University of New York from 1934 to 1969 and was a professor in the Department of Biochemistry of Columbia University from 1959 to 1969. His activities in cancer research led to his appointment as chairman of the Department of Molecular Biology at AMC Cancer Research Center. He also served as director of the Colorado Regional Cancer Center and was chairman of the Cancer Center's Support Review Committee of the National Cancer Institute. In 1969, he accepted an appointment as professor in the department of Microbiology at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center.\\"Trends in Biochemical Sciences\\", October 1986, page 397 On March 22, 1964, The New York Times ran a page one article on a new unified theory of cancer development proposed by Borek and his Columbia University associate Dr. P. R. Srinivasan. The theory ties together all classes of known cancer-causing agents by a single, common mechanism of action through which normal cells are turned into malignant cells. Author Ernest Borek Borek was the author of four popular books for the non-scientist, Man, the Chemical Machine (1952), The Atoms Within Us (1961), The Code of Life (1965), and The Sculpture of Life (1973), which describes the history and development of biochemistry and molecular biology. The Atoms Within Us has been translated into all major languages and received the Thomas Alva Edison Foundation Award for the best science book for the public in 1961. In addition to over 125 scientific publications in refereed journals and many reviews, he contributed essays to newspapers and scientific journals describing the problems of original thinkers in science. Reviewing Borek's The Atoms Within Us, Isaac Asimov wrote in the New York Times Book Review, \\"The book is a careful and correct picture, within the limits it sets for itself, of the state of modern biochemistry and how it came to be what it is. If you know nothing about the subject in the first place, here is where you might start\\".New York Times Book Review, June 25, 1961, Page 4 Noting skepticism that greeted some of his ultimately successful scientific discoveries in cancer research, Borek wrote in an essay for the M.D. Anderson symposium in Houston: > It is not surprising as it may at first appear that scientists should be > reluctant to accept new ideas. A truly new idea is one of the most > unpalatable impositions a man can inflict on his fellow men. A new idea > assaults the vanity of the recipient. If it is a valid and worthy idea, why > did he not think of that? Obviously, therefore, every new idea must be > subjected to critical scrutiny\\". Awards and honors Borek was awarded the Medal of the Society of Biological Chemists of Finland in 1965. He also received the Townsend Harris Medal for distinguished alumni of the City University of New York in 1968, and was awarded an honorary M.D. degree from the University of Szeged, Hungary. The City College of New York offers the annual Ernest Borek Scholarship, funded by his sister Irene Marsh, to undergraduate and graduate students \\"who show promise in chemistry or biochemistry\\". Personal life Borek was married three times. His first wife was Minuetta Shumiatcher, with whom he had one son, Ronald Kessler, a journalist and New York Times bestselling non-fiction author. His second wife was Blanche Lavnosky, with whom he had a daughter, Deborah Borek, M.D., a pathologist. His third wife was Dr. Sylvia Kerr. He died in Denver on February 14, 1986 at the age of 74.

The two versions of the film had a worldwide theatrical release on 28 July 2017 and received positive reviews from critics as well as the audience. The film's sub-plot is based on Aarushi Talwar's 2008 Noida double murder case. Plot Ranjith Kalidoss (Arjun) is a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) in CB-CID, who along with his partners Inspector Joseph (Prasanna) and Inspector Vandana (Varalaxmi Sarathkumar), takes on high-profile cases and closes them successfully. Counter to his high intensity job, Ranjith has a peaceful family life with a wife Shilpa (Sruthi Hariharan), daughter Oviya (Baby Swaksha), younger brother Sandeep (Vaibhav), and their family dog Rocky. Ranjith's boss assigns his team a task to pursue a group of five criminals, who continue to avoid justice with their influence and power. Ranjith suggests a more direct approach to taking them out, but his boss declines to go along with it. Before they could pursue the current assignment, they get dragged into another mystery. A parcel arrives at the police station one day that contains a small horse doll hanging on a noose. The figure has four holes but otherwise no other clues. Not thinking much of it, the team decides to ignore it. A few days later, a local communist leader goes missing. He is later found in warehouse hanging from the ceiling, tortured, shot, and his face covered in an animal mask, very much like the doll they received. The killer continues to taunt the team, sending them clues as he kills more people, which includes a lawyer and a doctor. Ranjith follows one of the clues and finds the killer, but before he could take him down, the tremors that he has been experiencing lately slow him down. The killer knocks out Ranjith and gets away. When his team arrives, they inform him about a dead body in one of the buildings, but he already knows and describes what he would find without seeing it. Back at the office, Ranjith manages to piece things together and connects the serial killings to a case that he investigated few years earlier. Emmanuel (Suman) and his wife (Suhasini) are a rich couple in town who lived with their 16-year-old daughter Catherine (Chandana Raj) and a caretaker Mariadas (Chetan). The couple were very successful business people but had very little time for their daughter. Mariadas took care of Catherine. One day, the couple came home to find Catherine murdered and Mariadas missing. The house had been ransacked. The police closes the case concluding that it was a burglary gone bad, and Mariadas is on the run. A local communist leader pushes to reopen the case, which lands with Ranjith. He quickly focuses the attention on Emmanuel. He sees a new golf club in his bag, and his investigation leads to the missing golf club with the caretaker's blood on it. He interrogates Emmanuel and his wife with the evidence, and they confess the truth. They came home one day to find Mariadas having sexual intercourse with Catherine. Catherine only reached puberty a few days earlier and their parents were busy preparing for the puberty ceremony. Emmanuel, in anger, hits Mariadas with the club and kills him. When Catherine threatens to call the police, her mother tries to stop her. In the scuffle, she accidentally falls on a sharp object and dies. Not able to wiggle their way out (as Ranjith and the lawyer refuse to take bribes and hush up the truth) and driven by guilt, Emmanuel and his wife hang themselves. The doctor is involved in the autopsy of Catherine, and the lawyer (prosecutor) is set to argue the case at the court and is present with Ranjith during the interrogation and confession. While all this is happening, Ranjith finds a doll hanging outside his house. When coming back, his dog Rocky was shot in the head. Infuriated by this, he decides to avenge Rocky's death. Ranjith concludes the three people that are killed were all involved in the case, and he himself is the last target. The killer is someone seeking revenge for the deaths of the couple and is probably connected to the family. His boss takes over the case and tells Ranjith to get medical help for his condition (Parkinson's disease). His team continues the investigation, looking for a connection between Ranjith's case and the murders. There were no other family members that could be the murderer. Emmanuel has a nephew named Christopher (Krishna in Tamil and Karthik Jayaram in Kannada), but he lives in the US. They are looking for someone with pharmaceutical knowledge, as the killer manufactured his own brand of anesthesia to knock out his victims. Ranjith gets admitted to the hospital, where as he continues to try and crack the clues, he concludes that it must be Christopher, as he has the motive, means and the know how. After checking with immigration services, they find that Christopher did arrive in India not too long ago. A police officer is dispatched to Christopher's house to investigate, and he finds all the evidence supporting their theory, but before he could alert his team, he is killed. Christopher baits Ranjith's team and captures Joseph and Vandana. Having no choice, Ranjith leaves the hospital to meet Christopher at a warehouse. There, he finds Joseph and Vandana standing on the floor with nooses around their necks. After a long struggle, Ranjith manages to overpower Christopher and hangs him. The press arrives at the site, and Ranjith tells them that Christopher is another victim of the serial killer. A few days later, Joseph and Vandana meet Ranjith at his house and ask him why he did not inform the press that Christopher was the serial killer. Ranjith then reveals his plan about their earlier assignment. He plans to kill the five criminals and blame it on the serial killer and also frame the last of them as the serial killer himself. During the closing end credits, it is shown that his plan worked.

The team has been described as the greatest in Colby history as well as one of the strongest college teams ever in the state of Maine. Colby defeated its three in-state rivals Bowdoin College, the University of Maine, and Bates College by a combined score 123 to 0 to win the series title and gained national recognition for its game against the star‚Äìstudded Navy Midshipmen. The team was led by first year head coach Myron E. Fuller and captained by senior Paul \\"Ginger\\" Fraser. Schedule and results Colby's 1914 schedule was announced on March 31, 1914, by manager Raymond P. Luce. =Non-conference schedule= Colby started out the season with a 17 to 0 victory against Holy Cross. Captain Ginger Fraser scored both touchdowns, kicked both point after conversions, and suffered a broken shoulder in the game. The following week, Colby defeated New Hampshire State College (now known as the University of New Hampshire) 66 to 0 without Fraser. Colby lost its first game of the season to Tufts. Tufts won the game 40 to 14 in part by confusing Colby with its passing offense, which was uncommon at that time. However, Colby rebounded the following week with a 6 to 0 victory in a muddy game against the Massachusetts Agricultural College (now known as the University of Massachusetts Amherst). =State series= Colby started out its Maine Intercollegiate Athletic Association schedule by defeating a weak Bowdoin team 48 to 0. The following week Colby faced the University of Maine, which had won the conference title the past three seasons. As Maine had defeated both Bowdoin and Bates already, the winner of this game would win the state championship. Colby scored its first touchdown on a twenty-five yard pass from Ginger Fraser to Edward Cawley. Defensively, Colby's strong line, led by Walter Dacey, was able to stop the Maine offense throughout the game. Dalcey helped set up Colby's second touchdown by recovering a fumble on Colby's 17 yard line. Colby also benefited from poor play by Maine's quarterback, George H. Bernheisel, who was benched in the second half, as well as in injury to the team's fullback. On November 2, the Lewiston Evening Journal ran the headline \\"Colby's Football Team Was Plainly Superior: Waterville Eleven Showed Itself Saturday to Be No One-Man Aggregation\\" (referring to claims that the team only had one star player, Ginger Fraser). The article described Colby's play as \\"brilliantly fierce\\" and \\"the most brilliant exposition of football...ever seen in this city\\". It also lauded Colby as coming \\"near possessing one of the best football teams in the history of Maine intercollegiate sport, balanced and strong, versed in every department of the game, cunning in every move.\\" Colby finished out its in- state series against Bates. Fraser scored Colby's first two touchdowns before exiting, which allowed Jack \\"Smacker\\" Lowney to have one of the best games of his career, as he scored four touchdowns to lead the team to a 61 to 0 victory. =Navy game= Colby's final game of the season was against the Navy Midshipmen. Only thirteen of Colby's players made the trip to Annapolis. Lowney scored three minutes into the game to take a 7 to 0 lead. Navy responded with a field goal. In the second quarter, Fraser and Downey scored rushing touchdowns (Downey's was a 75-yard run) and Navy put up a touchdown of their own to give Colby a 21 to 10 lead going into the half. However, Navy was able to put up three unanswered touchdowns to defeat Colby, 31 to 21. Navy was able to make substitutions while Colby was forced to play its team manager and assistant manager due to injuries.

Considered one of the first supporters of liberalism in Mexico, he fought for the separation of church and state. Mora has been deemed \\"the most significant liberal spokesman for his generation [and] his thought epitomizes the structure and the predominant orientation of Mexican liberalism.\\"Charles A. Hale, Mexican Liberalism in the Age of Mora, 1821‚Äì1853. New Haven: Yale University Press 1968, p. 8.  Early life  Born in 1794 during Spanish colonial rule of Mexico, Mora came from a prosperous American- born Spanish (criollo) family from the Guanajuato. His family lost its wealth during the 1810 revolt of Father Miguel Hidalgo, but Mora gained access to the prestigious ex-Jesuit academy of Colegio de San Ildefonso in Mexico City, where he studied theology. In 1820 he received his doctorate and ordination to the priesthood. He was a faculty member at the colegio and also served as librarian. He became a deacon in the archbishopric of Mexico, the seat of ecclesiastical power, but did not rise in the hierarchy. Blocked from advance within the Catholic Church, he turned in 1821 to secular political matters, becoming a journalist and following Mexican independence in September 1821, a liberal politician shaping the newly sovereign state.Racine, \\"Mora\\", pp. 944-45 In 1823 Mora advocated for the curricular reform of San Ildefonso to emphasize more modern approaches to learning in Spanish, rather than rote memorization and emphasis on Latin.Stanley C.

Career  After the proclamation of the republic in Mexico in 1824, he was one of the drafters of the Constitution of the State of Mexico and was a member of the state congress. He criticized the Mexican Constitution of 1824 as incoherent and because it protected Roman Catholicism as the sole religion rather than allowing for religious freedom. He opposed the expulsion of Spaniards in Mexico, and used the newspaper he edited, El Observador, funded by the wealthy Fagoaga family to support the post-independence presence of Spaniards in Mexico.Green, The Mexican Republic, p. 145. As a journalist, he advocated for the Scottish Rite Masons.Jaime Rodr√≠guez O., \\"Jos√© Luis Maria Mora\\" in Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, Barbara A. Tenenbaum, editor. New York: Charles Scribners and Sons, 1996, vol. 4, p. 111. He was an opponent of the populist former insurgent leader Vicente Guerrero, who came to power in 1829, and therefore supported the coup of Anastasio Bustamante to oust Guerrero from the presidency. However, when Bustamante became a military dictator, Mora opposed him too. Mora's principal writings date from the 1820s. Mora's main sources of inspiration were initially John Locke and Benjamin Constant and later Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos. In Benjamin Constant, Mora saw a thinker who in post-revolutionary France sought to guarantee the rights of the individual against the strength of popular sovereignty, which he opposed because it led to the bloody excesses of the French Revolution, favoring instead a Constitutionalist system. Within such a system the most important individual freedoms were protected from both the government and the whims of the masses. Mora initially saw giving political power to Mexican property-holders as a safe guard to personal liberty, but then realized that their vested interests allied them with the Church and the largely conservative Mexican army. Those interest groups were opposed to reform, so that Mora increasingly saw the use force against them as necessary. The centralizing policies of the Spanish state during the eighteenth-century Bourbon monarchy led Mora to take inspiration from Jovellanos. Historian Charles A. Hale contends that Mora's drive to use the strong state to effect reform undermined basic tenets of liberal thought such as individual rights and laissez-faire.Charles A. Hale, Mexican Liberalism in the Age of Mora, 1821‚Äì1853. New Haven: Yale University Press 1968. Owing to ongoing political unrest Mora became disillusioned with constitutionalism and therefore increasingly focused his sights on breaking the privileged position of the Roman Church and the army. Both for fiscal and ideological reasons, he was in favor of expropriating the property of the Roman Catholic Church, which controlled but did not utilize the land it owned. Mora wanted to continue reducing the privileged position of the Church in the constitution, and he sought religious freedom and secular education as well. When legislation to limit the power of the Church was defeated in 1831, the governor of Zacatecas state held an essay contest with a prize of 2,000 pesos, with contestants to write on the topic of government's right to expropriate church property, a contest Mora won.Green, The Mexican Republic, p. 215. Mora supported vice president Valent√≠n G√≥mez Far√≠as, who was Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna's running mate. Since Santa Anna had no interest in actually serving as president, G√≥mez Far√≠as was effectively in power and initiated a reform program. G√≥mez Far√≠as appointed Mora to reform education, and Mora opened the first secular school in Mexico City. However, Conservatives and the military, led by Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna, opposed the G√≥mez Far√≠as reform program and forced the vice president to resign in early 1834. Cemetery of Montmartre As a result, Mora went in self-exile to live in Paris, but he continued to comment on the political events in his homeland. In 1844 President Jos√© Joaqu√≠n de Herrera appointed him ambassador to the United Kingdom. In 1846, after returning to power, President G√≥mez Far√≠as asked Mora to return to Mexico, but Mora was prevented by the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. The war shocked Mora, who admired the American political system. Even in 1848, after the war, he was not able to return to Mexico due to health issues, especially tuberculosis. He died on the French national holiday (July 14), 1850. In exile, Mora began writing what was envisioned to be a four-volume history of Mexico. In it, he articulated particular views on Mexico's past with relevance to the current political situation. He was an opponent of all forms of demagoguery but saw the 1810 uprising of Father Miguel Hidalgo that sparked the Mexican War of Independence as a necessary evil.

Legacy  Compared to Mora's contemporary, Lucas Alam√°n, the chief conservative spokesman and prolific writer, Mora produced a slim output of works. He ceased writing in 1837, with the publication of his history of Mexico.Hale, Mexican Liberalism, p. 7. But Mora's ideas would later be followed by a generation of liberal politicians who, during the Liberal Reform following the ouster of conservative Santa Anna, changed the face of Mexico dramatically.

NOIRs may be issued for immigrant visa petitions (such as Form I-130 and Form I-140) and for non-immigrant visa petitions (such as Form I-129 and Form I-129F).  Response protocol  The NOIR is sent to, and the response must be sent by, the petitioner (or an attorney representing the petitioner, if the petitioner is using an attorney) rather than the beneficiary. A copy may be sent to the beneficiary for information. If the petitioner responds within the specified time, then the petitioner's response is considered when making a final decision on whether to revoke the petition. Otherwise, the petition is revoked once the specified time is over. An extension may be granted at the discretion of USCIS if the petitioner needs additional time to obtain documentation from abroad or for other meritorious reasons; however, the petitioner must respond in a timely manner to the NOIR by the stated deadline, and provide a reason for requesting the extra time.  Steps = The petition is returned for revocation/revalidation (usually by a consular officer) = The NOIR is generally issued when new evidence is presented to the USCIS suggesting that the petition was approved in error (i.e., it should not have been approved) or there has been a change in circumstances making the petition no longer approvable. The most common impetus for issuing a NOIR is that a consular officer (an employee of the United States Department of State) evaluating the beneficiary's visa application based on an approved petition comes across evidence suggesting that the petition should not have been approved, or is no longer approvable. The consular officer issues a Section 221(g) quasi-refusal to the visa applicant, and returns the petition to USCIS for revocation/revalidation, along with the reasons the consular officer believes the petition should not have been approved or is no longer approvable. Petitions relating to non-immigrant visas (such as Form I-129 and Form I-129F) are returned to the Kentucky Service Center whereas petitions related to immigrant visas (such as Form I-130 and Form I-140) are returned to the National Visa Center. = The USCIS forwards the petition to the original Service Center and updates the case status = The returned petition is sent to the Service Center where the original petition was processed and a USCIS officer is assigned with the task of re-adjudicating the petition in light of the reasons for returning it. Information about the petition is updated in the USCIS system so that it is reflected in the Case Status Online as well as available to the National Customer Service Center. The petitioner is also notified of the petition being returned. = After an initial re-adjudication, the USCIS revalidates the petition, issues a NOIR, or issues a Notice of Automatic Revocation = After re-adjudicating the petition, the USCIS may either refuse to take any revocation action, issue a NOIR, or issue a Notice of Automatic Revocation. If the USCIS revalidates the petition (either directly, or after receiving additional information from the petitioner in response to the NOID), then the same visa application can be resumed with the new information. = After receiving the petitioner's response to the NOIR, the USCIS officer makes an adjudication decision = After receiving the response from the petitioner, the USCIS officer decides whether to revalidate the petition or revoke it. If the USCIS revokes the petition, the corresponding visa application is definitively denied. If the USCIS revalidates the petition, the information is sent back to the consular officer who should then continue processing the original visa application.  Processing timeline and uncertainty  In 2007, Prakash Khatri, the USCIS ombudsman, sought comments from petitioners and beneficiaries on how to improve the system surrounding consular returns of petitions. The chief complaint by petitioners and beneficiaries was the lack of transparency about what was going on between the time the consular officer returned the petition to the USCIS and the USCIS issuing a NOIR, and this uncertainty often led to the filing of multiple duplicate petitions, thereby increasing costs for petitioners and creating an unnecessary caseload for the USCIS. The following recommendations were made: * Issue receipt notices to customers when the petition file is returned and received by USCIS Service Centers: The USCIS agreed to this recommendation, and also promised to update the Case Status Online and the National Customer Service Center to reflect the information. * Establish a nationwide standard for the re-adjudication of petitions returned by consular offices for revocation or revalidation and amends the Operating Instructions/Adjudicator's Field Manual accordingly; include a \\"REVOCATION\\" entry in the processing time reports: The USCIS declined to do this, stating that processing times for returned petitions varied widely because of the possibility of a lengthy fraud investigation. * Provide additional information about revocation or revalidation processes on the USCIS website: USCIS agreed to do so but did not immediately make changes to the website.  Relationship with RFE and NOID  There are two other kinds of communication that the USCIS uses for petitions: the Request For Evidence (RFE) and the Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID). The RFE and NOID differ from the NOIR in one important respect: the RFE and NOID are used for petitions still being adjudicated (i.e., ones that have not yet been approved) whereas the NOIR is used for petitions that have been approved. In particular, even after the NOIR is issued, the corresponding petition is still considered approved right until the point when it is revoked. Another difference between NOIRs and the other two is that there are no standard processing timelines for how much time it should take between receiving a returned petition and issuing a NOIR, but there are guidelines on standard processing times for the \\"initial review\\" that should end in approval, denial, RFE, or NOID.

There is a colloquial expression - ‚Äúdie Leute von Westerberg‚Äù (people from Westerberg) ‚Äì which is taken a synonym for the ‚Äúparticularly influential members of the social elite‚Äù. Local politics frequently see accusations of preferential treatment for Westerberg being made. Westerberg residents respond by asserting that the city administration ‚Äì according to statistics ‚Äì invests much more money in the other districts. The monument at Stra√üburger Platz honours the soldiers from Osnabr√ºck who fell during the Franco-German War of 1870-71. It was first erected in Neumarkt in 1880; in 1928 it was relocated to Westerberg.

It was built from 1902 to 1920s. It is also known as the Telecasters North Queensland Ltd Building. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The former Queen's Hotel, a large, two-storeyed masonry building, was erected in several stages between 1902 and the mid-1920s. It was considered the finest hotel in North Queensland. The first Queen's Hotel, circa 1900 Townsville's first Queen's Hotel, a two-storeyed timber structure, was erected at the corner of Wickham Street and The Strand in 1872, and was extended along Wickham Street in the 1880s. It early acquired a reputation as one of the best kept hotels in Queensland, patronised by visiting dignitaries. In 1899 the property and license were purchased by John Henry Tyack. He raised a mortgage on the property, and called for competitive designs to replace the timber building with a substantial brick structure. The winning entry was submitted by architects Eaton, Bates & Polin, who had opened an office in Townsville c.1901. Eaton & Bates had trained in Sydney, but by the turn of the century their principal offices were in Brisbane, with branch offices in Rockhampton, Townsville and Toowoomba. Arthur Polin was managing partner of the Townsville office. Queen's Hotel, ca. 1932 The original design was more modest in size than the final structure, extending along the Strand only as far as the eastern tower, and around the corner of Wickham Street for eight bays. It was erected in stages, with trade continuing from the original hotel on the corner of Wickham Street and the Strand until 1925. In 1901, Tyack purchased an adjoining block (site of the former North Australian Hotel) along the Strand, which permitted construction of the first section of the new Queen's Hotel, comprising the eastern tower and four bays to its west, c.1902. This section was extant by March 1903. In May 1904, Tyack replaced the first mortgage with one for , which probably financed construction of the second section, completed by 1905. This involved demolition of part of the timber building along the Strand, and the extension of the brick building a further six bays toward the corner of Wickham Street. The contractor was a Mr Boyle, and work was underway in January 1904. For the next twenty years, Queen's Hotel consisted of a brick wing along the Strand, and a corner timber section which continued back along Wickham Street. Publican John Tyack continued the tradition of fine service and hospitality at the Queen's. He was active also in civic affairs, and, as Mayor of Townsville in 1912, encouraged council improvements along the Strand and foreshore in front of the Queen's Hotel. This included the 1913 construction of a cast-iron bandstand, with balustrading to match that on the hotel. Tyack died in 1913, prior to construction of the final stages of his grand hotel. Following Tyack's death, the hotel was placed in the hands of Queensland Trustees Ltd, who transferred the various properties to Queen's Hotel Townsville Ltd in 1924-25. At the same time, Queen's Hotel Townsville Ltd acquired three adjoining allotments along the Strand, which permitted the construction of a further 10 bays of the hotel toward the east. The remaining timber section of the hotel was demolished, and the western tower and Wickham Street wing were completed. The 1920s additions and alterations, costing approximately , were designed by respected Townsville architect Walter Hunt, and constructed by established Townsville contractor WH Turner. Work was underway by the end of 1924, and the eastern extension, comprising 48 rooms, was completed in mid-1925. The timber building was demolished in late 1925, in preparation for the next stage of the new building. The section at the corner of the Strand and Wickham Street was erected in 1925-26, and occupied in August 1926. This ground floor of this section comprised the main entrance hall, extensions to dining room and lounge, offices, and bars; bedrooms and balconies occupied the first floor. A detached block at the rear, comprising kitchen and scullery on the ground floor and bathrooms and toilets on the first, was erected at the same time. The final stage along Wickham Street was erected in 1926-28. Work was commenced in mid-1926, but a 1927 strike in the building industry delayed its completion. Included in this wing were parlours, a commercial room, nursery, servants' dining room, two shops and some bedrooms on the ground floor, and bedrooms on the first floor. Through the 1920s and 1930s, when the license was held by Bridget Mary Guinane, Queen's Hotel retained its reputation as North Queensland's premier hotel. During the Second World War, when Townsville was the principal Australian base from which the Pacific war was fought, the Queen's Hotel was occupied as an American army officers' mess. After the war, the hotel fell into gradual decline. In 1966, Far Northern Theatres Ltd acquired the property, and demolished several bays at the end of each wing. The building was sold to Townsville firm Samuel Allen & Sons Ltd in 1973, and in 1977 was acquired by Telecasters North Queensland Ltd, who restored the exterior and converted the interior into television and radio studios and offices. In August 2015, a $250M redevelopment of the area to be called the King Street Precinct was proposed, which would include residential, cultural and commercial elements, but with no specific plan for the re-use of the former Queen's Hotel. As at January 2016, the former Queen's Hotel is available for lease as office space.  Description  Queen's Hotel, located on the southern side of The Strand and returning into Wickham Street, is a two-storeyed structure containing television studios and offices built of English Bond brickwork with rendered detailing. The brickwork has been sandblasted to remove a coat of paint, and the building has a hipped ribbed metal roof, similar in form to the original roof. The Strand elevation shows Art Nouveau and Indian/Colonial influences in its design, including turrets crowned by cupolas framing low tower forms along the northern frontage, decorative render panels, wide eaves and arcaded loggias to the ground floor with verandahs above. The two large and two small tower forms differ slightly in their design and proportions, with the two larger having a broad, recessed arched entry with a recessed loggia above and surmounted by a steep pitch ribbed metal roof. The smaller forms are surmounted by a rounded pediment. Sections of the ground floor arcaded loggias are enclosed with timber framed glazing, and the open sections have cast iron balustrade and French doors with fanlights. The verandah, off which French doors with fanlights also open, has paired timber posts with cast iron balustrade and valance. Metal stanchions have been added to the face of the brickwork for the purpose of tying the roof down, and sections of floor have been replaced with concrete. Four bays of the eastern end of the building have been demolished and the verandah now returns along this face to the rear. The Wickham Street elevation has a rendered corner parapet and a timber verandah with paired posts, timber brackets to the ground floor and cast iron balustrade and valance to the first floor. The southern end of the building has been demolished, and the facade altered, with window and door openings having been enclosed or moved. The rear of the building has been substantially altered, with only one of the original masonry two-storeyed toilet blocks remaining, and a large television studio and communication equipment have been added. Sections of the rear verandah remain as internal corridor, off which French doors with fanlights open. The rear of the site contains car parking. Internally, the building has been substantially altered. The entrance hall contains a carved cedar staircase with a twin return, two figurine lamps on the bottom balusters and leadlight sash windows at the landing. This space has a raised ceiling with plaster mouldings including a deep cornice with recessed lighting, laurel relief, ornamental ventilation panels and a centre glazed skylight, which no longer admits natural light. There are sections of original joinery throughout the building, including doors with etched glass panels into the former dining room, internal doors, architraves and skirtings. The building has false ceilings and air conditioning throughout. There are sections of marble tiled floor in the foyer and former Palm Lounge, now the Telecine room, but they do not match early photographs of these areas. The first floor is mostly office space, with the former bedrooms being enlarged by the removal of partition walls.  Heritage listing  Queen's Hotel was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Queen's Hotel, erected in several stages between 1902 and the mid-1920s, was once the premier hotel of North Queensland, and survives as important evidence of the evolution of Townsville as the principal city of North Queensland by the early 20th century. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Sufficient of the fabric remains to understand the building as a large, ostentatious, two- storeyed masonry hotel, and to illustrate the work of Queensland architects Eaton, Bates and Polin. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The place has a strong association with the Townsville community as a local landmark, and is significant aesthetically for the composition and massing of the building's architectural elements, the quality of the building's surviving interior elements, and its contribution to The Strand streetscape and Townsville townscape. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.

Early history The First Presbyterian Church was dated to an August 1832 prayer meeting and Sunday- school held by Philo Carpenter in an unfinished building, which was owned by Mark Beaubien at Fort Dearborn. Although there were changes in location, the services continued during the winter of 1832-33. Eventually, they were held at a cabin owned by \\"Father\\" Walker's. At this location, Rev. Jeremiah Porter founded a school and organized the church. Porter held the first religious services in the history of the church in the carpenter shop of Fort Dearborn, on May 19, 1833. On June 26th, the church was organized by adopting the Covenant and Articles of Faith in the Presbytery of Detroit. The first public school in Chicago was organized in the meeting house of the First Presbyterian Church, and Eliza Chappel was the first teacher in this school. The membership of the church increased within a few months from 26 to 47, and to accommodate both soldiers and citizens, preaching services were held for a time both in the fort and at Father Walker's cabin on Wolf Point. June 11th, a committee was appointed to solicit subscriptions for the construction of a meeting house, Porter suggesting that any money subscribed toward his support might be applied to the building fund. In the meantime, the American Home Mission Society made provisions for Porter. The erection of the first house of worship was quite an event in the settlement, \\"Nearly all the inhabitants aided in the construction of this building, and the undertaking was so stupendous that every shoulder was needed at the wheel.\\" The meetinghouse, built by Joseph Meeker, stood out in the open field, without any fence around it, on what was later the alley of the lot at the southwest corner of Lake and Clark Streets, on the south of lot 1 in block 34 in the Original Town of Chicago. The Chicago Daily Democrat (1834) noted: \\"The First Presbyterian Church has purchased lot 1 in block 34. The books of the Title Guarantee and Trust Co. do not, however, show any record of such a purchase. We can only infer that for the two years or more the Society was in possession of this lot it must have been by permission of the Trustees of the Illinois and Michigan Canal, who held title to the land.\\" The lot was purchased at the canal sale, June, 1836, more than two years after the meeting house was built, by James Curtiss, secretary of the Illinois Hotel Company. The hotel scheme collapsed in the panic of 1835-37, and thus the church was providentially permitted to continue in possession another year, until a new location was procured farther south on Clark Street, below Washington Street. The new building was a plain, frame structure, about , with plastered walls and bare puncheon floors. The cost was $600. The seating arrangements consisted of benches made of ordinary pine boards, which would accommodate about 200, including settlers and the troops from the garrison. In the spring months, when the water in the ditch in front of the church made it almost inaccessible, the benches taken from the church were the ordinary means for bridging the slough. Such was \\"Chicago's first built Protestant meeting house, commonly called 'the Lord's House,'and a useful building it was to the first settlers.\\" It was dedicated January 4, 1834; Porter was assisted in the dedicatory services by Rev. A. B. Freeman, pastor of the First Baptist Church, who offered the consecration prayer. From 1833 to 1835 the membership increased to about 100, and, as the church was then self-supporting, Porter felt justified in accepting a call, in the autumn of 1835, to the Main Street Presbyterian Church, of Peoria. During the two years which elapsed before a successor to Porter was secured, the pulpit was supplied partly by Rev. Isaac T. Hinton1, pastor of the First Baptist Church, Rev. William McLean and Rev. J. J. Miter. All thoughts as to the erection of a costly house of worship, \\"to be built of marble,\\" were dispelled by the financial depression of 1837. For a few years, the parishioners had to content themselves with their simple frame meeting house, although some desired changes were effected in its condition and location. The former situation had become undesirable, as the adjacent property was in demand for business purposes, and the people were going to the southern part of the city for their homes, \\"away out on the prairies below Van Buren Street.\\" The building was moved in 1837-38 from its original position on Clark Street, near Lake Street, to the corner of Clark Street and the alley now known as Calhoun Place, south of Washington Street and facing Clark Street, being the south fifty feet of lot 1, in block 56, Original Town of Chicago. During the seven years following and prior to the purchase of the land by the Society, the owners did not demand any rental, as they \\"regarded the presence of the church a blessing to the whole community.\\" After two years of unceasing labor, Dr. Blatchford's health gave way and he was obliged to terminate his work in Chicago. He was dismissed from the pastorate August 18, 1839, at his own request. The nine years' ministry of Rev. Flavel Bascom, D.D., covered a period of remarkable growth in the membership and affairs of the church. The old frame meeting house was again enlarged by increasing its width, and, as the Society was now in a condition to have a home of its own, plans were under consideration for a permanent building. May 7, 1844, the church purchased from Samuel and F. A. Russell, all of lot 1 in block 56, Original Town of Chicago, on the south end of which the \\"Wooden Church \\" was then standing. Though the trustees acquired a frontage of eighty feet on Washington Street and one hundred and eighty feet on Clark Street, the space was not sufficient to give proper light and ventilation for the building contemplated. An agreement was thereupon entered into with Robert Freeman, whereby title was acquired to the east twenty-seven feet of lot 2 in block 56, immediately west of and adjoining lot 1. The deed from Freeman to the church trustees was recorded December 19, 1849. This made a total frontage of one hundred and seven feet on Washington Street. The foundations of the \\"Brick Church\\" were laid in 1847, and in September, 1849, the building was dedicated.' In the meantime the finances of the Society were in such a condition that it became necessary for the trustees to sell a portion of the lot, according to an advertisement which appeared in the Daily Tribune of July 20, 1848. The Brick Church building First Presbyterian Church, Chicago, 1857, (\\"The Brick Church\\") Seven years later, it became necessary for the church to move still farther south, and on October 19, 1855, the trustees entered into a contract for the sale of the remaining portion of this ground, covering the frontage on Washington Street and the on Clark Street, with the brick edifice, to Hugh Maher at a price of $65,000. Philip F. W. Peck purchased this contract from Maher, and received a deed, dated November 22, 1855, signed by the trustees. He wished to get all the title the church had, and that he might be sure he was dealing with the people calling themselves the First Presbyterian Church, he named the Society in the body of the deed in four distinct ways: *The First Presbyterian Church and Society of Chicago, otherwise known as *The Presbyterian Church and Society of Chicago, otherwise known as *The Presbyterian Church of Chicago, otherwise known as *The First Presbyterian Church in the City of Chicago. This property then became the site of the Chicago Opera House building. After the Society moved to Wabash Avenue in 1857 the \\"Brick Church\\" was used for various purposes. In 1858, it was occupied by the Mechanics' Institute. About the beginning of the war, it was converted into a music hall, known as Smith & Nixon Hall, and was a popular place for concerts and lectures. The \\"Brick Church\\" had been dedicated in September, 1849, and soon after, Bascom severed his connection with the church. In consequence of dissension on the slavery question, twenty- six members withdrew in 1842 to form the Second Presbyterian Church. Wabash Avenue church building During the ministry of Dr. Humphrey the towers of the church building on Wabash Avenue were completed. March 27,1864, a new brick and stone building for the use of the Railroad Mission, erected at a cost of about $18,000, was appropriately dedicated. The building stood on the east side of Griswold Street, on the premises now known as 48 and 5O Pacific Avenue. A new chapel was built at 45 and 47 Congress Street, and was dedicated June 2, 1867. In 1868, the church supported five mission schools‚Äîthe Railroad, Foster, Sands, Indiana Street and Archer Avenue Missions ‚Äî all of which, except the Railroad Mission, have since been transferred to the care of other churches. The records of the Session contain this note regarding the destruction of the church on Wabash Avenue in the great fire of October, 1871: \\"On Sunday, October 8, a collection was taken in the church for the benefit of the sufferers from a severe conflagration which had visited the West Side on Saturday night. It was Communion Sunday; none realized that it was the last one in the old church, around which so many precious memories clustered. That night a fire broke out in the West Division, crossed to the South Side, and then to the North, destroying a large portion of the city. Early on Monday morning, our beautiful church home, as well as its beautiful chapel and the Railroad Mission chapel, was destroyed. Nothing was saved but the records of the church, the Communion service and the Sexton library.\\" Indiana Avenue and 21st Street Indiana Avenue and 21st Street (interior) Indiana Avenue and 21st Street (1887) Indiana Avenue and 21st Street (1913)  Kimbark and 64th Street Building  In 1927 the congregation began to build the current structure, its sixth building, which was designed by the Chicago architectural firm of Thomas Tallmadge and Vernon Watson. The cross-shaped American Gothic sanctuary was dedicated on October 14, 1928. = The Windows = The stained glass windows were designed by two different studios, R. Toland Wright of Cleveland, and Willett Studies of Philadelphia. All are memorials and were installed in stages as funds were raised. The windows of the nave, the seating section of the sanctuary, were designed by R. Toland Wright Studios to portray the life of Jesus. Each window contains two scenes from the Gospels. Below each of the scenes, an angel holds a scroll with a Biblical passage written on it. Above each scene, there is a symbol representing that passage. = The Clerestory Windows = At the very top of the sanctuary walls, the clerestory windows can be seen. = The Great East Window = This window, which has forty different sections, was designed by Willett Studios. Its purpose is to honor the women of the Bible. Throughout the panels, one can see women represented as teachers, nurses, scholars, artists, and musicians. At the top of the window are two figures of Christs, one to represent his Divine nature, the other his human. Directly below Jesus is Mary holding him when he was a baby. = South Transept Windows and Pastor's Study = In October 1968 the upper south transept windows which looked out from the Minister's Study and those in the study were destroyed by a fire. Chancel and Reredos Another project by Willet Studios is the reredos which towers forty feet behind the altar. The three windows at the top: the center is the ‚ÄúLord enthroned in glory,‚Äù the left, in a blue robe with a starry nimbus, is Mary, and on the right in red garments is John. Below are three murals, painted by Jean J. Myall, depicting St. Gabriel, St. Michael, and St. Raphael. North Transept Windows These memorial windows were designed and installed by Willett Studios. Upper Transept windows echo the nave windows with scenes from the life of Jesus Christ. The lower transept windows feature ‚ÄúRuth the Gleaner‚Äù and ‚ÄúDorcas the Helper.‚Äù ReferencesBibliography * * External links *First Presbyterian Church Records at the Newberry Library * Category:Churches in Chicago Category:1833 establishments in Illinois Category:Presbyterian churches in Illinois Category:Religious organizations established in 1833 Category:19th- century Presbyterian church buildings in the United States ","title":"First Presbyterian Church (Chicago)"},{"id":"49134180","text":"The 95th Fighter Aviation Division (95th IAD) was a fighter aviation division of the Soviet Air Forces.

Smith began making and releasing experimental ambient music in 2007. Since then, the solo project has turned into a four-piece indie pop band made up of Bellows's Oliver Kalb, Told Slant‚Äôs Felix Walworth, Sharpless's Jack Greenleaf and Smith. Felix Walworth has since been replaced by Ian Cory of Lamniformes. Early life Gabrielle Smith grew up in New York City. Born in Corvallis, Oregon, Smith was adopted at a young age and to this day knows little about her family history except for the fact that her father is of Tlingit descent. Smith spent her youth singing in choir and playing violin but did not start writing and performing her own songs until after dropping out of Bard High School Early College. Growing up in Manhattan, Smith also spent many of her late-teen years going to DIY shows in Brooklyn. Inspired to be a part of the DIY scene, Smith started writing songs under the moniker Eskimeaux, then later as √ì, and finally Gabby's World. Career In 2008, Smith enrolled in the University of the Arts (Philadelphia) but dropped out in early 2009. During these two years, Smith met many of their current collaborators and friends, forming an artist collective based in Brooklyn that Smith later co-founded. These artists opened up Smith's eyes to new music stylings and influenced much of her work. Her early recordings from around this time were more electronic, experimental and synth heavy than her more recent releases. In 2011, Smith released Two Mountains and formed an artist collective with friends as a way to support each other and release art under one umbrella. A year later, Smith released a self-titled album, which was almost entirely made up of re-recorded songs from an extensive collection of demos. It was with eventual collaboration from friends' bands, such as Told Slant, Bellows, and Frankie Cosmos, that inspired Smith to overcome a long writing block. She began to write and record new material through a song-a-day project with Frankie Cosmos, Japanese Breakfast, Florist, and Small Wonder. Many of the songs written during this time appear on O.K. By 2014, the live line up was cemented, and the band's sound began to resemble the indie pop sensibility it has now. While trying to put together O.K., the band worked on old songs already written by Smith, adding dimensions and layers that would make the songs more suitable to play live. O.K. was released on May 12, 2015 on Double Double Whammy Records and received favorable reviews from Pitchfork, NPR, and Stereogum. In 2018, Smith released her first album under the moniker Gabby's World, Beast On Beast, on Yellow K Records. Its singles received positive reviews from NPR, The Fader and Stereogum.

The width from Left Premolar to Right Premolar or Measured Premolar Value (MPV) can be calculated by using Sum of Incisal Widths (S.I) of incisors and multiplying it by 100. The result can be divided by 80. The width from Left Molar to Right Molar or Measured Molar Value (MMV) can be calculated by using the S.I of incisors and multiplying by 100. The result is divided by 64. The widths are measured from occlusal grooves of both premolars and molars. Disadvantages One of the drawbacks of this analysis is that the analysis was initially done on French Population by Pont. Therefore, the data cannot be used to make predictions for other populations. This analysis also does not take the alignment of the teeth into consideration. In addition, because this analysis only applies to the upper arch serves a drawback also. Maxillary teeth are often missing and Peg Laterals are often seen in the maxillary arch.  Linder Harth Index  Linder Hath index is derived from Pont's Index. The Hath index has a slight variation from Pont's analysis. In the maxillary arch instead of 80, Linder Harth Index uses 85 to achieve the Measured Molar Value.

His career included work in circus, medicine, minstrel, vaudeville, and Broadway. Early years Ulysses was born in Prescott, Arkansas, to George Washington Thompson, and Hanna Pandora Driver. His mother died of typhus when Ulysses was seven years old, and he ran away from home at age fourteen. Initially, he worked in positions of traditional labor, but he obtained the early skills of an entertainer while dancing in the street for nickels and dimes. His experiences led to a job performing a Juba Dance in a traveling medicine show. Ulysses would dance and tell jokes, providing entertainment to the crowds who came to see the \\"Doctor\\". Medicine shows were common during that period of American history and they provided many young men with an opportunity to develop more professional skills. By the winter of 1904, he was working in Louisiana for The Mighty Hagg Circus. Over the next few years, he worked for Patterson's World Carnival, Heger and Hopper Stock Shows, the Sells Floto Circus, the Gentry Brothers Dog and Pony Show, the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus, and the Ringling Brothers Circus. At the end of Ringling Brothers 1915 season, he joined Ralph Dunbar's Tennessee Ten on the Keith-Proctor circuit. His tap dancing and acrobatic skills were said to be exceptional, and he was considered to be a master of slow-motion dance. It was as dance director for the Tennessee Ten that he met the young singer and dancer Florence Mills (1895‚Äì1927).  Military service  In 1918, Thompson was drafted by the U.S. Army. He served with the 5th Army, 92nd Infantry Division, 366th Regiment in France during the war and his military classification was Musician 3rd Class. In that position, he entertained the troops by performing as Drum Major in the Army's Band.  Career Highlights  Upon his return to the United States in 1919, Ulysses visited relatives in Hot Springs, Arkansas, before rejoining the Tennessee Ten for five more seasons, working forty weeks a year. In 1921, Ulysses married Florence Mills in New York, and in 1922, the couple joined the cast of Noble Sissle and Eubie Blake's Shuffle Along. They also worked together at the Plantation Club as members of Lew Leslie's Plantation Revue, which starred Mills. Traveling to London, they performed together in C.B. Cochran's Dover Street to Dixie and in Paris they performed in Dixie to Paris, before returning to New York to join in Dixie to Broadway (1924‚Äì1925). In 1926, they returned to Paris for Lew Leslie's Blackbirds of 1926 with Ulysses as a featured dancer and Mills being the star attraction. Upon recognizing her talent was greater than his own, Thompson subjugated his career to be her manager and promoter. When his wife became sick in 1927 and died of a tuberculosis-related disease, Thompson was distraught, but he worked hard to revive his former career as a dancer. The 1930s saw him performing world wide as a tap dancer in such distant places as Auckland and Wellington, New Zealand; Bucharest, Romania; Budapest, Hungary; Berlin, Germany; Bombay, India; Manila, Philippines; Shanghai and Hong Kong, China; Hawaii; Cuba; and Australia, where he made three tours under the management of George Sorlie. In 1946, Thompson married Dr. Gertrude Curtis, noted in her own right as New York's first black woman dentist. She was the widow of lyricist Cecil Mack who contributed the words for many Williams and Walker Show tunes. Thompson continued to be active in the entertainment industry until approximately 1969.  Death  Thompson lived to the age of 101. In his later years, he lived at a nursing home in Little Rock. He died on March 17, 1990, at the home of a relative in Little Rock. Thompson was a veteran of the U.S. Army, where he served as Musician, 3rd Class, during WWI. His burial was in Little Rock National Cemetery.

Souk El Berka  Boutique from souk El Berka Built in 1612 by Yusuf Dey, the souk El Berka is the old souk of black slaves in Tunis. This souk became later the souk of jewelers. This souk has a square form, with a wooden platform in the middle which was the place where slaves were presented and waited for the outcome of the sale. Potential buyers were sitting on benches around the souk and participated in the auction. The white slaves, considered the rarest and most valuable, were not sold in the souk but in more remote locations because the sale concerned only wealthy potential buyers. The abolition of slavery in Tunisia was declared by Ahmad I ibn Mustafa in 1846 and caused the transformation of the souk into souk of jewelers specializing in silverware.  Souk El Bey  View of souk El Bey The souk El Bey was founded by Hammuda ibn Ali. It is located between the Kasbah of Tunis and the souk El Berka. The souk is now specializing in the sale of precious metals.

He served as Governor of Bahia, represented Bahia in the Senate of Brazil, and was the Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1926 to 1930. He was the 23rd chair of the Brazilian Academy of Letters from 1930 until his death in 1960, when was succeeded by Jorge Amado.  Political career  Prior to his political career, Mangabeira was an astronomy professor at the Federal University of Bahia. He began his involvement in local and state politics in 1908. Mangabeira was the Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1926 to 1930, in the administration of President Luis Washington. Towards the end of his first term, Washington and his entire cabinet were deposed by Get√∫lio Vargas in the military coup of 1930. Mangabeira advocated against the dictatorship and in favor of the return to democracy. He was repeatedly jailed in the 1930s for conspiring against the dictatorship, and then forced into exile in 1938, which he spent first in Europe and then in New York City. While in New York, he managed to financially supported himself and his family by working for Reader's Digest magazine to translate issues from English into Portuguese. He returned to Brazil in 1945 upon the end of the Vargas dictatorship, was elected as a Federal Deputy in 1946, and elected as Governor of Bahia in 1947. He became a Senator representing Bahia in 1958, an office he served until his death in 1960. In part as a consequence of his repeated exiles and imprisonments, Mangabeira spent most of his life with very little money, and \\"lacked, at the time of his death, the means to pay for his own burial.\\" When General Dwight Eisenhower visited Brazil in 1946, Mangabeira greeted him in Rio de Janeiro, and a famous photograph taken by Ibrahim Sued appeared to show Mangabeira kissing Eisenhower's hand in greeting; the image provoked intense public debate about Brazil's relationship to the United States. While Ot√°vio was regarded as a member of the political center or center-left, his brother Jo√£o was further to the Left. Personal life Mangabeira was the son of Francisco Cavalcanti Mangabeira, a poor pharmacist, and Augusta Mangabeira. His siblings included medical doctor and poet Francisco Mangabeira, and the politician Jo√£o Mangabeira. He was the father of art critic and feminist Edyla Mangabeira Unger, and the grandfather of Roberto Mangabeira Unger. Mangabeira was a mulatto, of Afro-Brazilian descent. The Octavio Mangabeira Stadium (also known as Fonte Nova Stadium), a major football stadium in Salvador, was built in 1951 and named in his honor. The stadium was replaced in 2010 by a larger and more modern stadium, the \\"Complexo Esportivo Cultural Professor Oct√°vio Mangabeira,\\" (also known as the Arena Fonte Nova), which was used to host the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

Strausenback began selling figures that he carved from gypsum to visitors to the Garden of the Gods. He went into business for himself about 1917 and operated various stores in and around the park. In 1929 he built a Pueblo-themed trading post at the junction of Beckers Lane and the park boundary where it was reported that, \\"real Indian curios will be carried, including Indian silver, Navajo blankets, pottery, etc.\\"\\"New Indian Store in Garden of Gods\\", Colorado Springs Gazette, April 7, 1929 Strausenback hired Navajo and Pueblo Indians to work and demonstrate their arts at the trading post, among them were Awa Tsireh (also known as Alfonso Roybal) of San Ildefonso Pueblo, Ca-Ping (also known as Severo Tafoya) of Santa Clara Pueblo, and William Goodluck (frequently called Billy Goodluck) a Navajo, who worked as silversmiths. Silversmiths worked at the business seasonally until about 1955. Hand tinted photo of Garden of the Gods Trading Post, ca 1930, with Navajo and Pueblo Indians seated on porch Strausenback died in 1957 and the trading post continued to be run by his widow Esther until 1979. At that time the trading post came under the proprietorship of T.A.T. Enterprises, which still owns the trading post. The main sales area was 40 feet by 60 feet with living quarters on the second floor, and cost an estimated $10,000 to build in 1929. The current owners have expanded the original sales floor from 2400 sq ft (40 ft x 60 ft) six times to encompass 22,000 sq ft and operates the trading post as a combination Indian art gallery, gift shop, caf√©, conference center and wedding venue. Many of the original features of the 1929 trading post, such as the fireplace, floor and roof beams, have been kept intact preserving Strausenback‚Äôs vision of an Indian trading post. It is one of the oldest and largest curio stores in the southwest to be operated continuously from its founding, and has become one of the main attractions in Colorado Springs. = Company logo = In 1926 Strausenback copyrighted a logo of a Pueblo style thunderbird attacking a rattlesnake patterned after a drawing by Awa Tsireh (Alfonso Roybal) that would become synonymous with the trading post.

It was designed by Eyre & Munro and built in 1891 by James Smith. It is also known as Dance North and Townsville Arts Centre. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The School of Arts building was designed by Townsville architects Eyre and Munro. It was constructed by local builder James Smith and opened in May 1891. The first Mechanic's Institutes or Schools of Arts were established in Britain in the early 1800s and were intended to assist self improvement and to promote moral, social and intellectual growth, by providing lectures, discussions and lending libraries to a rising middle class. At the time there were no free public libraries and books were expensive, so that access to books by borrowing as subscribers provided an important service. The first School of Arts committee in Queensland was established in Brisbane in 1849 with the aim of \\"the advancement of the community in literary, philosophic and scientific subjects\\". As towns and districts became established, local committees were formed to set up schools of arts, which became one of the principal sources of adult education. The government recognised this by making land available, subsidising books and assisting with building costs. Most Schools of Arts also had a hall with a stage which could be hired, thus encouraging the arts as well as providing a source of revenue. The first School of Arts committee met in Townsville in 1866 and comprised a number of leading citizens including the town's founders, Captain Robert Towns and John Melton Black. Townsville had been established only two years previously as a port and commercial centre for the pastoral industry north of the Burdekin. It was gazetted as a port of entry in 1865 and grew quickly. The School of Arts began modestly in a small rented cottage with a foundation library of 30 books. It soon moved to larger premises, but did not acquire a permanent home until 1877 when a substantial building was constructed on a reserve granted for the purpose on Melton Hill. Gradually the business heart of the city moved westward so that by 1889 it was believed that the School of Arts on Melton Hill was too far from the centre of town. The Melton Hill property was sold to the Queensland Government for conversion to a court building and a new site was purchased on the corner of Stanley and Walker Streets. A design competition was held for the new building and was won by Townsville architects Eyre and Munro. Walter Eyre was an architect, engineer and surveyor. He trained in England and arriving in Brisbane in 1880, worked in the office of his cousin, FDG Stanley, from 1881 until he was appointed City Engineer of Townsville in 1885. In 1887 he left to set up in practice as an architect and soon gained enough work to take on WHA Munro as a junior partner. The firm supervised the work of southern architects as well as designing buildings and were responsible for a number of major works in north Queensland before the firm ceased operations in 1892. Their design for the School of Arts was constructed by local builder James Smith and was opened in May 1891 with a debutante ball on opening night and a concert on the 27 May. Boxing match of Alf Goodwin versus Barney Anderson at the School of Arts, 1911 The new building had meeting rooms and class rooms on the ground floor with a large library above. Classes were held in such subjects as drawing, singing and woodwork. The first gas cooking classes in Townsville were held here in 1895 utilising a specially installed Darren gas cooker. Connected to this building was a theatre building, originally called Her Majesty's, which could seat 600 people. This was a large rectangular space rising to 2 storey height with a stage flanked by extensions housing dressing rooms. It was used by many visiting theatrical groups and performers, including a Chinese Opera company in 1894. It was the town's leading theatrical venue until the second Theatre Royal opened in 1900, although it continued to be popular after this, Nellie Melba appearing at the theatre in 1909. His Majesty's (as it was later renamed when King Edward VII succeeded Queen Victoria) was also the venue for the first Aboriginal stage performance in Townsville when a variety company, formed by local Aborigines performed there in 1907. Boxing matches were also held there. The building suffered cyclone damage from Cyclone Sigma in 1896 and again by Cyclone Leonta in 1903 when the offices were unroofed and the theatre was partially demolished. This damage was repaired in 1904 by the architects Tunbridge and Tunbridge. By this time it had become obvious that the theatre was too small and in 1913 the size of the auditorium was increased by an extension at the Walker Street end. During the Depression the cessation of government subsidies to Schools of Arts spelt the end for many of them. The Townsville School of Arts remained in use until the 1930s, although the verandahs were enclosed and a single storey office building was attached on the Walker Street side between 1929 and 1934. Alternatives for education and leisure activities and the Libraries Act of 1943, which provided for free lending libraries, all contributed to the gradual closure of Schools of Arts around the state. This change was slightly anticipated Townsville in 1938 when the Trustees resigned and vested the assets of the School of Arts in the Townsville City Council as Trustee, creating the first free public lending library in Australia. In 1941 the building was requisitioned by the Defence authorities and became the main RAAF postal office for the Pacific region. After the war it became the offices of the newly formed Townsville Regional Electricity Board. They vacated the building in 1963 and the Northern Electricity Authority occupied the building, moving out in 1968. The building then remained vacant for some time. In the late 1960s the Townsville Arts Centre Association formed and in 1976 the building underwent extensive renovation. It became an arts centre, used as the office of the Pacific Festival (1970‚Äì1995) and a base for the Townsville Little Theatre and a community radio station, 4TTT. It is home to the North Queensland Ballet and Dance Co Ltd commonly known as Dance North. Further work to the building was carried out in the 1990s during which the upper verandah was reinstated. In 2016, the building is known as the SOA (School of Arts) Theatre and is home to Dance North (now styled Dancenorth) and TheatreiNQ, a professional/amateur theatre company as well as hosting touring productions and other events.  Description  The Townsville School of Arts building is located on the corner of Stanley and Walker Streets and comprises a two storey structure with an adjoining theatre building running parallel to its rear and accessed from Walker Street and from within the School of Arts building. Both buildings are constructed of exposed face brick and are roofed in corrugated iron. The former School of Arts building is two storeys high and is fronted on the Stanley Street elevation by brick columns, square in plan, rising from rendered plinths through both storeys to create deep verandahs. The verandah at street level is reached by low steps and has decorative iron railings and matching gates. The front entrance is through double doors flanked by sash windows. The upper floor has cross-braced timber balustrading to the verandah above a deep timber valance. The verandah is accessed by french doors with transom lights above. The ground floor houses offices, toilet facilities, lobbies and the main foyer. A timber staircase gives access from the foyer to the first floor which is divided into two sections by an arch and which it is intended to use as dance space. The single storey extension at the corner of Stanley and Walker Streets is also brick and is similar in style and finish to the main building. The opposite side of the Stanley Street elevation has a brick arch which leads onto a passageway. The theatre is a large rectangular building divided into bays externally by shallow brick piers. There is an entrance onto Walker Street and the rear has large doors which were designed to allow for the movement of scenery and large props. Inside, the building has a large auditorium with a timber floor and a stage area which has a basement beneath. On the northern side of the building, the dressing room bay has been extended by the construction of a 1960s brick amenities block. This has been modified as dressing rooms and a performers area. On the southern side an extension runs the length of the building and houses the studios and offices of the 4TTT radio station.  Heritage listing  Townsville School of Arts was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The School of Arts building is important as part of the network of Schools of Arts which sprang up in any town of consequence in Queensland during the 19th and early 20th centuries and were a measure of prosperity and progress. The scale, material and form of the building amply demonstrate the wealth and importance of Townsville as a regional centre at this period. Schools of Arts were community based and played a valuable educational and social role in the dissemination of information and the provision of facilities for lectures and meetings and the staging of events such as balls, plays and concerts. They were an important stage in the development of adult education in Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. It is a good example of a School of Arts building in a major regional centre, originally comprising a library, meeting rooms and a theatre designed to provide the facilities for a wide range of community cultural events and needs. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. As a prominent and well designed building, the Townsville School of Arts makes an important contribution to the built character of Townsville in form, scale, material and because of its location close to the town centre. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The School of Arts building is important for its connection with the community of Townsville and the surrounding district as an integral part of the social and community life of the town. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The Townsville School of Arts building is a major work of the North Queensland architectural firm of Eyre and Munro.

It is one of twenty Yoga Upanishads in the four Vedas. Two versions of the Yogashikha Upanishad exist, one short that is attached to the Atharvaveda in some anthologies, and a long version which is often found attached to the Krishna Yajurveda in Telugu language anthologies. The long version consists of six chapters, and is about forty times longer than the short version. The short version appears interspersed within the first chapter of the long version. History The Yogashikha is an ancient text, states Mircea Eliade, who suggests a relative chronology. He dates it to the same period when the following Hindu texts were composed ‚Äì Maitri Upanishad, the didactic parts of the Mahabharata, the chief Sannyasa Upanishads and along with other early Yoga Upanishads such as Brahmabindu, Brahmavidya, Tejobindu, Yogatattva, Nadabindu, Kshurika, Dhyanabindu and Amritabindu. These texts along with the Yogashikha Upanishad, adds Eliade, were composed earlier than the ten or eleven later yogic Upanishads such as the Yoga-kundali, Varaha and Pashupatabrahma Upanishads.Mircea Eliade (1970), Yoga: Immortality and Freedom, Princeton University Press, , pages 128‚Äì129 Gavin Flood dates this text, along with other Yoga Upanishads, to be probably from the 100 BCE to 300 CE period. Georg Feuerstein calls the Yogashikha Upanishad, as the \\"Crest of Yoga\\" and the \\"most comprehensive of the Yoga Upanishads\\". The ideas found in Yogashikha are shared in many Hatha Yoga texts such as those by Gorakhnath.Akshaya Banerjea (2014), Philosophy of Gorakhnath with Goraksha-Vacana-Sangraha, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 184‚Äì185 Some manuscripts of the text are titled as Yoga- sikhopanisad (‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó‡§∂‡§ø‡§ñ‡•ã‡§™‡§®‡§ø‡§∑‡§§‡•ç). It is listed at number 63 in the serial order of the Muktika enumerated by Rama to Hanuman in the modern era anthology of 108 Upanishads. In the Colebrooke's version of 52 Upanishads, popular in north India, it is listed at number 22. The Narayana anthology, popular in South India, also includes this Upanishad at number 22 in Bibliothica Indica. In the collection of Upanishads under the title \\"Oupanekhat\\", put together by Sultan Mohammed Dara Shikhoh in 1656, consisting of a Persian translation of 50 Upanishads and who prefaced it as the best book on religion, the Yogashika is listed at number 20 and is named Djog Sank'ha. According to Alain Dani√©lou, this Upanishad is one of the 12 Raja Yoga Upanishads, seven of which are attached to the Krishna Yajurveda and five to the Shukla Yajurveda. The text was influential on medieval Hindu literature such as in section 1.2 of the early 12th-century encyclopedic text Manasollasa, and the Hath yoga literature.Christian Bouy (1994), Les Natha-Yogin et les Upanisads, Publications de l'Institut de Civilisation Indienne No. 62, Paris: De Boccard, pages 112‚Äì114 (in French) Contents The text is composed in poetic verse style. The chapter 1, the longest, includes a discussion of the role of yoga in achieving moksha, that is liberation while living (Jivanmukta), and contrasts it to Videhamukti (liberation in afterlife). The first chapter asserts Om to be Mula-Mantra (root mantra), and describes it to be part masculine Shiva and part feminine Shakti.Ellen Goldberg (2002), The Lord Who Is Half Woman: Ardhanarisvara in Indian and Feminist Perspective, State University of New York Press, , pages 86‚Äì87 It asserts that anger, greed and such psychological states to be defects that ultimately lead to sorrow, that the pure being is one who is beyond these, a state that can only be achieved through simultaneous pursuit of knowledge and yoga. The Telugu language anthology edition of Yogashikha Upanishad is notable for its discussion of Jnana-Yoga (path of knowledge). Chapters 1 and 5 of the text discuss six kinds of Yoga, Kundalini and five fires within a human body.Guy Beck (1995), Sonic Theology: Hinduism and Sacred Sound, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 94-95 It asserts that the awareness of Chakra with Hatha Yoga practice is a form of spiritual experience. The human body, metaphorically asserts the text, is the temple of Vishnu, as Brahman. It is incorrect to regard one's eternal Atman (self, soul) to be same as the temporal body. The Upanishad explains Brahma Granthi as the first knot of the Kundalini, being situated in the Muladhara chakra (the root chakra). Tantric texts are different than Yogashikha Upanishad, states Harish Johri, because they identify Brahma Granthi to be positioned in the Manipura Chakra which is the third chakra. The text, states Georg Feuerstein, suggests Yoga is a journey and recommends a steady spiritual practice with a Guru (teacher). The Upanishad calls one's Guru as the one who is a spiritual guide and one worthy of devotion, praising the Guru as Brahman, Vishnu, Achyuta, identical to one's Atman (soul), declaring that there is no one greater in the universe than one's Guru. The verse 2.22 states that those who have faith in Ishvara and Guru will become great. The last chapter of the Upanishad emphasizes the importance of Dhyana (meditation) on the highest self, Hamsa and Om. The variation in the manuscripts suggest corruption of the text over time, states Deussen, such as the abrupt, non-metric addition of \\"reciting this text thrice a day leads to liberation\\" in verse 8 of the short version.

The generalized FK model describes a chain of classical particles with nearest neighbor interactions and subjected to a periodic on-site substrate potential. In its original and simplest form the interactions are taken to be harmonic and the potential to be sinusoidal with a periodicity commensurate with the equilibrium distance of the particles. Different choices for the interaction and substrate potentials and inclusion of a driving force may describe a wide range of different physical situations. Originally introduced by Yakov Frenkel and Tatiana Kontorova in 1938 to describe the structure and dynamics of a crystal lattice near a dislocation core the FK model has become one of the standard models in condensed matter physics due to its applicability to describe many physical phenomena. Physical phenomena which can be modeled by FK model include dislocations, the dynamics of adsorbate layers on surfaces, crowdions, domain walls in magnetically ordered structures, long Josephson junctions, hydrogen- bonded chains, and DNA type chains. A modification of the FK model, the Tomlinson model, plays an important role in the field of tribology. The equations for stationary configurations of the FK model reduce to those of the standard map or Chirikov‚ÄìTaylor map of stochastic theory. In the continuum- limit approximation the FK model reduces to the exactly integrable sine-Gordon equation or SG equation which allows for soliton solutions. For this reason the FK model is also known as the 'discrete sine-Gordon' or 'periodic Klein- Gordon' equation.  History  A simple model of a harmonic chain in a periodic substrate potential was proposed by Ulrich Dehlinger in 1928. Dehlinger derived an approximate analytical expression for the stable solutions of this model which he termed Verhakungen which correspond to what is today called kink pairs. An essentially similar model was developed by Ludwig Prandtl in 1912/13 but did not see publication until 1928. The model was independently proposed by Yakov Frenkel and Tatiana Kontorova in their 1938 paper On the theory of plastic deformation and twinning to describe the dynamics of a crystal lattice near a dislocation and to describe crystal twinning. In the standard linear harmonic chain any displacement of the atoms will result in waves and the only stable configuration will be the trivial one. For the nonlinear chain of Frenkel and Kontorova there exist stable configurations beside the trivial one. For small atomic displacements the situation resembles the linear chain, however for large enough displacements it is possible to create a moving single dislocation for which an analytical solution was derived by Frenkel and Kontorova. The shape of these dislocations is defined only by the parameters of the system such as the mass and the elastic constant of the springs. Dislocations, also called solitons, are distributed non-local defects and mathematically they are a type of topological defect. The defining characteristic of solitons/dislocations is that they behave much like stable particles, they can move while maintaining their overall shape. Two solitons of equal and opposite orientation may cancel upon collision but a single soliton can not annihilate spontaneously.  Generalized model  The generalized FK model treats a one-dimensional chain of atoms with nearest neighbor interaction in periodic on-site potential, the Hamiltonian for this system is {2}\\\\sum_{n}\\\\bigg(\\\\frac{dx_{n}}{dt}\\\\bigg)^{2}+ U}} where the first term is the kinetic energy of the n atoms of mass m_{a} and the potential energy U is a sum of the potential energy due to the nearest neighbor interaction and that of the substrate potential U=U_{sub}+U_{int} The substrate potential is periodic, i.e. U_{sub}(x+a_{s})=U_{sub}(x) for some a_{s}. For non harmonic interactions and/or non sinusoidal potential the FK model will give rise to a commensurate-incommensurate phase transition. The FK model can be applied to any system that can be treated as two coupled sub- systems where one subsystem can be approximated as a linear chain and the second subsystem as a motionless substrate potential. An example would be the adsorption of a layer onto a crystal surface, here the adsorption layer can be approximated as the chain and the crystal surface as a on-site potential.  Classical model  In this section we examine in detail the simplest form of the FK model. A detailed version of this derivation can be found in the following paper. The model, shown schematically in figure 1, describes a one- dimensional chain of atoms with a harmonic nearest neighbor interaction and subject to a sinusoidal potential. Transverse motion of the atoms is ignored, i.e. the atoms can only move along the chain. The Hamiltonian for this situation is given by (1) where we specify the interaction potential to be U_{int}=\\\\frac{g}{2}\\\\sum_{n}(x_{n+1} -x_{n}-a_{0})^{2} where g is the elastic constant and a_{0} is the inter-atomic equilibrium distance. The substrate potential is U_{sub}=\\\\frac{\\\\epsilon_{s}}{2}\\\\sum_{n}\\\\bigg[1-\\\\cos\\\\bigg(\\\\frac{2\\\\pi x_{n}}{a_{s}}\\\\bigg)\\\\bigg] with \\\\epsilon_{s} the amplitude and a_{s} the period. The following dimensionless variables are introduced in order to rewrite the Hamiltonian: x_{n}\\\\rightarrow \\\\bigg(\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{a_{s}}\\\\bigg)x_{n},\\\\qquad t\\\\rightarrow \\\\bigg(\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{a_{s}}\\\\bigg)\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\epsilon_{s}}{2m_{a}}}t,\\\\qquad a_{0}\\\\rightarrow \\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{a_{s}},\\\\qquad g \\\\rightarrow g\\\\frac{a_{s}/2\\\\pi^{2}}{\\\\epsilon_{s}/2} In dimensionless form the Hamiltonian is H=\\\\frac{\\\\cal H}{\\\\epsilon_{s}/2}=\\\\sum_{n}\\\\bigg[\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\frac{dx_{n}}{dt}^{2}+(1-\\\\cos x_{n}+\\\\frac{1}{2}g(x_{n+1}-x_{n}-a_{0})^{2}\\\\bigg] which describes a harmonic chain of atoms of unit mass in a sinusoidal potential of period a_{s}=2\\\\pi with amplitude \\\\epsilon_{s}=2. The equation of motion for this Hamiltonian is \\\\frac{d^{2}x_{n}}{dt^{2}}+ \\\\sin x_{n}-g(x_{n+1}+x_{n-1}-2x_{n})=0 We consider only the case where a_{0} and a_{s} are commensurate, for simplicity we take a_{0}=a_{s}. Thus in the ground state of the chain each minimum of the substrate potential is occupied by one atom. We introduce the variable u_{n} for atomic displacements which is defined by x_{n}=na_{s}+u_{n} For small displacements u_{n}\\\\ll a_{s} the equation of motion may be linearized and takes the following form \\\\frac{d^{2} u_{n}}{dt^{2}}+u_{n}-g(u_{n+1}+u_{n-1}-2u_{n})=0 This equation of motion describes phonons with u_{n}\\\\propto \\\\exp[i(\\\\omega_{ph}(\\\\kappa)t-\\\\kappa n)] with the phonon dispersion relation \\\\omega_{ph}^{2}(\\\\kappa)=\\\\omega_{min}^{2}+2g(1-\\\\cos \\\\kappa) with \\\\kappa\\\\leq \\\\pi the dimensionless wavenumber. This shows that the frequency spectrum of the chain has a band gap \\\\omega_{min}\\\\equiv \\\\omega_{ph}(0)=1 with cut-off frequency \\\\omega_{max}\\\\equiv \\\\omega_{ph}(\\\\pi)=\\\\sqrt{\\\\omega_{min}^{2}+4g}. The linearised equation of motion are not valid when the atomic displacements are not small and one must use the nonlinear equation of motion. The nonlinear equations can support new types of localized excitations which are best illuminated by considering the continuum limit approximation of the FK model. Applying the standard procedure of Rosenau to derive continuum limit equations from a discrete lattice results in the perturbed sine-Gordon equation u_{tt}+\\\\sin u-(a_{s}^{2}g)u_{xx}=\\\\epsilon f(u) here the function \\\\epsilon f(u) describes in first order the effects due to the discreteness of the chain. \\\\epsilon f(u)=\\\\frac{1}{12}a_{s}^{2}(u_{xxtt}+u_{x}^{2}\\\\sin u - u_{xx}\\\\cos u) Neglecting the discreteness effects and introducing x\\\\rightarrow \\\\frac{x}{a_{s}\\\\sqrt{g}} reduces the equation of motion to the sine-Gordon (SG) equation in its standard form. u_{tt}-u_{xx}+ \\\\sin u=0 The SG equation gives rise to three elementary excitations/solutions: kinks, breathers and phonons. Kinks, or topological solitons, can be understood as the solution connecting two nearest identical minima of the periodic substrate potential, thus they are a result of the degeneracy of the ground state. u_{k}(x,t)=4 \\\\tan^{-1}(\\\\exp[-\\\\sigma \\\\gamma (v)(x-vt)]) where \\\\sigma =\\\\pm 1 is the topological charge, for \\\\sigma=1 the solution is called a kink and for \\\\sigma=-1 it is an antikink. The kink width \\\\gamma is determined by the kink velocity v where v is measured in units of the sound velocity c and is \\\\gamma(v)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1-v^{2}}}. For kink motion with v^{2}\\\\ll c^{2} the width approximates 1. The energy of the kink in dimensionless units is E_{k}=mc^{2}\\\\gamma(v)\\\\approx mc^{2}+\\\\frac{1}{2}mv^{2} from which the rest mass of the kink follows as m=\\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi^{2}\\\\sqrt{g}} and the kinks rest energy as \\\\epsilon_{k}=mc^{2}=8\\\\sqrt{g}. Two neighboring static kinks with distance R will have energy of repulsion v_{int}\\\\approx\\\\epsilon_{k}\\\\sinh^{-2}\\\\bigg(\\\\frac{R}{2a_{s}\\\\sqrt{g}}\\\\bigg) whereas kink and antikink will attract with interaction v_{int}(R)\\\\approx -\\\\epsilon_{k}\\\\cosh^{-2}\\\\bigg(\\\\frac{R}{2a_{s}\\\\sqrt{g}}\\\\bigg) A breather is u_{br}(x,t)=4\\\\tan^{-1}\\\\bigg[\\\\bigg(\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\Omega^{2}}}{\\\\Omega}\\\\bigg)\\\\frac{\\\\sin(\\\\Omega t)}{\\\\cosh(x\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\Omega^{2}}}\\\\bigg] which describes nonlinear oscillation with frequency \\\\Omega and 0<\\\\Omega<\\\\omega_{min} \\\\epsilon_{br}=2 \\\\epsilon_{k}\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\Omega^{2}} for low frequencies \\\\Omega\\\\ll 1 the breather can be seen as a coupled kink-antikink pair. Kinks and breathers can move along the chain without any dissipative energy loss. Furthermore, any collision between all the excitations of the SG equation will result in only a phase shift. Thus kinks and breathers may be considered nonlinear quasi- particles of the SG model. For nearly integrable modifications of the SG equation such as the continuum-approximation of the FK model kinks can be considered deformable quasi-particles, provided that discreetness effects are small.  The Peierls‚ÄìNabarro potential  In the preceding section the excitations of the FK model were derived by considering the model in a continuum-limit approximation. Since the properties of kinks are only modified slightly by the discreteness of the primary model, the SG equation can adequately describe most features and dynamics of the system. The discrete lattice does, however, influence the kink motion in a unique way with the existence of the Peierls‚ÄìNabarro (PN) potential V_{PN}(X). Here, X is the position of the kink's center. The existence of the PN potential is due to the lack of translational invariance in a discrete chain. In the continuum limit the system is invariant for any translation of the kink along the chain. For a discrete chain only those translations that are an integer multiple of the lattice spacing a_{s} leave the system invariant. The PN barrier, E_{PN}, is the smallest energy barrier for a kink to overcome so that it can move through the lattice. The value of the PN barrier is the difference between the kink's potential energy for a stable and unstable stationary configuration. The stationary configurations are shown schematically in figure 2.Stationary configuration for the FK model for a single kink. Top image corresponds to a stable configuration.

The palace was one of the 163 Palazzi dei Rolli of Genoa, the selected private residences where the notable guests of the Republic of Genoa were hosted during State visits. On 13 luglio del 2006 it was added to the list of 42 palaces which now form the UNESCO World Heritage Site Genoa: Le Strade Nuove and the system of the Palazzi dei Rolli. It is currently owned by the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism and houses the National Gallery of Art in Palazzo Spinola (). History The funds for the initial construction of this palace was present in the will of Francesco Grimaldi, made prior to 1593, when construction began upon medieval foundations at the site. The palace was included in the Rolli or list of aristocratic residences, that could be used by the government for hosting prominent visitors. An etching of its fa√ßade is included in Peter Paul Rubens's 1622 book I Palazzi di Genova, printed in Antwerp in 1622. The Grimaldi family commissioned the fresco decorations by Lorenzo De Ferrari and Lazzaro Tavarone. The ceiling frescoes by Tavarone depict: the Siege of Lisbon by Duke of Alba (first floor) and the Triumph of Ranieri Grimaldi in 1304 over the Flemish fleet at Zierikzee (second floor). The palace belonged to the House of Grimaldi until 1641-1650, when it was transferred to Ansaldo Pallavicini, a brother in law of Tommaso Grimaldi, in order to settle a debt. Ansaldo was responsible for closing the open loggia of the first floor. The palace eventually passed through marriage from the Pallavicini to the Doria family, when Anna Maria Pallavicino married to Gerolamo Doria. In the 18th century it again passed through marriage to become the property of the House of Spinola, when Maddalena Doria married to Niccol√≤ Spinola. Maddalena directed the Rococo refurbishment in the mid-18th century, and engaged Lorenzo De Ferrari, Giovanni Battista Natali and Sebastiano Galeotti to paint the quadratura and decoration. She also commissioned the Gallery of Mirrors. Her grandson, Paolo Francesco Spinola, however was forced during the Napoleonic occupation to sell many works of art; his portrait (1794) by Angelica Kauffman is on display in the palace. By 1830 the palace was owned by the Tollot Family who would give it to Tito and Ferdinando Pignone in 1875. The building has characteristics typical of late 16th-century Genoese palaces, having an entrance hall and an inner courtyard. The palace also had an extensive art collection, including paintings by Luca Cambiasi, Bernardo Castello and Bernardo Strozzi. The third floor of the palace was destroyed during bombing during World War II. In 1958, the marquis Paolo and Franco Spinola donated the building, complete with its furnishings, artworks, silverware, ceramics, etchings and books, to the Italian government. The damaged part was subsequently rebuilt, and it has housed the since 1993. Among the works of art in the collection are: *Praying Virgin by Joos van Cleve *Allegory of the Peace and the War by Luca Giordano *Portrait of a nun by Bernardo Strozzi *Ecce Homo by Antonello da Messina *Equestrian portrait of Giovanni Carlo Doria by Rubens *Justice statue by Giovanni Pisano *Putti for Capella Grimaldi by Giambologna and Pietro Francavilla  See also  * Genoa: Le Strade Nuove and the system of the Palazzi dei Rolli References Bibliography  * Gioconda Pomella (2007), Guida Completa ai Palazzi dei Rolli Genova, Genova, De Ferrari Editore() * Mauro Quercioli (2008), I Palazzi dei Rolli di Genova, Roma, Libreria dello Stato () * Fiorella Caraceni Poleggi (2001), Palazzi Antichi e Moderni di Genova raccolti e disegnati da Pietro Paolo Rubens (1652), Genova, Tormena Editore () * Mario Lab√≤ (2003), I palazzi di Genova di P.P.

It is also the earliest tarot deck in which all the plain suit cards are illustrated. The deck was created by an unknown artist and engraved onto metal in the late 15th century. A single complete hand-painted deck is known to exist, along with 35 uncolored cards held by various museums. The deck is notable not only for its age, but also for the quality of its artwork, which is characterized by expressive figures engraved with precise contours and shading. Various theories have been suggested about who created the deck, but its authorship remains uncertain. Composition The Sola-Busca deck comprises 78 cards including 21 trumps (trionfi) plus the Fool (Matte) and 56 suit cards. There had been many previous decks structured in this way. The names and illustrations relating to the trump cards are somewhat idiosyncratic in the Sola Busca deck. The characters depicted in the Sola- Busca cards include Nebuchadnezzar and Gaius Marius, the uncle of Julius Caesar. Trump cards loosely follow the rise and fall of the Roman Empire but also include members of the Roman Pantheon such as Bacchus. All the characters can be easily linked to their equivalents in the earlier and later, more standard, decks. Painted deck The complete painted deck is currently housed at the Brera Museum in Milan. It can trace its provenance to the noble Busca-Serbelloni family. In the early 19th century the deck was owned by Marchioness Busca (born Duchess Serbelloni) of Milan. In 1907, the Busca- Serbelloni family donated black-and-white photographs of all 78 cards to the British Museum, where they were likely seen by A. E. Waite and Pamela Colman Smith, inspiring the subsequent Waite-Smith tarot deck. From 1948, the deck was owned by the Sola-Busca family, from which it received its name. In 2009, the deck was purchased for by the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and delivered to the Brera Museum. Unpainted cards Thirty-five unpainted cards are also known. The Albertina museum in Vienna owns 23, including all of the trumps except the first and last, Mato and Nabuchodenasor. The 20 trump cards originally belonged to Count Moritz von Fries, while the other three came from the Imperial Court Library. The British Museum owns four unpainted cards, which it purchased from William and George Smith in 1845. Four unpainted cards are also housed in Hamburg and Paris. Impact The similarities between the artwork of the Minor Arcana of the Waite-Smith deck and Sola-Busca's plain suits has led some scholars to suggest that artist Pamela Colman Smith drew inspiration from the earlier work. Smith created the art for her deck two years after the acquisition of photographs of the Sola-Busca deck by the British Museum, and likely saw the cards on display there. Notable similarities include the Three of Swords card and the Ten of Wands card in the Rider deck, which is very similar to the Ten of Swords card in the Sola-Busca deck. Research In 1938, Arthur Mayger Hind described the Sola Busca Tarot in his Early Italian Engravings and supposed that the deck was engraved around 1490 and then hand-painted in 1491, as a result of reading some of the inscriptions on the cards. He also supposed that the deck was created for a Venetian client by Mattia Serrati da Cosandola, a miniaturist operating in Ferrara (the center of Tarot card production at the time). In fact, many inscriptions on the cards refer without any doubt to the Republic of Venice. In 1987, in the catalogue of a great Tarot exhibition realized at the Estense Castle of Ferrara, Italian historian Giordano Berti wrote a summary of all the research made up to that point by various scholars. In 1995 the Italian scholar Sofia Di Vincenzo, in her book titled Antichi Tarocchi illuminati. L‚Äôalchimia nei Tarocchi Sola-Busca (Turin, 1995 and Stamford, 1998), argued that many images of the Sola Busca deck are related to themes of European alchemy as practised during the Renaissance.

It joined three branches to the Cleator and Workington Junction Railway's (CWJR) main line from to via . No station ever existed at the junction, was the nearest, to the south. Former employees described the junction as the CWJR's \\"nerve centre\\". Harrington Junction looking north in 1951 A 1914 Railway Clearing House Junction Diagram showing the complex network which existed in the Workington area Background The main line was one of the fruits of the rapid industrialisation of West Cumberland in the second half of the nineteenth century, specifically being born as a reaction to oligopolistic behaviour by the London and North Western and Whitehaven, Cleator and Egremont Railways. All lines in the area were primarily aimed at mineral traffic, notably iron ore, coal and limestone, none more so than the new line to Workington, which earned the local name \\"The Track of the Ironmasters\\". General goods and passenger services were provided, but were very small beer compared with mineral traffic. The founding Act of Parliament of June 1878 confirmed the company's agreement with the Furness Railway that the latter would operate the line for one third of the receipts. Layout Three lines joined the main line at Harrington Junction: * the Derwent Branch, from Derwent Iron and Steel Works north west of the junction * the Moss Bay Branch, from the Moss Bay Hematite Iron and Steel Company Works west of the junction, and * the Harrington Branch, which met the Lowca Light Railway at Rosehill, south west of the junction. The layout was such that trains could travel from the Harrington Branch onto the Moss Bay Branch or the Derwent Branch without going onto the main line. There were five sidings on each side of the main line, four beside the lines to the steel works and a further four beside the Lowca line, together with other equipment such as cranes, signalboxes and a control cabin. Growth Mineral traffic started along the main line in July 1879, along with the branches towards Lowca and Derwent Ironworks. The Moss Bay branch followed in December 1885, being extended to Harrington Harbour in July 1893. Harrington Junction was about mineral and industrial traffic. The line's peak year was 1909, with lots of traffic generated between 1914 and 1918. In 1920 twenty \\"Up\\" (northbound) mineral trains halted at the junction, plus passenger, workmen's, goods, and special trains. A similar number travelled southbound. Decline Passenger traffic to and from Lowca ended in May 1926 and along the main line on 13 April 1931, though they had never been substantial. The last remnant of the Derwent branch, from Wilkinson Wagon Works to the junction, closed in 1962. The line south from to closed on 16 September 1963 and the line from the junction south to Distington was singled. The remaining main line from Calva Junction north of through the junction to Distington closed on 26 September 1965, but residual traffic continued between Lowca and Moss Bay, keeping a bit of the junction alive. The \\"Furnessman\\" brakevan railtour on 24 May 1969 passed through the remains of the junction. Solway Colliery, Workington, closed in May 1973, leaving the junction with no traffic or prospect of traffic, so it closed on 23 May, with a farewell brakevan special on 26 May 1973 being the last train for ever. Afterlife In 2013 the West Cumbria Cycle Network used the main line trackbed through the junction.

Pignato became First Lady of El Salvador on June 1, 2009, the same day that her husband, President Mauricio Funes appointed her as the country's Secretary of Social Inclusion from 2009 to 2014. The appointment made Pignato the first sitting First Lady in El Salvador's history to hold a political position. Funes's successor, President Salvador S√°nchez Cer√©n, reappointed Pignato as Secretary of Social Inclusion when he took office in June 2014. In 2011, Pignato established Ciudad Mujer (Women City), to aid victims of violence against women, as well provide access to women's healthcare services, financial advice, and career training.The five Ciudad Mujer centers, located throughout the country, offer services from 15 Salvadoran government agencies in one location.These include job training and financial loans to offer a chance for economic independence.Ciudad Mujer also provides healthcare services, including forensic laboratories and legal aid for victims of sexual assault, reproductive services, neonatal care and breast cancer prevention.An estimated 603,000 women have utilized Ciudad Mujer, as of November 2014. Pignato's Ciudad Mujer initiative has received international support and recognition, including from the Inter-American Development Bank and the United Nations. In January 2015, the Brazilian government announced plans to launch its own \\"Women's House\\" project, modeled on Pignato's Ciudad Mujer program in El Salvador.The first \\"Women's House\\" in Pignato's native Brazil is slated for Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul. Guatemala, Colombia and Mexico have also expressed interest in implementing Pignato's programs. Biography Pignato was born in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. She became an activist in the Workers' Party (PT) and served as an adviser to Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva, who would later serve as President of Brazil from 2003 to 2011. She reportedly remains close to both Lula da Silva and his successor, President Dilma Rousseff. She began documenting human rights abuses in El Salvador during the Salvadoran Civil War, which was ended by the Chapultepec Peace Accords. Pignato moved from Brazil to El Salvador in 1992, where she represented the Workers' Party in Central America. She also became the Director of the Center for Brazilian Studies at the Embassy of Brazil in San Salvador in 1992. She later married Mauricio Funes, a Salvadoran journalist and FMLN politician, with whom she had one son, Gabriel. First Lady and Secretary of Social Inclusion Pignato has promoted women's rights and gender equality during her tenures as First Lady and Secretary of Social Inclusion. Pignato's Department of Social Inclusion oversees issues related to human rights and family affairs in El Salvador. Pignato was first appointed as Secretary on June 1, 2009, by her husband, President Mauricio Funes. She was reappointed to the post in 2014 by President Salvador S√°nchez Cer√©n, who asked her to stay on as his Secretary of Social Inclusion. Pignato has acknowledged the challenges facing Salvadoran women, who have higher high school dropout rates and lower literacy rates than men. They tend to be economically dependent on male partners or family members, making it more difficult to leave an abusive relationship. In 2012, President Mauricio Funes gave a speech calling \\"Violence against women is violence against society,\\" which was one of the first times that women's issues and gender-based violence had reached the forefront of political debate in El Salvador. In a 2014 interview with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, Vignato praised her now-estranged husband's efforts and his 2012 speech, noting \\"Before that speech women didn't exist in government policies. They were invisible. At Women City, women are now visible, in a place that's just for them. When women come here they get a hug from a female official who doesn't judge or ignore them.\\" Her signature initiative has been Ciudad Mujer, which were established in 2011. Five the centers have been opened to low income areas across El Salvador. She overcame opposition against the plan from several sectors of Salvadoran society, which included politicians, evangelical Christian groups, and the Roman Catholic Church, to launch Ciudad Mujer. Ciudad Mujer, which had provided healthcare, legal and healthcare services to 603,000 women by November 2014, have won praise both within El Salvador and internationally. Brazil has announced plans to open its own Ciudad Mujer initiative, while Guatemala, Colombia and Mexico have expressed interest in adopting Pignato's initiative as well. Pignato simultaneously served as the Salvadorian Institute for Women Development. Additionally, she was appointed as the first President Salvadorian National Council for the Youth. In October 2011, ten days of heavy rain led to severe flooding which affected 70% of El Salvador and damaged approximately 80% of the country's roads. The floods, which impacted 300,000 residents, killed 105 people and destroyed of 250,000 of agricultural land and crops. Then President Mauricio Funes estimated that damages totaled $840 million, equal to 4% of El Salvador's gross domestic product (GDP). Pignato, as both Secretary of Social Inclusion and First Lady, traveled to Washington D.C. in November 2011 to lobby for humanitarian aid from the United States Congress and the U.S. State Department. She also met with United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, former U.S. President Bill Clinton, the Salvadoran American community and representatives for the corporate sector. The National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations (NECO) awarded Pignato the Ellis Island Medal of Honor in May 2012, citing her cooperation with the Salvadoran American community and her initiatives to support women's rights. In October 2014, Mauricio Funes publicly confirmed that he and Pignato had separated. In July 2015, Secretary Vanda Pignato announced that she had been diagnosed with cancer. She took a temporary leave of absence from the Department of Social Inclusion to undergo treatment for the disease. On May 12, 2017 Mr. Joao Santana, a Brazilian marketing consultant reveleaded under oath the money applied to Mr. Mauricio Funes first presidential campaign was financed by Brazilian company Odebrecht with dirt money, the command to Odebrecht to give money to Mr. Funes campaign committee came from former Brazilian President, Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva. A Warrant has been issued for Vanda Pignato arrest. This was decided on the afternoon of Monday, June 12, 2018 by the Fifth Peace Court of San Salvador. Pignato is part of the case against former President Mauricio Funes for the crimes of embezzlement, and money and asset laundering. Jorge Cortez, head of the Financial Unit of the Attorney General of the Republic (FGR), explained that they had requested that Pignato only pay a bond to be processed in freedom as a consideration for her health condition. However, the judge decided to issue a warrant for her arrest since he believes Mrs. Pignato poses a flight risk.

J. Pesce and starring Sam Elliott, Craig Sheffer and Linda Fiorentino. It was originally shown on the TNT cable TV network. Plot On a stagecoach in the old West, Marshall Bill Speakes (Sam Elliott) is escorting his prisoner Sarah O'Rourke (Linda Fiorentino) to her hanging. Also in the stage are Jack Cooper (Craig Sheffer), Mamie Hollister (Robin Westphal), and her husband Zeb Hollister (John Furlong). The stage is attacked by three highwaymen (Boots Southerland, Daniel O'Haco, and Joey Hamlin). The stage runs over one, but the driver is killed by the leader and the stage takes off. The Marshall handcuffs Sarah to the stage and gains control of it. One of the bandits climbs onto the back. Sarah grabs his gun and she and the Marshall shoot him. The Marshall finally shoots kills the leader. Sarah then surprises the Marshall and takes his gun. The strongbox is opened and Sarah prepares to take off with the cash, but Jack wrestles her gun away and runs off with the cash himself. Jack heads to a nearby town and takes a hooker up to his room. Some time later, Sarah drops by and gets the drop on him. She escorts him to the lobby to get the money from the safe, but they are both surprised by the Marshall and Mr. Hollister. In the shootout, they both escape. Jack talks Sarah into a scheme to rob a bank. They get some cash from a poker game after Sarah shoots most of the other players. Meanwhile, the Marshall gathers a posse and heads after them. The posse catches up to them in another town. During a shootout, Jack is wounded and is rescued by Sarah. They ride off. Hollister has been shot and is acting incoherently, so the Marshall kills him, showing his dark side. Jack and Sarah get chummy. She reveals that the person she was to be hanged for killing was actually the Marshall's son, who had beaten her. They travel to the ranch of Jack's brother, Walter (Frank Whaley). Jack and Sarah fight, and she takes off but is captured by the posse and taken to town for hanging. Walter spots her there and tells Jack. They come up with a plan to rescue her. Meanwhile, the Marshall shows more of his bad side by mentally torturing Sarah in her cell. Jack goes to town and gets captured intentionally. He is put into the jail with Sarah. Using some chemicals given to him by Walter, he breaks out of his cell and he and Sarah take off. They hide in a large crate in the shipping office. Walter picks up the crate the next day and gets them back to the ranch. While Jack and Sarah are out, the posse comes to the ranch and starts to torture Walter. Jack breaks in and shoots some of the posse. In an involved shootout, all of the posse except the Marshall are killed. The Marshall kills Walter, then wounds Jack. Sarah distracts the Marshall and Jack shoots and kills him. Jack and Sarah ride off.

He is a professor of Psychology at Stanford University, member of the Stanford Neuroscience Institute and director of the Stanford Center for Reproducible Neuroscience. Education and academic career Poldrack received his bachelor's degree in Psychology from Baylor University in 1989, and his PhD in experimental psychology from the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign in 1995, working with Neal J. Cohen. From 1995 to 1999, he was a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University, working with John Gabrieli. Prior to his appointment at Stanford in 2014, he held faculty positions at Harvard Medical School, UCLA, and the University of Texas at Austin. Scientific career=Learning and memory= Poldrack‚Äôs earliest work studied the brain systems involved in nondeclarative memory. His dissertation work examined the relation between stimulus-specific learning and general skill in a motor skill learning task. His first neuroimaging paper demonstrated changes in brain activity associated with learning of mirror-reading skill, showing that it was associated with a shift from activity in parietal regions toward activation in inferior temporal regions. He later showed that learning of classification learning was associated with a tradeoff between activity in the basal ganglia and medial temporal lobe, and proposed that this reflected a competition between declarative and nondeclarative memory systems in learning. In 2006, his group published work showing that this tradeoff between systems is modulated by dual-task interference =Executive function= Poldrack‚Äôs group has also studied the brain systems involved in the inhibition of motor responses. With Adam Aron, Poldrack published two papers that established the role of a circuit involving right prefrontal cortex and the subthalamic nucleus in the inhibition of motor responses. They subsequently showed that it was possible to predict individual differences in inhibitory behavior from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data using high-dimensional regression machines. =Decision making= In 2007, Poldrack and colleagues demonstrated that brain activity during decisions under risk exhibited the pattern of gain- and loss-responsiveness predicted by prospect theory. In subsequent work, they found that risky decisions in the Balloon Analog Risk Task could be predicted from fMRI data, and that these decisions were related to a balance of activity between large-scale brain systems involved in value processing and cognitive control respectively. =Reverse inference= In 2006, Poldrack published a paper in Trends in Cognitive Sciences that criticized the field for the use of ‚Äúreverse inference‚Äù, in which the presence of activation in a brain region is used to infer the engagement of a specific psychological process. Using a Bayesian analysis, he showed that this form of inference generally provides weak evidence in favor of specific psychological processes. His lab subsequently applied machine learning methods to fMRI data, demonstrating that it is possible to accurately infer mental states in a way that generalizes across individuals. Poldrack has also been engaged in criticizing the unwarranted use of reverse inference in the media. In 2007 he was part of a group of researchers who published a letter in the New York Times that criticized the use of reverse inference in regard to the US Presidential election.\\"Politics and the Brain\\", Letter to the New York Times, published November 14, 2007. https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/14/opinion/lweb14brain.html In 2010 he led a group of 45 researchers who published a letter in the New York Times criticizing the use of reverse inference in an Op-Editorial on neuromarketing.\\"The iPhone and the Brain\\", Letters to the New York Times, published October 4, 2011. https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/05/opinion/the- iphone-and-the-brain.html =Neuroinformatics and data sharing= Poldrack‚Äôs group has developed a formal ontology for cognitive neuroscience, known as the Cognitive Atlas. In 2009, Poldrack established the OpenfMRI project(later rebranded as OpenNeuro) which openly shares complete raw fMRI datasets. He has collaborated with Tal Yarkoni on the development of Neurosynth, an online meta-analytic tool for the neuroimaging literature. In 2014 he established the Stanford Center for Reproducible Neuroscience,https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/where-science-as-a-service-and- supercomputing-meet which develops tools for reproducible data analysis including fMRIPREP and MRIQC. =MyConnectome Project= In 2012, Poldrack undertook a project to collect brain imaging, behavior, and biological data on himself for an extended period of time. Called the MyConnectome Project, this study lasted 18 months, during which Poldrack was scanned with magnetic resonance imaging more than 100 times.http://discovermagazine.com/2016/oct/a-mind-in- timehttps://www.technologyreview.com/s/514886/the-quantified-brain-of-a-self- tracking-neuroscientist/ Analyses of these data showed that brain connectivity changed over this long period of time within specific brain networks, and also showed that the nature of variability over time within an individual is qualitatively different from variability across individuals. This entire dataset was made openly available to the public for further analysis = Science of Behavior Change = Poldrack is a part of the Science of Behavior Change (SOBC) network. His research uses brain imaging to understand the brain systems supporting decision making, executive control, and behavior change. Poldrack's lab also develops informatics tools to help make sense of the growing body of neuroimaging data (including the OpenNeuro and NeuroVault data sharing projects and the Cognitive Atlas ontology) as well as tools to help improve the reproducibility of neuroimaging research (including the Brain Imaging Data Structure and BIDS-Apps projects). Professional Achievements In 2009, Poldrack was elected as Chairperson of the Organization for Human Brain Mapping. He is a founding Co-Editor-in-Chief of Frontiers in Brain Imaging Methods, and has served as a member of editorial boards for Psychological Bulletin, Nature Scientific Data, Trends in Cognitive Sciences, Cerebral Cortex, Human Brain Mapping, GigaScience, SCAN (Social, Cognitive, and Affective Neuroscience), Cognitive Science, Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, and Neuroimage.

She was married to singer, producer and talent manager Ren√© Ang√©lil, and had two children with him.  Biography  Anne Ren√©e was born in Laval, Quebec, on 24 August 1950. In 1964, she released her debut song under her real name, Manon Kirouac. She had some success on discs and pursued her career in music until 1968, when she decided to complete her education. Later she started using her pop song name Anne Renee. Her friend, singer Johnny Farago, introduced her to producer Guy Cloutier, who took her under his wing. She became one of the most popular female singers in Quebec with hits like \\"Un amour d'adolescent\\" (a translation of a Paul Anka song) and \\"On trouve l'amour\\" (by the composer Fran√ßois Bernard of SOCAN). It was around this time that she fell in love with Cloutier's partner, Ren√© Ang√©lil, whom she married in 1973, and with whom she had two children: Jean- Pierre (b. 1974) and Anne-Marie (b. 1977).

He was well known for successfully arguing for Ibrahim Hananu's innocence in the French Mandatory courts in Syria regarding Hananu's participation in the Hananu Revolt between 1919 and 1921. Biography Saqqal was born in Aleppo in 1898 to father Michel Saqqal and mother Magida Baccache. The Saqqals were an Armenian Catholic family. Saqqal graduated from the French law school in Cairo, Egypt. Thereafter, he practiced law in the Mixed Courts of Egypt before returning to Aleppo in 1919 to open his own practice. During his first defense case, he argued his case in the elaborate manner he had grown accustomed to in Egypt, but which was frowned upon by the Ottoman court system and its Syrian successors, which preferred brief defense arguments (Syria had been part of the Ottoman Empire until 1918, after which it came under an informal Arab administration before French Mandatory rule began in 1920). Saqqal was told by the judge that if he were to continue in this manner, he ought to return to Cairo. Between 1919 and 1921, a revolt against French rule had been active throughout Aleppo's western countryside and the political leader of the revolt was Ibrahim Hananu. Hananu evaded capture by the French military by escaping to Transjordan, but he was soon after extradited to the French authorities by British authorities in Transjordan. Saqqal defended Hananu during his four-day trial by the French Mandatory court in Aleppo between 15‚Äì18 March 1922. Saqqal produced for the court documents from Ankara, the capital of the Turkish state that succeeded the Ottoman Empire in Anatolia, that showed Hananu had been commanded by the Ottoman authorities to engage in war against the French in Syria. Saqqal also brought numerous Aleppine notables and religious figures to testify on Hanna's behalf, with their testimony generally painting a picture of Hananu as a patriot rather than a brigand rebel. Thus, Saqqal was able to persuade the court that Hananu had only been carrying out his military duties as an Ottoman soldier. The court acquitted Hananu on a three-two vote. His acquittal was widely celebrated in Aleppo and Syria. Saqqa later served as Minister of National Economy in the cabinet of Prime Minister Husni az-Za'im, who had overthrown President Shukri al-Quwatli in April 1949. Za'im's government lasted until Za'im was killed in August 1949. Saqqal published Za'im's memoirs, Min Dhikrayat al-Za'im Husni al-Za'im (Recollections on Colonel Husni az-Za'im) in Cairo in 1951. Following Syria's secession from the United Arab Republic, Saqqal was one of the signatories of Syria's new National Charter. He died on 27 March 1970 in his hometown, Aleppo.

She founded the Hershey School of Musical Art in Chicago.  Early years and education  Of Pennsylvania Dutch (German) ancestry, Sara Hershey was born in 1837, near Indiantown, Pennsylvania in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, the daughter of Benjamin (died 1893) and Elizabeth Hershey. Her father was a lumber and farming businessman. Her mother was Elizabeth Witmer of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. Sara had three sisters, Mary Amanda, Elizabeth and Mira. Elizabeth died in early maidenhood, at Muscatine in 1856, and Amanda died in Munich, Germany where she had gone to complete her studies, in December, 1876. Prior to going abroad she had for several years been chief accountant in her father‚Äôs office. For several years past, after completing her studies abroad, Mira has taken an active interest in the operations of the Hershey Lumber Company and has held office therein as secretary and vice- president, before becoming a Hollywood hotel proprietor and property developer. From childhood, Hershey has been musically inclined. At 14 years of age, she went to Philadelphia where she received her education and early musical training, signing in a church choir for several years. Bad training resulted in the ruin of her voice, and she turned her attention to the piano. Upon leaving Philadelphia, she went to St. Mary's Hall (now Doane Academy), Burlington, New Jersey, where she remained a year and a half, when she came West with her parents to Muscatine, Iowa, and began teaching, going East at intervals for the purpose of study. In 1867, she went to Berlin, Germany, in order to finish her musical education, and became a pupil of Professor Julius Stern, in the Stern Conservatory, studying harmony, counterpoint, score- reading and piano-playing. She took vocal instruction from Jennie Mayer. This training was followed by piano study under Theodor Kullak of the Conservatory, and vocalization from Gustav Engel. She also was a pupil under Gottfried Weiss. During her sojourn in Germany, she found time to master the German language, and to gain a wide acquaintance with the German poets and dramas of the day. After a stay of 3.5 years in Berlin, she went to Milan, Italy, where she studied singing with Professor Gerli, and visited the classes of the older Lamperti. During her stay at Milan, she devoted her entire attention to the Italian methods of opera-singing, and learned the Italian language. Having accomplished her aims in the Italian schools she went to London, England, and studied with Charlotte Sainton-Dolby, in oratorio and English singing, for a number of months. Career Sara Hershey-Eddy Upon her return to the US, she learned of the Great Chicago Fire in 1871. Changing her intention of locating in Chicago, she went to New York City, where she remained nearly two years, engaged in concert and church singing and giving instructions in music and singing at the Packer Collegiate Institute, of Brooklyn. She received offer an to take charge of the vocal department of the Pennsylvania Female College (now Chatham University), Pittsburgh, which she accepted, with a salary the largest ever paid to a woman teacher in that state. In the following year, she was induced to assume the entire control of the musical department of that institution. In August, 1875, she came to Chicago and founded the Hershey School of Musical Art, with William Smythe Babcock Matthews, which become the leading institution of its kind in the West. The Hershey Music Hall, built by her father, was erected in 1876. It soon gained a national reputation, with Clarence Eddy as its general musical director. During the existence of this institution, it was remarkably successful in departments not generally successful in American schools. A large number of organists was trained; composers, who proved the excellence of their teaching by producing works large in style and presentable in quality, were given a hearing; and a considerable number of accomplished singers went forth to give recitals of song of every national school. It was upon his own organ in Hershey Music Hall that Mr. Eddy gave his great and unprecedented series of recitals of organ music, containing no repetitions. This remarkable task occupied nearly two years, the recitals occurring every Saturday. Over 500 compositions were performed, and every national school, old or new, was represented. The closing recital, June 23, 1879, was turned into an ovation, the program consisting almost entirely of original works written expressly for the occasion. In 1879, she married Clarence Eddy. The responsibilities of such an institution, however, became too arduous, and in 1885, husband and wife retired to private teaching, with a large following of pupils. Their apartments offered a commanding view of Lake Michigan. Sara Hershey-Eddy For years, Hershey-Eddy was a prominent member of the Music Teachers' National Association, and did much to make that organization a success. At Indianapolis, June, 1887, she was elected to the Board of Examiners in the vocal department in the American College of Musicians. She contributed a number of valuable articles to musical journals. In 1893, she was made vice-president of the Woman's Musical Congress at the World's Fair in Chicago, and was one of the Examining Committee of Musical Competition, of which Theodore Thomas was the presiding officer. As a writer, she contributed to the columns of The Voice. She remarked in \\"Plea for More Singing\\": ‚ÄúEvery voice should be sufficiently cultivated to produce an agreeable quality of tone and to sing a simple solo with good enunciation and with intelligence. This should belong to any scheme of education, and singing should, to this extent, rank side by side with the common branches of education as a necessary factor of human culture. Until the study of singing is dignified to this position and accepted as educational, and is not regarded merely as an accomplishment on a par with dancing, the children of our race will be deprived of its elevating and humanizing influences. Superficial playing or singing is wrong, because it is not only useless, but injurious, inasmuch as it is a bar to the progress of music and its adoption as a means of general culture. Until the sense of hearing is developed as a faculty, until our children are taught how to listen, how to analyze and methodize what is heard, this wonderful sense will remain only a latent instead of a most potent force in musical education. Let the ear and the understanding work together and advance side by side. There is no reason why a child should not as readily distinguish tones from semitones, and thirds from fifths, as it tells a from z.‚Äù With Frederic Grant Gleason, Hershey-Eddy was a co-editor of The Musical Bulletin, published by the Hershey School of Musical Art. Published monthly, it contained articles on musical topics, programs and criticisms of performances, translations from foreign writers, reviews of new music, extracts from European journals, foreign and domestic correspondence, as well as general musical intelligence. Personal life Hershey married three times. On 1 September 1857, she married William F. Brannan. They had at least one child, a daughter, Bessie. The marriage did not last long. She married Clarence Eddy, 14 years her junior, on 1 July 1879. After her father's death in 1893, she received a large inheritance. In 1895, Hershey-Eddy retired and moved to Paris. Eddy filed for divorce from his wife in 1905, noting desertion. She married John Darlington Marsh in London in July 1908. Hershey- Eddy died in Paris in 1911.

It was designed by Andrew Baxter Leven and built from 1935 to 1937 by relief workers. It is also known as Lands Department and Townsville Public Offices. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 January 1995.  History  The Townsville Government Offices were constructed in 1935-7 as part of a Queensland Government employment scheme. The Public Works Department was responsible for the design of the buildings, the Chief Architect of the time being Andrew Baxter Leven. Townsville was proclaimed a town in 1866. It experienced its first phase of major growth when gold was discovered in the nearby town of Ravenswood in 1868. The construction of the Great Northern railway line and the development of the beef industry in the north, created modest growth in Townsville in the early twentieth century. The \\"new\\" 1885 Lands Office A \\"new\\" Lands Office was built in Townsville about 1885. However, despite repairs in the early 1930s, it was decided to move the Lands Department into a new Queensland Government building housing a number of government departments. During the 1930s Depression, Labor Premier, William Forgan Smith established a government-initiated works scheme under the Income (Unemployment Relief) Act (1930) to create employment. This involved the employment of architects, foremen, construction workers and the use of local materials for the construction of government buildings such as court houses, government offices, schools and council halls. The Townsville State Government Offices is a fine example of work undertaken through this scheme. The building was designed by the office of the Queensland Government Architect. The Chief Architect at this time was Andrew Baxter Leven. From 1910 to 1951 Leven was employed by the Queensland Government Works Department and was Chief Architect and Quantity Surveyor from 1933 to 1951. Other members of the office involved in the design DFW Roberts and HJ Parr. The ground floor of the offices was to accommodate the Labour Agent and officers of the Lands Department, and the first floor was to provide offices for staff of the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock, Department of Public Works and Workers' Dwellings, and the Machinery Inspector, Health Inspector, Land court room and visiting Ministers' room. The State Government Offices is typical of the tradition of high standards in design and construction of the Public Works Department, and one of a group of government buildings constructed by the Department influenced by a classical revival style, including the Innisfail and Mackay Court Houses and the Cairns Government Office. The State Government Offices in Townsville were designed to harmonise with the adjacent Customs House. The area around Flinders Street (East) and The Strand including Wickham Street where the State Government Offices are situated, was the site of the first settlement in Townsville. In 2016, the building has been divided into a number of separate tenancies with the upper floor of the building available for lease as professional offices. The Australian Red Cross are one of the tenants.  Description  State Government Offices, 1952 (Townsville Customs House is visible to the right) The Townsville State Government Offices is a two- storeyed brick building with basement and a hipped corrugated-iron roof. The facade of the building features two projecting end bays with round arched window and door openings. Between the bays is a two storey colonnade with open verandahs. A centrally located bi-furcated staircase emphasises the entrance. The building is decorated with classical design features including the round arched openings and prominent keystones and eaves. The balconies and verandahs are designed as a response to the Townsville climate and allow for cross- ventilation of all rooms and offices. The balcony floors are of concrete and the ground floor verandahs, entrance hall and main staircase are finished in terrazzo.  Heritage listing  Townsville State Government Offices was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 January 1995 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Townsville State Government Offices is an example of construction work undertaken under the unemployment relief scheme instigated by the State Government in the 1930s. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Townsville State Government Offices, erected in 1935-37, is significant as a good example of the work of the Queensland Works Department, influenced by a classical revival style. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The building complements the adjacent Townsville Customs House, and is harmonious in scale and form, making a significant contribution to the townscape.

Of this style the present book of verses is a good and typical example, and will not diminish the fame earned for its author by \\"A Golden Shanty.\\" In the subject of mining he has struck a lode of almost wholly new poetical material, full of incident and adventure, and thrilling with hopes fulfilled or disappointed. The writer is evidently well acquainted with mining life, and gives expression to the comic as well as the pathetic aspects of its scenes and characters. The daring rescue of entombed miners; the desolation of the deserted works haunted by the ghostly-grey old whim-horse, the regrets of one pent in a city slum for the fierce freshness of the wilder life, are few of the subjects, not unworthy of poetic treatment, and handled in a manner whose very ruggedness is appropriate.\\"\\"New Books and New Editions\\", The Town and Country Journal, 26 December 1896, p45 In their review The Australasian ranked Dyson with some of the other well-known Australian poets of the time: \\"Mr. Edward Dyson ia a welcome addition to the little band of writers who, within the last few years, have striven with no small success to found a distinctly Australian school of poetry. His \\"Rhymes from the Mines and Other Lines,\\" published by Messrs. Angus and Robertson, of Sydney, are, like the verses of Messrs. A. B.

It is also known as Molly Malone's Irish Pub. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The City of Townsville was established in 1864 as a port for rapidly developing pastoral districts in the hinterland. John Melton Black, who had pastoral runs in the Cleveland Bay area, formed a partnership with Robert Towns to secure financial backing for plans to establish a port at the mouth of Ross Creek. The port was proclaimed in October 1865 and by the end of the year the population was between 100-200 people. Townsville was proclaimed a municipality in 1866 and became the centre of substantial and continuous growth, particularly with the discovery of five major goldfields in the vicinity within six years. Wharves, stores, shops, hotels and housing were rapidly established at the new port. The land now at the corner of Wickham and Flinders Streets proved an ideal location for a hotel. Opposite the wharves, the site was first developed by Hermann de Zoet & Company as the \\"Townsville Boarding House, Cleveland Bay\\" in 1865. In December 1865 de Zoet applied for a licence for the Townsville on the same site at the corner of Flinders and Wickham Street. The original hotel was a single storey timber building of simple design incorporating two sitting rooms and four bed rooms with an awning facing both streets. In 1866 Joseph Fletcher and Bernard O'Neill purchased the property, retaining the hotel for six months before selling in December to Alexander Mollison. In March 1867 the township experienced its first cyclone, which destroyed the hotel and much of the town. Mollison rebuilt the hotel in a matter of weeks and reopened with \\"a Grand Ball\\". However, by the time he reopened the hotel he had exhausted his funds, and he died the following year. The place was purchased by James Evans, who renamed the hotel Tattersall's. This name evoked the model of sporting clubs established in Britain and their connection with horse racing, a sport which Evans was actively involved in. At this time Townsville's Tattersall's Hotel was only the second Tattersall's in Queensland, a club having been established in Adelaide Street, Brisbane in 1856. On 11 April 1868 the Cleveland Bay Express featured a tender notice for a two-storey extension to the hotel. The decision to expand was probably due to both economic and environmental factors. Recent gold discoveries had brought more mining prospectors to the town, and a better class of hotel was required to compete with the likes of the popular Criterion and Exchange hotels. A decision to construct out of brick may also have been a direct response to the cyclone the previous year. The new section in Wickham Street consisted of two, two-storeyed buildings. Both were constructed of imported brick, as brickworks were not yet established in Townsville. When travelling down Wickham Street from The Strand, the first of the two new buildings was a plain building with access from the street. The next building adjoining the 1865 timber hotel featured a balcony with a timber balustrade which incorporated simple cross braced panels and a facia with an unusual corrugated decoration. Evans incorporated an \\"American Bowling Saloon\\" to attract clients, provide entertainment and fill the void of bowling activity left after the destruction of the saloon at Hamilton's Hotel in Denham Street by the 1867 cyclone. Although Flinders Street may have been the commercial centre of the township, Wickham Street was the administrative core. By the end of the 1860s it contained the Court and Customs House, Telegraph House, Post Office and a Bank. In July 1869 Evans advertised that the hotel had received \\"extensive improvements and additions\\" and could accommodate \\"a much larger circle of patrons in 'first-class style'; [it] had 'cool' ale, spirits, porter and wines always on hand as well as 'first class stabling'\\". The Townsville economy continued to boom in the 1870s and 1880s as the gold fields created new markets for the flagging pastoral industry. New industries were developed such as sugar cane and manufacturing. Infrastructure and administration also developed as the population expanded to total 1500 in 1875. Civic and commercial works underlined Townsville's growing importance as the regional centre and port of an extensive pastoral and mineral district. Evans left Tattersall's in 1872 to supervise the building of his new Queen's Hotel on the Strand. James McGrath became the licensee of Tattersall's in 1874 beginning a long association of the extended McGrath family with the hotel. Following his death in 1878, his son Daniel McGrath became the licensee. In that year, Thomas Enright, who became a leading community figure associated with Tattersall's hotel, became the licensee of the Post Office Hotel, Townsville. Enright had come to Townsville in 1878 working with his father, Thomas Enright senior on a variety of civil infrastructure projects. He had spent the previous years from 1876 exploring the Hodgkinson region inland from Cairns (a potential goldfield) and before that had been licensee of the Commercial hotel at Sadlier's Waterholes (now Morven) from 1873‚Äì75 and the Drover's Arms, Hoganthulla 1875‚Äì77. In 1881, the original 1865 hotel was demolished. In its place, a two-storeyed timber and corrugated galvanised iron structure was added to the brick 1868 section. It featured exposed framing and lace brackets on the supporting posts of the verandah and roof. The new Tattersall's was reported to be \\"a handsome new structure\\". In April 1884 Enright transferred the license of the Post Office Hotel to JR Riley while Daniel McGrath continued to hold the license to Tattersall's. In 1885 Enright's wife tragically died and in the following year he took over the license and running of Tattersall's Hotel. Townsville continued to boom with the population growing from 1500 in 1875 to 3032 in the 1881 census. Tattersall's was centrally located in the growing township with the town's first buses operating from the hotel and continued to be the terminus of Townsville bus routes for nearly a century. During the 1880s the growth of the sugar and mineral industries encouraged the construction of rail lines from Townsville to Ayr, Charters Towers and Hughenden. There was also considerable expenditure on harbour improvements with the construction of jetties at Ross Island and improvements to the eastern breakwater. Enright remarried in 1888 to Miss Parker, the daughter of a leading Ipswich butcher and he continued to run the new Tattersall's. By 1895, Townsville had grown to the extent that Tattersall's was considered to be \\"one of the few connecting links between old and new Townsville\\". The new hotel was considered to be one of the most comfortable in the municipality accommodating fifty. The hotel had a bottle department selling directly imported liquor and made up and dispatched country orders. Enright was also the sole promoter of Nimrod's Consultations which conducted horse racing sweeps that were \\"becoming more and more popular\\". In June 1895 a right of way added to the rear of the property, presumably to enable better service access. It is unclear whether the partial demolition of the non-balconied 1868 extension occurred at this time or whether it was severely damaged during Cyclone Sigma in 1896. The remaining section was rendered from the street frontage, presenting a blank wall and the roofline totally altered. Photos taken soon after Cyclone Leonta in 1903 reveal this remnant section, detached from the main hotel. It remains the oldest identified building in Townsville. In 1899 shortly after being elected mayor, Enright replaced the 1881 two-storey timber section with a new two- storeyed brick building. W. G Smith and sons Architects produced plans for the new hotel. Smith and Hansen were contracted as the builders. The 1881 section was moved on rollers along Flinders Street to the Western corner of Blackwood Street where it became Fritz Grosskoff's Boarding House. With this structure removed, the 1868 balconied section of Tattersall's had its balcony and roof demolished. The new hotel incorporated this section into its length down Wickham Street with a uniform verandah, parapet and roof. On completion in 1899, it presented as a unified whole. The interior, finished in silky oak and cedar, was lighted by gas. The courtyard formed by the wings of the building was paved and was described as being like a conservatory. Wide verandahs and fretwork panels above the doors were designed to channel the Strand's breezes through the hotel. The iron lace pattern used on Tattersall's was also used on two other Townsville buildings, Matthew Rooney's House (now Yongala Lodge) and \\"Kardinia\\". The North Queensland Herald regard the new Tattersall's as \\"an architectural acquisition to Flinders Street\\". Enright remained as landlord for three years transferring the licence to his brother-in-law George Sullivan in 1902. During the 1930s the hotel was renamed \\"Ramages\\" while Sid Ramage was proprietor but its name reverted to Tattersall's after his departure. The exterior of the hotel has changed little with the exception of the original curved valance which was replaced with a horizontal profile during the 1960s. Around 1999, the hotel was renamed Molly Malone's Irish Pub and themed as an Irish bar and grill.  Description  Tattersall's Hotel is part of the Flinders Street East Precinct. Tattersall's Hotel is a two-storeyed rendered brick building with frontages to Flinders and Wickham Streets. A timber verandah supported on timber posts extends along the two street frontages. The verandah has a cast iron balustrade separated by double timber posts. The iron lace is of a rare design. Tattersall's Hotel is located on a prominent corner site at the intersection of Flinders and Wickham Streets, within an historic precinct which includes the Queensland Building, the former Bank of New South Wales and the former Burns Philp Building. It has a single pitched corrugated iron roof, hidden behind a parapet. Bull nosed awnings, wide verandah's and a wooden valance adorn both street frontages. The exterior of the hotel has changed little with the exception of the original curved valance which was replaced with a horizontal profile during the 1960s. A remnant section of the original valance design still exists at the angled corner of the hotel. Up to four former doorways on the footpath of the Wickham Street section have been bricked in and rendered. This is the 1868 balconied section that was incorporated into the 1899 extension. = Ground floor = There are two bars on the Flinders and Wickham Street frontages. Almost no original fabric is visible, the walls being rendered and the ceiling covered in fibro. Over the bar area air conditioning ducting has been enclosed in a lowered ceiling. A cellar exists under the bar area. It was filled with cracker dust approximately ten years ago as it had become unusable due to water penetration. A timber internal staircase rises from the Flinders Street foyer. It has a well-crafted turned timber baluster on one side and handrail height panelling against the wall. = First floor = Several guest rooms from the 1899 extension remain with enamel room numbers located on doors. Many original fanlight panels and ceiling roses are extant. = Courtyard = An open area exists to the rear of the building which originally contained a section of the 1868 extension. What appeared to have been a U -shaped courtyard has since been covered over with a 1960s single storey masonry extension.  Heritage listing  Tattersalls Hotel was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Tattersall's Hotel, erected in 1899 and incorporating an earlier 1868 brick section demonstrates the pattern of Queensland's regional history associated with the development of Townsville as a key northern port and service centre for the surrounding mining and pastoral districts. Tattersall's Hotel is associated with the Tattersall's hotel empire which had connections to numerous Queensland towns. The hotel complex, including the 1868 and 1899 buildings, demonstrates the utilitarian pattern of approach adopted in the late 19th century towards reconstructing business premises by incorporating earlier sections as the place developed. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Tattersall's Hotel features a rare pattern of cast iron balustrade particular to North Queensland. The incorporation of this design of balustrade is an important link to the other two buildings it survives upon in Townsville; the private residences of the former Rooney's House (Yolonga Lodge) and \\"Kardinia\\". The place demonstrates the incorporation of older brick structures into newer buildings during the 19th century. The 1868 sections are the oldest structures identified in Townsville. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The 1868-69 additions use of brick prior to local manufacture has the potential to reveal further information about materials and construction techniques that were adopted during the foundation years of the settlement. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Tattersall's Hotel demonstrates the principal characteristics of a two-storied 19th-century hotel through its prominent location at an intersection, its incorporation of accommodation on the first floor, public facilities on the ground floor and wide, sweeping verandahs. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Tattersall's Hotel has considerable aesthetic appeal and is located at a prominent junction of Flinders and Wickham Streets, Townsville. It is opposite the Queensland Building, the former Bank of New South Wales Building and the former Burns, Philp building and contributes to the visual and historical significance of the Flinders Street East, Wickham Street precinct.

Biography In 1977, Childers had just finished the Anarchy tour with Sex Pistols, The Clash, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers. After the tour was over, Levi Dexter met Childers at a rockabilly concert in London. Childers decided to start a fresh project. Dexter and Smutty Smiff decided to form a band together, even though Smiff had no musical training. One week later, Childers purchased a double bass for Smiff and a first gig was booked in Max's Kansas City. At about same time, when the band was accepted by local artists, musicians and photographers, Smiff became a model and a friend to photographers such as Andy Warhol, Mick Rock, Bob Gruen, Janette Beckman, and Robert Mapplethorpe . He did some runway shows for Betsey Johnson and Stephen Sprouse. He also did some photo sessions for the German and Italian editions of Vogue. About his experiences with Warhol and The Factory, Smiff talks in his upcoming book Smutty: The Only Essex Boy In Warhol's Factory. He also released one sold-out book called Kats, Tats, Cars and Creepers as well as co- writing two songs for the John Travolta movie, the General's Daughter 's soundtrack, and appeared in Where the Boys Are. He toured with The Rockats, opening for Tina Turner, The Clash, David Bowie, Kiss, The Pretenders, Bob Dylan, The Go-Go's, Ramones, Talking Heads, and Joan Jett among others. In 1979, Dexter decided to quit the band and go solo after a gig at the Whisky a Go Go. Smiff decided at the time to continue with The Rockats with Dibbs Preston as lead singer. After relocating to New York, The Rockats signed with Chris Blackwell and released the album Rockats: Live at the Ritz, with an album cover shot by Mick Rock. Introductions to the album were made by Billy Idol. Following the release of The Rockats' biggest hit Make That Move in 1984, after four months of rehab, Smiff relocated from Arizona to California and formed The Havalinas with Tim Scott McConnell. Their song \\"High Hopes\\" was covered by Bruce Springsteen, who in 2014 named his entire album High Hopes.

Although the Clinton was said to have been \\"not a very good boat.\\", it was the first steamer ever to reach Eugene, Oregon. James Clinton was destroyed in April 1861, when a large fire broke out at Linn City, Oregon in a shoreside structure near to where the vessel was moored. Construction James Clinton was built at Canemah for the Yamhill River trade by Cochran, Cassedy & Co. The boat was designed to go to Dayton and Lafayette, on the Yamhill, during most of the year. Construction of the steamer was underway by April 5, 1856. The boat was expected to be placed in operation in June 1856. The builders were captains Cassidy, John Gibson, and John Wilson Cochran (1823-1913). Clinton was launched on July 19, 1856. At that time, the only steamers operating above Willamette Falls were Enterprise and Hoosier. James Clinton was 90 feet long, exclusive of the extension over the stern, called the \\"fantail, on which the stern-wheel was mounted. The boat was driven by twin steam engines, horizontally mounted, each with bore of and stroke of . With the completion of Clinton in early October 1856, there were now five steamers operating on the Willamette above the falls. In addition to Clinton, there was the sternwheeler Enterprise and the side-wheelers Hoosier, Franklin (ex Minnie Holmes ex Fenix), and Canemah. In addition, a sixth vessel, the sidewheeler Portland was being brought up around the falls. Operations James Clinton made its trial trip on Monday, October 6, 1856. The initial officers of the boat were: John Cochran, captain; John Boston,clerk; Christian E. Sweitzer (1829-1860). , pilot; and Willam Cassedy, engineer. On November 8, 1856, Cochran, Cassady & Company, the owners of James Clinton, doing business as the Yamhill Company, placed the steamer on a schedule running to the Yamhill River from Canemah, departing every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. =First steamboat to Eugene= On March 12, 1857, James Clinton was the first steamer to reach Eugene It took the Clinton three days to reach Eugene City from Corvallis. The distance on the river between the two cities was 53 miles. The citizens of Eugene had promised to purchase $5,000 worth of stock in the Clinton if the steamer could reach the city, and it was later said that \\"it is altogether probable that Captain Cochrane would have taken her through if it had required three weeks instead of three days.\\" When the Clinton did arrive in Eugene, the entire town turned out to greet the steamer. Two of the leading investors were brothers A.A. and David McCully. They and other persons in Eugene and Harrisburg directed their considerable shipping business to the Clinton instead of hauling it overland by ox team to New Orleans Landing, which was the previous head of navigation. New Orleans or Orleans Landing was opposite of Corvallis. The stock subscriptions from the Harrisburg and Eugene investors formed the basis of the very successful People's Transportation Company, and financed a new steamer, the Surprise, built at Canemah in 1857. The McCullys invested $3,000 in the Clinton to achieve independence from steamboat lines. =Sale to James D. Miller= In 1858 James D. Miller purchased the James Clinton. =Trouble at Woodyville= Leonard White, a captain of James Clinton In 1852 or 1853, a man named Woody set up a saloon at a place on the Willamette River about two miles north of the present town of Junction City, from which Woody dispensed a type of liquor known as \\"blue ruin.\\" Woody had a large number of relatives and these and others formed a settlement which was called Woodyville, or more commonly, Woody's Landing. The Woodys declared Woody's Landing to be the head of navigation on the Willamette, and for a time this appeared to be the case. However, they were prone to pilfering the goods dropped off at the landing, and if anyone complained, they were roughed up by one or more of the large and bellicose members of the Woody family, or Woody tribe, as they came to be called. The local shippers tired of having to deal with the Woody tribe, and established a different landing, Coffman's, up a slough which cut through a part of the Woody land claim. The Woodys claimed the steamboat could not use the slough, and threatened a trespass action. They also felled small trees along the banks of the slough to impede navigation, which the Clinton had to clear out, often with the help of locals who disapproved of the Woodys. = Continued problems at Lancaster = The Woodys eventually sold out to the Mulkeys, who changed the name of the place to Lancaster. While there had been some hope for improved relations with the advent of the Mulkeys, they soon proved to be just as bad, so much so that they became known as \\"Woody Tribe No. 2.\\" On the night of Friday, January 21, 1859, the Clinton, running under command of Leonard White (1827-1870), came near to destruction at the hands of the Mulkeys who wanted to stop it from calling at landing downstream from Eugene City. The Clinton needed to reach a warehouse at Coffman's Landing, which was situated on a slough that ran on the west side of the Willamette River. The slough ran through a land claim on which another warehouse, in Lancaster was located. The Mulkeys, as the Woodys before them, were opposed to use of the slough by the Clinton to reach Coffman's Landing, and had threatened a lawsuit for trespass. On the night of January 21, the Clinton had arrived at Lancaster after dark, and waited until 10:00 p.m. for the moon to rise. Woodyville was located about two miles north of present-day Junction City While they were waiting, they heard people chopping down small trees alongside the banks of the slough. When the steamer began moving up the slough, it took two hours to clear out the obstructions. While the crew of the steamer was doing this, the people who had cut down the smaller trees, cut nearly through a large tree, and waited with lanterns for the steamer to approach. When the boat did so, the people on the bank started chopping avidly at the tree, bringing it just a few seconds too late to destroy the steamer. Leonard White recognized four of the wood choppers and knew the names of three of them. =Later operations= The McCully brothers, who had invested $3,000 into the Clinton, were instrumental in founding the People's Transportation Company in the early 1860s. They brought the James Clinton into the P.T. Company as one of its first boats. On March 10, 1860, the James Clinton continued to make regular trips to Lafayette, Oregon, running three times a week, Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from Canemah under Capt. James D. Miller. On Mondays, James Clinton left Oregon City promptly at 8:00 a.m., due to its schedule carrying the mail to Champoeg. The Clinton made connections at Oregon City with the steamer Express running on the lower river to Portland. Destruction by fire James Clinton was destroyed by fire at Linn City on the night of April 23/24, 1861. The Clinton and another steamer, Relief, having arrived in the afternoon, were moored in the boat basin upriver from the works of the Oregon Milling and Transportation Company, The fire originated in the company's warehouse and quickly spread. There was later talk that the cause might have been arson. People tried to save the two vessels, both built entirely of wood, and they were successful in the case of the Relief, which even so was still damaged. The Clinton however caught fire, burned to the water's edge, and sank. Loss to the owners of the Clinton, Capt. James D. Miller, John T. Apperson, and others, was about $6,000.

In particular, VGLMs allow for response variables outside the classical exponential family and for more than one parameter. Each parameter (not necessarily a mean) can be transformed by a link function. The VGLM framework is also large enough to naturally accommodate multiple responses; these are several independent responses each coming from a particular statistical distribution with possibly different parameter values. Vector generalized linear models are described in detail in Yee (2015). The central algorithm adopted is the iteratively reweighted least squares method, for maximum likelihood estimation of usually all the model parameters. In particular, Fisher scoring is implemented by such, which, for most models, uses the first and expected second derivatives of the log-likelihood function. Motivation GLMs essentially cover one-parameter models from the classical exponential family, and include 3 of the most important statistical regression models: the linear model, Poisson regression for counts, and logistic regression for binary responses. However, the exponential family is far too limiting for regular data analysis. For example, for counts, zero-inflation, zero-truncation and overdispersion are regularly encountered, and the makeshift adaptations made to the binomial and Poisson models in the form of quasi-binomial and quasi-Poisson can be argued as being ad hoc and unsatisfactory. But the VGLM framework readily handles models such as zero- inflated Poisson regression, zero-altered Poisson (hurdle) regression, positive-Poisson regression, and negative binomial regression. As another example, for the linear model, the variance of a normal distribution is relegated as a scale parameter and it is treated often as a nuisance parameter (if it is considered as a parameter at all). But the VGLM framework allows the variance to be modelled using covariates. As a whole, one can loosely think of VGLMs as GLMs that handle many models outside the classical exponential family and are not restricted to estimating a single mean. During estimation, rather than using weighted least squares during IRLS, one uses generalized least squares to handle the correlation between the M linear predictors. Data and notation We suppose that the response or outcome or the dependent variable(s), \\\\boldsymbol{y}=(y_1,\\\\ldots,y_{Q_1})^T, are assumed to be generated from a particular distribution. Most distributions are univariate, so that Q_1=1, and an example of Q_1=2 is the bivariate normal distribution. Sometimes we write our data as (\\\\boldsymbol{x}_{i},w_i,\\\\boldsymbol{y}_{i}) for i=1,\\\\ldots,n. Each of the n observations are considered to be independent. Then \\\\boldsymbol{y}_i = (y_{i1},\\\\ldots,y_{iQ_1})^T. The w_{i} are known positive prior weights, and often w_{i}=1. The explanatory or independent variables are written \\\\boldsymbol{x}=(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_p)^T, or when i is needed, as \\\\boldsymbol{x}_i = (x_{i1},\\\\ldots,x_{ip})^T. Usually there is an intercept, in which case x_1 = 1 or x_{i1} = 1. Actually, the VGLM framework allows for S responses, each of dimension Q_1. In the above S = 1\\\\. Hence the dimension of \\\\boldsymbol{y}_{i} is more generally Q = S \\\\times Q_1. One handles S responses by code such as \`vglm(cbind(y1, y2, y3) ~ x2 + x3, ..., data = mydata)\` for S = 3\\\\. To simplify things, most of this article has S = 1\\\\.  Model components  The VGLM usually consists of four elements: : 1. A probability density function or probability mass function from some statistical distribution which has a log-likelihood \\\\ell, first derivatives \\\\partial \\\\ell / \\\\partial \\\\theta_j and expected information matrix that can be computed. The model is required to satisfy the usual MLE regularity conditions. : 2. Linear predictors \\\\eta_j described below to model each parameter \\\\theta_j, j=1,\\\\ldots,M. : 3. Link functions g_j such that \\\\theta_j = g_j^{-1}(\\\\eta_j). : 4. Constraint matrices \\\\boldsymbol{H}_k for k=1,\\\\ldots,p, each of full column-rank and known. = Linear predictors = Each linear predictor is a quantity which incorporates information about the independent variables into the model. The symbol \\\\eta_j (Greek \\"eta\\") denotes a linear predictor and a subscript j is used to denote the jth one. It relates the jth parameter to the explanatory variables, and \\\\eta_j is expressed as linear combinations (thus, \\"linear\\") of unknown parameters \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}_j, i.e., of regression coefficients \\\\beta_{(j)k}. The jth parameter, \\\\theta_j, of the distribution depends on the independent variables, \\\\boldsymbol{x}, through : g_j( \\\\theta_j) = \\\\eta_j = \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}_j^T \\\\boldsymbol{x}. Let \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\eta} = (\\\\eta_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\eta_M)^T be the vector of all the linear predictors. (For convenience we always let \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\eta} be of dimension M). Thus all the covariates comprising \\\\boldsymbol{x} potentially affect all the parameters through the linear predictors \\\\eta_j. Later, we will allow the linear predictors to be generalized to additive predictors, which is the sum of smooth functions of each x_k and each function is estimated from the data. = Link functions = Each link function provides the relationship between a linear predictor and a parameter of the distribution. There are many commonly used link functions, and their choice can be somewhat arbitrary. It makes sense to try to match the domain of the link function to the range of the distribution's parameter value. Notice above that the g_j allows a different link function for each parameter. They have similar properties as with generalized linear models, for example, common link functions include the logit link for parameters in (0, 1), and the log link for positive parameters. The \`VGAM\` package has function \`identitylink()\` for parameters that can assume both positive and negative values. = Constraint matrices = More generally, the VGLM framework allows for any linear constraints between the regression coefficients \\\\beta_{(j)k} of each linear predictors. For example, we may want to set some to be equal to 0, or constraint some of them to be equal. We have : \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\eta} = \\\\sum_{k=1}^p \\\\, \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}^{}_{(k)} \\\\, x_{k} = \\\\sum_{k=1}^p \\\\, \\\\boldsymbol{H}_k \\\\; \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}^{*}_{(k)} \\\\, x_{k} where the \\\\boldsymbol{H}_k are the constraint matrices. Each constraint matrix is known and prespecified, and has M rows, and between 1 and M columns. The elements of constraint matrices are finite-valued, and often they are just 0 or 1. For example, the value 0 effectively omits that element while a 1 includes it. It is common for some models to have a parallelism assumption, which means that \\\\boldsymbol{H}_k = \\\\boldsymbol{1}_M for k=2,\\\\ldots,p, and for some models, for k=1 too. The special case when \\\\boldsymbol{H}_k = \\\\boldsymbol{I}_M for all k=1,\\\\ldots,p is known as trivial constraints; all the regression coefficients are estimated and are unrelated. And \\\\theta_j is known as an intercept-only parameter if the jth row of all the \\\\boldsymbol{H}_k = are equal to \\\\boldsymbol{0}^T for k=2,\\\\ldots,p, i.e., \\\\eta_j = \\\\beta_{(j)1}^{*} equals an intercept only. Intercept-only parameters are thus modelled as simply as possible, as a scalar. The unknown parameters, \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}^{*} = (\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}_{(1)}^{*T},\\\\ldots,\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}_{(p)}^{*T})^T, are typically estimated by the method of maximum likelihood. All the regression coefficients may be put into a matrix as follows: : \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\eta}_i = \\\\boldsymbol{B}^T \\\\boldsymbol{x}_i = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}^{T}_{1} \\\\, \\\\boldsymbol{x}_i \\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\ \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}^{T}_{M} \\\\, \\\\boldsymbol{x}_i \\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\left( \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}^{}_{(1)}, \\\\ldots, \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}^{}_{(p)} \\\\right) \\\\; \\\\boldsymbol{x}_i. = The xij facility = With even more generally, one can allow the value of a variable x_k to have a different value for each \\\\eta_j. For example, if each linear predictor is for a different time point then one might have a time-varying covariate. For example, in discrete choice models, one has conditional logit models, nested logit models, generalized logit models, and the like, to distinguish between certain variants and fit a multinomial logit model to, e.g., transport choices. A variable such as cost differs depending on the choice, for example, taxi is more expensive than bus, which is more expensive than walking. The \`xij\` facility of \`VGAM\` allows one to generalize \\\\eta_j(\\\\boldsymbol{x}_i) to \\\\eta_j(\\\\boldsymbol{x}_{ij}). The most general formula is : \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\eta}_i = \\\\boldsymbol{o}_i + \\\\sum_{k=1}^{p} \\\\, diag(x_{ik1},\\\\ldots,x_{ikM}) \\\\, \\\\mathbf{H}_k \\\\, \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}_{(k)}^{*}. Here the \\\\boldsymbol{o}_i is an optional offset; which translates to be a n \\\\times M matrix in practice. The \`VGAM\` package has an \`xij\` argument that allows the successive elements of the diagonal matrix to be inputted. Software Yee (2015) describes an R package implementation in the called VGAM. Currently this software fits approximately 150 models/distributions. The central modelling functions are \`vglm()\` and \`vgam()\`. The \`family\` argument is assigned a VGAM family function, e.g., \`family = negbinomial\` for negative binomial regression, \`family = poissonff\` for Poisson regression, \`family = propodds\` for the proportional odd model or cumulative logit model for ordinal categorical regression.  Fitting = Maximum likelihood = We are maximizing a log-likelihood : \\\\ell = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\\\, w_i \\\\, \\\\ell_i, where the w_i are positive and known prior weights. The maximum likelihood estimates can be found using an iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm using Fisher's scoring method, with updates of the form: : \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta^{(a+1)} = \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta^{(a)} + \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mathcal{I}}^{-1}(\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta^{(a)}) \\\\, \\\\, \\\\mathbf{u}(\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta^{(a)}), where \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mathcal{I}}(\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta^{(a)}) is the Fisher information matrix at iteration a. It is also called the expected information matrix, or EIM. = VLM = For the computation, the (small) model matrix constructed from the RHS of the formula in \`vglm()\` and the constraint matrices are combined to form a big model matrix. The IRLS is applied to this big X. This matrix is known as the VLM matrix, since the vector linear model is the underlying least squares problem being solved. A VLM is a weighted multivariate regression where the variance-covariance matrix for each row of the response matrix is not necessarily the same, and is known. (In classical multivariate regression, all the errors have the same variance-covariance matrix, and it is unknown). In particular, the VLM minimizes the weighted sum of squares : \\\\mathrm{ResSS} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\\\; w_i \\\\left{ \\\\mathbf{z}^{(a-1)}_{i} - \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\eta}^{(a-1)}_{i} \\\\right}^T \\\\mathbf{W}_{i}^{(a-1)} \\\\left{ \\\\mathbf{z}^{(a-1)}_{i} - \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\eta}^{(a-1)}_{i} \\\\right} This quantity is minimized at each IRLS iteration. The working responses (also known as pseudo-response and adjusted dependent vectors) are : \\\\mathbf{z}_i = \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\eta}_i + \\\\mathbf{W}_i^{-1} \\\\mathbf{u}_i, where the \\\\mathbf{W}_i are known as working weights or working weight matrices. They are symmetric and positive-definite. Using the EIM helps ensure that they are all positive-definite (and not just the sum of them) over much of the parameter space. In contrast, using Newton‚ÄìRaphson would mean the observed information matrices would be used, and these tend to be positive-definite in a smaller subset of the parameter space. Computationally, the Cholesky decomposition is used to invert the working weight matrices and to convert the overall generalized least squares problem into an ordinary least squares problem.  Examples = Generalized linear models = Of course, all generalized linear models are a special cases of VGLMs. But we often estimate all parameters by full maximum likelihood estimation rather than using the method of moments for the scale parameter. = Ordered categorical response = If the response variable is an ordinal measurement with M + 1 levels, then one may fit a model function of the form: : g(\\\\theta_j) = \\\\eta_j where \\\\theta_j = \\\\mathrm{Pr}(Y \\\\leq j), for j=1,\\\\ldots,M. Different links g lead to proportional odds models or ordered probit models, e.g., the \`VGAM\` family function \`cumulative(link = probit)\` assigns a probit link to the cumulative probabilities, therefore this model is also called the cumulative probit model. In general they are called cumulative link models. For categorical and multinomial distributions, the fitted values are an (M + 1)-vector of probabilities, with the property that all probabilities add up to 1. Each probability indicates the likelihood of occurrence of one of the M + 1 possible values. = Unordered categorical response = If the response variable is a nominal measurement, or the data do not satisfy the assumptions of an ordered model, then one may fit a model of the following form: : \\\\log \\\\left[ \\\\frac{Pr(Y = j)}{\\\\mathrm{Pr}(Y = M+1)} \\\\right] = \\\\eta_j, for j=1,\\\\ldots,M. The above link is sometimes called the multilogit link, and the model is called the multinomial logit model. It is common to choose the first or the last level of the response as the reference or baseline group; the above uses the last level. The \`VGAM\` family function \`multinomial()\` fits the above model, and it has an argument called \`refLevel\` that can be assigned the level used for as the reference group. =Count data= Classical GLM theory performs Poisson regression for count data. The link is typically the logarithm, which is known as the canonical link. The variance function is proportional to the mean: :\\\\operatorname{Var}(Y_{i}) = \\\\tau\\\\mu_{i},\\\\, where the dispersion parameter \\\\tau is typically fixed at exactly one. When it is not, the resulting quasi-likelihood model is often described as Poisson with overdispersion, or quasi-Poisson; then \\\\tau is commonly estimated by the method-of-moments and as such, confidence intervals for \\\\tau are difficult to obtain. In contrast, VGLMs offer a much richer set of models to handle overdispersion with respect to the Poisson, e.g., the negative binomial distribution and several variants thereof. Another count regression model is the generalized Poisson distribution. Other possible models are the zeta distribution and the Zipf distribution. Extensions=Reduced-rank vector generalized linear models= RR-VGLMs are VGLMs where a subset of the B matrix is of a lower rank. Without loss of generality, suppose that \\\\boldsymbol{x}=(\\\\boldsymbol{x}_1^T, \\\\boldsymbol{x}_2^T)^T is a partition of the covariate vector. Then the part of the B matrix corresponding to \\\\boldsymbol{x}_2 is of the form \\\\boldsymbol{A} \\\\boldsymbol{C}^T where \\\\boldsymbol{A} and \\\\boldsymbol{C} are thin matrices (i.e., with R columns), e.g., vectors if the rank R = 1\\\\. RR-VGLMs potentially offer several advantages when applied to certain models and data sets. Firstly, if M and p are large then the number of regression coefficients that are estimated by VGLMs is large (M \\\\times p). Then RR-VGLMs can reduce the number of estimated regression coefficients enormously if R is low, e.g., R = 1 or R = 2\\\\. An example of a model where this is particularly useful is the RR-multinomial logit model, also known as the stereotype model. Secondly, \\\\boldsymbol{ u} = \\\\boldsymbol{C}^T \\\\boldsymbol{x}_2 = ( u_1,\\\\ldots, u_R)^T is an R-vector of latent variables, and often these can be usefully interpreted. If R = 1 then we can write u = \\\\boldsymbol{c}^T \\\\boldsymbol{x}_2 so that the latent variable comprises loadings on the explanatory variables. It may be seen that RR-VGLMs take optimal linear combinations of the \\\\boldsymbol{x}_2 and then a VGLM is fitted to the explanatory variables (\\\\boldsymbol{x}_1, \\\\boldsymbol{ u}). Thirdly, a biplot can be produced if R' = 2 , and this allows the model to be visualized. It can be shown that RR-VGLMs are simply VGLMs where the constraint matrices for the variables in \\\\boldsymbol{x}_2 are unknown and to be estimated. It then transpires that \\\\boldsymbol{H}_k = \\\\boldsymbol{A} for such variables. RR-VGLMs can be estimated by an alternating algorithm which fixes \\\\boldsymbol{A} and estimates \\\\boldsymbol{C}, and then fixes \\\\boldsymbol{C} and estimates \\\\boldsymbol{A}, etc. In practice, some uniqueness constraints are needed for \\\\boldsymbol{A} and/or \\\\boldsymbol{C}. In \`VGAM\`, the \`rrvglm()\` function uses corner constraints by default, which means that the top R rows of \\\\boldsymbol{A} is set to \\\\boldsymbol{I}_R. RR- VGLMs were proposed in 2003.  Two to one  A special case of RR-VGLMs is when R = 1 and M = 2\\\\. This is dimension reduction from 2 parameters to 1 parameter. Then it can be shown that : \\\\theta_2 = g_2^{-1} \\\\left( t_1 + a_{21} \\\\cdot g_1(\\\\theta_1) \\\\right), where elements t_1 and a_{21} are estimated. Equivalently, : \\\\eta_2 = t_1 + a_{21} \\\\cdot \\\\eta_1. This formula provides a coupling of \\\\eta_1 and \\\\eta_2. It induces a relationship between two parameters of a model that can be useful, e.g., for modelling a mean- variance relationship. Sometimes there is some choice of link functions, therefore it offers a little flexibility when coupling the two parameters, e.g., a logit, probit, cauchit or cloglog link for parameters in the unit interval. The above formula is particularly useful for the negative binomial distribution, so that the RR-NB has variance function : \\\\operatorname{Var}(Y\\\\mid\\\\boldsymbol{x}) = \\\\mu(\\\\boldsymbol{x}) + \\\\delta_1 \\\\, \\\\mu(\\\\boldsymbol{x})^{\\\\delta_2}. This has been called the NB-P variant by some authors. The \\\\delta_1 and \\\\delta_2 are estimated, and it is also possible to obtain approximate confidence intervals for them too. Incidentally, several other useful NB variants can also be fitted, with the help of selecting the right combination of constraint matrices. For example, NB ‚àí 1, NB ‚àí 2 (\`negbinomial()\` default), NB ‚àí H; see Yee (2014) and Table 11.3 of Yee (2015).  RCIMs  The subclass of row-column interaction models (RCIMs) has also been proposed; these are a special type of RR-VGLM. RCIMs apply only to a matrix Y response and there are no explicit explanatory variables \\\\boldsymbol{x}. Instead, indicator variables for each row and column are explicitly set up, and an order-R interaction of the form \\\\boldsymbol{A} \\\\boldsymbol{C}^T is allowed. Special cases of this type of model include the Goodman RC association model and the quasi-variances methodology as implemented by the \`qvcalc\` R package. RCIMs can be defined as a RR-VGLM applied to Y with : g_1(\\\\theta_1) \\\\equiv \\\\eta_{1ij} = \\\\beta_0 + \\\\alpha_i + \\\\gamma_j + \\\\sum_{r=1}^R c_{ir} \\\\, a_{jr} . For the Goodman RC association model, we have \\\\eta_{1ij}=\\\\log \\\\mu_{ij}, so that if R = 0 then it is a Poisson regression fitted to a matrix of counts with row effects and column effects; this has a similar idea to a no-interaction two-way ANOVA model. Another example of a RCIM is if g_1 is the identity link and the parameter is the median and the model corresponds to an asymmetric Laplace distribution; then a no-interaction RCIM is similar to a technique called median polish. In \`VGAM\`, \`rcim()\` and \`grc()\` functions fit the above models. And also Yee and Hadi (2014) show that RCIMs can be used to fit unconstrained quadratic ordination models to species data; this is an example of indirect gradient analysis in ordination (a topic in statistical ecology). =Vector generalized additive models= Vector generalized additive models (VGAMs) are a major extension to VGLMs in which the linear predictor \\\\eta_j is not restricted to be linear in the covariates x_k but is the sum of smoothing functions applied to the x_k: :\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\eta}(\\\\boldsymbol{x}) = \\\\boldsymbol{H}_1 \\\\, \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}_{(1)}^{*} + \\\\boldsymbol{H}_2 \\\\, \\\\boldsymbol{f}_{(2)}^{*}(x_2) + \\\\boldsymbol{H}_3 \\\\, \\\\boldsymbol{f}_{(3)}^{*}(x_3) + \\\\cdots \\\\,! where \\\\boldsymbol{f}_{(k)}^{*}(x_k) = (f_{(1)k}^{*}(x_k),f_{(2)k}^{*}(x_k),\\\\ldots)^T. These are M additive predictors. Each smooth function f_{(j)k}^{*} is estimated from the data. Thus VGLMs are model-driven while VGAMs are data-driven. Currently, only smoothing splines are implemented in the \`VGAM\` package. For M > 1 they are actually vector splines, which estimate the component functions in f_{(j)k}^{*}(x_k) simultaneously. Of course, one could use regression splines with VGLMs. The motivation behind VGAMs is similar to that of Hastie and Tibshirani (1990) and Wood (2017). VGAMs were proposed in 1996 . Currently, work is being done to estimate VGAMs using P-splines of Eilers and Marx (1996) . This allows for several advantages over using smoothing splines and vector backfitting, such as the ability to perform automatic smoothing parameter selection easier. =Quadratic reduced-rank vector generalized linear models= These add on a quadratic in the latent variable to the RR-VGLM class. The result is a bell- shaped curve can be fitted to each response, as a function of the latent variable. For R = 2, one has bell-shaped surfaces as a function of the 2 latent variables---somewhat similar to a bivariate normal distribution. Particular applications of QRR-VGLMs can be found in ecology, in a field of multivariate analysis called ordination. As a specific rank-1 example of a QRR-VGLM, consider Poisson data with S species. The model for Species s is the Poisson regression : \\\\log\\\\,\\\\mu_s( u) = \\\\eta_s( u) = \\\\beta_{(s)1} + \\\\beta_{(s)2} \\\\, u + \\\\beta_{(s)3} \\\\, u^2 = \\\\alpha_s - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left( \\\\frac{ u -u_s}{t_s} \\\\right)^2, for s=1,\\\\ldots,S. The right-most parameterization which uses the symbols \\\\alpha_s, u_s, t_s, has particular ecological meaning, because they relate to the species abundance, optimum and tolerance respectively. For example, the tolerance is a measure of niche width, and a large value means that that species can live in a wide range of environments. In the above equation, one would need \\\\beta_{(s)3}<0 in order to obtain a bell-shaped curve. QRR-VGLMs fit Gaussian ordination models by maximum likelihood estimation, and they are an example of direct gradient analysis. The \`cqo()\` function in the \`VGAM\` package currently calls \`optim()\` to search for the optimal \\\\boldsymbol{C}, and given that, it is easy to calculate the site scores and fit a suitable generalized linear model to that. The function is named after the acronym CQO, which stands for constrained quadratic ordination: the constrained is for direct gradient analysis (there are environmental variables, and a linear combination of these is taken as the latent variable) and the quadratic is for the quadratic form in the latent variables \\\\boldsymbol{ u} on the \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\eta} scale. Unfortunately QRR- VGLMs are sensitive to outliers in both the response and explanatory variables, as well as being computationally expensive, and may give a local solution rather than a global solution. QRR-VGLMs were proposed in 2004.

The ten-book Nesth√§kchen series follows Annemarie from infancy (Nesth√§kchen and Her Dolls) to old age and grandchildren (Nesth√§kchen with White Hair).Jennifer Redmann. Nostalgia and Optimism in Else Ury's \\"Nesth√§kchen\\" Books for Young Girls in the Weimar Republic. The German Quarterly, Vol. 79, No. 4 (Fall, 2006), pp. 465-483 Volume 4 describes Anne Marie's experiences in World War I from 1914 to 1916.Nesth√§kchen and the World War in the Library of Congress catalog Plot summary \\"Original Dust Jacket, Nesth√§kchen und der Weltkrieg. Illustration by Robert Sedlacek Anne Marie's father, Dr. Braun, is a soldier and medical officer in France. Her mother is absent. Mrs. Braun was in England at the outbreak of war, visiting with her cousin Annie, who is married to an Englishman. Mrs. Braun can not go back to Germany because she missed her last opportunity for departure. Of her letters, only some get to her family. During the absence of the parents, the grandmother, the nanny Lena, and the cook Hanne care for Annemarie and her brothers. In England, Mrs. Braun is arrested as an alleged spy, after she has spoken, imprudently excited, about the success of German submarines. She is released soon afterwards. Anne Marie's brother Hans brings a foundling home. The baby, an East Prussian refugee, would likely have perished. Annemarie takes the child into the house enthusiastically and gives him the name ‚ÄúHindenburg‚Äù for Paul von Hindenburg. Finally, the noisy child is passed to the concierge couple and given the name Max. Annemarie‚Äôs patriotism goes so far that a \\"foreign concept checkout\\" is set up at home and in class. Anyone who uses a foreign word must pay five cents. In Anne Marie's class a new girl, Vera Burkhard, arrives from Czernowitz in Bukovina. Vera hardly speaks German. Spurred on by two older girls, Anne Marie holds Vera for a Polish spy, therefore an enemy, and begins to bully the girl. Anne Marie‚Äôs girlfriends Margot, Ilse and Marlene have compassion for Vera, but dare not oppose the dominant Anne Marie. Occasionally Anne Marie has doubts about the correctness of her behavior, but she does not want to admit she is wrong. Finally, the class teacher announces that Vera's father has been killed in the Carpathian battle (Gorlice‚ÄìTarn√≥w Offensive) on the German side and has therefore died a hero‚Äôs death. Although Vera is devastated and distraught, her reputation is restored and the shamed Anne Marie wants to make up for her bad behavior. Vera is now her best friend. Other important episodes: Anne Marie believes that a Thai man living in her building is a Japanese alien, an enemy, and henceforth no longer greets him. Lena, her nanny, tells her that rudeness is never patriotic. Anne Marie fears her mother is being treated badly in England. She says this to her doctor, a colleague of her father, who laughs: \\"The English don‚Äôt treat ladies badly, even when they belong to an enemy nation.\\" One evening Anne Marie prays to God, asking that he assist Germany; but she realizes that perhaps French and English children pray to the same God. She then asks God to be neutral, at least. When Annemarie does not want to learn French because it is the language of the enemy, her teacher gives her a lesson in thinking ahead: After the war, relations between peoples will need to be rebuilt, language skills are mandatory, and the Fatherland needs an educated youth. Volume 4 ends with the surprising return of Mrs. Braun from England and the hope for a victorious peace. As at the end of all volumes in the series, Anne Marie‚Äôs maturation is suggested. But in the next volume, Annemarie is the same spirited, spoiled girl. The message of the book is ambiguous. Despite her patriotic enthusiasm for Germany and occasional chauvinism (\\"You will feel the German fist\\" and similar sentiments), Ury preaches no hate. She considers war a sad event and peace a normal state. Her tone is always conciliatory. Ury strongly criticizes Anne Marie's relational aggression against Vera as unacceptable behavior and calls Anne Marie a \\"silly girl.\\" Postwar controversy Else Ury, 1915 After 1945 the new publisher removed Nesth√§kchen and the World War from the Nesth√§kachen series, because it was on the censorship list of the allied control boards. Ury was, like most German Jews, fiercely patriotic, and her descriptions of the events in and around the First World War were classified as glorifying war. Since 1945 the Nesth√§kchen series has consisted of only 9 volumes. Steven Lehrer translated Nesth√§kchen and the World War into English in 2006 and Nesth√§kchen in the Children's Sanitorium in 2014.Nesth√§kchen in the Children's Sanitorium on Google Books Ury also wrote other books and stories, primarily for girls and young women. German women still buy and read Ury's books, almost all of which are in print. Critical reception *\\"A uniquely sentimental look at World War I through the eyes of a preteen German girl. Though still immensely popular in Germany, Ury's Nesth√§kchen books are virtually unknown in the United States, an omission Lehrer looks to correct with this fine translation, complete with notes and a brief but highly informative introduction.\\" Kirkus ReviewsKirkus Review of Nesth√§kchen and the World War *\\"Ury's work has been long overlooked in German history, and Lehrer's annotated translation of this work has made an important contribution.\\" H-Net ReviewsH-Net review of Nesth√§kchen and the World War Genre The Nesth√§kchen books represent a German literary genre, the Backfischroman, a girls' novel that describes maturation and was intended for readers 12 ‚Äì 16 years old. A Backfisch (‚Äúteenage girl‚Äù, literally ‚Äúfish for frying‚Äù) is a young girl between fourteen and seventeen years of age. The Backfischroman was in fashion between 1850 and 1950. It dealt overwhelmingly with stereotypes, traditional social images of growing girls absorbing societal norms. The stories ended in marriage, with the heroine becoming a Hausfrau. Among the most successful Backfischroman authors, beside Else Ury, were Magda Trott, Emmy von Rhoden with her Der Trotzkopf and Henny Koch. Ury intended to end the Nesth√§kchen series with volume 6, Nesth√§kchen Flies From the Nest, describing Nesth√§kchen's marriage. Meidingers Jugendschriften Verlag, her Berlin publisher, was inundated with a flood of letters from Ury's young fans, begging for more Nesth√§kchen stories. After some hesitation, Ury wrote four more Nesth√§kchen volumes, and included comments about her initial doubts in an epilogue to volume 7, Nesth√§kchen and Her Chicks. Author Else Ury (November 1, 1877 in Berlin; January 13, 1943 in the Auschwitz concentration camp) was a German writer and children's book author. Her best- known character is the blonde doctor's daughter Annemarie Braun, whose life from childhood to old age is told in the ten volumes of the highly successful Nesth√§kchen series. The books, the six-part TV series Nesth√§kchen (1983), based on the first three volumes, as well as the new DVD edition (2005) caught the attention of millions of readers and viewers.Patricia M.

Recording for Fenton Records between 1966 and 1967, the group released three singles in their career. Although the group was hampered by a lyrical controversary surrounding one of their tunes, they achieved regional popularity among their teen fanbase with the original songs \\"Scream Loud\\" and \\"Shadows in the Night\\". Since the Quests' disbandment, their material has been well-documented on garage rock compilation albums and prompted surviving members to occasionally reunite. History Formed in 1964, and motivated by earning a hit record in Michigan, the Quests were composed of Grand Rapids Junior College students Bob Fritzen (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Joe Suchocki (rhythm guitar), Bob Dengate (bass guitar, vocals), Jim Nixon (keyboards) and Jerry Szyszko (drums). After practice sessions on the college grounds, the band made its debut live performance to a sold-out crowd at a local teen dance club known as the Pit. Fritzen recalled the Quests \\"were primarily seen as a group that could perform a wide variety of the recent sounds of that time, both instrumentally and vocally\\". He also credits the Beatles and the Beach Boys for the band's vocal harmonies. Shortly after the band's first few gigs at the Pit, Szyszko gave up on drumming and sold his kit to Neil Turmell, who replaced him at the position. In 1965, the Quests recorded demo tapes for Fenton Records, which consisted of three original compositions penned by Fritzen: \\"Secret Love\\", \\"Look Up to Me\\", and \\"Scream Loud\\". While the band was satisfied with their take of \\"Scream Loud\\", they were less impressed with the other two songs, and sought a way to bolster their sound. They recruited Lyle Hotchkiss, the former guitarist of the surf rock instrumental group known as the Stingrays. Almost immediately after the acquisition, the Quests entered Great Lakes Recording Studio in Sparta, Michigan, where record producer Dave Kalmbach recorded the group's debut single. The record featured Fritzen's \\"Scream Loud\\", coupled with \\"Psychic\\", an Instrumental written by Hotchkiss during his stint with the Stingrays. Upon its release in March 1966, \\"Scream Loud\\" received substantial support from Michigan-based deejays, and peaked at number two on the regional charts. Hopes were high on the band's sophomore effort as they recorded the Fritzen original \\"Shadows in the Night\\", and Hotchkiss's \\"I'm Tempted\\". Marked by its up-tempo fuzz-toned guitar melody, and Fritzen's vocal range, \\"Shadows in the Night\\" appeared to possess the potential to exceed the popularity of the Quests' debut. However, the single's B-side, \\"I'm Tempted\\", was protested by parents who were concerned with the song's alleged sexual content. The tune, along with \\"Shadows in the Night\\", was barred from further radio play within a month after its initial pressing. Nonetheless, the Quests became immensely popular among teen audiences as they performed at campuses, teen dance clubs, and at the larger venue Grand Haven Roller Rink, which seated as many as 6,000 attendees. Although the group traditionally was billed as a solo act, the Quests were Freddy Cannon's backing band as he toured Michigan, which subsequently lead to the band opening for the Supremes and Neil Diamond. For their third and final single, the band chose the Fritzen-penned \\"What Can I Do\\". Since it was prematurely pulled from radio stations, the song, \\"Shadows of Night\\", was reissued as the flip-side. Yet, despite charting at number 24 regionally, the Quests ran into more setbacks as they attempted to persuade nationally-distributing record labels. As Fritzen recalled, \\"Right when we were considering how many 45s to reorder, we received a call from Dick McKay, WLAV top DJ and station manager, who told us that a Detroit record producer passing through Grand Rapids heard the song ['What Can I Do'] on the radio and called the station to get information. He told McKay to tell us that he'd be interested in promoting the song on a large scale, but only if we immediately pulled it from the Grand Rapids airways. So, we decided not to order more records, the song quickly dropped off the charts, and, sadly, we never heard from the record producer again\\". In 1968, the Quests disbanded after its members graduated from college, and pursued other opportunities. Despite receiving little airplay, \\"Shadows in the Night\\" has since become one of the group's most beloved compositions, and appears‚Äîas does several other tunes‚Äîon compilation albums. Among them include The Chosen Few, Volume 1, Highs in the Mid-Sixties, Volume 5, Michigan Mayhem, Volume 1, Trash Box, and Scream Loud!!! The Fenton Story. Sporadically, the Quests have reunited, most notably in 2007 when surviving members recorded the album ReQUESTed: Back to the Garage. Along with five new recordings, the album features four previously-unreleased songs from the band's recording sessions between 1966 and 1967.

She was active in several social betterment societies in Chicago at the turn of the 20th century. Biography Jane Addams Collection/Swarthmore College Peace Collection. Jane Addams & Mary Rozet Smith, 1923 Mary Rozet Smith was born on 23 December 1868 in Chicago, Illinois to Sarah (n√©e Rozet) and Charles Mather Smith. She was raised in a wealthy, privileged home, the daughter of the Bradner-Smith Paper Company president. As was typical of women of her social class, she did not attend university. As a young woman, she participated in activities usual to her social standing, as part of the Social Register and traveled extensively in Europe. She became involved in Hull House in 1890, shortly after its founding, becoming one of its major financial contributors and serving as one of the trustees. Around the same time, Eleanor Sophia Smith (no relation) also joined Hull House and the women began collaborating on the development a music school. Smith provided the financial backing to create the school in 1893 and hire teachers and Eleanor became the director of the school. In 1902, she donated a Hook and Hastings pipe organ in honor of her mother to Hull House for the music school. In addition to her philanthropy at Hull House, Smith served on the executive committee of the Juvenile Protective Association of Chicago and was a contributor to the Henry Booth House, another of Chicago's settlement houses. She was also active on the advisory board of the social worker's committee of the United Charities of Chicago for the DeKoven District. Not all of her philanthropy was focused through organizations, as she was known to provide direct aid to families. In one instance, she paid for the education, including university studies of three children, for a mother who had fled from her husband. At this time period, women's groups and organizations, often provided social services because governmental structure to do so was lacking. Smith was a member of many of these types of clubs, such as the Chicago Women's Club from 1888 and the Friday Club. Smith was the companion and partner of Jane Addams for over 30 years and there has been much speculation of their life and relationship. Many of their letters were burned by Addams, but Addams referred to their relationship as a \\"marriage\\". They traveled together, co-owned a home in Maine, and were committed to each other. In 1895, after Addams had suffered from a bout with typhoid fever, she went abroad with Smith, traveling to London. There, they visited several settlement houses, including Oxford House, Browning House, Bermondsey Settlement and others. They proceeded on to Moscow and met Tolstoy, then traveled through southern Russia, into Poland and Germany, before returning to Chicago. Early in 1934, Addams had a heart attack and Smith nursed her at her home, neglecting her own illness. Smith succumbed to pneumonia, fell into a coma and then died on 22 February 1934. Addams was considered too ill to descend the stairs to attend Smith's memorial service, which she could hear from her second-floor room.

It was designed by Andrew Baxter Leven and built in 1928 by Queensland Department of Public Works. It is also known as the former Public Curator's Office. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 January 1995.  History  The State Government Offices were built in 1928 by the Queensland Department of Public Works to accommodate various departmental offices in Townsville in one central location. Townsville was proclaimed a town in 1866. It experienced its first phase of major growth when gold was discovered in the nearby town of Ravenswood in 1868. Townsville became the leading regional centre in north Queensland reflected by the construction of the State Government Offices, one of the earliest examples of purpose built offices for state government departments. The State Government Offices was constructed under the supervision of the Queensland Department of Public Works in 1928. The chief architect at the time was Andrew Baxter Leven who was employed by the Department from 1910 to 1951, also associated with the design of the building was another Works Department employee, FL Jones. The building is typical of many other government buildings of the time including the Cairns Court House, City Council building and Post Office, Cairns Post, Maryborough Government Offices Building and Maryborough City Hall. The offices were designed to accommodate a further storey above the entablature. Various State Departments were accommodated within the building including State Insurance, Public Curator, State Children and Health Departments, Titles, Stamp Duties, Lands and Marine, Machinery and Mines. Provisions were also made for the installation of a lift in the event of the third storey being built. The building was designed to ensure adequate lighting and natural ventilation.  Description  The State Government Offices in Townsville is a two storeyed masonry building with a basement. Externally, the building features a rock- faced granite plinth and cement rendered facade. The main entrance, on Flinders Street, is surmounted by a broken pediment with a crest supported on pairs of engaged square fluted columns, and is centrally located within a two storey colonnade. The ground floor storey has an ornate concrete balustrade whilst the upper storey a simple wrought iron balustrade. The corner bays of the building feature colossal order stylised ionic columns. The facade of the building is surmounted by a deep entablature, crowned by a parapet. Internally, the main entrance doors open into a vestibule from which a flight of marble steps, flanked by a pair of ionic columns, leads into the main corridor.  Heritage listing  State Government Offices was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 January 1995 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The State Government Offices (the ormer Public Curator's Office) in Townsville is one of the earliest examples of state government offices built outside Brisbane which reflects the prominence of Townsville as a major regional centre in Queensland in the 1920s. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Townsville State Government Offices, erected in 1928, is significant as a good example of a building designed by the Department of Public Works in the 1920s influenced by classical revival styles. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The building forms a prominent landmark on the corner of Flinders and Stanley Streets and contributes to the streetscape value of Flinders Street which is characterised by buildings of similar scale and form.

They are so far known only from Cretaceous formations in China. Distribution All known dictyoolithids are known from the Cretaceous of China; they have been found in Henan, Zhejiang, and Shandong, from the Liuyemiao Formation, the Zhaoying Formation, Chichengshan Formation, and the Wangshi Group. History Dictyoolithidae was first described in 1994 by the Chinese paleontologist Zhao Zikui; he named only a single oogenus, Dictyoolithus, with two oospecies: D. neixiangensis and D. hongpoensis. Because excavations were still going on at the time, however, Zhao did not provide a detailed description. After that, dictyoolithids received little attention in the scientific literature because of the rarity of their fossils. However, in 2013 Chinese paleontologists Wang Qiang, Zhao Zikui, Wang Xiaolin, Zhang Shukang, and Jiang Yan'gen discovered new remains and did a comprehensive reanalysis of the oofamily. The split Dictyoolithus into two oogenera: Dictyoolithus and Protodictyoolithus, as well as adding a new oogenus, Paradictyoolithus, based on newly discovered remains. One oospecies, \\"D.\\" gongzhulingensis, was moved to an entirely different oofamily and reclassified as an oospecies of Similifaveoloolithus.Wang Qiang, Zhao Zikui, Wang Xiaolin, Zhang Shukang, and Jiang Yan'gen. (2013) \\"New forms of dictyoolithids from the Tiantai Basin, Zhejiang Province of China and a parataxonomic revision of the dictyoolithids.\\" Vertebrata PalAsiatica 51:43‚Äì54. Description Dictyoolithid eggs are spherical or oval in shape. The outer surface is smooth or covered with low nodes. The eggshell units and pore canals are irregularly shaped.Z.-K. Zhao. (1994) \\"Dinosaur eggs in China:On the structure and evolution of eggshells.\\" In K. Carpenter, K. F. Hirsch, and J. R. Horner (eds.), Dinosaur Eggs and Babies, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. Cambridge. pp. 184‚Äì203. Dictyoolithids are unique for having a reticulate-like organization of eggshell units, which resembles the honeycomb-like structure of faveoloolithids. The eggshell units are branching,Xie, J.-F., Zhang, S.-K., Jin, X.-S., Li, D.-Q., and Zhou, L.-Q. (2016) \\"A new type of dinosaur eggs from Early Cretaceous of Gansu Province, China. \\" Vertebrata PalAsiatica, 54(1):1‚Äì10. and superimposed in multiple layers throughout the eggshell. However, in 2010, Jin et al. argued that superimposed shell units were not universal to the oofamily because they had discovered three fossil egg clutches, referred to D. hongpoensis, in Lishui, Zhejiang which lacked this characteristic. However, the identification of these eggs as dictyoolithids is disputed; they may in fact represent Faveoloolithidae, an oofamily which is similar in microstructure to Dictyoolithidae. Paleobiology It is unknown what kind of dinosaur laid dictyoolithid eggs, because they have not been associated with embryos or skeletal remains.Varricchio, D. J. (2011). A distinct dinosaur life history?. Historical Biology, 23(01), 91‚Äì107. Chicago A phylogenetic analysis in 2010, based on the remains from Lishui that possibly belong to Dictyoolithus hongpoensis, found it to be the eggs of theropods. Similarly, a cladistic analysis by Sell√©s and Galobart in 2015 found Dictyoolithus to be a theropod egg more basal than Prismatoolithidae, Elongatoolithidae, and avian eggs, so they considered it to be the eggs of a megalosauroid.Sell√©s, A. G., & Galobart, √Ä. (2015). \\"Reassessing the endemic European Upper Cretaceous dinosaur egg Cairanoolithus.\\" Historical Biology, (ahead-of-print), 1‚Äì14. =Eggshell formation= Dinosaur eggshells formed in two different ways: Spheroolithidae, Dendroolithidae, and Elongatoolithidae had eggs forming similar to those of birds, with the membrane forming before the hard, calcareous part of the shell. On the other hand, in Dictyoolithidae and Faveoloolithidae, the membrane and calcareous parts of the eggshell formed simultaneously. Parataxonomy Under the basic type and morphotype system of classification for fossil eggs, dictyoolithids are classified in an unnamed morphotype in the dinosauroid-spherulitic basic type. However, morphotypes and basic types are not normally used in modern research as they are often redundant and uninformative.Zelenitsky, D. K., and Therrien, F.

Dictyoolithidae contains three oogenera: Dictyoolithus, Paradictyoolithus, and Protodictyoolithus. Stromatoolithus has also been classified as a dictyoolithid, but due to its very brief description comparison is difficult.Jin X.S., Jackson F.D., Varricchio D.J., Y. Azuma, and He T.

There were several hundred people at the ranch during the flood, but the flood did not cause any injuries or deaths. The flood caused the destruction of several facilities on the ranch, which are planned to eventually be reconstructed. Background Throughout the summer of 2015, a great portion of the state of New Mexico was experiencing a wet season, likely because of an El Ni√±o, which included several cases of heavy rain, hail, and storms. A similar flash flood had occurred on the morning of June 27 of the same year at Philmont Scout Ranch, a Scouting reserve near Cimarron, New Mexico. There had also been street and highway flash floods in various parts of New Mexico throughout that summer. The National Weather Service claimed that there had not been any floods in the Ghost Ranch area before the 2015 flood of this extremity in their records. Course of events A large storm with heavy rain occurred at Ghost Ranch on 7 July 2015. That evening, arroyos in the area had overflowed, causing a flash flood, with waters up to 27 feet at the highest, to sweep through a large portion of the property. People at the ranch were soon evacuated onto higher grounds, and the evacuation was successful; none were injured or killed. The flood destroyed several buildings at the ranch, eroded two trails, and caused boulders to tumble down from the mesas. Some claimed that the flood ended 30 to 45 minutes later. Aftermath A short time after the flash flood ended, a double rainbow appeared over the property. Debra Hepler, the executive director of Ghost Ranch, described the rainbow as \\"the promise of God‚Äôs love and hope times two,\\" as no injuries or deaths resulted from the flood. The specific facilities that were destroyed were the Fiber Arts Studio, a ropes course area, an equipment shed, an aqueduct, Pot Hollow, Short House, and Pole Barn. Activities in those facilities were temporarily moved to other facilities on the property in order to await possible reconstruction. Some parts of the Box Canyon trail as well as the entire Matrimonial Mesa trail at the ranch were also inaccessible due to the aftermath of the flood. Some victims received counseling due to posttraumatic stress. The expenses of the flood were mostly covered by flood insurance. However, the ranch received a deductible of $100,000. Ghost Ranch and its parent organization, Presbyterian Church (USA), held several fundraisers throughout the year to meet their deductible and to fund for the reconstruction of facilities that were destroyed. In popular culture Shortly after the flood, Ghost Ranch published a short poem called \\"The Flash Flood\\" that was inspired by the flood. The poem was written by a participant in the ranch's Weave & Wonder program who helped with evacuation during the flood.

It was built in 1887 by Denis Kelleher. It is also known as Australian Meat Industry Employees Union (Queensland Branch). It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The former Bank of New South Wales Building was built for the Bank of New South Wales in 1887. It was third building which the bank had constructed. Built by Townsville builder Denis Kelleher at a cost of , the building was probably designed by Sydney architect John Smedley, with construction supervised by architect WM Eyre of the Townsville firm of Eyre and Munro and Brisbane architect FDG Stanley. The Bank of New South Wales was the second banking company to be established in Townsville. The Australian Joint Stock Bank opened on 19 February 1866 and the Bank of New South Wales on 20 March 1866. The Bank of New South Wales was founded in 1817 in Sydney, New South Wales. In 1851 Robert Towns, a Sydney businessman, became a shareholder. During the early 1860s Towns formed a business partnership with John Melton Black in his North Queensland properties and investment speculations, including the establishment of a port on Cleveland Bay. Keen to protect his investment in the new settlement at the port and to encourage the expansion of the Bank of New South Wales into North Queensland, Towns facilitated the establishment of a branch of the bank in Townsville within a year of settlement. The first branch building, leased from Towns and Black, was located in Flinders Street East near the site of the present building, but the managers and staff soon complained that the building was hot and plagued by mosquitoes from Ross Creek. A decision was made to move after Queensland Bank Inspector, Alexander Archer, reported that the bank and its records were unsafe located amongst a group of wooden buildings. Bank of New South Wales, Townsville, ca. 1873 (probably on the site of the Townsville Customs House) The second bank building and a manager's residence were constructed in 1869 on the corner of Wickham Street and The Strand on the present Townsville Customs House site. While these premises were well placed for the sea breezes, the building was again deemed unsuitable because of the distance from the centre of town and the difficulty of access via Wickham Street. By August 1875 the Bank of New South Wales had purchased a new site closer to the centre of town while still taking advantage of the sea breezes. However, the block on the corner of Flinders and Wickham Streets remained undeveloped for a further twelve years, despite Brisbane architect James Cowlishaw calling tenders on 8 January 1883 for the erection of banking premises at Townsville for the Bank of New South Wales. During the 1860s, Cowlishaw had supervised the construction of the Brisbane branch of the Bank of NSW for Sydney architect GA Mansfield, and was also involved in the construction of branches in Bowen and Rockhampton. It is not certain whether the 1883 tender for a new bank building in Townsville was for a building designed by Cowlishaw, or another design by Mansfield to be supervised by Cowlishaw. However, newspaper reports of 1887 suggest that, either way, the 1883 design for a Bank of New South Wales in Townsville was not constructed. By October 1887 however, the Townsville Herald noted that FDG Stanley, architect for three buildings being erected in Townsville including the Bank of NSW, inspected these with his local representative Mr WM Eyre who was supervising their construction. Three months later on 24 December 1887, the same newspaper congratulated the architect Mr Smedley of Sydney for his design of the newly completed Bank of New South Wales building. This suggests Smedley was Mansfield's successor as the bank's design architect in Sydney, and Eyre was the local supervising architect with Stanley his senior partner. Bank of New South Wales (right), Townsville, circa 1888 The new premises included the banking chamber, manager and accountant's offices, strong rooms and ablution facilities. The manager's residence included nine private rooms, kitchen, bathroom linen press and pantry. Included in the complex were stables, a coach house and a messenger's room. In 1925 Townsville architect Walter Hunt supervised alterations to the building including the installation of the pressed metal ceiling in the banking chamber. The work was carried out by contractor J Hillman. On 17 November 1931 the Bank of Commerce amalgamated with the Bank of New South Wales. In Townsville the combined businesses operated from the Flinders St/Wickham Street offices until 12 January 1935 when the main office of the bank moved to new premises at the corner of Flinders and Stokes Streets. The former premises became known as the East Flinders Street Branch of the Bank of New South Wales, with the branch operating from the building until it was sold. Historical Services Section of the Westpac Banking Corporation provided information that the property was sold in 1940 for but titles information indicates that the building was not sold until 26 February 1941 when the Queensland branch of the Australian Meat Industry Employees Union (AMIEU) purchased it. With the threat of invasion of Australia by Japan during the early years of WWII, Townsville was selected as the supply base for the allied forces in the south west Pacific. By 1941 many buildings in the city had been requisitioned including the former Bank of New South Wales from the AMIEU. A detachment of Area Signals personnel established a telegraph, switchboard and dispatch rider service in the building prior to February 1942. For a short time after the attack on Pearl Harbour, Col North, Commander of the Townsville area, established his headquarters in the building along with the Signals Corp. During this period PMG style switchboards were installed and the communication centre connected to service units being established throughout the region. Telegraph facilities in the building were linked to Charters Towers and to units further west as well as to Victoria Barracks, Brisbane. Part of the first floor was also used as living quarters for the Area Signals Officer and Operations Officer. During this period, a concrete bunker was constructed at the rear of the property to house a cypher group who worked to decode Japanese messages. Pigeon lofts were also built in the yard to supply ships and aircraft with carrier pigeons. Towards the end of 1942 or early 1943, the switch installation became a security monitor of all telephone calls, both civil and military, emanating from North Queensland. About twenty AWAs manned the switch which was connected to the Security Monitoring Centre at Stuart, south of Townsville. The monitoring unit remained in the building until the end of the war. The AMIEU, located in Denham Street during the war, did not move into this building until about 1948. For the next three decades the AMIEU building became a bastion of the Labor movement in Townsville and North Queensland, with the building and surrounding area becoming a focus for workers seeking permits to work at the Ross River Meatworks, seeking social security in the Queensland Building diagonally opposite, and visiting the Tattersalls Hotel, across Wickham Street which was a favourite recreation venue for all those who lived and worked in the area. From the late 1940s until the early 1970s, the building was a hive of activity and the centre of labour issues for North Queensland. During this period. apart from the AMIEU, the Trades and Labour Council and the Seamen's Union operated at various times from offices on the first floor, and later the Communist Party had an office on the Wickham Street verandah. The Seamen's Union, miners unions, the Trades and Labour Council and affiliated unions, and particularly the Communist Party were involved in the 1948 Railway Strike; a strike which highlighted the conflict between the unions and the Labor Party and a conflict which was to split the party a few years later. The Seamen's Union and various mining and craft unions played active roles in this conflict with the Queensland Government and the industrial court over wage fixing measures introduced by the court in 1939. This conflict was to raise questions of fundamental importance to a democratic society, such as the extent of civil liberties, the use of violence, and the distortion of truth. The labour organisations in this building were also involved in the Mount Isa Strike of 1964/65 when the Qld Trades and Labour Council, representing unionists at the mine, came into conflict with Mount Isa Mines management over bonus payments. The Communist Party was also involved to a lesser degree through union officials and members who were members of the Communist Party. From 1 January 1954 Remington Rand Charters Pty Ltd leased most of the ground floor and part of the first floor of the building. They had a showroom of typewriters and business machines in the banking chamber, a workshop at the rear, and accounting branch offices upstairs connected by a stairs to the banking chamber. A partition in the corridor divided them from the other tenants. Remington Rand vacated the building early in the 1970s, then for several years ex-employees continued to work from the building. The ground floor has remained vacant since these workshops closed in the late 1970s. About 1962-3, the toilets on the first floor were altered to divide the single male toilet into male and female toilets. This became necessary after the introduction of a Federal award which, after some 60 years, again allowed women to work at the meatworks, and so women would be coming to the union offices in the building for their work tickets. There were also apparently substantial wrought iron gates in the Flinders Street fence and at the Wickham Street entrance, which have all been removed. In 1995, Townsville celebrate VP50 (the 50th anniversary of victory in the Pacific). A small ceremony was held in the building and a plaque presented recognising the service of the men and women of the Royal Australian Corps of Signals here during WWII. The building has housed Flynns Irish Bar since 2001.  Description  The former Bank of New South Wales building is a two-storeyed stuccoed masonry structure on the corner of Flinders Street East and Wickham Street, Townsville. With the Tattersalls Hotel, the Queensland Building and the Burns Philp Building, it forms a group of late-19th century commercial buildings on the four corners of this intersection. Flinders Street East also retains many other late-19th century commercial masonry buildings. The principle facades of the Bank of NSW building are set on the street alignments of Flinders and Wickham Streets, and joined by a curved bay at the street corner. The facades are asymmetrical, and are divided by pilasters and by a horizontal moulded string course between the levels. In each bay are sets of windows, mostly double hung but some louvres and fixed lights to the curved bay at the corner, all with external moulded architraves. The simple squared parapet has a moulded and bracketed cornice above the windows, and a higher decorative parapet with \\"Bank of NSW\\" in relief above the main Flinders Street entrance. This entrance is emphasised by moulded pilasters to either side, decorative plasterwork and a segmented arch over the doorway. Behind the parapet is a hipped roof with moulded chimneys and ventilators. The facades not facing the street have little decoration, apart from the two-storeyed verandah to the north-eastern end of the building. The upper level of the verandah, now enclosed with louvres and fibro, has segmental arched openings and cast iron balustrade, and the lower level has moulded semi-circular archways infilled with timber and masonry. Through the Flinders Street entry doors is a decorative timber vestibule, with timber and glass panelled walls and doors, which leads to the former banking chamber. The former chamber features highly decorative pressed metal ceilings, moulded architraves and dados, and two central decorative cast iron columns. It also has a concrete safe which retains its safe door and some timber shelving, and a curious window opening to the stair landing reputedly for managers to supervise their staff from above. From Wickham Street is a second entrance lobby, and vestibule with tessellated tiles. The timber stair features substantial newels, twisted balusters, and boarding to the underside. From the mid landing is the window opening to the former chamber, and a doorway to a small room and stair to the exterior. The remainder of the ground floor includes several former offices between the chamber and the stair, and a series of small service rooms to the rear. Projecting from the north-western corner of the building is a single-storey wing, with three small former services rooms opening onto a common verandah. This wing has details consistent with the two-storey part of the building. The First Floor has a central corridor with rooms opening to either side. The corridor is divided by a pedimented and panelled partition with a pair of glazed French doors, and by an adjacent fibro partition. The first floor interior features moulded timber skirtings and architraves, some panelled doors with toplights, some double hung windows, and decorative metal ceilings and cornices. At the top of the main stair is a hall, divided by a square arch with panelled architraves, and by a fibro partition with a small hatch. To the north-eastern end of this level is a verandah enclosed with louvres and fibro sheet, but with the cast iron balustrade still visible from the exterior. At the north-western corner of the site is a rectangular concrete building, mostly covered with vines and other vegetation. It is a single room, with access from a covered entrance porch. To the western end of the site is the garage, reputedly the former stables, which is constructed of brick with a corrugated iron skillion roof, double-hung windows and boarded doors. Access to the western yard is through a rendered masonry fence on the Flinders Street alignment. Along the north- eastern boundary is a face brick fence, with a curved coping, engaged piers and recessed panels.  Heritage listing  The former Bank of New South Wales building was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Built and occupied by the Bank of New South Wales from 1887-1935, the building is associated with the establishment of the presence of the bank in Townsville and the growth of Townsville as a major port in North Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. It is typical of bank buildings of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, with a ground floor plan banking chamber and a second floor residence for the manager. The interior of the building is substantially unaltered since WWII. It is of extremely high quality in its design, detailing and finishes. It is one of the few intact ground floor commercial interiors of all the historical buildings of Flinders Street East. The upper level retains its layout as a manager's residence, and includes a white marble fireplace and timber joinery. The building was probably designed by Sydney architect John Smedley, and constructed by Townsville builder Denis Kelleher under the supervision of Townsville architect WM Eyre and his partner FDG Stanley of Brisbane. Eyre's firm, Eyre and Munro, were later responsible for other Bank of NSW branches including Georgetown, Winton, Cairns and Charters Towers. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The exterior of the Former Bank of New South Wales remains remarkably intact. The street facades form a major contribution to the streetscape of the Flinders Street East area, which retains many historical commercial buildings. The facade of the building along Wickham Street also contributes to the linking of this area with the historical government precinct of lower Melton Hill. The intersection of Flinders and Wickham Street has a prominent historical building on each of its four corners. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The building is associated with the Royal Australian Corps of Signals who occupied it between 1941-1948. The announcement of the end of WWII first reached North Queensland through this facility. Purchased by the AMIEU in 1941, and occupied by them in 1948, the building is significant for its long association with the Union, over 50 years, and the substantial role that the Union played, in connection with other organisations such as the Ross River Meatworks, in the social and economic framework of Townsville. The building is associated with a number of other Unions, with offices being occupied at various times by the Seamen's Union, the Communist Party and the Queensland Trades and Labour Council (Townsville Branch). Whilst in this building, these organisations were involved in several industrial disputes, including the Mount Isa Mines Strike of 1964-5, in which the Trades and Labour Council played a key role.

It is one of twenty Yoga Upanishads in the four Vedas, and is attached to the Atharvaveda. The text is primarily focussed on Yoga techniques, and is among the most detailed in the Upanishadic corpus of texts dedicated to Yoga. It describes ten Yamas (ethical don'ts, restraints), ten Niyamas (ethical to do list, observances) and eight Asanas (postures), along with three Pranayamas, five types of Pratyaharas, five kinds of Dharana, two types of Dhyana and one Samadhi. History Gavin Flood dates the text to around 100 BCE to 300 CE. Roy Eugene Davis suggests Shandilya Upanishad probably pre-dates Patanjali's Yogasutras,Roy Eugene Davis (1976), Yoga Dar≈õana: The Philosophy and Light of Yoga, CSA Press, , page 110 while Georg Feuerstein suggests the text probably post-dates the Yogasutras.Georg Feuerstein (1990), Encyclopedia Dictionary of Yoga, Shambala, , page 418 Thomas McEvilley states that the chronology of the text is uncertain, but it was probably composed around the time Dhyanabindu Upanishad and before Hatha Yoga Pradipka, Kaulajnananirnaya and Shiva Samhita.Thomas McEvilley (2002), The Roots of Tantra (Editors: Katherine Harper, Robert L Brown), State University of New York Press, , page 95 Some historical manuscripts of this Upanishad are titled as ≈öƒÅ·πá·∏çilyopani·π£ad (‡§∂‡§æ‡§£‡•ç‡§°‡§ø‡§≤‡•ç‡§Ø‡•ã‡§™‡§®‡§ø‡§∑‡§¶‡•ç).Vedic Literature, Volume 1, , Government of Tamil Nadu, Madras, India, pages 562‚Äì563 It is listed at number 58 in the serial order of the Muktika enumerated by Rama to Hanuman in the modern era anthology of 108 Upanishads. It is also known as the Shandilya Yoga Sutras. According to Alain Dani√©lou this Upanishad is one of the three Upanishads in the genre of the Hatha yoga; the others are the Darshana Upanishad and the Yoga-kundalini Upanishad. Contents The Shandilya Upanishad is structured as three chapters with many sections in each chapter. The first chapter of the text deals with Ashtanga Yoga. It contains eleven sections. # Yama # Niyama # Asana # Pranayama : Nadis, Vayus and Kundalini # Pranayama: Purification of Nadis # Pranayama with Pranava # Pranayama: Purification of Susumna and others # Pratyahara # Dharana # Dhyana # Samadhi The other Chapters have a single section each. The Second chapter is comparatively a smaller one and expounds the Brahma Vidya. The Third Chapter talks about the nature and forms of Brahman: Sakala Brahman, Niskala Brahman and Sakala-Niskala Brahman. Raman states that the first chapter is one of the most detailed Upanishadic treatises on various types of Yoga. The last two chapters integrate the Vedanta philosophy, particularly the \\"nondual Nirguna Brahman as the ultimate self\\" concept of Hinduism, and asserts that there is oneness of Atman in all living beings, that everything is Brahman. =Yoga practice= The Yoga techniques-related chapter 1, which is the largest part of this Upanishad, begins by asserting that to be an accomplished Yogin, one must possess self- restraint, introspectively delight in truth and in virtue towards self and towards others. A successful Yogin is one who has conquered anger and is proficient in Yoga theory and practice. Yoga is best done in a peaceful pleasant place, states the Upanishad, such as near river banks or water bodies, temple, garden abounding with fruits, water falls, a place of silence or where Vedic hymns are being recited, frequented by fellow yoga practitioners and such, and there the Yogi should find a level place. After settling into his posture, he should do breath exercises to cleanse his body, then meditate, states the text. The Upanishad elaborates on eight-fold or Ashtanga Yoga, without citing Patanjali. The Upanishad defines each Yamas and each Niyamas. For example, Ahimsa (virtue of non-violence) states the text is the Yamas of \\"not causing pain to any living being at any time either mentally, vocally, or physically\\". Section 1.3 of the text describes eight Asanas, which includes Svastikasana, Gomukhasana, Padmasana, Virasana, Simhasana, Bhadrasana, Muktasana and Mayurasana. The Yogi who has mastered all the Yamas, the Niyamas and an Asana, states the Upanishad, should proceed to the Pranayama to help cleanse the inner body. The text is notable in repeatedly reminding the importance of ethical virtues in a Yogi, virtues such as truthfulness, non-anger, temperance, proper eating habits, proper conduct and others, as it transitions from one stage of Yoga to next. After reminding the ethical mandates, the Upanishad describes three types of Pranayama, namely Ujjayi, Sitkara and Sitala. The text is one of the four Upanishads which includes a discussion of Kundalini chakras from Yoga perspective, the other three being Darshana Upanishad, the Yogachudamani Upanishad, and the Yogashikha Upanishad. However, the ideas in the four texts show an acceptance of a diversity of views; for example, this text asserts that Manipura Chakra has 12 petals instead of 10 in the other texts. Section 1.8 of Shandilya presents five kinds of Pratyahara, namely the ability to withdraw sensory organs from the external world at will, the ability to view everything as the Atman (soul), the ability to give away fruits of one's effort, the ability to be unaffected by the presence of sensual pleasures, and finally the fifth Pratyahara being the ability to project one's attention to one of eighteen vital parts of one's own body. Section 1.9 of the Upanishad presents five kinds of Dharanas (concentration), section 1.10 presents two kinds of Dhyana (meditation), while section 1.11 describes Samadhi ‚Äì its last stage of Yoga. =Vedanta= The ultimate goal of its teachings is the realization of the nature of one's Atman and its nonduality with Brahman (ultimate reality). This is the \\"Shandilya doctrine\\", named after the Vedic sage after whom this text is titled, and who is credited in section 3.14 of the Chandogya Upanishad with the oldest known statement of the Vedanta foundation.

It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films and other television series of the franchise. The season was produced by Marvel Television in association with ABC Studios and Tall Girls Productions, with Melissa Rosenberg serving as showrunner. Krysten Ritter stars as Jones, with Rachael Taylor, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Eka Darville also returning from the first season, as well as Wil Traval and David Tennant in guest roles. They are joined by J. R. Ramirez, Terry Chen, Leah Gibson, and Janet McTeer. The second season was ordered in January 2016, with filming beginning in April 2017, back-to-back with the miniseries The Defenders. Filming concluded in September 2017. The season was released on March 8, 2018. It received mostly positive reviews from critics, who once again praised Ritter's performance and the series' female focus, but felt the season suffered from pacing issues and a lack of a compelling villain after Tennant's Kilgrave from season one. A third season of Jessica Jones was ordered on April 12, 2018.

In July 2015, Sarandos said some of the Defender series would \\"selectively have multiple seasons as they come out of the gate,\\" with series showrunner Melissa Rosenberg saying she was hopeful Jessica Jones would get an additional season before The Defenders. Rosenberg later expanded on this, saying that Marvel Television and Netflix were working out the placement of a potential second season, though \\"[i]t might not be possible from a logistical standpoint\\" to have a second season of Jessica Jones debut before The Defenders; Sarandos later confirmed this to be the case, stating that the season would air after The Defenders released in 2017. On January 17, 2016, Netflix ordered a second season of 13 episodes. Raelle Tucker joined the season as an executive producer and writer, replacing Liz Friedman from the first season, who departed the series to work on the pilot for the ABC series, Conviction. =Writing= Rosenberg and the season's writers were halfway through the writing process by August 2016, with the scripts completed by the end of October 2016. Writing during the 2016 United States presidential election, Rosenberg noted she \\"was just so \\" and that she and the writing team tried to tap \\"into the rage Hillary [Clinton] must have felt every day\\" for the characters. With The Defenders releasing before the season, Rosenberg used the miniseries as an opportunity to help \\"set up\\" elements for the season, working with The Defenders executive producers and writers Doug Petrie and Marco Ramirez to do so. Rosenberg wanted to \\"continue with [the Jessica Jones] character\\" in the season, saying, \\"She's a very damaged character, her damage goes beyond [David Tennant's] Kilgrave. There's a lot to mine from in her backstory and in her present day situation\\". Actress Krysten Ritter said that the second season would evolve from the first, and that for Jones, \\"The first season was in her head and the second season is in her heart,\\" adding that Jones \\"is in a pretty dark headspace\\" at the beginning of the season and that the season would be \\"more of an emotional thriller this time.\\" On whether Tennant could return for the second season, Rosenberg said, \\"Sure, when you have David Tennant, you want him around forever....But the show is called Jessica Jones and the story is about Jessica's arc and how does that play out in its best form?\\" It was noted that Kilgrave would be \\"hard to top\\", though, with Marvel Television head Jeph Loeb saying, \\"One of the things that's important about any Marvel show is your hero is often defined by how strong your antagonist is,\\" with Rosenberg adding that the objective for the new villain, or villains, for the season would be not to match or do what was done with Kilgrave. As Kilgrave does appear in the season, Rosenberg felt it was important to have him return to \\"be that mirror again\\" for Jones, as he is \\"such a part of her construction and her dilemma\\". Rosenberg also hoped to \\"further expand on the ensemble and on Jessica's world\\" by giving more screen time to supporting characters, noting that in the first season, \\"the trick of a show that's called Jessica Jones [is if] she's not in the scene, it's not a guarantee that scene will end up in the final picture. You have to earn secondary character stories. You have to flesh them out enough so that they can eventually carry stories of their own\\" in future seasons. She also wanted to continue to explore the relationship between Jones and Trish Walker, stating \\"That is the core relationship in the piece. It is about female friendship, it is about how friends evolve‚Äîthey're sisters, really‚Äîand it's about how they evolve and ping off each other.\\" On Jones becoming famous after her heroics in the first season, Ritter said, \\"She keeps her circle small because she doesn't want people in her life, so there's no textbook on how to deal with new popularity or new eyes on you.\\" Speaking on the social issues she hoped to tackle in the season, after covering \\"issues of choice, interracial relationships, domestic violence, [and] issues of consent\\" while also exploring \\"feminism and being a woman in this world\\" in the first, Rosenberg said, \\"I'm not quite sure yet what the social issues are that we're dealing with [in season 2]. We're just trying to find some resonance for [Jessica Jones] and a new place to push her, to give Krysten something new to play and really push the boundaries of the character.\\" After much of the first season was taken from the Alias comic book, Rosenberg wanted to continue that trend with the second season, but acknowledged that \\"the MCU is very different from the comics in terms of its mythology. In the books there were things building towards \\"Civil War\\" and all that, and here that's not the case. The nature of that is we're probably not going to be able to continue to do parallel storylines [to Alias]\\". On having Jones continue to struggle with the same issues in the second season, Loeb said, \\"The end of the [first season]‚Äîand it was one of the things that was very important when we talked about the end of the first [season]‚Äîwas that it wasn't, 'Ooh, I triumphed and now I can get in my hovercar and join the Avengers.' That wasn't the story we were interested in telling.\\" Rosenberg elaborated by comparing the Jessica Jones to her previous series Dexter, saying that she learned \\"you can advance the character, but you never want to cure the character. With Dexter, the moment he felt guilt or accepted that he was 'bad,' the show's over. He's no longer a sociopath. The equivalent for us would be if Jessica somehow recovered from the damage that had been done to her. People don't just heal\\". She added that Jones' killing of Kilgrave at the end of the first season was \\"a life changing experience\\" and something that would affect the character going forward. Rosenberg also stated that the season would be \\"about digging deeper into this chaos and peeling back those layers [of Jones' life], just going to the core of her being\\" after the first season focused on Jones' trauma and facing her abuser. =Casting= After the season was ordered, several main cast members revealed that they would return for the second season, including Ritter as Jessica Jones, Rachael Taylor as Patricia \\"Trish\\" Walker, and Carrie-Anne Moss as Jeri Hogarth. Eka Darville also reprises his role as Malcolm Ducasse. In March 2017, J. R. Ramirez was cast as Oscar Arocho, which was revealed in July after the airing of his character's death on Power. In April 2017, Janet McTeer was cast in an undisclosed role, described as someone who has \\"an enormous impact on Jessica's life.\\" She was revealed to be playing Alisa Jones, Jessica's mother, who was briefly portrayed in flashbacks by Miriam Shor in the first season. By July, Leah Gibson had also joined the cast, in the role of Inez Green. Also joining in the season is Terry Chen as Pryce Cheng. In August 2017, David Tennant was confirmed to be reprising his role as Kilgrave, appearing as a hallucination, with Wil Traval also returning as Will Simpson. Recurring characters in the season include Rebecca De Mornay reprises her role as Dorothy Walker, Kevin Chacon as Vido Arocho and Callum Keith Rennie as Karl Malus. Elden Henson and Rob Morgan reprise their roles as Foggy Nelson and Turk Barrett from previous Marvel Netflix series, respectively. =Filming= Filming began the week of April 3, 2017 in New York City, once again using the working title Violet. This followed the end of production on The Defenders in March, with Ritter having indicated in May 2016 that the season would film back-to-back with The Defenders. Filming occurred at the Long Island Aquarium and Exhibition Center. Filming for the season wrapped on September 14, 2017. Approaching the second season, Rosenberg wanted to increase the number of female directors working on the series as a further push for representation. This was a goal that \\"Marvel was completely on board with\\", and given the demand of many talented female directors at the time, the series' producers looked to book only female directors first, and approach male directors later in the pre-production phase if needed. Another member of the production suggested that the series book only female directors for the season, which Rosenberg \\"hadn't contemplated [as a] concept prior to that conversation\\". She quickly made that the goal of the production, and in October 2016, Rosenberg confirmed that all 13 episodes of the season would be directed by women. Oscar's paintings in the season were created by comic book artist David Mack, who has drawn covers for Jessica Jones comics. =Music= A soundtrack album for the season was released by Hollywood Records and Marvel Music digitally on March 16, 2018, featuring selections of the original score for the season composed by Sean Callery, as well as the original song \\"I Want Your Cray Cray\\". All music composed by Sean Callery. =Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins= The season makes several references to the events of Captain America: Civil War, including Vido Arocho's toy Captain America's shield being broken, as well as mention of the Raft prison. The season also mentions the Rand Corporation from Iron Fist. Marketing In December 2017, a teaser trailer for the season was released, along with announcing the season release date. A trailer was released on February 7, 2018. Ahead of the season releasing, Netflix revealed the episode titles and creative teams with pulp comic covers for each episode created by women artists. The artists included, in respective order for each episode: Stephanie Hans, Jen Bartel, Elizabeth Torque, Kate Niemczyk, Colleen Doran, Erica Henderson, Audrey Mox, Joyce Chin, Jenny Frison, Amy Reeder, Emanuela Lupacchino, June Brigman, and Annie Wu. The season held its red carpet premiere on March 7, 2018 at the AMC Loews Lincoln Square. Release The second season of Jessica Jones was released on March 8, 2018, to coincide with International Women's Day, on the streaming service Netflix worldwide, in Ultra HD 4K and high dynamic range. Critical response On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the season has an approval rating of 83% with an average rating of 6.97/10, based on 86 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"While Jessica Jones is a slower burn with less focus than its inaugural season, its enticing new character arc more fully details the most charismatic Defender.\\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the season a score of 70 out of 100 based on 19 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". In her review of the first five episodes of the season, Allison Keene of Collider gave the season 4 out of 5 stars. She felt \\"[t]he season really starts to kick into gear.. once we‚Äôre introduced to the central mystery: the truth behind IGH,\\" with the season getting \\"better and better as it goes along.\\" However, as with previous Marvel Netflix series, the season suffered from pacing issues, featuring \\"a minimal or non-existent score, scenes that go on for too long, and a limited number of edits that add up to everything feeling like it‚Äôs happening in real time. It‚Äôs not as bad as any other Marvel series on Netflix in this regard ‚Äî not even close ‚Äî but it‚Äôs still a problem, and one that has unbelievably still not been addressed in terms of episode count (or shorter runtimes within episodes).\\" Keene also felt the season missed a \\"driving force\\" by not having David Tennant back as Kilgrave, but was glad the season largely ignored the events of The Defenders to focus on Jones and her relationships. Awarding the season a \\"B\\", Liz Shannon Miller from IndieWire said the season's all-female directors kept \\"the show‚Äôs noir bent in place though doesn‚Äôt push too hard into the realm of art ‚Äî but the clean approach works, as does Ritter‚Äôs always grounded and believable performance.\\" She also enjoyed the Hogarth medical storyline, saying it was \\"one of the most compelling new storylines\\", despite it not connecting to the overall larger narrative through the first five episodes. For Miller, Janet McTeer was \\"the most dynamic element of these early episodes. While she has potential as a foil, there‚Äôs not enough of her to keep us hooked, not to mention the lack of the emotional hook that we had with Kilgrave in season 1.\\" Miller also felt the plot lacked direction, and agreed with Keene about the pacing issues. Digital Spys Jo Berry said in her review, \\"While the beginning of the new season lacks the focus of the first, and is missing a truly menacing bad guy for Jessica to go up against, the new additions and expanded storylines don't detract from Ritter's powerhouse performance... Pacing quibbles aside, this is a darkly enjoyable return for Jessica Jones, thanks to the strong scripts, slick direction and Ritter's gripping performance.\\" In a more mixed review, The Washington Posts David Betancourt noted the season \\"lacks shock value\\". While Ritter \\"still brings her A-game... It‚Äôs the lack of Kilgrave that at first seems to be what‚Äôs missing from season 2.\\" He did praise the supporting cast, feeling Darville \\"has a standout performance\\" as Malcolm, with his connection to the larger storyline \\"surprising and enjoyable to watch\\", and also praising Taylor, adding it \\"wouldn‚Äôt hurt to bring [Taylor] in\\" as her comics alter ego Hellcat, to help the season that \\"lags at the beginning\\". Conversely, Susana Polo from Polygon was left disappointed and bored by the early episodes, also noting the lack of compelling antagonist for the season. She said, \\"I don‚Äôt see Jessica Jones second season winning over anyone who was lukewarm about her first ‚Äî or anyone who skipped it entirely. I‚Äôm a big fan, and even I left these first five episodes wondering exactly what had happened to the series that gripped me and never let go in 2015.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Category:2018 American television seasons 02 ","title":"Jessica Jones (season 2)"},{"id":"49138046","text":"The New Castle Outlaws were an Ohio‚ÄìPennsylvania League minor league baseball team that played in 1906.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989 for having local significance in the theme of politics/government. It was nominated for being a representative example of early-20th-century civic development and of the municipal buildings common to many small Minnesotan cities. The building now houses a chiropractic clinic. Description The old Wadena Fire and City Hall is a rectangular, two-story building of red brick with concrete details. The center of the ground floor fa√ßade is dominated by a large, semicircular arch with a raised concrete keystone. This is flanked by symmetrical doors with corbeled concrete lintels topped by smaller arched windows. The second floor is topped by a dentillated false cornice, a decorative panel of bricks in a herringbone pattern, and a crenelated parapet. Many of these decorations derive from Renaissance Revival architecture. The southwest corner of the building has an open belfry with a pyramidal roof and a concrete frieze embellished with festoons. History Wadena's first combination city hall and fire station was built in 1885. Within a quarter of a century the facility was inadequate for both purposes, and city officials began planning a replacement in late 1911. Minneapolis architect Kirby T. Snyder drafted a compact design for a new multipurpose hall. Construction began on a new lot the following summer and was completed in early January 1913. The period of 1910 to 1915 saw a major construction boom in Wadena, with new public, commercial, and residential buildings appearing, plus two large new churches.

For much of the 1960s and 70s, WSAM had a top 40 CHR format at the time. \\"Sam\\" saw local competition from 1250 WKNX until the format gave way to FM radio. In 1968, \\"Sam\\" got a sister station at FM 98.1. It was originally known as WSAM-FM and its call letters were changed to WKCQ, and has had a country music format since its inception. Kenneth H. MacDonald Sr. would go on to buy stations in the Petoskey and Cadillac markets in the 1970s. He befriended WMBN founder Les Biederman, who needed to divest himself of his Petoskey properties in order to increase the power of WTCM in Traverse City. MacDonald, who vacationed in Petoskey and was familiar with the stations, purchased 1340 WMBN and 96.3 WMBN-FM (WLXT) from Biederman. MacDonald also picked up Biederman's Cadillac stations, 1240 WATT and 96.7 WLXV. Later, in 1994, MacDonald bought Charlevoix's 1270 WMKT and 105.9 WKHQ form Midwest Family Broadcasting. MacDonald expanded to the Lansing-East Lansing market in 1992 with the purchase of 1320 WILS and 101.7 WHZZ. WILS at the time had an adult standards format and later flipped to news/talk. MacDonald changed the format for WHZZ from country music to CHR and then to variety hits as 'Mike FM. The Northern Michigan stations of MacDonald were eventually spun off into a separate company called MacDonald-Garber Broadcasting in 1998, headed up by Kenneth MacDonald's daughter Patricia MacDonald. The group would later acquire WKAD, WZTC, and a cluster of stations in Colorado. Back in Saginaw, FM stations 104.1 WSAG and 97.3 WMJO were added to the MacDonald Broadcasting portfolio. WMJO of Essexville was purchased by MacDonald in 1998 from local owner- operator Geary Morrill and flipped its format form country to classic rock, and most recently to a variety hits format branded as Joe FM. WSAG was bought by MacDonald in 2005 and its City of License was changed from Pinconning to Linwood so the city of license would be within thirty miles of the main studios in Saginaw. WSAG simulcasts WSAM 1400's current soft adult contemporary format known as The Bay. Most recently in Lansing, MacDonald acquired 1180 WXLA and 96.5 WQHH in 2006. WXLA, licensed to Dimondale, was broadcasting a contemporary R&B; format at the time became a satellite-fed adult standards station following WILS's switch to talk radio. WQHH of DeWitt continued to keep its hip hop and urban contemporary format. In 2008, 1320 WILS launched its new 25,000-watt transmitter, making MacDonald the owner of Mid-Michigan's most powerful AM radio station. Both Kenneth MacDonald Senior and Junior have been inducted into the Michigan Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame. MacDonald Senior died in 1989, leaving the family business to his son Kenneth (Mac) MacDonald, Jr. and daughter Patricia (Trish) MacDonald- Garber. Archives from the MacDoanlds' broadcasting career, known as the Kenneth MacDonald Papers, have been donated to the Bentley Historical Library at the University of Michigan.

The mall opened in 1972 on U.S. Route 40 along the \\"Golden Mile\\". It was closed in April 2013, except for two anchor stores, Boscov's and Home Depot. In November 2019 it was announced that the mall would be renamed District 40 and would become an entertainment center with a movie theater, and possibly a trampoline park, video arcade, go-karts and bowling alley. History The mall opened in 1972 on U.S. Route 40 along the \\"Golden Mile\\". The mall had anchor stores JCPenney, Gentleman's Choice, Eyerly's, McCrory's, and Montgomery Ward, as well as a Hoyts cinema. The area surrounding the mall eventually intensified with low income housing, as did violent crime in the surrounding area. After a series of well-publicized events earned the mall a reputation for crime and frequent fights, mall tenants began relocating to a safer retail district across the city near the competing Francis Scott Key Mall, which opened in 1978. The Montgomery Ward store closed in 2001 due to bankruptcy and later to be replaced in 2004 by The Home Depot. The then vacant J.C.Penney was replaced with Boscov's in 2003. In 2005, Gentlemen's Choice, the last remaining original tenant, moved out. In 2006, proposals were made to redevelop the mall into a mixed use site. However, by 2009, economic issues caused by the Great Recession ended the possibility of mixed use redevelopment for the time. By 2007, the reputation for crime the mall gained increased, as a woman was attacked and beaten while exiting the Bon-Ton department store. This reputation would only grow further when the Hoyts Cinemas 10 was closed in 2008 after a man was stabbed to death inside. Because of this, Frederick residents relocated their dollars to the safer side of town, near the Francis Scott Key Mall. In November 2010, it was announced that the Bon-Ton store and their furniture gallery would be closing within the next few months. They closed in January 2011, leaving the mall without any original anchor stores. John's Hallmark, the last interior tenant, closed its doors in April 2013; however by this time it was selling merchandise out of its back door due to the closure of the mall's interior to the public in early April. At this time, it was announced that Walmart had plans to open on the site, following demolition of the mall, however these plans were cancelled in 2016. In 2014, just a year after the closure of the mall, three men were charged with burglary and trespassing after breaking into the mall by prying one of its doors. Officers went inside and arrested the three men. Their motive for breaking into the mall remains unclear. Since 2015, the land has been planned for redevelopment. In 2016, work started on a redevelopment called Frederick Towne Center. Boscov's and Home Depot will be kept and the mall in between demolished. The new site plan would include a Walmart of size 155,000-square- foot. In September of that year, however, Walmart cancelled their plans for redevelopment. Shortly afterwards, the owner of the property considered selling the mall. On November 23, 2016, there was an auction for the site between December 6 to 8 with a starting bid of $2.5 million. On February 24, 2017, the property was sold to LYNK Capital, headed by urologist Mohammed Mohiuddin. many For Lease signs can be seen around the building. A Warehouse cinemas is slated to open on the former Hoyts Cinemas side of the mall with a signed lease and the mall being cleaned up, although it has been several months since any work has been done and lease signs have reappeared on the Hoyts anchor building. =District 40= On November 11, 2019 it was officially announced that the mall was being renamed District 40 and may include tenants with business such as go-karts, a bowling alley, a video arcade, a trampoline park, and restaurants. Warehouse Cinemas would be the first tenant and was expected to open in the summer of 2020. According to the report, Home Depot, which is connected to the old mall, is technically not included in the property and Boscov's still has a lease, but no further details were disclosed about the future of the store.

Background  In 2011, the Syrian Civil War began after an uprising against president Bashar al-Assad. The rebels took over Deir ez-Zor governorate except for about half of Deir ez-Zor city which stayed in the hands of the government. However, in 2014 the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) took over all the areas formerly held by the rebels. Since that time, ISIL have tried repeatedly to take over the remaining part of Deir ez-Zor city.  The offensive = Initial assault and massacre = On 16 January 2016, ISIL militants launched an attack on Deir ez-Zor. In the initial fighting, at least 35 Syrian Arab Army soldiers and allied militia fighters were killed. The group used \\"six suicide bombers first and they tried to break into military positions but they failed,\\" according to the government. The British-based SOHR added that the group \\"carried out several assaults\\" during the day.Islamic State kills dozens in Syria's Deir al-Zor city After parts of the city were overrun by ISIL, pro-government fighters and their families were among those attacked in the neighborhoods of Baghiliya and Ayyash. The Syrian government and state media said that 250-300 people were killed, including some by beheading; the SOHR had differing numbers, reporting 135 fatalities, of which 85 were civilians and 50 soldiers. ISIL also captured an army weapons depot and seized tanks. SOHR added that ISIL kidnapped about 400 civilians from families of pro-government fighters. \\"There is genuine fear for their lives, there is a fear that the group might execute them as it has done before in other areas.\\" \\"Abu Hamza Al-Ansari‚Äù, a top ISIL commander in the province was killed during an ISIS offensive on Ayyash and Al-Bughayliyah by the 104th Airborne Brigade. ISIL forces continued to advance on areas held by the Syrian Government north west of Deir ez-Zor City, taking areas south and west of Baghiliya. = Attempted counterattack = Counter-strikes by Russian Air Force fighter jets, in support of Syrian army forces, were reported to take back the areas. Around 60 ISIL fighters were killed in airstrikes, according to the Russian defense ministry. On 19 January, ISIL launched a new offensive against government territory, taking advantage of a dust storm that all but grounded Russian warplanes. Over 80 ISIS fighters were killed while battling government forces in the Al-Baghayliyah District. 75-82 government soldiers (11 of them from the NDF) and 12 pro-government Shaytat tribesmen also died. On the next day, a pro-government source claimed government forces recaptured the Saiqa Camp, the Tal Kroum hilltop and the Ayyash weapons depot. However, subsequent reports confirmed they were still ISIL-held. Later on 20 January, the Al-Baghaliyeh district also fell to ISIL and the jihadists took the Missile Battalion Base, south of Deir Ezzor, and the Al Mari'iyah farms. Earlier in the day, a Russian air force operation delivered 50 tonnes of humanitarian aid to civilians in Al-Baghaliyeh. The advances left ISIL in control of at least 60% of Deir ez-Zor city. At this time, ISIL released 270 of the 400 civilians kidnapped over the weekend. On 21 January, the Syrian army launched an offensive against the Baghiliya district, with 11 soldiers being killed.  Aftermath  On 22 January, Russian airstrikes killed 44 in ISIL-controlled Tala'a district and the following day, further airstrikes killed 63 in Khasam. On 26 January, six civilians were killed by a mortar round and a Syrian Arab Army Brigade General was killed. On 28 January, ISIL launched an offensive against Al-Baghayliyah District in order to seize the Al-Rawad Hill, Al-Jazeera University, and Firat Al-Sham Hotel. The attack was cut short by Syrian and Russian Air Force airstrikes. On 30 January, ISIL launched an attack along the Cinema Fouad Street inside the Al-Rashidiyah District and against the Al-Haweeqa District. On 11 March, the Syrian Arab Army‚Äôs Central Command announced their intention to lift ISIS's siege of Deir ez-Zor by capturing Palmyra and the Palmyra-Deir ez-Zor highway. On 18 May, the Syrian Army claimed that over 200 ISIS militants had been killed after a government assault in the western district of the besieged city. However, this number is disputed by the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights who give a more conservative estimate of 50 ISIS militants killed.  Casualties  Syrian Arab Army casualties were 200 killed, of whom 48 were executed by ISIL. 110 ISIL fighters had also died, including 30 suicide bombers.

The abbey is located on Lake Orta in northern Italy, considered one of the most scenic sites in the country. History By 1973 the community of Benedictine nuns of the Abbey of Viboldone, near Milan, which had been established in 1941 to care for the needy children of wartime Italy, had grown to the point that they considered opening a new foundation. They were offered the facilities of the former bishop's residence on San Giulio Island for this, which they accepted. Six nuns were chosen to undertake this enterprise, under the direction of Mother Anna Maria C√†nopi, O.S.B., who was appointed as the first prioress of the new monastery. Within fifteen years the small community had expanded so much that new quarters were needed. They then transferred to the former diocesan seminary in the center of the little island, which was a massive complex built around 1840. At that time, the monastery was raised to the status of an abbey, with C√†nopi being elected as the community's first abbess. The community had grown to over 80 members by 1989, and it was decided to establish a new foundation. For this site, they chose the village of Saint-Oyen, in the Aosta Valley, where they opened the Monastery of Regina Pacis (Latin for Queen of Peace). As of 2006 they numbered about fifteen nuns. The community of Mater Eccesliae has continued to flourish and today numbers about 100 nuns. Crafts The nuns of Mater Ecclesiae Abbey support themselves through their work in creating and repairing liturgical vestments and accessories, in writing icons and making translations from German and French spiritual books. Through their research they have developed a reputation for the quality of their restoration work with antique items. Additionally, C√†nopi, the abbess, has become a noted spiritual writer.

It was designed by Mark Cooper Day and built from 1890 to by John Petrie & Son. It is also known as North Queensland Insurance Building. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The Queensland Building was built in 1890‚Äì1892 by the important North Queensland firm of Burns, Philp Co. Ltd as the headquarters for its subsidiary insurance company, which role it retained for over eighty years. Townsville was established in 1864 by partners John Melton Black and Robert Towns and was gazetted as a port of entry in 1865. It grew quickly as a supply centre, and by 1873 the port was receiving international as well as coastal traffic. Improvements were carried out to improve facilities and to allow larger ships to anchor. By 1880 Townsville was the port for several major goldfields and had opened the first stage of the Great Northern railway line westwards through Charters Towers and beyond, consolidating its importance as a port and mercantile centre. Townsville had many prosperous mercantile and shipping firms including the major partnership of Burns Philp. James Burns arrived in Brisbane in 1862 with his brother John, who set up a store there while James worked on a pastoral run. In 1867, James established a store in Gympie, beginning a long commercial association with mining fields. In 1872 he moved to Townsville and set up his own business there, as improvements to the port and the wharves on Ross Creek were beginning. He was joined in 1874 by Robert Philp who had previously worked for shipping agents in Brisbane. Burns moved to Sydney in 1877 and established himself as an importer and shipping agent, while Philp continued business in the north. In 1883 they formed a company, Burns Philp and Company Limited, registered in Sydney. Philp was elected to the Queensland Legislative Assembly in 1886 but continued to represent the northern interests of his company. Burns Philp developed rapidly during the boom of the 1880s and Townsville owed much of its importance to the fact that it was the headquarters of this company. Within a decade of Burns' arrival in Townsville, the company dominated trade in North Queensland, supplying a huge range of goods and establishing branches in such places as Charters Towers. They also became a major player in Pacific Island and New Guinea trading. By the time that the Queensland Building was constructed, Burns Philp had passed beyond being a North Queensland company only and had shed some of its local retail activities, selling its drapery interest to Hollis Hopkins, for instance. Its shipping business was so important that the North Queensland Insurance Company was initially formed in 1886 to cover its own maritime interests. The land on which the Queensland Building stands was originally purchased by Robert Towns and John Melton Black in 1867. It was situated near the Burns Philp wharves on Ross River and at the opposite corner of Wickham Street from the Burns Philp Offices. In 1890, Burns Philp purchased the land for an office for its subsidiary insurance company. Sydney-based architect Mark Cooper Day, who had just completed a house for Sir James Burns at Parramatta, was engaged to design the building. Construction was carried out by the Brisbane builders John Petrie and Son and supervised by local architects Eyre and Munro. When completed, the quality of the workmanship in the building was highly praised. The position of the new offices in relationship to the existing Burns Philp and Company building on the other side of the intersection may have been taken into account in the design, so that two company buildings harmonious in scale and design formed a gateway to the Burns Philp wharves on Ross Creek beyond. The North Queensland Insurance building originally provided space on the ground floor for the resident company secretary, the manager, public offices, a strong room and stationery room. The two upper floors had two suites of offices with strong rooms on each floor. North Queensland Insurance was highly successful and soon moved into other areas of insurance, absorbing North Australian Lloyds in 1887 and in 1896 took over the Sydney-based Lloyds Underwriters' Association. To reflect its wider business interest the word \\"North\\" was dropped from the company name in 1907. In 1946, part of the block surrounding the offices was subdivided and sold. In 1971 Cyclone Althea took the roof off the building and damaged the ornate parapet. The mansard roof was not replaced and new, lower ceilings were installed during repairs. The current plain parapet was probably installed at this time. In 1972, The offices were purchased by the Townsville Harbour Board, who leased out office space. During the 1970s and early 1980s, the building was tenanted by a doctor who used the two lower floors as consulting rooms and who filled in the arches of the arcade with windows. The top floor was used as offices and living accommodation by an architect. In 1987 the building was bought by Barrier Reef Resources who used part of the building as a residence. It has been for some years the head office of a group of companies. The interior contains offices and residential accommodation of the top floor. The exterior of the building is little changed in form, although some of the surface decoration carried out in moulded render, which can be seen in early photographs, has been removed. The Museum of Tropical Queensland has been constructed on adjoining land.  Description  Queensland Building, viewed from Flinders Street, 2009 The Queensland Building is located on the south east corner of Wickham and Flinders Streets, Townsville, and has been designed to make the best use of its position with frontages to both streets and a corner entrance. It is across the street from the former headquarters of Burns Philp and Company which has similarities of form and detail. The Queensland Building is a 3-storey structure of rendered brick in a free classical style with arcades at each level. There are pronounced cornice mouldings marking each storey. The central entrance is approached by a flight of low steps and is surmounted by a triangular broken pediment. It is flanked by a 3 bay arcade on each side, the round headed arches being separated by pilasters with Doric capitals. The arches on the ground floor have been filled in with glass to create windows and have round canvas window hoods. The arcade on the first floor is similar in form but has Ionic capitals and a balustrade linking the arches. Sash windows are visible in the wall to the rear of the loggia created. The top floor is similar in form, but the arches are separated by consoles. The area above these was originally profusely decorated with swags of moulded render, but is now plain. The roof is concealed by a simple parapet of rendered brick.  Heritage listing  Queensland Building was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The style and quality of the Queensland Building demonstrates the prosperity of Townsville in the 1880s and reflects the way in which North Queensland was developed by the establishment of key ports as commercial and administrative centres. As the premises of a maritime insurance company set up to serve the enterprises of Burns, Philp and Company Limited, the building is closely associated with this development. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Queensland Building is important as a good example of a substantial nineteenth century office building in North Queensland which has design elements to accommodate a tropical climate. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. It is located on the major intersection of Wickham and Flinders Streets, where, by its design, form and materials, it makes a substantial visual contribution to the character of the city. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The Queensland Building is closely associated with the mercantile entity of Burns Philp and Company Limited, who were an important component in the development of Queensland, as a purpose built office for its subsidiary insurance company.

In his political career lasting more than 50 years, several of which were in exile, he held numerous ministerial portfolios and was also the Chairman of King Birendra's Raj Parishad Standing Committee (the Royal Privy Council of King Birendra) after the establishment of multi-party democracy in 1990. He also took part in the freedom movement of India, following the non-violent forms of protest advocated by Gandhi. After the independence of India and the subsequent partition of the country, Bhadrakali Mishra served as a personal assistant to Mahatma Gandhi, traveled with him and also spent some time at his ashram. He was first appointed a minister in 1951 when King Tribhuvan abolished the system of hereditary Prime Ministers from the Rana family and established democracy in Nepal. In the 1950s, Mishra held ministerial portfolios of Communications, Public Works, Transport, and Law and Parliamentary Affairs. Bhadrakali Mishra went into exile in 1960 when King Mahendra, son of King Tribhuvan banned all forms of political activities and imposed a party-less panchayat system. While in exile, Mishra with his family lived in Patna, Bihar, India and served as the General-Secretary-in-exile of the Nepali Congress as all political activities were banned in Nepal. He returned to Nepal in 1990 following the success of the first Jana Aandolan (People's Movement) and the restoration of multiparty democracy in 1990. He was subsequently appointed the Chairman of the first Raj Parishad Standing Committee (the Royal Privy Council) by King Birendra. Bhadrakali Mishra died in June 2006 in Ranchi, Jharkhand state, India due to old age and failing health. Biography=Early life= Bhadrakali Mishra was born on 6 February 1920 to Dwarika Parshad Mishra () and Ram Ratan Kuwari () in the village of Pipra in Mahottari District, located in the southern plains of Nepal. Owing to the absence of schools in his native district, he underwent early education at a local school in Sitamarhi, Bihar, India. Either during his final years of school or shortly thereafter, he was married to the daughter of Bishwanath Prasad Mishra, a renowned criminal lawyer from Chhapra, India. After his school studies, Bhadrakali Mishra enrolled at the law school at University of Allahabad. =1940‚Äì1949= While at the University, Bhadrakali Mishra became active in student politics, following the non-violent forms of protest advocated by Gandhi. He became an active member of the Indian National Congress and took part in numerous protests against the British Regime. On 9 August 1942, during one such protest in Patna, Bhadrakali Mishra was arrested and imprisoned at the Bankipur Jail along with senior leaders such as Dr. Rajendra Prasad, who incidentally was a close friend of his father-in-law. From Bankipur Jail, Mishra was transferred to Hazaribagh Central Prison. After his release from prison in 1945, Mishra resumed his studies and remained active in the freedom movement. He graduated with a degree in law (Bachelors of Law) from the University of Allahabad, and then went on to complete his post-graduate degree in English literature from Patna University. In 1948, Bhadrakali Mishra served as a personal assistant to Gandhi and travelled with him on visit to a number of villages in Bihar that were affected by the communal violence erupting after the partition of India. Mishra also spent some time with Gandhi at his ashram. =1950‚Äì1960= Sometime in 1948 or 1949, Bhadrakali Mishra returned to Nepal and in 1950, established Lok Sewak Sangh along Gandhian lines (translation: Association of the Servants of the People) in Janakpurdham. The Sangh organized prayer meetings, cleaned temples and other public places, and worked to provide relief to people affected by natural disasters, such as fires. The organization was also successful in raising the general level of awareness of the local population in Mahottari. In April or May 1950, while organizing a relief programme for victims of the fire, Bhadrakali Mishra, along with his cousin Ram Narayan Mishra and other Sangh workers were arrested and imprisoned. This incident sparked protests which far-flung and ill-staffed police posts could not contain and the local administration capitulated and released those who were arrested, including Mishra. After his release, Bhadrakali Mishra moved to Kathmandu. Bhadrakali Mishra's arrival in Kathmandu coincided with the popular movement against the Rana regime, a system hereditary Prime Ministers hailing from the Rana dynasty, that had reduced the ruling Shah monarchy to nominal figureheads and consolidated all powers within the office of the Prime Minister. A number of factors that included Mishra's closeness to the prominent leaders of the Indian Freedom Struggle, an Indian ambassador who knew of his history with the struggle, King Tribhuvan's strong inclination and belief in democracy, and Mishra's presence in Kathmandu propelled him to a central position and a key figure in the movement. Meanwhile, as the movement against the Rana grew in strength, relations between BP Koirala, brother of Matrika Prasad Koirala‚Äîwho would become the first Prime Minister of Nepal after the overthrow of the Ranas, and Mishra started to strain. In his autobiography, Atmabrittanta , BP Koirala wrote of his disagreements with Bhadrakali Mishra due to the latter's opposition to Nepali Congress starting an armed struggle for overthrowing the Rana Regime. Koirala added that Mishra continuously insisted that the struggle should fully be along Gandhian lines, including at formal party meetings. Tensions between the Ranas and the King grew and peaked in early November 1950 that ultimately led to the King seeking refuge at the Indian Embassy. On the morning of 10 November, two Indian aircraft arrived in Kathmandu and the royal family, along with the Indian Ambassador and Bhadrakali Mishra left for the Indian capital Delhi where they were received with full honours by President Dr. Rajendra Prasad, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Commander-in-Chief General Cariappa. The King, assisted by Mishra and other close confidants, held a number of meetings with very senior and influential people and garnered overwhelming support for his efforts to establish democracy in Nepal. With full support of the Indian political and military leadership, and absolute popular support back home for democracy in Nepal, King Tribhuvan returned to the country. Shortly thereafter, on 18 February 1951, he proclaimed an end to the Rana dynasty and announced the establishment of democracy in Nepal. For the transition, the King appointed a joint Rana-Congress cabinet, headed by Mohan Shumsher. Bhadrakali Mishra, representing the Nepali Congress was allocated the portfolio the Minister of Transport; the new cabinet, including Mishra, were sworn in the same day. As the Minister of Transport, Mishra played a key role in the response and relief work following massive floods in the Terai region in 1951, personally visiting the affected districts and overseeing rescue efforts and disbursement of relief material and cash. He also met with senior political leaders to secure their cooperation with government agencies for relief operations irrespective of political differences. He also undertook official trips to China, India and East Pakistan (now: Bangladesh) to explore avenues of strengthening Nepal's connectivity with its neighbours. In the meantime, relations between BP Koirala and Bhadrakali Mishra did not warm considerably. In a defining moment at the party's Fifth General Convention in Janakpur in 1952, where Koirala was campaigning strongly for being elected the party's President as well as posturing himself as the next Prime Minister, Mishra spoke out very strongly and critically against Koirala's proposal and stressed that the same person should be both the Prime Minister and the chief of a political party. Tensions overflow and culminated in Mishra, along with some other leaders of the Nepali Congress walking out of the meeting venue, boycotting the Convention and announcing a new political party, called the Terai Congress. Historians believe that despite the differences Koirala maintained a \\"deep respect\\" for Mishra. Behind the scenes, many senior leaders worked to reconcile the differences between the two. These efforts ultimately led to the reunification of Terai Congress and Nepali Congress a few years later. In subsequent years, Mishra was re-inducted in the cabinet and held numerous ministerial portfolios. But the differences between him and Koirala continued to surface time and again. The differences resulted in Mishra writing notes of dissent to many decisions taken by Koirala as the President of Nepali Congress and ultimately led to Mishra leaving the party again and also subsequently resigning from the Cabinet. Following differences with the Nepali Congress, Bhadrakali Mishra and Tanka Prasad Acharya split from the party and reactivated the Nepal Praja Parishad (translation: Nepal People's Council) that was established circa 1945 against the Rana regime. However, in 1959, Tanka Prasad and Bhadrakali contested the elections separately, as duly recognized as national parties by the Election Commission of Nepal. Bhadrakali Mishra's party, Nepal Praja Parishad (Mishra fraction), contesting 36 seats won 1 while the Acharya faction, contesting 46, won 2. =1960‚Äì1990= In December 1960, King Mahendra proclaimed all executive powers in the country and banned all forms of political activities. Following this \\"coup\\", the administration swiftly arrested a huge number of political leaders who would to be \\"tried for treason and receive due punishments.\\" To escape arrest and imprisonment, Bhadrakali Mishra, along with his family fled Nepal and went to India. Following the developments back home, Nepali political leaders in exile in India started to raise attention to the situation in Nepal and started gathering together. On 25 January 1961, the Nepali Congress, then in exile, held a general convention in Patna, Bihar and Subarna Shamsher, its senior leader, formally announced a struggle against the autocratic King and his regime. The convention also elected Rana as the President of Nepali Congress- in exile. About a month later, on 26 February 1961, Bhadrakali Mishra formally merged his own party, the Nepal Praja Praishad with the Nepali Congress. Shortly thereafter, he was also appointed the General Secretary of the Nepali Congress. Other political parties, such as Samyukta Prajatantra Party, Nationalist Gorkha Parishad, Gorkha Parishad, Nepal Terai Congress, and Terai Congress also merged with the Nepali Congress in due course. Mishra undertook a number of activities to protest the situation in Nepal. In one such protest, held in Muzaffarpur, Bihar, Mishra spoke about the role of media that had also sided with the King. His statements were suppressed by media in Nepal but Indian media widely reported on the subject, resulting in further highlighting of the situation in Nepal in both national and regional press and radio. In the years that followed, Mishra gave a number of interviews and wrote a number of opinion pieces in major Indian newspapers on political repression and curtailment of civil rights in Nepal. In December 1976, King Birendra decreed that Mishra, along with 11 other senior political leaders, all in exile in India, will be pardoned. In doing so, he reiterated that the pardon and any subsequent participation in the panchayat system was possible for those who accepted the basic rules of the system. Mishra issued a press statement thanking the King but did not endorse the panchayat system. Instead he welcomed \\"the opportunity to dedicate himself to the service of his compatriots.\\" Other leaders, such as B.P. Koirala and Ganesh Man Singh however decided to return to Nepal to seek national reconciliation on terms more acceptable to the Nepali Congress. Following the pardon, Mishra briefly visited his hometown, Pipra, to perform some religious services on the death of a family member and thereafter returned. However, despite the 1976 royal pardon, a single member bench of the Supreme Court of Nepal, in February 1977 passed death sentences on a number of senior political leaders, including Bhadrakali Mishra, Girija Prasad Koirala and Ganesh Man Singh for their involvement in an attack on the district of Okhaldhunga. On this verdict, B.P. Koirala, who was at the time imprisoned at the Sundarijal Prison, wrote in his memoirs Pheri Sundarijal (Jail Diary 2033-34): It remained unclear whether the 1976 royal pardon to Mishra applied to this case. But as a result of the 1980 general amnesty announced by the King, Mishra and other leaders were exonerated of the charge of attack on Okhaldhunga. In 1979, King Birendra announced that a national referendum would be held and the population would be offered the choice between the non-partisan panchayat system and a multi-party system. While a number of political leaders cautiously welcomed the announcement, Mishra spoke very critically on the matter. He questioned the fairness of the vote and expressed particular concern on the issue of citizenship for the Nepali population inhabiting the Terai region as it practically disenfranchised close to two million people. The issue of citizenship was largely not addressed and the referendum was ultimately held on 2 May 1980 with a voter turnout of 66.9%. The panchayat system received a slim majority of 54.8%. On 13 April 1980, King Birendra announced a general amnesty to all political prisoners and exiles. A few days later, it was confirmed by the Home Ministry that Mishra was one of the political exiles to be granted amnesty. This paved way for him to freely return to Nepal although he was still barred from any political activates in the country. Following the amnesty, Mishra would visit Kathmandu frequently but remained in India where he continued to advocate for greater political and civil freedom in Nepal. =1990‚Äì1995= Bhadrakali Mishra returned full-time to Nepal in August 1990 after the success of the 1990 popular movement. The movement brought an end to absolute monarchy and established a democracy with the King retaining a ceremonial role. (See also People's Movement I (1990)) In late December 1990, Mishra was granted an audience by King Birendra at the Narayanhiti Palace where the two reportedly discussed the establishment of democracy and transition from an absolute to constitutional monarchy. It was at this meeting that the King reportedly asked Mishra if he would be willing to serve as the Chairman of his Raj Parishad (Privy Council). Bhadrakali Mishra agreed and, on 17 February 1991, was appointed to the position. He was administered the oath of office and secrecy by the King on the morning of 19 February 1991, Nepal's Prajatantra Diwas (Democracy Day). The Raj Parishad was a body bestowed with a lot of power by the Constitution of Nepal (1990). According to the constitution (Article 34), Chairman of the Raj Parishad had the authority to convene a meeting of the Council to run matters of the state in the event of the demise of the King, should the King proclaim his abdication, or the King be mentally or physically unable to perform his functions. In May 1991, Mishra traveled as the Personal Representative of King Birendra to pay respects on the death of former Prime Minister of India Rajiv Gandhi. The official Nepalese delegation was led by Prime Minister Prime Minister Krishna Prasad Bhattarai. In late January and early February 1992, Bhadrakali Mishra undertook an official visit to the United States of America as the Personal Representative of King Birendra to meet with President George H. W. Bush, senior officials of the US Government, the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, and other officials and dignitaries at Washington DC. During this visit he also attended the National Prayer Breakfast on 30 January 1992. In early July 1992, Bhadrakali Mishra traveled to Thailand at the invitation of Sanya Dharmasakti, the then President of the Privy Council of Thailand. During this visit he undertook discussions with his counterpart at the Privy Council of Thailand and with other senior Thai Government officials on strengthening relations between Nepal and Thailand as well as the development of Lumbini, the birthplace of Gautama Buddha. In 1994, Bhadrakali Mishra traveled to various parts of the Tibet Autonomous Region of China, visiting many border crossings that could be developed to strengthen trade and transit between Nepal and China. During this trip, in addition to meeting with border, customs and trade officials, Mishra also met with senior officials of both the Region's administration as well as with senior members of the Communist Party of China. He also visited the Consulate of Nepal in Lhasa. Mishra's was the first official visit to any part of Tibet Autonomous Region of China by a senior Nepalese dignitary since the establishment of democracy in Nepal (in 1990). =1996‚Äì2006= Following the end of his term as the Chairman of the Royal Privy Council Standing Committee, Bhadrakali Mishra returned to his village Pipra in the Terai. He engaged in a number of local and small-scale social initiatives. He financed, from his personal accounts, repair and preventative maintenance of the Pipra high-school and its Dwarika-Vijay- Lilawati Chhatrawas (hostel). He also reactivated the Basahiya village-based Gandhi Sewa Ashram started a number of programmes aimed at social upliftment, education and women empowerment (Bhadrakali Mishra, Pundit Ramakant Jha, Ram Narayan Mishra and Mahendra Narayan Nidhi had established the Ashram in 1953). He strongly advocated the need for and importance of women's empowerment, effective social security structures for widows and orphans, meaningful and remunerated employment for women, and proper education of girls. He financed tuition scholarship for one girl and one boy in Pipra village, each year, for the duration of their school years on condition that they continue formal schooling until they graduated high school. He also accompanied local NGO workers to rural Terai villages to speak to parents and impress upon them the need to educate their children, particularly their daughters. In his retired life, he also undertook religious pilgrimages to locations of religious and educational importance, visiting Puri, Kanya Kumari, Delhi, Varanasi, Allahabad, Calcutta, Badrinath and Kedarnath in India. From 2003 onwards, owing to poor health and the need for regular medical care, Bhadrakali Mishra moved back to Kathmandu and lived with his son Ajay and his family. He made yearly trips to Ranchi where in addition to being with his youngest son, Vinay, he also underwent regular medical check-ups. He frequently traveled to Delhi and Mauritius to visit his grandchildren. Bhadrakali Mishra passed away in Ranchi on 1 June 2006 due to old age. As per his wishes, his last rites were performed as per the Arya Samaj rituals and his ashes were immersed in the Ganges in Varanasi, India. =Social and political legacy= Following his passing, the Nepali Congress unanimously approved a condolence motion that was sponsored by late Girija Prasad Koirala, the then President of the Nepali Congress and care-taker Prime Minister of Nepal. Speaking at the meeting, Koirala noted that in Mishra's demise, the nation had lost a statesman and a true democrat. Condolence messages were also delivered by the Ambassadors of China, Japan and India, and numerous political activists and civil society members. On the eve of the promulgation of the Constitution of Nepal-2015, Nepali civil society leaders including Sushil Pyakurel, Kapil Shrestha, Dharmendra Jha, Charan Prasai, Dinesh Tripathi, and many others issued a statement recalling the contributions of and paying homage to Bhadrakali Mishra, along with leaders including B.P. Koirala, Tanka Prasad Acharya, Pushpalal Shrestha, Madan Bhandari, Mahendra Narayan Nidhi and Gajendra Narayan Singh as \\"dreamers of a democratic Nepal.\\" Personal life Bhadrakali Mishra was born on 6 February 1920 to Dwarika Parshad Mishra () and Ram Ratan Kuwari () in the village of Pipra in Mahottari District, located in the southern plains. Bhadrakali had an elder and a younger brother. Sometime in his late-teens, Bhadrakali Mishra was married to Lilawati Mishra (), the daughter of Bishwanath Prasad Mishra from Chhapra, Bihar, India. His father- in-law, Bishwanath Prasad was a close friend of the first President of India, Dr. Rajendra Prasad. By profession, he was a defense lawyer, primarily for criminal cases during the British Raj. Bhadrakali and Lilawati Mishra were married for about 45 years, until Lilawati's death in 1987, in Patna, India. They had three sons, Vijay, Ajay and Vinay. Vijay Mishra (1946-1977) spent most of his life in Nepal and started Vijay Printing Press, one of the country's first privately owned mechanical printing presses. Ajay Mishra (1952-2011) initially served in the Merchant Navy in India as an engineer, returning to Nepal in 1981, and was one of the country's first Apple certified service providers (for Macintosh computers). He is also credited as having designed and developed Preeti, the first computer font for Nepali language. Vinay Mishra (1956-) a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons is presently the Chief Surgeon at the Abdur Razzaque Ansari Memorial Hospital in Ranchi, Bihar. Among his grandchildren, Vibhu Mishra (son of Ajay Mishra) is an official at the United Nations, serving at the Department of Public Information, having previously served at the secretariat of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the United Nations Mission in Nepal. One of Bhadrakali Mishra's cousins, Shyam Nandan Prasad Mishra, served as the Minister of External Affairs of India from 28 July 1979 to 13 January 1980. Honours Some of the prominent honours bestowed upon Bhadrakali Mishra included: * Suprasidha Prabala Gorkha Dakshina Bahu (The Most Puissant Order of the Gurkha Right Arm) for most exceptional and highly invaluable services rendered to the nation and to the monarchy, 1995. * Birendra Rajat Jayanti Padak (King Birendra Silvery Jubilee Medal), special coronation medal for services rendered to the nation during the reign of His Majesty King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev, 1997. * Birendra-Aishwarya Sewa Padak (King Birendra- Queen Aishwarya Service Medal) for dedicated and trustworthy services rendered to King Birendra and the monarchy during his reign, 2002.

The church is located in the Midtbyen neighbourhood. It is a parish church within the Church of Denmark servicing a parish population of 8.873 (2015). The church was designed by the Danish architect Thomas Havning who won a public contest for a new church design in 1933. The parish of the Church of Our Lady was reaching a population of 10.000 and it had been decided to split it and create a new parish, requiring a new church. Construction began in 1934 and was completed in October, 1935. The church is dedicated to Mark the Evangelist. In 1982 a new wing, Klosterg√•rden, was added to the church with an office and recreational facilities for youth preparing for confirmation. In 1998 the church was extensively renovated.  Architecture  The nave The design for the church was presented as ‚ÄúMellem tvende Have‚Äù (Between two oceans) by Thomas Havning. The oceans referred to the traditional medieval church style and functionalism which was popular at the time. The church is a fusion of the two architectural styles, connecting with the past in a modern form. The result was a large and tall church with a tower in the south-west corner and with community facilities attached perpendicularly on the nave in a wing of its own. The church is designed in Neoclassical style with a traditional pitched roof and gable. It is constructed of red brick with Nex√∏ sandstone at the base and around windows and doors. The church room is inspired by medieval churches with the basilica and central nave elevated over the aisles. The interior is shaped by the bright, whitewashed walls and light oak used in the benches, pulpit and altar.

This example was sent from Paris to Alfred Vagts in Munich. Dadaglobe was an anthology of the Dada movement slated for publication in 1921, but abandoned for financial and other reasons and never published. At 160 pages with over a hundred reproductions of artworks and over a hundred texts by some fifty artists in ten countries, Dadaglobe was to have documented Dada's apogee as an artistic and literary movement of international breadth. Edited by Dada co- founder Tristan Tzara (1896-1963) in Paris, Dadaglobe was not conceived as a summary of the movement since its founding in 1916, but rather meant to be a snapshot of its expanded incarnation at war's end. Not merely a vehicle for existing works, the project functioned as one of Dada's most generative catalysts for the production of new works.See Adrian Sudhalter, ed. Dadaglobe Reconstructed (Zurich: Scheidegger and Spiess and Kunsthaus Z√ºrich, 2016) History Max Ernst, 1920, Punching Ball (l'Immortalit√© de Buonarroti), photomontage, gouache and ink on photograph The Dadaglobe solicitation letter, sent from Paris in early November 1920, requested four types of visual submissions‚Äîphotographic portraits (which could be manipulated, but should \\"retain clarity\\"); original drawings; photographs of artworks; and designs for book pages‚Äîalong with prose, poetry, or other verbal \\"inventions.\\" Contributors included Jean (Hans) Arp, Marcel Duchamp, Max Ernst, George Grosz, John Heartfield, Hannah H√∂ch, Francis Picabia, Man Ray, Kurt Schwitters, and Sophie Taeuber among others (see full list of contributors below). Johannes Baargeld, 1920, Typical Vertical Mess as Depiction of the Dada Baargeld (Typische Vertikalklitterung als Darstellung des Dada Baargeld) Some of Dada's most iconic artworks were created in direct response to the Dadaglobe solicitation letter: Ernst's self-portrait montage commonly known as Dadamax (The Punching Ball or the Immortality of Buonarroti) and his Chinese Nightingale,Max Ernst, The Chinese Nightingale (Le Rossignol chinois), 1920, Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts, Grenoble, France Taeuber's Dada Head,Celebrating Sophie Taeuber-Arp‚Äôs 127th Birthday, MoMA and Baargeld's Typical Vertical Mess as Depiction of the Dada Baargeld are just a few examples. These works were conceived by the artists with their presentation in reproduction foremost in mind. Dadaglobe was to have been a manifesto on the revised status of the artwork in reproduction. The volume was advertised in Duchamp's and Man Ray's journal New York Dada in 1921: \\"Order from the publishing house 'La Sir√®ne' 7 rue Pasquier, Paris, DADAGLOBE, the work of dadas from all over the world [‚Ä¶] The incalculable number of pages of reproductions and of text is a guarantee of the success of the book.\\"Marcel Duchamp and Man Ray, eds. New York Dada (single issue; April 1921), n. p. [2]. When Andr√© Breton, later founder of Surrealism, saw the intended contents of the book, he remarked: \\"The grand album 'Dadaglobe' [‚Ä¶] will soon appear. [‚Ä¶] After the publication of this volume it will be impossible to contest Dada's artistic value.\\"Quoted in Adrian Sudhalter, \\"Max Ernst and Tristan Tzara's Dadaglobe\\" in Max Ernst: Retrospective, Werner Spies and Julia Drost, eds. Exh. cat.. (Ostfildern: Hatje Cantz Verlag, 2013).p. 86. In scope, ambition, and even title, Tzara's Paris-based Dadaglobe, was modeled on Richard Huelsenbeck's Berlin-based, Dadaco, planned the previous year, but also abandoned and never published.For the relationship between the two unrealized volumes see: Richard Sheppard, \\"Introduction\\", in Z√ºrich ‚Äî Dadaco ‚Äî Dadaglobe: The Correspondence between Richard Huelsenbeck, Tristan Tzara, and Kurt Wolff (1916‚Äì1924) (Tayport: Hutton Press 1982), pp. 5‚Äì8. Dadaglobe reached an advanced stage of planning before financial and interpersonal obstacles put a halt to the project in spring 1921. Dadaglobe Reconstructed Numerous archival traces provide an indication of the intended contents of Dadaglobe. The French scholar Michel Sanouillet (1924-2015) rediscovered the abandoned project and, in 1966, published a selection of the texts intended for the original anthology.Michel Sanouillet, Le Dossier de Dadaglobe, in Cahiers de l'association internationale pour l'√©tude de Dada et du Surr√©alisme, no. 1 (1966), pp. 111‚Äì143.

It was filmed in 1953 and starring Amalia Aguilar, Lilia del Valle and Silvia Pinal. Plot Don Jose Samaniego (Adalberto Martinez), an old and ridiculous man, marries Silvia (Silvia Pinal), a 20-year-old girl. On their wedding night before the marriage be consummated, Don Jos√© died after suffering a seizure. Through the obituaries many people learn about his death and go to the cemetery. Among the visitors is Amalia (Amalia Aguilar), with her marriage certificate and says that in their wedding day, Don Jos√© got a call, went and never returned. Also coming Lilia (Lilia del Valle), another widow, saying that her husband was kidnapped on their wedding night. The day when the will of Don Jos√© is read, the three women learns that the man also had a child with a cook. He asks who seek this woman and wait five years to take part in the inheritance.

Estanislao Girao Reviews In 1952 the Cuban rumbera Amalia Aguilar, Lilia del Valle and Lilia Prado staged The Three Merry Midwives and The Interested Women, directed by Tito Davison and Rogelio A. Gonz√°lez respectively. As the films were successful, the formula is repeated and Silvia Pinal was chosen to replace Lilia Prado to team up with the other two actresses and interpreting together three sleepers, sympathetic, cheerful and, above all, very sexy women. The story runs after an absurd plot with supposedly scientific nonsense led by the Puerto Rican filmmaker Fernando Cortes, less skilled than Davison, but the grace of the three beautiful actresses and some good dancing numbers of Adalberto Mart√≠nez and Amalia Aguilar, make the movie bearable. In 1953 Cort√©s filmed a new film with the three actresses: The Loving Women (Las cari√±osas).

It is commonly known as the tent spider or dome-web spider, and is native to India, Japan, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Australia, Fiji, and Tonga. It is often found in disturbed or open habitats from coasts to forest and mountainous interiors. The abdomen is high and the anterior end overhangs the cephalothorax. It can be distinguished from similar species by the two tubercles on its abdomen, its elaborate pattern, and, in females, the shape of the median septum of the epigyne. In males, the embolus of the pedipalp is enclosed within the conductor. Females and immature spiders are yellow to green in color. Webs built by Cyrtophora species are different than typical webs built by orb-weavers. The orb web is built horizontally with a finely meshed dome or bowl shape, hence the name \\"dome-web spider\\". The non-sticky spiral is left intact and webs are without a sticky spiral. A 1980 study suggests that this type of web derives from the typical orb web and not the other way around. These webs are durable, sometimes lasting several weeks, so they don't need to be remade every day like the webs of most spiders. Webs can be either solitary or colonial, though even in groups, each web is defended by its owner. Colonial groups can cover an area of fifteen meters squared and include over four hundred individuals, including fifty adults. Young spiders will often build their nests within the space of that of their parent's. Webs of this spider have also been known to be host to Argyrodes miniaceus or young spiders of other species.

More recent research has shown that the site was a station on an ancient desert road, called Abu Ballas Trail, that connected the Dakla Oasis with the Gilf Kebir and the Jebel Ouenat. Some researchers maintain that Abu Ballas was a milestone of an ancient Egyptian trade route into central Africa or for prospecting mineralsDiscovery of the ancient Abu Ballas Trail Retrieved 2020/04/20. The place was installed in the late Old Kingdom or early First Intermediate Period, when some authorities decided to arrange supply depots on a track in the desert. Abu Ballas was one of the largest. Besides the pottery there were discovered some rock carvings, stone tools and even a senet game board engraved on a stone. There are no water sources nearby, evidently all water and food was brought here from the Dakhla Oases with donkeys. Most likely people lived here only for short periods of time. The desert road was mainly in use at the end of the Old Kingdom and to a lesser extent in the Second Intermediate Period and in the New Kingdom.

He had four elder brothers and sisters. He came from a noble family; his great-grandfather, General Karol Toll, was made a count by Nicholas I of Russia and the family owned Uniej√≥w Castle at ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Voivodeship in central Poland. He received his schooling in Warsaw and went to the University of Warsaw where he studied law. During World War I, the university was evacuated to Rostov-on-Don in Russia, and while there, he added biology to the subjects he was studying. In 1918, he was awarded his PhD in law. He had already developed his interest in butterflies and moths and while in Russia he studied the lepidoptera of the Rostov region. Career Uniej√≥w Castle After the war, the family's castle was confiscated, and his parents moved to Bydgoszcz in North Poland. By 1924, Toll had returned to Poland. In 1930 he started work as an apprentice at the National Scientific Institute in Bydgoszcz, and between then and 1934 he studied the lepidoptera of the region, joining the Polish Entomological Society and founding its North Silesian branch. By 1937 he was working at the Silesian Museum at Katowice, and also doing teaching work. His interest in Lepidoptera continued, and after World War II he became the head of the Nature Conservancy Department of the Directorate of State Forests. He became a member of the editorial board of the Microlepidoptera Palaearctica, and was writing the Coleophoridae section, a volume with 1500 pages and 5000 drawings. He had nearly finished this monograph in 1961 when he developed appendicitis, and died of heart failure soon after surgery. Research Toll's research was mainly concentrated on the smaller moths of the Microlepidoptera group, specialising from 1929 on the Tortricidae and Nepticulidae families, and from 1939 onwards, on the Coleophoridae family, on which he was still working when he died. He reared many caterpillars at home, and worked out the life cycle of a number of species. He accumulated a large collection of insects, and donated about 40,000 specimens to the Municipal Museum at Rostov. About 100,000 specimens were given to the of the Polish Academy of Sciences. He also collected about 8,000 bird eggs and 12,000 butterflies and moths during his time living in Bydgoszcz. He scientifically described over 200 lepidopteran species, and undertook faunal surveys of several parts of Poland. List of works *Toll, S.Gr.v., 1936.

He received his Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of Monterrey in Mexico in 1998. While a student in Monterrey, he started getting interested in conceptual art. Garc√≠a Torres cited a group of his professors that were linked with American abstract expressionism as an influence in that direction. Before continuing his studies in the United States, and earned his Master of Fine Arts by the California Institute of the Arts in 2005, as a Fulbright grantee, the artist worked as an ‚Äúelectronic arts curator‚Äù at the Museo Carrillo Gil in M√©xico City . In 2007 he received the Cartier Award at the Frieze Art Fair. He is a member of the Artists Board of SOMA -a Mexico City arts organization. Early Work The work that first attracted attention to the artist negotiated obscure events associated with conceptual art of the 1960s and 1970s, with the use of a variety of media. His early work, based on past events around the history of conceptual art, tried to create new ideas and meanings through them. Garc√≠a Torres used minor events for the creation of his narratives, as he believed that \\"some of them still have the potential to trigger questions both regarding their own nature, and regarding historiography\\". In \\"In Some Places I Had Seen Before Moving to L.A.\\", he presents locations around L.A. in an attempt to reproduce the image he had about the city, based in what he saw in films or conceptual art works. His first solo exhibition in the United States presented \\"What Happens in Halifax Stays in Halifax\\". It was triggered during a conversation about art concepts with Jan Mot, and was initiated as a historic research project covering a 1969 art project which was assigned to NSCAD University students in David Askevold's class by artist Robert Barry. Garc√≠a Torres' work consisted of black and white slides and produced a reunion of the 1969 project class. Garc√≠a Torres' Share-e-Nau Wanderings (A Film Treatment) was the artist's first attempt to approach the life and work of Alighiero Boetti, by creating a series of fictitious fax sheets, describing Garc√≠a Torres' imaginary trip in Kabul. The project would occupy seven years of research and the production of a number of works. \\"¬øAlguna vez has visto la nieve caer?\\" is a 50-minute slide show of black and white photographs of Kabul, taken by as anonymous photographers, and accompanied by sound. The project comprised photographs taken in the seventies, but the artist placed his work after the September 11 attacks, in an attempt to mingle different times and trigger the audience to question what it sees. With \\"Tea\\", Garc√≠a Torres documents in film his journey to One Hotel, the hotel operated by Alighiero Boetti in Kabul, further exploring his knowledge of Kabul and Boetti while tackling the also tense political climate in his own country. This was an important part of his contribution to Documenta 13. With \\"Je ne sais si c'en est la cause\\", and \\"What Doesn't Kill You Makes You Stronger\\" Garc√≠a Torres gave documentation for two past works: Martin Kippenberger's Museum of Modern Art Syros, and Daniel Buren's in-situ mosaics in Saint Croix. His work \\"My Westphalia Days\\" is a road movie containing fictitious events of the four-day disappearance of Michael Asher's trailer, which was presented in Skulptur Projekte M√ºnster since 1977. \\"Unspoken Dailies\\", is a 66-minute feature film, showing actor Diego Luna reading the film's script written by Garc√≠a Torres for the first time while being filmed in an artist studio in Mexico City. Monologues and Lectures In 2007, Garcia Torres created what would become the first of a number of theater monologues. Alan Smithee, the pseudonym directors used to disown projects they were dissatisfied with, is personified in \\"I am not a Flopper\\". The work is a monologue which Garc√≠a Torres co-wrote with philosopher Aaron Schuster, and is an effort to discuss created and invented concepts. In 2015, inspired by Seth Siegelaub, an independent curator, gallerist, and publisher who was influential to the emergence of Conceptual art in the 1960s, the artist co-wrote with Alan Page ‚ÄúThe Causality of Hesitance‚Äù. Centered on Siegelaub's interest in theories about time, this ‚Äúthought-provoking performance‚Äù spans a range of topics, from the psychology of hesitating to the contradictory aspects of economic progress. ‚ÄúThe Cordiality Paradox‚Äù is a performative speech carried out by ‚Äòan actor and a robotic tortoise,‚Äô that takes on two philosophical paradoxes ‚Äì conceptual notions in the foundations of mathematics ‚Äì and enlivens them for the layperson through an anecdotal narrative recounting life-changing moments and encounters. The piece is ‚Äúa nonstop operation that could have been either a philosophical treatise or the chatter of a confused mind‚Äù according to Noemi Smolik. In 2012, Garc√≠a Torres presented a working version of ‚ÄúHave You Ever Seen the Snow‚Äù, as part of the ‚ÄúArtists on Artists‚Äù series at Dia Art Foundation in New York. The lecture became latter a slide show piece presented afterwards at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof√≠a in Madrid, and latter became a fundamental part of the artist contribution to Documenta 13, Kassel. \\"Five Feet High and Rising\\", is a work in the form of a lecture where Garc√≠a Torres tracks a somewhat esoteric cultural history of rivers. The piece, which also exist as an installation presented at the Sharjah Biennial in the United Arab Emirates in 2017, chart and merge different stories of movement, migration, and fragmentation while drifting through a combination of images and popular music that make reference to small and large waterways. In 2013, Garcia Torres gave a short lecture where he argued against the use of the word ‚ÄúLatinamerica‚Äù, in the context of the Art Basel Miami Beach. As his participation to ‚ÄúAn Inquiry: Modes of Encounter‚Äù, an exhibition at the Times Museum, in Guangzhou, China, in 2019, the artist wrote ‚ÄúIf Only I'd Thought of The Right Words‚Äù a monologue for an Artificial Intelligence character. The project was made in collaboration with the Chinese tech company Sogou. In the video piece, the avatar speaks randomly as if she has been left alone at a live TV news broadcast. Other lectures that are considered works of art are ‚ÄúLike You, I Dig, I Dig In, I Dig Into, and I Dig Up Art Too‚Äù, presented at the a LUMA Westbau symposium in Zurich, Switzerland and ‚ÄúPractical Demonstrations of Unique Quantic Systems As Mechanism to Produce Resonances in the Terrestrial Atmosphere‚Äù, a ‚Äúperformatic lecture‚Äù made in collaboration with artist and musician Sol Oosel, and presented at the Torcuato di Tella University, in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Museographic Essays In 2014 Garcia Torres started creating what he called \\"museographical essays\\"; large installations in which a very diverse number of objects and media are included. \\"R.R. and the Expansion of the Tropics\\" is a narrative of the last three decades in South Florida, combining elements on social issues in the area, climate change, and Robert Rauschenberg. An earlier work of this type was his contribution to the 2014 Berlin Biennial, for which he displayed a large number of elements in an underground room at the Ethnologistches Museum surrounding the work and legacy of musician Conlon Nancarrow. ‚ÄúSounds Like Isolation to Me‚Äù also included a collaboration with Berlin pianist Nils Frahm. ‚ÄúThe Party Was Yesterday (But Nobody Remembers It)‚Äù was an atmospheric display created by Garc√≠a Torres where the memory of the events that conformed the little-known Mexican Museo Din√°mico (Dynamic Museum -not to be confused with the initiative of the same name in Dakar, Senegal) were recovered throughout the display of newly created original artworks and documents from the time. During the 1960s, Manuel Larrosa and Miguel Salas Anzures created what is claimed to be the first contemporary museum in M√©xico, transforming a series of nonconformist houses designed by Larrosa into ephemeral exhibition spaces. The exhibitions included both, interventions of avant-garde theater and film directors of the time like Alejandro Jodorowsky and Juan Jose Gurrola as well as works by prominent artists like Manuel Felguerez, Lilia Carrillo and Vicente Rojo. For ‚ÄúThe Strange Things My Eyes See‚Äù the artist created an exhibition in the ruins of a utopian building designed and built in the 1980s by Agust√≠n Hern√°ndez Navarro in Santa Mar√≠a Ahuacatitl√°n, M√©xico. Upon entering the derelict space, visitors encountered a scene with a number of objects, elements that had originally been part of the building itself, transformed into bronze. Regarded by the artist as ‚Äúa conceptual framework‚Äù, it constituted a subtle intervention that suspended notions of perception and the laws of physics. The project prompted the German gallery neugerriemschneider to open a temporary satellite space in M√©xico. Music Although he does not consider himself a composer, music has had a recurrent presence in Garc√≠a Torres‚Äô practice over the past two decades. According to Caroline Dumalin he ‚Äúuses sound to transmit ideas, and also examines its circulation, exploring the social and geopolitical circumstances that have influenced its particular resonance in a given time and place.‚Äù In 2004 he published ‚ÄúI Promise Every Time‚Äù ‚Äìa collaboration with Mexican musician Mario L√≥pez Landa, which was released by White Cube Gallery as a CD. It is the musical version of an older work, which consists of a written vow in which the artist pledged to ‚Äúdo his best as an artist‚Äù. From then on, he went on to collaborate with a long list of musicians, in order to record music for films and installations, often taking the role of lyricist and producer. Some of the Garc√≠a Torres‚Äô works that feature original music are ‚ÄúTea‚Äù, \\"Je ne sais si c'en est la cause\\", ‚ÄúThe Day Mankind Faded Away‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Disjunction of Time‚Äù', ‚ÄúIl auriat bien pu le premettre aussi‚Äù and ‚ÄúSilence's Wearing Thin Here‚Äù. Some works that include several tracks each have been published as EPs or LPs: ‚ÄúUm Cabo La, Um Porto Ca‚Äù (2013), ‚ÄúThe Schlieren Plot‚Äù (2015), ‚ÄúWe Make the Weather‚Äù (2014) and ‚ÄúSilence's Wearing Thin Here‚Äù (2018). In 2019 Garc√≠a Torres presented ‚ÄúFalling Together in Time‚Äù a video-essay where the artist explores the themes of coincidence and happenstance, weaving together an incident in 1981 that involved Mohammad Ali with the development a number of popular songs surrounding Van Halen‚Äôs 1983 hit ‚ÄúJump‚Äù. The 2004 video work ‚ÄúThe Call Them Border Blasters‚Äù the artist had also used a popular song ‚ÄúMexican Radio‚Äù by Wall of Voodoo ‚Äúto make evident the social and political context of the northern Mexican states‚Äù through music. Mid-Career Surveys In 2016, a mid-career survey of Garc√≠a Torres‚Äô work was held at the Museo Rufino Tamayo and in three other venues in Mexico City. Theoretically, the works in the show were exhibited in the geographic area that would be covered if you would superimposed the Museo de Arte Sacramento -a ‚Äúmuseum without walls‚Äù in the state of Coahuila, Mexico, conceived by the artist between 2002 and 2004- over a section of the city. According to Leslie Moody Castro ‚ÄúWithin this fantastically complex exhibition, Garcia Torres blurs any standards regarding linear time or functional space, ultimately offering an opportunity to reconsider our understanding of reality‚Äù.\\"Let's Walk Together\\" was curated by Sofia Hern√°dez Chong-Cuy. \\"Illusion Brought Me Here\\" -Garc√≠a Torres's first US survey held at the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, in 2018 highlighted the artist as both researcher and storyteller, exploring the impulses that produce artistic thought. Encompassing the galleries, the Bentson Mediatheque, and the Walker Cinema, the presentation features 45 works created over the past two decades as well as site-specific installations conceived exclusively for the Walker. The show traveled the year after to Wiels in Brussels were the Mexican artist presented, among a number of other works, his own abridged version of a retrospective: a new sound piece entitled \\"Silence's Wearing Thin Here\\" (n.d.), composed of voices and soundtracks from his earlier works. \\"Illusion Brought Me Here\\" was curated by Vincenzo de Bellis and Caroline Dumalin. COVID-19 Pandemic During the COVID-19 pandemic, Garc√≠a Torres held an exhibition that no one, but one undisclosed person could physically visit, at the Museo Colecci√≥n Jumex in Mexico City. A daily live stream broadcast the image of the gallery during normal museum hours while the artist made use of the space as a private studio to create new work. \\"Solo\\" was produced in response to the temporary closure of cultural institutions at that time and the abrupt changes to artists‚Äô production as a result of that year's worldwide pandemic. The exhibition was a means for the artist to reconsider the relationship between the artist, the studio, the public, and the institution during the hiatus from exhibitions around the world. During the same time, the artist promoted an initiative known as Museos Uno en Uno (museums one by one) which consisted in allowing single visitors to then-closed museums in Mexico using an online booking system. The program started in Museo Frida Kahlo and Anahuacalli in the country's capital.  List of exhibitions and collections  Garc√≠a Torres has exhibited his work in several museums and biennales around the world, both in solo and collective exhibitions. His work is represented by neugerriemschneider, Berlin; Jan Mot, Brussels; Franco Noero, Turin; josegarcia ,mx, Mexico City and Taka Ishii, Tokyo. ;Individual exhibitions *Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, Netherlands (2007) *Kunsthalle Z√ºrich, Z√ºrich (2008) *Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts, San Francisco, United States (2009) *Fundaci√≥ Joan Mir√≥, Barcelona, Spain (2009) *Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof√≠a, Madrid, Spain (2010) * Museo Madre, Naples, Italy (2013) * Hammer Museum, Los Angeles (2014) *Focus.: Mario Garcia Torres, Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, Fort Worth, United States (2015) *Walker Art Center, Minneapolis (2018) *Wiels, Brussels (2019) *Museo Jumex, Mexico City (2020) ;Collective Exhibitions and Biennials *52nd Venice Biennale, Venice, Italy (2007) *Taipei Biennial, Taipei, Taiwan (2010) *29th S√£o Paulo Art Biennial, S√£o Paulo, Brazil (2010) *dOCUMENTA (13), Kassel, Germany (2012) *Mercosul Biennial, Porto Alegre, Brazil (2013) *Berlin Biennale, Berlin, Germany (2014) *Manifesta 11, Zurich (2016) ;Public Collections *Museum of Modern Art, New York *Musee d Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, France *Walker Art Center, Minneapolis * Pompidou Center, France * Guggenheim, New York *Hammer Museum, Los Angeles * Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, The Netherlands * Tate Modern, London, UK * Museo Centro Nacional de Arte Reina Sof√≠a, Madrid * Museo Universitario de Arte Contempor√°neo, Mexico City, Mexico * Museo Rufino Tamayo, Mexico City, Mexico * Smithsonian Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington DC ReferencesExternal links *Mario Garc√≠a Torres at Guggenheim Museums' website. *Mario Garc√≠a Torres at MoMA's website. *Theseartworks the official artist's website.

The club is based in Miami on Queensland's Gold Coast.http://www.greenandgoldrugby.com/bond-pirates-a-cinderella-story/ History The Bond Pirates are an amalgamation of two early GCDRU clubs, the Pirates and Bond University. The original Bond University club was based on the same field as the current one, but relations with the university were never good, and a permanent club house and change rooms were never made available. The Pirates were a loosely affiliated bunch of rugby enthusiasts with no fixed home ground who would often cobble together a team on a Saturday morning. Eventually, the two clubs, realising that something had to change in order for each to survive, agreed to combine. Initially the newly formed club remained at Bond University, but with tensions increasing over vehicle access, noise, ground and facility maintenance, and a raft of other issues, the decision was made to look for a new home. Eventually a deal was struck with the Gold Coast City Council to take over a recently vacated club house at the back of the Miami tip, in the Pizzey Park sports complex. That ground remains the home of the Bond Pirates to this day. In the years since the amalgamation, the club has played in, and lost, three first grade grand finals. 1998, 2004 and 2015. So despite winning several junior, colts and lower grade premierships, the elusive first grade flag has yet to be captured by the club.

History=Establishment= In Letter of Instructions No. 955 dated October 31, 1979, primarily issued to the Ministry of Youth and Sports Development and the Philippine Olympic Committee, President Ferdinand Marcos instructed the creation of a national sports program to develop track and field athletes. On November 8, 1979, Marcos issued Proclamation No. 1922 which authorized Gintong Alay to conduct an educational and fund campaign to aid in the generation of funds for the project and on May 2, 1980 to expand the scope of the project to include 17 other sports. On August 16, 1980, all donations, bequests and gifts to the sports program were exempted from tax. =1986 disbandment= Following the ouster of President Marcos due to the People Power Revolution in February 1986, the Gintong Alay program was effectively ended. =Revival and later succession by the PSC= In 1987, the program was revived albeit in a smaller scale to prepare and train the Philippine delegate which participated at the 1987 Southeast Asian Games. Gintong Alay would be later replaced with the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) which was established in 1990. Leadership The Gintong Alay Project was led by the Executive Director, the first executive director was Michael Marcos Keon from the project's establishment until the first halt of the project following the People Power Revolution. Keon was also simultaneously the president of the Philippine Olympic Committee. Joey Romasanta led Gintong Alay, after its revival in 1987. Arturo \\"Bong\\" Iligan later served as executive director. Legacy Gintong Alay set up a strong foundation in Philippine sports. According to former Executive Director, Michael Marcos Keon, the succeeding officials after him were able to continue the momentum made by the Gintong Alay project citing the overall performance of the Philippines at the 1991 Southeast Asian Games where the country won 91 gold medal-only one medal short from becoming the overall champions. However Keon, said from 1991, Philippine sports went downhill despite continued breaking of national records in measurable sports by Filipino athletes and said that other Southeast Asian and Asian countries are improving in sports more rapidly. He cited the palakasan system, bata-bata (favouritism), and politicking as hindrance to development in Philippine sports. The initiative led to the Philippines in winning in international competitions especially in track and field in the 1980s. During the program's tenure, Keon discovered Lydia de Vega, eventually she became the \\"Asia's Sprint Queen\\" and Isidro del Prado, a two-time Olympian in track and field. Under Ferdinand Marcos, the Philippines was always within the top three at the overall standing of the Southeast Asian Games (2nd in 1983, 3rd in 1985 and 1987)However the country's performance went plummeted the next editions finishing 5th ahead only of Myanmar, Vietnam, Laos, and Brunei, which were considered minnows during that time and only receiving two brief success in 2005 when the country managed to become overall champions of the regional tournament and finishing 2nd in 1991; both success were from editions hosted by the nation.

In tracking deaths, Ghany has said he used similar tactics to those of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, but the SNHR only count civilians. Ghany said accurate counting was immensely challenging due to a number of factors including the complexity of the conflict, the lack of direct access to conflict areas, and ethnic and political divisions. During the month of March 2017, according to figures released by the SNHR, more Syrian civilians were killed by United States-led coalitions than by ISIS or Russian-led forces. The SNHR acknowledged the real number of civilians killed in the conflict could be much higher because of the difficulties in keeping track of victims. In 2018, The Violations Documentation Center in Syria (VDC) counted nearly 9,500 deaths in detention since 2011, compared to over 13,000 counted by the SNHR.

Barnard said a death had to be reported by a family member or a direct witness and they did not take third party accounts. She added that they took phone calls and had a form on their website, and then they went through and verified what they could in the detailed report.

He was identified as the author of the 1504 fatwa commonly named the Oran fatwa, instructing the Muslims in Spain about how to secretly practice Islam, and granting comprehensive dispensations for them to publicly conform to Christianity and performing acts normally forbidden in Islam when necessary to survive. Because of his authorship of the fatwa he is often referred to as \\"the Mufti of Oran\\", although he likely issued the fatwa in Fez, not in Oran and he did not have any official capacity in either city.  Name  His name was given in various forms and rendition, both by surviving manuscripts of his works and by modern scholars. His full name is made up of several names: * Abu al-Abbas, meaning \\"father of al-Abbas\\", possibly a kunya or teknonym * Ahmad is presumably his given name. * ibn (or bin) Abi (or Abu) Jum'ah is a patronymic name, meaning \\"son of Abu Jum'ah\\" * al-Maghrawi is a nisba, a name signifying place of origin or tribal affiliation. Its meaning is contested. An opinion, argued by Mikel de Epalza and Jean Cantineau said that it means \\"of Almagro\\", implying that he was a Spanish Muslim who had later fled to North Africa. Devin J. Stewart, while agreeing that al-Maghrawi must be a toponymic, instead argued that it refers to Maghrawah, an area in north-western Algeria. While an opinion, argued by L. P. Harvey held that it means \\"of the Maghrawa [tribe]\\". * al-Wahrani is another nisba, which means \\"of Oran\\", referring to the city of Oran (,Wahran) in today's Western Algeria. In some of the manuscripts the name \\"Ubaydallah\\" is also added, a theophoric name that means \\"the little servant of God\\", and was likely added as a pious formula. His various names, and the various renditions and combinations that appear in various manuscripts and transliterations, have given rise to occasional confusions. The renditions that appeared include: \\"Ahmed ben Juma'a\\", \\"Ubaydallah Ahmed Ben Bu Jumu'ah\\", \\"Ahmad fijo de Abu Jumu'ah\\", \\"Obaydala Ahmed Abenabigiomoa\\", \\"Ubayd Allah al-Wahrani\\" and \\"Ahmad Bu Jum'a\\".  Biography  There are several contradicting theories about his birth and childhood. He may have been born in Oran, then part of the Zayyanid kingdom of Tlemcen, or in the nearby region of Maghrawah. In either way, he was presumably of Berber origin and belonged to the Maghrawah tribal confederation. Some opinions also say that he was a native of Spain, born in Almagro. His date of birth is unknown, but estimated to be in the mid- fifteenth century. He studied in Oran in his early years, then moved to Tlemcen, the nearest major capital to get an education in Islamic law and theology. He studied under Muhammad ibn Yusuf al-Sanusi, a well-known Islamic scholar. In Tlemcen he wrote Jami' Jawami' al-Ikhtisar wa al-Tibyan and had a teaching position. At some point (estimated to be around 1493), he moved to Fez and obtained a salaried position as a professor of law. He issued the Oran fatwa in 1504, likely when he was in Fez. He died in Fez in 3 June 1511. His son, Muhammad Shaqrun would also become an Islamic scholar. Because of his authorship of the Oran fatwa, he has frequently been referred to as \\"the Mufti of Oran\\", suggesting that he wrote the fatwa there and he had some sort of official authority as a mufti. However, Devin J. Stewart noted that he was active in Fez (in today's Morocco), not Oran, at the time of the fatwa's composition, and likely penned it there. His name did not appear in the list of official muftis of Fez, so it is likely that the fatwa was not issued in any official capacity, but as a private mufti issuing a legal opinion on request. In theory, any competent Islamic jurist could issue a fatwa, although normally it carries less weight than ones from an official mufti.  Works = Oran fatwa = He is best known for the responsum fatwa commonly named by modern scholar as the Oran fatwa. The name \\"Oran fatwa\\" itself was given by modern scholars due to the name al-Wahrani (\\"of Oran\\") that appeared in the text as part of his name. The fatwa instructed the Muslims in Spain about how to secretly practice Islam, and granted comprehensive dispensations for them to publicly conform to Christianity and perform acts normally forbidden in Islam when necessary to survive. The fatwa, while reaffirming the orthodox obligation of all Muslims, sets out detailed relaxations of the sharia requirements for the benefit of the persecuted Muslims of Spain. The fatwa allowed for outwardly conforming to Christianity and performing acts that are ordinarily forbidden in Islamic law when necessary to survive, while maintaining internal convictions against such acts. The fatwa enjoyed wide currency among Muslims and Moriscos (Muslims nominally converted to Christianity and their descendants) in Spain, and one of the surviving aljamiado translations was dated at 1564, 60 years after the original fatwa. The fatwa has been described as the \\"key theological document\\" to understand the practice of Spanish Muslims following the Reconquista up to the expulsion of the Moriscos. = Other works = He wrote Jami' Jawami' al-Ikhtisar wa al- Tibyan fima ya'rudu bayna al-mu'allimin wa aba al-sibyan (\\"The Epitome of Epitomes of Competence and Explanation, on What Arises Between Teachers and the Fathers of Boys\\"), a treatise on elementary education while in Tlemcen.

In the end he only managed to get 6 wins and went 6‚Äì9 in the end. 2016 proved overall to be a good year for Mitakeumi having three tournaments with double digit wins, winning his first prize, and making it to komusubi, and he was the 53rd winner of the annual \\"best makuuchi newcomer\\" award sponsored by ChuSpo. Mitakeumi began the Hatsu tournament in January 2017 with a win over ≈çzeki G≈çeid≈ç, and on Day 2 he earned his first kinboshi (a yokozuna upset by a wrestler from the maegashira ranks) when he defeated Harumafuji. He also defeated yokozuna Kakury≈´ on Day 4. He finished with 11 wins and was awarded a Technique prize for his performance in this tournament. He returned to the sanyaku ranks in the March 2017 tournament at komusubi, and came through with a winning record of 9‚Äì6. In May he defeated Kakury≈´ on Day 1 and Harumafuji on Day 11 (which was Harumafuji's first loss in the tournament). He finished with an 8‚Äì7 record and received the Outstanding Performance Award for the first time. He was promoted to sekiwake for the July 2017 tournament, the first wrestler from Dewanoumi stable to achieve this since Dewanohana in 1982. In this tournament he defeated yokozuna Kisenosato on opening day, and tournament leader Hakuh≈ç on Day 11, who was on a 25-match winning streak and hoping to equal the all-time career wins record of 1047. Mitakeumi's only previous win over Hakuh≈ç had been by default when the yokozuna pulled out of the March 2017 tournament through injury. He ended the tournament with a 9‚Äì6 record and received a second consecutive Outstanding Performance award. In an interview immediately after the tournament he commented \\"I didn't think I would be able to win this award twice in a row so I am pleased. It was good that I was able to wrestle my brand of sumo at this tournament, win on the last day and also get a victory against Hakuho\\". Mitakeumi maintained his sekiwake rank in the September and November tournaments, and was the only top division wrestler to secure a majority of wins against losses in every tournament of 2017. In January 2018 he started well with seven straight wins but he recorded only one more win (over Kakury≈´) in the tournament. A 7‚Äì8 result in March saw him demoted to komusubi but he rebounded with 9 wins in May to return to sekiwake. The 2018 Nagoya tournament in July saw many injury withdrawals (ky≈´j≈ç): Kisenosato did not start the tournament, and by day 6 he had been joined on the injured list by Hakuh≈ç, Kakury≈´ and the newly promoted ≈çzeki Tochinoshin. Mitakeumi won his first eleven matches and appeared to have extended his run against the ≈çzeki Takayasu on day 12 but the referee's decision was overturned by the judges. After a win over the ≈çzeki G≈çeid≈ç the following afternoon he clinched the title on day 14 with a yorikiri victory over Tochi≈çzan. Interviewed immediately after the match he had difficult responding to questions as he struggled to control his emotions and repeatedly broke down in tears. He became the first wrestler from the Dewanoumi stable to win a top- division title in since Mienoumi in 1980. Despite losing to Yutakayama in his final match he was awarded the Emperor's Cup as champion as well as the special prizes for technique and outstanding performance. Addressing the crowd after the presentation of the trophies he said \\"It‚Äôs simply awesome. I‚Äôve never spoken in front of such a big crowd. I probably won‚Äôt remember what I said here. I wanted to end on a good note with a win, but I think I still need to get stronger. I wasn‚Äôt able to push my opponent out, so I think I‚Äôll have to go back and practice.\\" He received plenty of local support as the Nagoya tournament is held close to his hometown of Agematsu. Despite speculation that Mitakeumi could be promoted to ≈çzeki with another good performance in September, he lost five bouts in a row from Days 8 to 12, and ended with only a 9‚Äì6 record. He lost his sekiwake rank after a make-koshi 7‚Äì8 record in November, but began the January 2019 tournament with five straight wins before injuring his knee in a Day 6 defeat to My≈çgiry≈´. Forced to sit out Days 7 to 10 due to the injury, he returned on Day 11 and defeated Hakuh≈ç, handing the yokozuna his first loss of the tournament. He finished the tournament with eight wins and was awarded the Outstanding Performance Award for defeating both two yokozuna as well as the tournament winner Tamawashi. He became the first wrestler since special prizes were established in 1947 to win one despite missing some bouts through injury. Despite a 7-8 performance in March he retained his komusubi status and secured a return to sekiwake with nine wins in May. Another nine wins in July meant that he entered the next tournament in san'yaku for the 16th consecutive time. The 2019 September tournament saw the upper ranks depleted as the ≈çzeki Takayasu sat out the tournament while the two active yokozuna, Hakuh≈ç and Kakury≈´ withdrew by the end of the first week. After losing to Asanoyama in his first match Mitakeumi won his next six bouts before losing tamely to Takakeish≈ç on day 8. He remained in contention throughout the second week despite a loss to Ry≈´den on day 11 and a victory over G≈çeid≈ç on day 14 (in which he employed a henka) saw him enter the final day in a three-way tie for the lead alongside Okinoumi and Takakeish≈ç. After Takakeish≈ç defeated Okinoumi, Mitakeumi secured his place in a play-off for the title with a yorikiri win over End≈ç. In the play-off Mitakeumi evaded Takakeish≈ç's attempt at a pull-down, secured a double inside grip and quickly forced his rival over the bales to win his second top division championship and the Outstanding Performance Award as well. Mitakeumi needed a strong performance and record in the November 2019 basho to secure a promotion to ≈çzeki. On Day 3, he badly injured his right eye in his win over Meisei. Mitakeumi never recovered after that, finishing with a losing record of 6‚Äì9 and eliminating all chances for a promotion. Instead, he was demoted from sekiwake all the way down to West Maegashira #2 for the January 2020 basho. This was his first time in the maegashira ranks since January 2017. In the March 2020 basho he posted 10 wins, securing his promotion to Sekiwake for the July 2020 Basho, where he posted 11 wins and is now on another ozeki run. Fighting style Mitakeumi prefers pushing and thrusting moves as opposed to fighting on the opponent's mawashi or belt. His most common winning techniques are oshidashi, the push out, yorikiri, the force out and hatakikomi the slap down. Mitakeumi emphasizes speed in his tachi-ai, and attempts to be the first wrestler in each match to take two steps toward his opponent rather than one. He trains by unconventional methods, such as jumping rope and running uphill, to gain additional speed.NHK World, GRAND SUMO Highlights Preview, 8 September 2017 Career recordSee also *List of sumo tournament top division champions *List of sumo tournament second division champions *List of active gold star earners *Glossary of sumo terms *List of active sumo wrestlers *List of sekiwake References External links  * Category:1992 births Category:Living people Category:Japanese people of Filipino descent Category:Japanese sumo wrestlers Category:Sumo people from Nagano Prefecture Category:Sekiwake ","title":"Mitakeumi Hisashi"},{"id":"49139829","text":"Sunset Eyes is an album by saxophonist Teddy Edwards recorded in 1960 and released on the Pacific Jazz label.Pacific Jazz Records Catalog: 10000/20000 series accessed January 12, 2016Teddy Edwards catalog accessed January 12, 2016Teddy Edwards discography accessed February 28, 2018Enciclopedia del Jazz: Teddy Edwards accessed February 28, 2018 Reception Allmusic awarded the album 4 stars stating \\"Since the great Teddy Edwards never recorded an uninspiring record, this date is easily recommended to fans of straight-ahead jazz\\".

He is in the Tokitsukaze stable. He is a right hand inside-type wrestler. His highest rank is ≈çzeki. He has one gold star for defeating a yokozuna and seven special prizes, six for Fighting Spirit and one for Outstanding Performance. He was runner-up in two tournaments before winning his first top-division championship in September 2020. Early life and sumo background Sh≈çdai Naoya‚Äôs talents were first noticed by the coach of the Uto Boys Sumo Club while he was playing sumo in the park at Uto Elementary School. In 5th grade he competed in the national sumo competition, and while at Kakuj≈ç Middle School he was an alternate member of the winning team at the All-Middle School sumo championship. In his final year at Kumamoto agricultural high school he won the youth national sumo championship.„Éô„Éº„Çπ„Éú„Éº„É´„Éª„Éû„Ç¨„Ç∏„É≥Á§æÂàä „ÄéÁõ∏Êí≤„Äè 2014Âπ¥4ÊúàÂè∑ÔºàÊò•Â†¥ÊâÄÁ∑èÊ±∫ÁÆóÂè∑Ôºâ 107È†Å Sh≈çdai went on to university at Tokyo University of Agriculture, where he studied international food information sciences in the international agricultural development department. He became a university yokozuna in his second year, and met the qualifications to join professional sumo at the makushita 15 rank as a tsukedashi,‰ºèÂÖµ„ÄÅÊ≠£‰ª£„ÅåÂàù„ÅÆÂ≠¶ÁîüÊ®™Á∂± ÂÖ®ÂõΩÂ≠¶ÁîüÁõ∏Êí≤ÈÅ∏ÊâãÊ®© Á¶è‰∫ïÊñ∞ËÅû 2011Âπ¥11Êúà5Êó•Ôºà2015Âπ¥2Êúà24Êó•Èñ≤Ë¶ßÔºâ however he gave preference to finishing school and missed the one year time limit to accept this opportunity. In his third year at university he advanced to the All-Japan sumo championship, however he lost to End≈ç and therefore did not attain the amateur yokozuna title that year. He also did not qualify for tsukedashi in his 4th year at university. Career After graduating from university, he joined the Tokitsukaze stable and entered his first tournament in March 2014. Because he missed his opportunity to start in the makushita ranks as a tsukedashi, he began in maezumo in this tournament. He lost on the 5th day to Shiba, however finishing with a 2‚Äì1 record allowed him to continue to the professional ranks. In May when ranked in jonokuchi (the beginning level of professional sumo), he faced Shiba on day 5 and beat him for the first time. He went on to finish with a 7‚Äì0 record and take the jonokuchi championship.„ÄêÂ§èÂ†¥ÊâÄ„ÄëÊ≠£‰ª£„ÄÅÂ∫è„ÉéÂè£ÂÖ®ÂãùÔº∂„ÄåÁõÆÊ®ô„ÅØÂπ¥ÂÜÖ„Å´Âπï‰∏ã„Äç „Çπ„Éù„Éº„ÉÑÂ†±Áü• 2014Âπ¥5Êúà23Êó•Ôºà2015Âπ¥2Êúà24Êó•Èñ≤Ë¶ßÔºâ This propelled him into the next higher level of sumo, jonidan, in the July tournament, where he finished with a 6‚Äì1 record, and advanced to the next higher level, sandanme in the September tournament. He faced Shiba again on day 9 and lost, however his 6‚Äì1 record was good enough to advance him to the next higher level, makushita in the November tournament. He lost his third and fourth matches in this tournament to Higoarashi and Asatenmai, however still finished with a promising 5‚Äì2 record which allowed him to advance higher up the makushita ranks. In the January 2015 tournament he was concerned that diarrhea and a bacterial infection would affect his performance,„Éô„Éº„Çπ„Éú„Éº„É´„Éª„Éû„Ç¨„Ç∏„É≥Á§æÂàä „ÄéÁõ∏Êí≤„Äè 2015Âπ¥2ÊúàÂè∑ÔºàÂàùÂ†¥ÊâÄÁ∑èÊ±∫ÁÆóÂè∑Ôºâ 76È†Å however he was able to win the tournament with a perfect 7‚Äì0 record when he beat Ishiura, who was promoted to j≈´ry≈ç, on the last day.Âπï‰∏ãÂÑ™Âãù„ÅØÂÖÉÂ≠¶ÁîüÊ®™Á∂±„ÅÆÊ≠£‰ª£ ‰∏âÊÆµÁõÆ„ÅØÁ´úÈõª„ÅåÂà∂Ë¶á „Çπ„Éù„Éã„ÉÅ„Ç¢„Éç„ÉÉ„ÇØ„Çπ 2015Âπ¥1Êúà23Êó•Ôºà2015Âπ¥2Êúà24Êó•Èñ≤Ë¶ßÔºâ In the next three tournaments in makushita he attained winning records and was promoted to j≈´ry≈ç in the September 2015 tournament.Êù±Ëæ≤Â§ßÂá∫Ë∫´„ÅÆÊ≠£‰ª£„ÅåÊñ∞ÂçÅ‰∏° ÁßãÂ†¥ÊâÄÁï™‰ªòÁ∑®Êàê‰ºöË≠∞ Êó•Âàä„Çπ„Éù„Éº„ÉÑ 2015Âπ¥7Êúà29Êó•Ôºà2015Âπ¥7Êúà29Êó•Èñ≤Ë¶ßÔºâ He kept his family name, Sh≈çdai, rather than change his name as most sumo wrestlers do.

He also became tied for third fastest wrestler to reach the highest level of sumo since 1958 (excluding tsukedashi) at only 11 tournaments. As opposed to another wrestler, Kagayaki, who also was making his top level debut and earned only a 4‚Äì11 record, Sh≈çdai earned an impressive 10‚Äì5 record, continued his streak of no losing tournaments, and also took the Fighting Spirit prize. He became number two on the all-time list for fastest attainment of a special prize at 12 tournaments since entering sumo, second only to former Yokozuna Wakanohana, who took the Fighting Spirit prize in his 9th tournament in January 1950. In November 2016 he scored eleven wins against four losses from the rank of maegashira 3, sharing the Fighting Spirit prize with Ishiura. He defeated ozeki Kisenosato in this tournament and was promoted to a career-high rank of sekiwake for the January tournament. It took him only 17 tournaments from his professional debut to reach sekiwake, which is the second fastest (after Konishiki's 14) since the introduction of the six tournaments a year system in 1958 for those starting from maezumo. He narrowly missed out on a winning record in his sekiwake debut, and remained in the junior sanyaku ranks for the following tournament at komusubi. However, he won only four bouts and was demoted back to the maegashira ranks for the May 2017 tournament. In July, ranked at maegashira 1, he earned his first kinboshi or gold star by defeating yokozuna Harumafuji on Day 2. He remained near the top of the maegashira ranks in his next few tournaments. In November 2019 he was a runner-up to Hakuh≈ç with an 11‚Äì4 record and earned the Fighting Spirit Prize by defeating Asanoyama on the final day. In January 2020 he was in contention for the championship until the final day, finishing one win behind surprise winner Tokushoryu on 13-2. He also received the Fighting Spirit prize. He returned to the sekiwake rank in March 2020 for the first time since January 2017, and to sanyaku for the first time since March 2017. He was one of only two men to defeat the tournament winner Hakuh≈ç in March and maintained his sekiwake rank with an 8‚Äì7 record. In the July 2020 tournament he won his fifth Fighting Spirit prize after a 11-4 performance in which he was one of only two wrestlers to defeat the tournament winner Terunofuji. In the September 2020 tournament Sh≈çdai won his first championship with a 13‚Äì2 record, defeating Tobizaru on the final day to avoid the need for a play-off. His only defeats were to the previous tournament winner Terunofuji on Day 4 and komusubi Okinoumi on Day 7. Sh≈çdai said \\"I was only in the sole lead on the final day, so until then I wasn't worrying about the championship race and I felt comfortable.\\" He also earned his first Outstanding Performance Prize and sixth Fighting Spirit Prize. He is the first Kumamoto Prefecture native to win a top division championship. =Promotion to ≈çzeki= The Sumo Associaiton announced after the September 2020 basho that they would convene an extraordinary meeting to discuss Sh≈çdai's promotion to the second-highest rank of ≈çzeki. Even though he finished with 32 wins over the previous three tournaments - one short of the conventional guideline - it was decided that Sh≈çdai's consistent performances since the November 2019 basho were enough for him to be considered for ≈çzeki promotion. The promotion was unanimously approved on 30 September 2020. In his acceptance speech, Sh≈çdai said that he would devote himself to the way of sumo \\"with the spirit of utmost sincerity so as not to disgrace the name of ≈çzeki.\\" He later told reporters that he was \\"relieved\\" and that he was \\"in a position where you are expected not to lose.\\" He is the first ≈çzeki from Kumamoto Prefecture since Tochihikari was promoted in 1962. Fighting style Sh≈çdai is a yotsu-sumo wrestler who prefers grappling techniques to pushing his opponents. His favoured grip on the mawashi or belt is migi-yotsu, a left hand outside, right hand inside position. His most common winning kimarite is a straightforward yori-kiri or force out.

After graduating from high school in Georgetown, Ali left on 12 August 1957 for London, intending to study economics,\\"A lifetime in publishing: Arif Ali and the Hansib story\\", Stabroek News, 3 September 2008. and arrived at Victoria Station on 3 September,Hoyles (2015), p. 104. having travelled to Britain via the Canary Islands, Spain, Italy and France.Adwoa Korkor, \\"Forty and still going strong\\", Angela Cobbinah, 30 October 2010. He initially worked at different jobs, including on the buses and as a porter in a hospital ‚Äî where in 1958 he met a young English nurse named Pamela who three months later became his wife.Hoyles (2015), p. 108. =First business ventures= In 1966 Ali started to run a greengrocer's in Tottenham Lane, an area with a significant Caribbean population in north London, and before long, as Carolyn Cooper notes, \\"his business place became a vibrant cultural centre\\".Carolyn Cooper, \\"Seaga's Jamaica? Absolutely!\\", Jamaica Gleaner, 7 March 2010, One of the few outlets for Caribbean provisions such as yams, plantains and cassava, the shop also sold newspapers brought in from such Caribbean countries as Guyana, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados: \\"The newspapers served to connect West Indians in the diaspora with their respective home territories.\\" Ali progressed from this to producing on a Gestetner machine a cheaply priced compilation of articles called The Westindian, a venture that proved successful. He sold the food shop and in 1970 founded Hansib Publications ‚Äî named after his parents, Haniff and Nasibun (Sibby) ‚Äî specifically to cater for this readership and in April 1971 the company published The Westindian Digest, a magazine for Britain's West Indian communities.Hoyles (2015), pp. 112‚Äì13. In 1973 Hansib published its first book, edited by Ali and entitled Westindians in Great Britain.Hoyles (2015), p. 142. New editions of this \\"Who's Who\\" came out in subsequent years, and with the fifth edition in 1982, the name of the publication was changed to Third World Impact.Hoyles (2015), p. 144. =Newspaper publishing= Ali's career as a newspaper publisher started in 1973 with the acquisition of West Indian World from its then owner Aubrey Baynes, who had launched the paper in mid-1971 but had become disillusioned with its financial viability.Lionel Morrison, A Century of Black Journalism in Britain: A Kaleidoscopic View of Race and the Media (1893-2003), Truebay Ltd, 2007, p. 36. . Under Ali's editorship the West Indian World prospered, campaigning on various educational issues that were affecting black schoolchildren in Britain. Ali went on to further engage and communicate with the Caribbean, African and Asian communities by establishing the Asian Digest (August 1980),Hoyles (2015), p. 117. the newspapers Caribbean Times (1981), Asian Times (1983) and African Times (1985), as well as Root magazine (1987).\\"About Us\\", Hansib website. By the 1990s he had a staff of 140, publishing three weekly papers and two monthly magazines. The circulation of the Caribbean Times peaked at 28,000, with average sales of about 10,000 copies.Hoyles (2015), p. 134. =Book publishing= In 1997 Ali sold his newspapers in order to concentrate on book publishing, and Hansib remains \\"the biggest and most diverse black book publisher in Britain\\". Talking to The Guardian in 2010, Ali said: \\"In the 1960s, mainstream European-led publishing houses rarely published black and minority ethnic (BME) writers' work, if at all. Little positive was written about us, our cultures, our backgrounds and performances. I went into publishing to print stories and feelings that needed telling and would not be produced elsewhere.\\"Fay Wertheimer, \\"Minority publisher celebrates 40th birthday\\", The Guardian, 24 November 2010. By the time of its 40th anniversary, in 2010, Hansib had brought out more than 200 titles,Angela Cobbinah, \\"Caribbean Publishing in Britain: A Tribute to Arif Ali, by Asher and Martin Hoyles\\" , Camden Review, 22 September 2011. in categories encompassing politics, history, culture, sport, cookery, to multicultural literature including poetry, fiction and memoir, with claims to have for more than four decades \\"reflected and chronicled the achievements and struggles, the turmoils and frustrations, and the hopes and dreams of Britain's Caribbean, African and Asian communities.\\" Ali himself has edited some of the company's successful titles, such as the Nations Series, illustrated portraits of countries, such as Jamaica Absolutely, Trinidad and Tobago: Terrific and Tranquil and Guyana at 50: Reflection, Celebration and Inspiration.Sharon Millar, \\"Caribbean Bookshelf\\", Caribbean Beat, Issue 88 (November/December 2007).\\"Hansib Publications\\", They Gave the Crowd Plenty Fun. In parallel with his publishing activities, Ali has been involved over the years with various black political organisations, and was public relations officer for the West Indian Standing Conference, an umbrella organisation comprising more than 40 UK-based African and Caribbean groups.Hoyles (2015), p. 138.

The album features \\"Microon\\" compositions containing recordings of a 16th tone interval tuning piano‚ÄîPiano Metamorfoseador Carrillo en Dieciseisavos de Tono. The album also features two covers of the track \\"By This River\\" originally composed by Brian Eno, Dieter Moebius, and Hans-Joachim Roedelius in 1977. The initial letters of the five albums in the series‚ÄîVrioon (2002), Insen (2005), Revep (2006), utp_ (2008), and Summvs (2011)‚Äîtogether form the word \\"Virus\\". Reception Mark Jarnes of The Japan Times commented \\"Sakamoto‚Äôs haunting piano-based arrangements ‚Äî as well as his masterful understanding of silence ‚Äî effortlessly coalesce with Nicolai‚Äôs digital rhythms and accompaniment, creating a work of musical art that is as provocative as it is meditative. OK, so technically because this album was pressed by German label Raster-Noton, it‚Äôs not strictly a Japanese release. However, Sakamoto‚Äôs contribution makes it a significant step forward for Japan‚Äôs avant-garde scene ‚Äî not just musically, but also artistically\\".

Shortly before its premiere, it was acquired for theatrical distribution by Sony Pictures Classics and was released in the United States on July 29, 2016 to positive critical reviews. Plot Naomi Bishop (Anna Gunn) is a senior investment banker who deals with IPOs. After her latest project is undervalued she faces professional setbacks including clients losing confidence in her work. To bounce back she is hired to handle the IPO for Cachet, a privacy company with a social networking platform. Around the same time Naomi bumps into Samantha Ryan (Alysia Reiner), an old college classmate who now works as a public attorney. Unbeknownst to Naomi, Samantha is investigating Naomi's on-again, off-again boyfriend Michael Connor (James Purefoy), a broker at the same firm as Naomi who Samantha suspects is involved in insider trading. Michael tries to get information from Naomi about Cachet but fails. While doing due diligence, Naomi learns from Marin, one of the coders, that Cachet is hackable. Despite having a nagging feeling that something is wrong, the numbers check out and Naomi continues to try to sell the shares of the company to investors. Michael, who has had no new insider trading tips to pass on to his friends at investment firm Titanite, tries unsuccessfully to hack into Naomi's phone. Vice President Erin Manning (Sarah Megan Thomas), Naomi's assistant on the IPO, learns that Marin has been fired. To warn Naomi of this, she goes to Michael's home after not being able to reach Naomi and ends up leaking the information to him in the hope that he will be able to get her a promotion, something Naomi has been unable to do for her. Michael leaks the tips to his friends at Titanite and then sends the story to an old college roommate who is a tech journalist. Naomi figures out that it was Erin who betrayed her, based on her having a green pen, the same type of pen that Michael uses. When the shares open, confidence is lost and the company loses a third of its value on the first day of trading. Michael changes jobs to Titanite, neglecting to take Erin with him. Naomi is fired, while Erin assumes her position. Unable to crack the case from the outside, Samantha interviews for a high-paying corporate position, saying that she is in it for the money using words from a speech she heard Naomi give at an alumni event.

The corps was the parent unit for Soviet interceptor units based in northeastern Manchuria during the Korean War.  History  Three MiG-15s attacking B-29s in 1951 The Korean War broke out in June 1950. On 11 October 1950, Stalin agreed to send Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 fighters of the Soviet Air Forces to provide air cover for the Chinese Communist People's Volunteer Army units then moving into North Korea. Tasked with providing air cover for bridges and for the hydroelectric power plants on the Yalu River, as well as for North Korean facilities and for the Chinese Communist rear area, 64th IAK pilots also trained Chinese Communist and North Korean pilots.Popov, Lavrenyov and Bogdanov, p. 263 On 1 November, Soviet MiG-15s began defensive patrols over the Yalu River. The 64th Fighter Aviation Corps, established on 14 November, comprised the 28th, 50th and 151st Guards Fighter Aviation Divisions. It was first commanded by Major General Ivan Belov. The Mig-15s of the 64th IAK began to clash with United Nations jet fighters, such as the North American F-86 Sabre. On 1 November 1951, the 64th IAK became part of the People's Liberation Army Air Force's 1st United Air Army. In March 1952, the corps received new MiG-15bis aircraft.Seidov and Britton p. 356 On 21 April 1952, pilots of the corps shot down two F-86s while losing six MiGs.Seidov and Brittain p. 364 On 4 July, the corps suffered its heaviest losses of the war when it lost 11 MiGs. During the Korean War, the corps flew 64,000 sorties and conducted 1,872 air battles. According to the inflated official totals of the corps, 1,250 UN Forces aircraft were shot down, 1,100 by MiGs and 150 by antiaircraft artillery. The corps lost 335 aircraft, killing 120 pilots and 68 antiaircraft gunners.Popov, Lavrenyov and Bogdanov, pp, 272‚Äì274 After the cease-fire of 27 July 1953, the corps withdrew from Korea. It moved to Petrozavodsk and became part of the 22nd Air Army. In Karelia, the corps included the 26th, 216th and 336th Fighter Aviation Divisions. The corps disbanded in 1956.  Composition  The composition of the corps constantly varied. During the war, the corps went through 12 fighter aviation divisions, two separate night fighter regiments, 2 Naval Aviation fighter wings, four antiaircraft artillery divisions and different rear units. The corps was composed of 26,000 personnel in 1952. On 1 November of the same year, 321 aircraft were in the combat units. The participation of the Soviet Union in the Korean War was kept secret, and pilots were forbidden to approach the front line or fly over the sea. The aircraft used PLAAF markings and pilots were given Chinese Communist documents and uniforms. During the early actions, they were required to not speak Russian during missions and had to learn Korean phrases. After the first battles, the requirement was removed because it was practically impossible.Seidov and Brittain p. 35 The details of the Soviet participation in the Korean War were published in the Soviet Union only during the 1970s and 1980s.

It was designed by Tunbridge & Tunbridge and built from 1895 to 1896 by Jeremiah Dempsey. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992. It was completely destroyed by fire on 8 June 2018.  History  The Victoria Park Hotel was the second hotel constructed on this site and was opened in 1896. It was designed by the Townsville architectural firm of Tunbridge and Tunbridge, and was constructed by local builder Jeremiah Dempsey. Townsville was established in 1864 by partners John Melton Black and Robert Towns and was gazetted as a port of entry in 1865. It grew quickly as a supply centre and by 1873 the port was receiving international as well as coastal traffic. Improvements were carried out to port facilities to allow larger ships to anchor. By 1880 Townsville was the port for several major goldfields and had opened the first stage of the Great Northern railway line westwards through Charters Towers and beyond, consolidating its importance as a port and mercantile centre. South Townsville was the second area settled in Townsville and soon had a number of hotels, houses and a hospital. By 1890 the suburb had grown substantially. In an era when private transport was expensive and public transport scarce, working people lived near their work. The presence of the Cleveland Foundry, railway and boat building workshops and other industries therefore attracted families to the south side of Ross Creek. Further development between 1890‚Äì95, including the establishment of Rooney & Company's sawmill and workshop, Victoria Foundry and the Ross River Meatworks, brought a further influx of people to live in South Townsville. The corner of Main (now Boundary Street) and Sixth Avenue was an ideal location for the new hotel because it was close to the recently opened Victoria Foundry, the residential areas of South Townsville and Railway Estate and to Victoria Park, which in 1891 was the only ground suitable for playing football in Townsville. The land at that time was owned by William Casey who had purchased it in 1888. The Victoria Park Hotel was designed by the local architectural firm of Tunbridge and Tunbridge in 1895. Walter Howard Tunbridge was born and trained in England as an architect. In 1884 he migrated to Australia and worked for Rooney Bros in Townsville. He left to establish his own practice in 1886 and invited his younger brother, Oliver, to join him in 1887. This partnership subsequently became an important architectural and civil engineering firm in North Queensland. The hotel was constructed by local builder Jeremiah Dempsey. On the 9 October 1895, the night before the licensee, Jane Guthrie, was to take possession of the completed hotel, it was destroyed by fire. A second building, of similar design, was begun on the same site. In November 1895, prior to the completion of the second building, the site was leased to Townsville merchant firm, Samuel Allen & Company. They sublet to Jane Guthrie who opened the new hotel, constructed at a cost of ¬£1300, in January 1896. The hotel catered largely for working people from the wharves, the railway, meatworks and foundry and at weekends, sportsmen from nearby Victoria Park. In 1898 Northern Breweries (Qld) Ltd took over the lease from Samuel Allen and Company. They sublet the property to Adelaide Joyce in January 1899. Samuel Allen and Company, who purchased the property in 1907, retained ownership until 1945 when they sold to Emily Hall of Bondi Junction, New South Wales. She leased the property to Townsville firm Cummins and Campbell who eventually purchased the hotel on 6 October 1969 and sold it in 1985. The hotel has since changed hands again and has had a history of leasing and sub-leasing to publicans. Over the years other sporting venues developed, providing competition to Victoria Park, and many industries in the area closed. The character of the surrounding residential area has changed as earlier residents died or moved away. However, the hotel, locally known as the \\"Vic Park\\", attracted a regular clientele with a strong affection for it. In 1982, when the Licensing Commission proposed that the hotel should be demolished, there was a community outcry. It was largely due to the efforts of the hotel's patrons in attracting media attention and public support that the building was retained and underwent extensive repair and renovation. As part of these renovations, the bar area was enlarged and new toilets constructed, but the general appearance and layout of the hotel remained the same. On 8 June 2018, the hotel was completely destroyed by fire, with the blaze being so intense that firefighters were initially unable to enter the property. It was reported that all that was left of the hotel was a \\"large pile of rubble\\". The hotel was listed for sale at the time of its destruction, with an asking price of $2.5 million.  Description  The Victoria Park Hotel was a two-storey timber structure situated at the corner of Boundary Street and Sixth Avenue, South Townsville and has major elevations to both streets and a corner entrance. The hotel was approximately L-shaped in plan with the roof, core structure and awnings truncated at the corner facing the intersection. The roof was hipped and clad in corrugated iron. The hotel had exposed exterior studding and was shaded at the street elevations by a balcony on the upper storey and a wider awning that spanned the pavement at street level. The awnings to both levels are of corrugated iron supported on timber posts. The balcony to the upper floor has dowel balustrading. The hotel has several entrances on the ground floor, with accommodation above, following the usual internal layout of two storey hotels in Queensland. The principal entrance was at the street corner and opened onto a large public bar. Leading from this on the Boundary street side was a lounge and dining area. The original timber ceiling remained above a modern suspended ceiling. The kitchen and pantries were located in a single storey extension to the rear along Boundary Street. The upper floor contained accommodation for the manager and 6 guest bedrooms leading off a central hall. Guest rooms to the verandah had French doors and modern toilets had been constructed on the rear verandah at the south west. There was a beer garden behind the hotel and a 1950s brick butcher's shop on Lot 2 RP 715005 which was acquired by Cummins and Campbell in 1979.  Heritage listing  Victoria Park Hotel was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Victoria Park Hotel was constructed in 1896 to a design by the Townsville architectural firm of Tunbridge and Tunbridge and demonstrates the development of this early suburb of Townsville. The patrons were largely working people from the surrounding area, which had a considerable amount of industry, and those who used the park for weekend sports. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The building is a good example of a two-storey timber hotel of the late 19th century and is the last hotel of this type remaining in Townsville. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The building is a good example of a two- storey timber hotel of the late 19th century and is the last hotel of this type remaining in Townsville. Change to the hotel has been minimal as the exterior is virtually unchanged and the layout of the interior remains much the same following renovations. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. As a well designed timber building on a prominent corner site, the Victoria Park Hotel makes a major contribution to the built character of South Townsville and is demonstrably well liked by the community. The hotel, built by local builder Jeremiah Dempsey, has served the South Townsville community for over a hundred years as a meeting place, particularly after sporting events. Community regard for the hotel was emphasised in 1982 when regular patrons of the hotel led a successful campaign through the local media protesting the proposed demolition of the building. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The hotel is connected with the important North Queensland architectural firm of Tunbridge and Tunbridge as an example of their commercial work.

It is owned by Atlantic Cape Community College, with staff running daily behind-the-scenes operations. Live programming is produced and presented entirely by current student volunteers. History The radio station concept for the college began decades prior to its FM launch, when audio transmissions were originally being broadcast via closed circuit only. The station was first used to transmit exclusively to internal areas of the college, including the cafeteria and Student Life Center. Eventually, the station began broadcasting as an online- only internet stream that was branded as \\"WACC\\" (even though these call letters were never officially granted by the FCC). Atlantic Cape Community College first expressed an interest in offering a new radio station that would be on terrestrial FM, when they requested a low-power FM license on December 9, 2014. A construction permit was granted to the college by the FCC on January 14, 2015. Broadcast tests on the FM radio band began as early as August 2015, with a steady test of the audio occurring in January 2016. The station's license to cover was filed on March 29, 2016, with it being granted as a fully licensed radio station on April 4, 2016. While the original closed circuit audio has been discontinued, the internet stream continues to this day, now serving as a relay of the terrestrial FM signal. Programming WRML-LP is on the air 24 hours a day, and broadcasts a variety of shows that are programmed by the student body, many of whom are enrolled in broadcasting degrees. The station's format, while officially \\"college\\", can also be considered freeform. Many of the live shows on WRML take advantage of social media outlets such as Facebook and Twitter to help with independent promotion, while other programs also have full websites. Program schedules are usually updated and retooled each college semester, with some shows leaving (and new ones taking their places), due to student needs. Whenever there is no live programming by a student on the air, an automated system, Megaseg, transmits a variety of different blocks of programming, from rock and jazz, to jam sessions and popular music. = Former original programming = * \\"Tea Time\\" (love songs & soft rock) - Hosted by Adrianna Hill (discontinued in May, 2016) * \\"The Mix\\" (spanish music hits) - Hosted by Adam Chen (discontinued in May, 2016) * \\"EDM with TBM\\" (electronic dance music) - Hosted by Amador Campos (discontinued in May, 2016) * \\"Tuesday JuicePop\\" (current pop music and culture) - Hosted by Eric Conklin & Leo Garcia (discontinued in August, 2016) * \\"Hip Hop and R&Beats;\\" (hip-hop) - Hosted by Leo Garcia (discontinued in September, 2016) * \\"Groove Time\\" (smooth jazz music) - Hosted by Dorian Gilmer (discontinued in September, 2016) * \\"Highly Dysfunctional\\" (variety) - Hosted by Mike Lewis & Ashley Vassallo (discontinued in November, 2016) * \\"Music Bash\\" (hip-hop) - Hosted by Demetrius Letson (discontinued in December, 2016) * \\"Broken Radio\\" (rock & roll music) - Hosted by Dylan Graef (discontinued in December, 2016) * \\"Keepin' It Real\\" (rap music) - Hosted by Jordan Knight & Evan Barnett (discontinued in December, 2016) * \\"The Power Hour\\" (variety) - Hosted by Jonathan Santiago (discontinued in April, 2017) * \\"Millennial Memories\\" (millennial-era music) - Hosted by Maddie Brennan (discontinued in May, 2017) * \\"The Reel Deal\\" (variety) - Hosted by Eric Smith & Ethan Gabrysz (discontinued in December, 2017) * \\"The Sports Rant\\" (sports talk) - Mondays from 10am-12pm - Hosted by Dashawn Hendricks & Christian Paulino (discontinued in June, 2018) * \\"The Chef's Hour\\" (country music, classic rock & cooking talk) - Hosted by Peter Srocsynski (discontinued in June, 2018) * \\"The Renegade\\" (nineties music/post-grunge) - Hosted by Nick Derr (discontinued in June, 2018) * \\"L&G; Eats\\" (cooking talk) - Hosted by Lori Gunther & Gabby Wyand (discontinued in June, 2018) * \\"Fatale\\" (music & conversation for women) - Hosted by Meghan Clark (discontinued in June, 2018) * \\"Mellow Minutes\\" (variety) - Hosted by Mad K Productions (discontinued in June, 2018) * \\"Pop Theory\\" (variety) - Hosted by Sarah Heintz (discontinued in June, 2018) * \\"The 1\\" (sports talk) - Hosted by Dashawn Hendricks (discontinued in December, 2018) * \\"A Reason to Smile\\" (country music & rock) - Hosted by David Baurder (discontinued in December, 2018) * \\"Sound Check\\" (classic rock & alternative) - Hosted by Enzo Ronchi (discontinued in December, 2018) * \\"Gamerz\\" (variety & video game talk) - Hosted by Demetrius Letson & Kerrick Capaldi (discontinued in December, 2018) * \\"Anything Goes\\" (variety) - Hosted by Jackson Neill (discontinued in December, 2018) * \\"Genre Wake-Up\\" (alternating musical genres) - Hosted by Erik Treadwell (discontinued in December, 2018) * \\"Musical Moments\\" (jazz & rhythm/blues) - Hosted by Jamie Masso ( discontinued in December, 2018) * \\"Free Delivery\\" (avant-garde music) - Hosted by M.C.

History  The castle of Fossa is the typical result of the phenomena of encastellation that occurred in medieval times. It is located in the highest part of the village, on the eastern side of the Circolo mountain. The original structure dates back to the early 12th century and was made by the keep on the top and the fortified trapezoidal enclosure containing the first houses. The development of the village then took place outside the fence of the castle. This enclosure castle typology was quite common in the area, as seen with similar structures in San Pio delle Camere, Barisciano or Bominaco.  Architecture  The highest point of the castle consists of a circular tower, from which the walls depart delimiting the trapezoidal enclosure, surrounded by four square towers. The tower probably dates back to the 12th or 13th century, while the rest of the building probably dates to the late 13th or early 14th century. The height of the walls was between 8 and 10 meters, with a thickness of over a meter and a chemin de ronde to their summits. Two towers were located at the bottom corners of the fence and were also used as houses. Another tower is located on the north wall and the fourth one side is to the east, flanked to the southeast one. The main access to the enclosure is located on the north-east wall, and it consists of a door with a pointed arch in stone. A secondary entrance is near the southwest tower. The height of the main tower is 17 meters and its width diameter of 8 meters. It had no doors and it was accessed by a staircase that was stored inside of the building. A drawbridge connected the tower with the chemin de ronde on the walls.

The winery produces everything on-premises at their Havelock Hills site near Havelock North, south of Napier. Established in the late 19th century by the Chambers family, the winery and original vineyards were the first to be heritage-protected, and is one of New Zealand's most highly regarded wineries. The winery and vineyards are run by the Buck family: John Buck , a former chairman of the Wine Institute of New Zealand and member of the New Zealand Wine Hall of Fame, as well as his three sons Jonathan, Nick and Tobias. Te Mata's flagship Coleraine wine is regarded by many as New Zealand's finest red wine, and is named after the Buck family's ancestral hometown in Northern Ireland. Te Mata Estate relies on its long-term senior management staff, a permanent vineyard crew and a team of hand-pickers led by senior viticulturist Larry Morgan, and the winemaking team has been led for over 30 years by Technical Director Peter Cowley. Te Mata Estate is especially notable because it has hand-harvested grapes from its own vineyards and produced, blended and labelled small-batch premium wines entirely on site in the original winery buildings since 1895. New Zealand's first legally protected wine-growing area, the Te Mata Special Character Zone in the Havelock Hills, was established by the Hawke's Bay Regional Council in 1996, recognized and conserved on the basis of its unique wine-growing heritage value. History 275x275px After returning from France in 1895, the winery and site was established by Bernard Chambers on Te Mata Station, a large area of farmland the Chambers' family had bought in 1854 from NgƒÅti Kahungunu. Three vineyards were planted in the 1890s with Cabernet, Chardonnay and Pinot and incorporated into this early development, including Eighteen92 on Te Mata Road and the Elston vineyard, which was the earliest Chardonnay planting in New Zealand. These sites extend across the elevated, north-facing slopes of the Havelock Hills at the foot of Te Mata Peak and are all still in use today. With the help of the Marist brotherhood, and the Beecham family in Central Hawke's Bay, the early vineyards were recognized for their export quality by the government viticulturist Romeo Bragato in 1905. Since then Te Mata wines have been available and won praise in Europe, including a Gold Medal at the Imperial International Exhibition in 1909. In the early twentieth century Te Mata was New Zealand's largest wine producer. The main cellar was built in the 1870s from local hand-fired brick with a matai and rimu roofing, and extended to add a first-year barrel hall in the 1930s. In 1919 the Chambers family sold the property and Te Mata Vineyards was established. The Buck and Morris families bought the winery in 1974 and began significant modernization and development. =Modern History= The Buck family home, Coleraine Vineyard, across the road from Te Mata Estate. Under the direction of the Buck and Morris families the Te Mata Estate winery complex was modernized and extended in the 1980s by New Zealand architect Sir Ian Athfield. An underground barrel hall, cuverie and office buildings were added in the region's prominent Art Deco and Spanish Mission architecture as deliberate influences. Opposite the winery, the distinctive Coleraine House is a private residence that has gained much recognition as a significant work of New Zealand architecture. In 1997 it appeared on the 80c postage stamp in a series celebrating New Zealand wines. In addition to the original north-facing vineyards covering in the Havelock Hills surrounding the winery, Te Mata established in the early 1990s the Woodthorpe vineyard covering to the northeast of Havelock North, and two vineyards in the Bridge Pa Triangle west of Hastings, each covering 15 hectares. Since 2001, only half of the fruit grown on these vineyards is made under the Te Mata label. While Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay and Pinot Noir have all been planted in Te Mata vineyards since 1892, in 1994 Te Mata Estate introduced Viognier to New Zealand, followed by Gamay Noir, and the second-oldest planting of Syrah in the country. Te Mata Estate was responsible for founding the New Zealand Poet Laureate award in 1994, with the title in its first decade being the ‚ÄúTe Mata Estate Poet Laureate‚Äù. The position is now administered by the National Library of New Zealand. Each New Zealand Poet Laureate still receives support from Te Mata Estate and is inaugurated near the winery at Matahiwi Marae. The first five Poets Laureate received a tokotoko, carved from Te Mata's original wine press by Hawke's Bay artist and sculptor Jacob Scott. Production The Hawke's Bay wine growing region has a wide diversity of soil types and a climate similar to Bordeaux, with dry sunny summers and long autumns. The proximity of the Pacific Ocean makes the region maritime and temperate with a natural rain shadow which can keep soils particularly dry during ripening season. The Te Mata vineyards are on free-draining, silt loam soils, and at Bridge Pa a mixture of red metal soils over river gravel. In a typical year Te Mata Estate produces 30,000 cases of wine, most of which is sold internationally. Due to production size and reputation their top wines often sell out quickly, with the 2013 Coleraine selling out in 10 days. The use of multiple vineyard sites across Hawke's Bay is crucial to their winemaking style, allowing them to 'parcel-develop' small blocks that reflect differences in aspect, climate and soil type from within the region. Te Mata Estate is regarded as New Zealand's finest producer of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot blends, and produces a variety of other well-known wines including the Bullnose Syrah from the Bridge Pa Triangle, Awatea Cabernets/Merlot blend, Estate Vineyards Gamay Noir, the Zara Viognier, the Elston Chardonnay and Cape Crest Sauvignon Blanc - a barrel-fermented sauvignon blend similar in style to a Graves region, or southern Bordeaux white wine. Recognition Described as 'a national treasure' by jancisrobinson.com in 2018, Robert Parkers' Wine Advocate listed Te Mata Estate as one of the 5 Icon wineries of New Zealand, awarding it the classification of ‚ÄúOutstanding Producer‚Äù. Both Te Mata Estate Coleraine and Te Mata Estate Bullnose Syrah have been listed by James Suckling in the Top 50 Wines of the World.https://www.temata.co.nz/download/1015 The 1998 Te Mata Coleraine was profiled as a ‚ÄúWine Legend‚Äù by Decanter Magazine in 2017, the only New Zealand wine to have done so. New Zealand's Cuisine Wine Magazine wrote of Te Mata Estate: : \\"If there were a Kiwi wine aristocracy, Te Mata would be part of it. [...] they make some of the best wines in the country\\". Te Mata Estate wines are available in 45 countries, including China, UAE and the United States. They have been served at Noma in Copenhagen, Raffles in Singapore, and the Burj Al Arab in Dubai, and are available in London in Harrods, and in Hong Kong and Japan through Berry Bros & Rudd. They have been presented at the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II, as gifts by New Zealand Prime Ministers to Queen Elizabeth II, Chinese President Xi Jinping and served at an exclusive dinner in 2018 to former US President Barack Obama. In their 2016 article on Te Mata Estate, Decanter Magazine described Te Mata Estate as ‚ÄúNew Zealand's First Growth‚Äù with Coleraine ‚Äúamong the top Bordeaux blends in the world.‚Äù Michael Cooper lists the Coleraine, Awatea, Bullnose Syrah, and Elston Chardonnay in his highest category, ‚ÄúSuper Classic‚Äù. In 2016 the barrel fermented Cape Crest Sauvingnon Blanc received 90+ points and was named ‚Äúone of the world's best barrel-fermented sauvignon blancs‚Äù by Australian wine critic Lester Jesberg. Chairman John Buck and Technical Director Peter Cowley have an extensive history as critics and judges of wine competitions. Today, with a boutique production schedule and wines created to develop over many years, Te Mata seldom enters wines in competition - though there have been exceptions. In 1991 the International Wine Challenge awarded the 1989 Elston Chardonnay the trophy for 'Best White Wine in Show'. Only a limited amount of Coleraine is available from each vintage. It is released on March 1 and sells out very quickly, usually within a few days. In 2016 a thirty-year vertical collection of Coleraine sold at auction for over $5,000 NZD. It is the first time any collection of aged New Zealand wine has been sold in this way.

He is an IBM Fellow and responsible for the Cloud and Computing Infrastructure department at the IBM Research ‚Äì Zurich laboratory in R√ºschlikon, Switzerland, and is also the group leader for the Memory and Cognitive Technologies group in that department. Education and research interests Eleftheriou graduated in 1979 from the University of Patras, Greece, with a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering. He then attended Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, where he obtained his M.Eng.(1981) and Ph.D. (1985) degrees in Electrical Engineering. He joined the Research Staff of IBM Research ‚Äì Zurich laboratory in R√ºschlikon, Switzerland, in 1986. He currently heads its Cloud and Computing Infrastructure department. He holds over 150 patents (granted or pending) and has authored or co-authored about 200 scientific publications. Research activities Eleftheriou performed basic research in noise-predictive detection, which found wide application in magnetic recording systems and spurred further research on advanced noise-predictive schemes for a variety of stationary and non-stationary noise sources. In this context, he developed the reduced state sequence detection approach, which is also the basic idea behind the so-called Noise-Predictive Maximum Likelihood (NPML) detection for magnetic recording. This work in its various instantiations, including iterative detection/decoding schemes, is the core technology of the read channel module in hard-disk drives (HDDs) and tape drive systems. The Eduard Rhein Foundation said Eleftheriou had \\"a pioneering role in the introduction of innovative digital signal processing and coding techniques into hard disk drives\\". In 2001, he started to work on a concept that IBM‚Äôs 1986 Nobel laureate Gerd Binnig had originated, namely, to use atomic force microscopy to not only image surfaces, but to also manipulate the surface of soft materials, such as polymers, and write information in the form of nanometer-scale indentations. This concept is now known as probe-based storage or informally as the so-called Millipede Storage. Together with his team, he demonstrated a small-scale, form-factor prototype storage system using thermomechanical probes, which achieved error-free writing and read back of data at an ultrahigh areal density of 840 Gb/in2, then a world record for data storage. The \\"millipede\\" work was selected as \\"Technology of the Year\\" by the US trade publication IndustryWeek in 2003. Through this effort improvements were made in the field of nanopositioning research, a key enabling technology for investigating and engineering matter at the nanometer scale, for a variety of applications that include not only data storage, but also molecular biology, metrology, nano lithography and scanning probe microscopy. Eleftheriou co- developed the progressive edge growth (PEG) algorithm, a general method for constructing regular and irregular Tanner graphs having a large girth. This algorithm is of great importance in graph theory as well as for constructing powerful short-block-length LDPC codes, a methodology used extensively f in recording and transmission systems Since 2007, he and his team have increasingly focused on phase-change memory (PCM) as a storage-class memory bridging the gap between memory and storage. They have investigated how to store more than one bit per cell or so-called MLC (multi-level cell) PCM. They have successfully tackled the problem of long-term resistance drift in MLC PCM by using novel read-out metrics. Furthermore, using a new device concept in which the physical mechanism of writing is decoupled from the read process, they were able to eliminate drift; they call this new concept \\"projected PCM devices\\". Exploiting these cutting-edge innovations and enabling technologies, they have been able to show the practical viability of PCM through a 3-bit- per-cell large-scale demonstration. They have also investigated carbon as memory material, focusing in particular on oxygenated amorphous carbon to address the issue of low endurance due to the difficulty of breaking the conductive carbon filaments. In oxygenated amorphous carbon, oxygen is added as a dopant to facilitate the breaking of the carbon filaments because it is known that carbon-based materials, when exposed to oxygen, break down by so- called Joule heating. Very recently, he and his team have focused on mimicking the unprecedented computational capabilities of the human brain to build ultra-low power cognitive computing systems. They have built artificial synapses and spiking neurons using phase-change materials, and showed that the inherent stochasticity of these neurons enables population-based computation, similar to the way the human brain processes information. Using the all phase- change neuromorphic architecture, they demonstrated the basic computational primitive of a temporal correlation detector.

Life There is very little information available about Sauer's life. He resided in Saint Petersburg from at least 1792. He knew many languages (English, Russian, French and German). Sauer got to know Joseph Billings in the 1780s in Saint Petersburg. He was also acquainted with Peter Simon Pallas. After the request of both, he agreed to take part in Billings's expedition as his secretary and translator (i.e., interpreter) on condition that he would be allowed to publish an account of it upon his return. The expedition lasted nine years and it carried the objects for which it had been organised with success. The expedition returned to St Petersburg on 10 March 1794. Sauer was at that time in a very critical state of health, suffering from rheumatism. In his apartment he had hidden a diary, some notes and also possibly other secret materials from the expedition. Billings cautioned members of the Admiralty that Sauer might publish them to the world before the Empress Catherine the Great would like. As a result Billings received permission to search Sauer's room, but the only things he found were a few draft notes. Sauer claimed he had burned the material. The doctors' recommendation being that he should visit a milder climate for some time, Sauer was released from Russian service and left for England where he published the first printed description of the expedition. There is some controversy regarding his activities after his return to St Petersburg in 1794. Suggestion has been made that he set off hurriedly for England in order to publish his account before the Russian authorities and scholars of the Russian Academy of Sciences could review its details. The Russians suspected that his illness had been simulated and had only been a ruse in order to be released from Russian service and prevent his apartment from being too thoroughly inspected. Sauer later was stockbroker in the St Petersburg exchange either resuming a former occupation or forging a new career for himself. Work Sauer published his account in London in 1802 under the title of An account of a geographical and astronomical expedition to the northern parts of Russia: for ascertaining the degrees of latitude and longitude of the mouth of the river Kovima, of the whole coast of the Tshutski, to East Cape, and of the islands in the eastern ocean, stretching to the American coast, performed ... by Commodore Joseph Billings, in the years 1785, &c; to 1794. Sauer says that his report was \\"taken from the journal written for Captain Billings, which I copied from the ship's journal kept by the Master Batakoff and his mates\\" (p.xiii). However, his narrative is also based on his own notes and recollections. He explicitly says, \\"During my travels, I was frequently necessitated to take notes on small pieces of paper; those I have faithfully transcribed; but in some instances I have been obliged to refer to memory\\" (p. xii). William Beloe also contributed to the work by helping with the style. In Europe not much information was available concerning the Billings expedition since 1790. It was even considered secretive. For this reason Sauer's work was received with much anticipation. Sauer's narrative is not the only contemporary account of the expedition. Two other contemporary accounts were written; one by Gavril Sarychev and the other one by Carl Heinrich Merck. However, Sauer's account is considered to be the fullest one.

Blueprint for Revolution: How to Use Rice Pudding, Lego Men, and Other Nonviolent Techniques to Galvanize Communities, Overthrow Dictators, or Simply Change the World is a book written by Srdja Popovic, the founder of the Centre for Applied Nonviolent Action and Strategies (CANVAS). The book is described on its back cover as \\"a handbook for anyone who wants to effectively (and peacefully) improve your neighborhood, make a difference in your community, or change the world.\\"  Synopsis  The first part of the book discusses modern nonviolent revolutions, and the second explains how nonviolent techniques can be put to good use. The book contains eleven chapters, each with a lesson about nonviolent techniques for revolution, including case studies. Popovic writes in the first-person voice, describing his experiences in taking part in and training activists for several revolutions, including the Otpor! movement and the Arab Spring. He references movements that attempted to make changes (successfully and unsuccessfully), such as Occupy Wall Street and Gay Rights Movements. In referencing these movements, Popovic explains the tactics they allude to that make revolutions successful‚Äîsuch as laughtivism and unity‚Äîand why they are a better alternative to violence.  Reception  Blueprint for Revolution has received generally positive reviews. Michael Andor Brodeur from The Boston Globe expressed that \\"despite Popovic‚Äôs persistent ham factor (at times, the implied laugh track feels out of place), he offers a clear, well- constructed, and easily applicable set of principles for any David facing any Goliath (sans slingshot, of course).\\" New York Times writer Tina Rosenberg expressed that \\"Popovic cheerfully blows up just about every idea most people hold about nonviolent struggle.\\" The book inspired lots of international praise as well. Duncan Green from The Guardian reviewed the book in the United Kingdom, calling it \\"fantastically readable and useful [...] for activists.\\" The book also appeared on lists of top human rights books.  Editions  Blueprint for Revolution was originally published in the United States. It has been published in Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Serbia, and has been translated into French, German, Serbian, and Korean.  Tour and promotion  Popovic held a book tour to promote Blueprint for Revolution, visiting Harvard University and Northeastern University, the Frontline Club and Conway Hall in London. Popovic also spoke at Google Ideas about the book, followed by a similar talk at Harvard Kennedy School's Carr Center for Human Rights Policy. Further into the book tour, Popovic was interviewed by German news stations S√ºddeutsche Zeitung and 3sat, as well as by satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo.

He became well known as the parish priest of Helmsley in the North Yorkshire Moors, a cure of scattered villages. Early life Born in Lastingham, Yorkshire, he was the son of John Conyers (died 1733) and his wife Ann Boulby (died 1740), and was brought up by a grandmother; Wilson considers it likely this was his paternal grandmother Elizabeth Conyers, who died c.1748, widow of Robert Conyers who died 1734. Family property in Helmsley passed from Elizabeth to John (1723‚Äì1761), elder brother of Richard, and then to Richard.Wilson, p. 210 note 3 Educated at Coxwold grammar school, Conyers matriculated at Jesus College, Cambridge in 1742, graduating B.A. in 1746 and M.A. in 1749. He became LL.D. in 1767. A tradition states that he was Senior Wrangler in the Cambridge Tripos; the year 1745 of his graduation precedes the period when this title was given in public.Wilson, p. 210 note 5 In any case he was placed above his friend Henry Venn, to the latter's chagrin. On leaving university, he lived in Helmsley with his grandmother Elizabeth Conyers. Parish priest in North Yorkshire In 1747 Conyers was ordained deacon, by Samuel Peploe, with a promise from the Duncombe family of the succession to a living; it followed an unsuccessful attempt to be ordained to Kirby Wiske the previous year.Wilson p. 210 note 6 Resident in Helmsley, he assisted at the church there. Conyers was ordained priest by Matthew Hutton in 1755, and was licensed to Kirby Overcarr, also known as Kirby Misperton, as curate. =Early years at Helmsley= The parish of Helmsley, noted in the 19th century as one of the largest in England, was 16 miles from north to south. It including Bilsdale to the north, and Harome somewhat to the east of the town of Helmsley; also Laskill, Pockley, Rievaulx and Sproxton. Initially Conyers also held the living of Kirkdale, a valley to the east beyond Kirby Misperton, but asked to be relieved of it in 1763. The Vale of Pickering, to the south of Helmsley, was noted for its linen weavers. Linen and linsey-woolsey manufacture was a predominant local occupation, with flax brought by pack horse from Kingston upon Hull, during the 18th century. Linen yarn at the time was spun at Helmsley, by hand; spinning was mechanised by the early 19th century. Conyers became rector of Church of All Saints, Helmsley in 1756, following the death of the Rev. Francis Hodgson in 1755, and also rector of Kirby Misperton in 1763, presented by Thomas Duncombe II.Wilson, p. 211 note 9 Curate to Conyers at Helmsley from about 1756, a local man who had attended Jesus College, Cambridge, was Roger Bentley. He was ordained priest in 1760. In 1759 he became brother-in-law to Conyers, marrying his younger sister Ellen.Wilson, p. 212 note 10 To begin with, Conyers was concerned with education (he taught mathematics himself), and with the catechism. A grammar school founded by the mid-17th century had been supported by the Duncombe family; but Hodgson by 1743 reported to his archbishop that there was no endowment or other finance for a school. =Evangelical preacher= It was in 1758 that Conyers experienced an evangelical conversion. Two changes considered significant in the narrative of this conversion are his turning away from an anti-Trinitarian author, and his adoption of extempore preaching, rather than speaking from a text.Wilson p. 213 note 15 and p. 216 note 22 In that year he joined the SPCK. For a short period, from 1761, he served as a naval chaplain; and was domestic chaplain to Richard Terrick from 1763 to 1770. Conyers held daily morning services at Helmsley; and meetings on week nights at Beadlam. Kirby Misperton, though having a fair population, had a single Sunday service. Conyers had a resident curate there, who also served as rector of Normanby. Running a monthly communion service at Helmsley, at which a collection was taken, with a regular reported (i.e. quarterly) attendance of 450, Conyers was able to finance school places for 40 children.Wilson p. 221 note 42 Robert Hay Drummond, his archbishop, made clear his dislike of Conyers's preaching in 1764, an opinion formed after hearing a visitation sermon at Malton, saying \\"Were you to inculcate the morality of Socrates, it would do more good than canting about the new birth\\". But Conyers was favoured by William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth. The Duncombe family restored the chapel at Sproxton, just south of Helmsley, in 1765. From 1766 Conyers extended the building in Bondgate, Helmsley, which remained the vicarage to 1940. In 1767 he was an itinerant preacher in Yorkshire, for Selina, Countess of Huntingdon, and in 1768 with George Whitefield. He was not, unlike Whitefield, a preacher in open-air meetings, but is thought to have infringed somewhat on demarcations, for example at Bilsdale.Wilson, p. 213 note 14 Having had a private chapel built next to the vicarage, Conyers carried out study and worship there, in a fashion that has been compared to John Berridge and William Bromley Cadogan. Another comparison is to William Grimshaw at Haworth. From a Wesleyan point of view, Conyers was a revivalist, who before conversion was tending to Socinianism, but then leaned in the Calvinist direction; he prepared the ground locally for a Methodist chapel. George Cussons, the cabinet-maker and diarist from Ampleforth, was a Methodist from 1760, and a close friend. A few years after Conyers had moved on from Helmsley, the area was one of those petitioning against the Papists Act 1778. His successor as parish priest was John Clement, vicar of Helmsley 1776 to 1805. Associations There was at this time an identifiable group of Yorkshire evangelicals, who included also Miles Atkinson and Henry Venn. Conyers belonged also to a circle around The Gospel Magazine, including John Berridge, Thomas Haweis, Martin Madan, and John Newton. Newton and William Cowper were introduced by Conyers. In 1767 Conyers was staying in Olney, and asked Newton to call on Cowper and his friend Mary Unwin, whose husband had just died, in Huntingdon. Cowper wrote of Conyers, in his poem Truth: > [...] he says much that many may dispute, And cavil at with ease, but none > refute. Conyers wrote to John Wesley shortly after his 1758 conversion. Wesley accepted an invitation to visit Conyers, coming on 17 April 1764 after discussion with Selina, Countess of Huntingdon. A couplet, from a poem sent by Augustus Toplady to Erasmus Middleton in 1775, imagines Wesley reciting a list of his Calvinist rivals: :\\"There's Townsend, Shirley, Foster, Venn, :With Madan, Conyers and Romaine...\\" William Romaine was in Helmsley in 1766. John Thornton, patron of evangelicals and to become a relation by marriage, visited Conyers in 1764.Wilson, p. 217 note 24 Thornton then brought Roger Bentley, curate at Hemsley, to St Giles' Church, Camberwell in 1769. It followed Bentley's failed attempt two years earlier to obtain the living of Cottingham, blocked by Edmund Keene who suspected Bentley of Methodism. In Deptford In 1775, Conyers was brought to St Paul's, Deptford, south of London, by John Thornton, his brother-in-law, on the death of James Bate. There Cornelius Bayley was a curate of his. Conyers gained a reputation as a spiritual adviser, and converted outbuildings at Deptford to continue his pattern of religious study built up at his Helmsley chapel. He lectured four nights every week. He associated with evangelicals including George Pattrick, William Romaine and Henry Venn.Wilson p. 221 note 44 Basil Woodd's 1784 memoir of his mother Hannah was in the form of a letter to Conyers. Preaching, on the other hand, was by then problematic for Conyers, despite his reputation, for other clergy and the general public. He turned down an invitation from John Thomas, his bishop, to preach in another church. He did that just once, at St Mary the Virgin, Stone, Kent, by Dartford, for an archidiaconal visit, at personal cost. He was short of breath, and suffered from fainting.Wilson p. 222‚Äì3 with notes Conyers died on 23 April 1786. His funeral sermon was preached on 7 May by John Newton, and he was buried in the parish churchyard of St Paul's, Deptford. An earlier sermon was preached by Thomas Scott, at the London Lock Hospital on 30 April. His successor was John Eaton (died 1806), rector of Fairstead, Essex. Works The Operations of the Holy Ghost Considered, in a Sermon (1764) was the published form of the visitation sermon by Conyers, to which his archbishop took exception. In 1767, Conyers published A Collection of Psalms and Hymns from Various Authors. At this period a number of evangelicals within the Church of England were compiling hymn books, and Conyers put his together to replace the use of metrical psalms and paraphrase singing by his own congregation. The Collection took much of its material from Martin Madan's similar work of 1760. Additions included hymns by William Cowper and John Newton. Newton himself used the book for his \\"speaking on a hymn\\" in services. A 14th edition appeared in 1841. It proved influential, with Baptists in particular adopting hymns from the Collection, as well as from the Selection of John Rippon, to add to the repertoire handed down from Isaac Watts. The hymn tune \\"Helmsley\\" is named for the Yorkshire parish, the title having been given by Madan in his Collection, 1769 edition. There has been confusion over the provenance of the tune. Family In 1765 Conyers married Jane Thornton, a widow previously married in 1735 to the merchant Nathaniel Knipe, and the sister of John Thornton. She died in 1774, and they had no children.Wilson, p. 217 note 25 A monumental inscription to Jane Conyers was placed on the outside of Helmsley church.Thomas Gill, Vallis Eboracensis (1852, PDF) at p. 292] Biographers The early biographers of Conyers included: * James Illingworth, the last of Conyers's curates at Helmsley, who left a manuscript life of Conyers, dated c.1790. * The author of the manuscript memoir of Conyers, edited by Quentin Harcourt Wilson, with the tentative attribution to Humphrey Sandwith II (1746‚Äì1809), grandfather of Humphry Sandwith IV (1822‚Äì1881). Internal evidence shows it to have been written in the period 1790‚Äì4.Wilson p. 217 note 24 The Memoir of Mr George Cussons, edited from the diary of Cussons for a period of over 50 years, contains letters from Conyers.
